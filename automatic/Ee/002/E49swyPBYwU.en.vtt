00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.820
 Hello everyone, here you see a Rex Rs 450 CDI, a CDI ignition that is 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.880
 those with the blue cable where you have to look out, there are 2 ignition units, that 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:26.650
 Here is an original Rex RS450 that needs DC and AC, ok, that needs it 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.880
 DC and AC, but there are also pure AC CDIs. I have one 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.539
 Plan and the next, the CDI, as you see it here with the farmers 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.809
 is connected as follows, the first pin here is the Absteller, the second is the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.159
 100 to 200 volt coil in the dynamo sitting under the pole, then here is the 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.390
 Ignition coil connected, since the pick-up, there 12 volt must be applied through the contact 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.899
 are exchanged and there is mass and here The mass in the box is ground as 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.620
 the scooter is off, there must be 12 volts when it is on. We can do that with us 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.920
 now measure the multimeter and we can measure the coil of 100 - 200 volts 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.150
 From here to the masses, we can get the Bobine from there to the ground and 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.070
 we can measure the pick-up from there on mass, then this would be the occupation 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.450
 from a standard, from a standard CDI, so if you want to rebuild the CDI here, the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.420
 Scooter with such a CDI on a standard CDI then you should make mass 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.280
 remove the plug and the +12 volts, it does not need the +12 volts and the ground 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.909
 clamp on the lower one and that is not proven, if you then infect both 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.900
 Does that make a short circuit or when you do that just connect another CDI does that 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.030
 also a short circuit, because the CDI can break and the wick will usually fly 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:03.600
 they have bridged the wick, yes, the CDI is defective. Then I have the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.610
 Circuit again of the Rex RS 450 CDI with the blue cable, and the first is that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.760
 Absteller, and I have here now that the ignition would be such that the engine is on 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.430
 the engine is on, the parking space is open, then the +12 volt ignition is closed 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.480
 to +12 volts then to the ignition coil, that is such a coil to earth, ok that is silent 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.060
 over the sidestand switch and the like, then the 100 - 200 volt coil that the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.680
 here is the pole wheel and the pick-up, the Pick-up coil also on earth. And that is possible 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.480
 we measure it easily with the multimeter we can measure the pickup coil, the 100-200 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.159
 Volt coil and coil and then we can check if +12 volts is present here 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.110
 the ignition is switched on when the ignition is switched off is not the 12 volt when ignited 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.569
 is switched off, we can check whether the Absteller is on the ground or if the ignition is on 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.290
 is that the stater is open and does not lie on earth. I start and measure, 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.580
 I put all the plugs and Mass of mass when picking up, mass when picking up 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.519
 in the ohm range of 2 kilo ohms and there I have 149 ohms, so 150 ohms, that must be something 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.370
 so between 120 and 300 ohms then it is that the pickup is ok, if it is now much smaller 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.200
 than 120 ohm then the pick-up is broken, pick-up 150 ohm from ground to pick-up line. then 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.560
 If it continues, we will measure the Winding generator, the generator winding is off the ground 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:50.590
 on the second spark plug, that is top right so from here top right 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.609
 large plug on top here, however, the cable does not measure at the CDI 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.819
 but on the cable contacts. Ok, at 100-200 Volt power supply there we measure at 2 kilohm 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:10.269
 Range 403 ohms, so from here from one plug ground to another plug 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.199
 Generator coil, 403 ohm is ok, that can be a few hundred ohms, but it can 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:20.640
 also 1 kilo ohm, 403 ohm with a Rex RS 450 Roller, if I have the second pin 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.750
 take here then I have 0 ohm because the ignition Yes, I have to switch the ignition on 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.900
 set to infinite ohm, ignition Oh, okay, switch it off again 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.040
 0 ohm, because the pin is here on earth, okay now we have measured the collection 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:53.120
 we have measured the ignition coil and the circuit breaker So now we have measured the 3 things, 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.410
 ever the pick-up here from here on earth with ohm measurement than the coil of 100-200 volts 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.230
 on earth and once the breaker on earth, if the contact is off, this must be here 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.840
 So on mass are 0 and if the ignition is on then it must be open infinitely 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.813
 Oh at dinner. Okay, what's missing now is the ignition coil we need the sidestand 

00:05:17.813 --> 00:05:23.661
 fold in and then from ignition coil to earth measure, must also be passage. ok, ignition coil 

00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:31.360
 at mass we also measure 0 ohm, 1 ohm, 0 ohm yes ok then the coil, the circuit 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.180
 also closed, that was now ignition coil on earth this was here, the pin 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.930
 here the ignition coil of the ignition coil on earth and if all that is excluded all that 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:55.251
 works, so the high-voltage coil 400 ohm, the pick-up has a coil of 150 ohm 

00:05:55.251 --> 00:06:02.710
 on earth then the coil is really the employee ready we need 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.860
 just check if there is 12 volts here, that means mass up to 12 volts, this time in voltage 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:17.080
 Measuring range so we set the voltmeter then we go to 20 volts and now we have to 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.470
 we measure from mass to 12 volts. Okay, there First we don't measure anything because the inflammation 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.310
 is off, we switch the contact on and off if the contact is on, you have to go here 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.220
 11 12 volts switched on when ignited, okay and so they can do that 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.270
 Switch off the ignition again and then take the good we have measured everything and whether that is okay 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.700
 and since then there is still no spark the CDI is only then broken. Now attention, 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.780
 very important and indeed if we have a standard CDI then we need the grounding cable 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.590
 turn off the top and then the bottom cable turn off here and the cable inside 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:04.530
 was stuck there and the cable was gone then we can also have a standard 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:10.250
 Use CDI as they are in Ebay so without the cable, it would work as well 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:16.861
 because we don't need the +12 volts, so the +12 volts here, the cable here the 12 volts 

00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:22.760
 must go and this must go there and you will be put in and out 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.060
 the whole by having a component Beinchen or something or a long pin inside 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.391
 go up there, drive in and then pull up.
