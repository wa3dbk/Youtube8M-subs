00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:12.549
 I guess it all started with the guide 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:16.190
 summer is a very special type of snow 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.550

 more arrivals home and enemies 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.789

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.319
 we saw dumb kids who believe everything 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:16.470
 they see when they grow up they will understand that 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.470
 the snowmen do not have life 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.120
