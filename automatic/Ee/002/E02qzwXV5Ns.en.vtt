00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
 and this has made one of the head

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.130 
 and this has made one of the head
bolts<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.460> loose<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.689> I'll<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:36.869> ahead<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
bolts all loose so I'll go ahead and

keep this thing real clean inside

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.100 
keep this thing real clean inside
because<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.180> any<00:01:45.360> obstructions<00:01:45.960> in

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
there it'll block air flow yeah this

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.940 
there it'll block air flow yeah this

pretty<00:02:05.790> cool<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.780> now<00:02:07.079> I'm<00:02:07.229> going<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.530> remove

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.030 

the<00:02:11.980> ignition<00:02:12.939> kill<00:02:13.420> thing<00:02:13.810> piece<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.799> metal

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
the ignition kill thing piece of metal

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.349 
the ignition kill thing piece of metal
just<00:02:15.159> for<00:02:15.310> grounding<00:02:15.579> that<00:02:15.670> spark<00:02:16.000> plug<00:02:16.180> man

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
just for grounding that spark plug man

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.470 
just for grounding that spark plug man
with<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.750> remove<00:02:17.530> these<00:02:18.040> two<00:02:18.430> or<00:02:19.209> these

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
with that remove these two or these

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.130 
with that remove these two or these
three<00:02:19.719> rather<00:02:20.519> fan<00:02:21.519> shroud<00:02:23.340> bolts<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:25.140> yeah

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
three rather fan shroud bolts and yeah

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.140 
three rather fan shroud bolts and yeah
that<00:02:26.439> then<00:02:26.650> I'll<00:02:26.769> go<00:02:27.219> around<00:02:27.310> here<00:02:27.700> doing<00:02:28.000> them

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
that then I'll go around here doing them

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.210 
that then I'll go around here doing them
like<00:02:30.659> like<00:02:31.659> with<00:02:32.109> that<00:02:32.290> one<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.950> then<00:02:33.040> that

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
like like with that one and then that

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.660 
like like with that one and then that
one<00:02:33.280> or<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.790> one<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.299> one<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.689> know<00:02:34.840> like

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
one or that one that one you know like

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.309 
one or that one that one you know like
crisscross<00:02:36.670> pattern<00:02:37.120> has<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.750> make<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.139> gas

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
crisscross pattern has to make the gas

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.709 
crisscross pattern has to make the gas
gate<00:02:38.590> come<00:02:38.799> up<00:02:38.950> even<00:02:39.129> and<00:02:39.609> then<00:02:40.090> I'll<00:02:40.239> pull

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.719 
gate come up even and then I'll pull

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.530 
gate come up even and then I'll pull
that<00:02:40.810> off<00:02:41.430> all<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.639> head<00:02:42.760> bolts<00:02:43.090> are<00:02:43.209> out<00:02:43.239> now

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
that off all the head bolts are out now

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.509 
that off all the head bolts are out now
so<00:02:44.290> I'm<00:02:44.439> ready<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.680> remove<00:02:44.859> the<00:02:45.010> head

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
so I'm ready to remove the head

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.879 
so I'm ready to remove the head
I've<00:02:45.609> also<00:02:45.790> disconnected<00:02:46.389> the<00:02:46.569> HT<00:02:47.109> lead<00:02:47.319> to

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
I've also disconnected the HT lead to

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:58.970 
I've also disconnected the HT lead to
the<00:02:47.950> spark<00:02:48.220> plug<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:53.099> lot<00:02:54.099> of<00:02:54.280> carbon<00:02:54.669> in<00:02:54.760> there

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.199 

yeah<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.010> lot<00:03:00.129> of<00:03:00.250> carbon<00:03:00.579> on<00:03:00.700> those<00:03:00.819> events<00:03:00.939> not

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
yeah a lot of carbon on those events not

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:10.199 
yeah a lot of carbon on those events not
too<00:03:01.359> much<00:03:01.510> in<00:03:01.629> the<00:03:01.720> piston<00:03:02.169> but<00:03:05.310> oh<00:03:08.909> yeah<00:03:09.909> that

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
too much in the piston but oh yeah that

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.710 
too much in the piston but oh yeah that
bone<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.480> pretty<00:03:10.930> bad<00:03:11.730> but<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:13.239> runs<00:03:13.450> good

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
bone is pretty bad but it runs good

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.250 
bone is pretty bad but it runs good
suppose<00:03:14.019> this<00:03:14.169> burns<00:03:14.379> olive<00:03:14.709> oil<00:03:16.019> yeah<00:03:17.019> some

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
suppose this burns olive oil yeah some

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.229 
suppose this burns olive oil yeah some
get<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:17.799> little<00:03:18.040> bit<00:03:18.190> of<00:03:18.340> aluminium<00:03:18.519> this<00:03:19.060> one

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
get a little bit of aluminium this one

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.390 
get a little bit of aluminium this one
should<00:03:19.449> do<00:03:19.540> pretty<00:03:19.659> good<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.199> I<00:03:20.859> just<00:03:20.889> scrape

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
should do pretty good and I just scrape

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.610 
should do pretty good and I just scrape
the<00:03:21.699> carbon<00:03:22.060> off<00:03:22.209> everything<00:03:25.319> upon<00:03:26.319> closer

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
the carbon off everything upon closer

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.680 
the carbon off everything upon closer
examination<00:03:26.829> this<00:03:27.729> bore<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.150> in<00:03:28.329> pretty<00:03:28.569> bad

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
examination this bore is in pretty bad

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.869 
examination this bore is in pretty bad
shape<00:03:28.840> we<00:03:29.440> can<00:03:29.620> feel<00:03:29.799> grooves<00:03:30.129> in<00:03:30.370> there<00:03:30.549> and

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
shape we can feel grooves in there and

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.750 
shape we can feel grooves in there and
there<00:03:33.879> are<00:03:34.090> kind<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.599> a<00:03:34.720> little<00:03:34.810> bit<00:03:35.079> of<00:03:35.199> a

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
there are kind of a little bit of a

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.969 
there are kind of a little bit of a
jiggle<00:03:36.760> on<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.120> piston<00:03:37.680> isn't<00:03:38.680> seating<00:03:38.919> the

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.979 
jiggle on the piston isn't seating the

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.479 
jiggle on the piston isn't seating the
bore<00:03:39.159> to<00:03:39.340> get<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:40.479> so<00:03:40.930> I'm<00:03:41.079> gonna<00:03:41.290> report<00:03:42.280> and

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
bore to get that so I'm gonna report and

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.930 
bore to get that so I'm gonna report and
precise<00:03:43.060> piston<00:03:43.510> there<00:03:43.889> eventually<00:03:44.889> but<00:03:45.400> for

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
precise piston there eventually but for

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.500 
precise piston there eventually but for
right<00:03:46.239> now<00:03:46.299> that's<00:03:46.599> okay<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.459> even<00:03:48.819> already

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
right now that's okay so even already

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.960 
right now that's okay so even already
starting<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.109> carbon<00:03:50.440> out<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.590> there<00:03:50.970> I'm

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
starting the carbon out of there I'm

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.099 
starting the carbon out of there I'm
gonna<00:03:52.120> sort<00:03:52.269> of<00:03:52.359> cut<00:03:52.479> a<00:03:52.510> little<00:03:52.659> most<00:03:52.930> of

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
gonna sort of cut a little most of

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.259 
gonna sort of cut a little most of
carbon<00:03:53.349> off<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.530> top<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:53.889> piston<00:03:54.269> gotta

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
carbon off the top of the piston gotta

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.339 
carbon off the top of the piston gotta
get<00:03:55.419> off<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.720> valve<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:57.629> get<00:03:58.629> it<00:03:58.780> get<00:03:59.229> the

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
get off the valve and get it get the

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.710 
get off the valve and get it get the
head<00:03:59.709> gasket<00:04:00.099> real<00:04:00.250> clean<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.729> the<00:04:01.510> adjoining

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
head gasket real clean and the adjoining

head gasket real clean and the adjoining
surface<00:04:02.139> over<00:04:02.349> there<00:04:02.500> real<00:04:02.680> clean<00:04:02.939> they<00:04:03.939> don't

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
surface over there real clean they don't

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.289 
surface over there real clean they don't
smash<00:04:04.359> back<00:04:04.599> together<00:04:05.579> I've<00:04:06.579> been<00:04:06.909> most<00:04:07.180> of

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
smash back together I've been most of

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.749 
smash back together I've been most of
the<00:04:07.359> loose<00:04:07.569> carbon<00:04:08.109> off<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.590> don't<00:04:09.549> know<00:04:09.669> I'm

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:09.759 
the loose carbon off I don't know I'm

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.189 
the loose carbon off I don't know I'm
gonna<00:04:09.879> give<00:04:10.030> it<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.150> good<00:04:10.509> Jews<00:04:10.959> you<00:04:11.109> know

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
gonna give it to good Jews you know

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:12.749 
gonna give it to good Jews you know
that's<00:04:11.349> not<00:04:11.680> really<00:04:11.889> working<00:04:12.069> on<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.489> engine

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:12.759 
that's not really working on the engine

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:14.819 
that's not really working on the engine
this<00:04:12.849> off<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:14.079> will<00:04:14.229> this<00:04:14.319> carbon<00:04:14.680> out<00:04:14.799> of

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
this off that will this carbon out of

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:27.520 
this off that will this carbon out of
there

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:35.659 

yeah<00:04:32.090> cool<00:04:33.090> so<00:04:33.300> I'm<00:04:33.360> gonna<00:04:34.160> drop<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.220> little<00:04:35.520> bit

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
yeah cool so I'm gonna drop a little bit

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.180 
yeah cool so I'm gonna drop a little bit
of<00:04:35.759> oil<00:04:35.849> down<00:04:36.180> there<00:04:36.539> and<00:04:36.889> put<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.009> head<00:04:38.160> back

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
of oil down there and put the head back

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.309 
of oil down there and put the head back
on<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:38.940> give<00:04:39.090> up<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.300> bolts<00:04:39.599> and<00:04:39.780> see<00:04:40.139> if<00:04:40.199> she

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
on and give up the bolts and see if she

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:47.120 
on and give up the bolts and see if she
runs<00:04:40.440> good<00:04:45.229> so<00:04:46.229> I've<00:04:46.319> got<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.560> motor<00:04:46.770> all<00:04:46.949> back

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
runs good so I've got the motor all back
