00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.189
 the trainers and coaches who deal 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.929
 with the walker warns 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.660
 certain devices used to obtain 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.580
 higher yield of your used walker 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.550
 improperly they can be 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.359
 prejudices within the framework of the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.070
 walker 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.720
 the riding instructor fernando melo 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.670
 prepared a series of tips 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.490
 special for you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:35.250
 today he talks about the use of the embouchure 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:36.630
 accompany the region of the horse's mouth 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.510
 the most sensitive region we use 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.879
 Any trauma attaching the horse takes the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.930
 rest of life and it's very difficult for you 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.399
 adjusted 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.399
 so what the easy pawn 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.610
 most of the time this horse is 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.320
 weighing in the mouth and he has no technique 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.750
 enough does not know how to do the exercises 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.220
 corrective relieve the mouths of animals 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.649
 logically he gets on the track with 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.210
 animal weighing and will be very 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.810
 impaired months of the maximum penalty 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.940
 so in the case of the toast this match is 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.259
 where it is in contact with the mouth 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.869
 It's called a mouthpiece. 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.659
 it uses a very aggressive place ie 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.520
 you can use a twisted nozzle that is 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.009
 prohibited by the regulation but many 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.350
 times the judge or commission of entry 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.750
 does not notice does not open the mouths of animals 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.679
 the use of a very thin shearing site or 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.160
 that nothing 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:33.440
 and put it in the mouths of the animals and 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.810
 acts in the commission of OAB al in cheek 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.670
 horse when he weighs on the farm that 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.170
 he does he throws a lot material 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.560
 aggressive giving what we call 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.140
 I stopped a few stops immediately. 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.149
 horse relieves the mouth only that is a relief 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.119
 What are you going to have with her? 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.520
 because it begins to traumatize the 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.409
 of the horse's mouth in charge of 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.470
 a commission for that place is 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.110
 injured and a horse begins to react in the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.060
 case of bridle wound is in soft part 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.070
 from the mouth then we can afterwards 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.989
 recover your brother's confidence 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.630
 now in the case of the brake he acts on 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.430
 that part between the teeth in 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.410
 followed and the molars we have this 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.019
 part that does not have to have a bar 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.579
 then the brake action is on the bar if you 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.200
 have a trauma that we call 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.079
 of bar in the bar 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.060
 the horse will take that trauma the rest 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.320
 of life because he has a memory had 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.780
 a bad thing 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.670
 so every time they get their 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.480
 educator and she passes over that 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.000
 callus 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.130
 the horse will react so are problems 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.130
 very serious that should be avoided
