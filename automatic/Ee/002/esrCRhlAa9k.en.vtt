00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 but if we have not played well ourselves 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.940
 we won against milan then he wants me 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.120
 we put a little bit of everything 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.980
 determination a bit of determination of whom 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.220
 desire to win we did golf 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.390
 they were all concentrated and that is why 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.910
 who had won then there is no one who 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.960
 think to be a permanent owner we are here 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.180
 to help the team 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.890
 we are available as a semi field 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.449
 you have to do the maximum I would see his 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.040
 quality 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.960
 then there is no one who always plays 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.730
 we seem to be ready and give the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.059
 maximum when it seems a bit but if 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.040
 We play two midfielders or 3 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.340
 first series be ready and always give 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.410
 the maximum to show that we are 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.860
 in fact I am young 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.090
 so when the coach imposed me 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.350
 I can say nothing even if you do me 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.539
 praise the left-back 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.940
 I will always give the maximum I have not yet 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.570
 not dear fate done everything to leave 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.780
 something 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.270
 so I'm available is from 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.049
 always a great not when I was playing cranes 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.400
 noble had raven who he had 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.490
 then called then I had to sign the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.130
 Florentine but I didn't want to 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.960
 go too fast because I was young 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.350
 I wanted to look for a team where I could 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.050
 then play when they want 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.390
 bologna looked for me I came 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:39.410
 no doubt because he was a team with 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.420
 where I could find space and now 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:48.860
 I can see who I made a choice 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.690
 right choice montolivo vargas had 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.369
 behrami and the chiaravalle team 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.690
 called juve idee further below 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.600
 in this in this league like 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.400
 we know we are if not cold 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.530
 that's why they were doing well 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.970
 well we worked on the week 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:13.620
 this is why we are playing something 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.020
 also growing so we are ready 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.500
 we go to Florence to win as much as 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:24.140
 I would always play football win 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.790
 then the sure thing is that they do everything for 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.060
 let us try to win and we will always give the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.060
 maximum
