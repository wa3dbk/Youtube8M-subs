00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
mine is a different color so you can see

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.659 
mine is a different color so you can see
it<00:03:43.530> better<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.980> I've<00:03:44.099> also<00:03:44.280> run<00:03:44.459> out<00:03:44.639> of

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
it better and I've also run out of

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.449 
it better and I've also run out of
fabric<00:03:44.970> but<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.930> could<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.440> course<00:03:46.680> be<00:03:46.980> exactly

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
fabric but it could of course be exactly

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.940 
fabric but it could of course be exactly
the<00:03:47.669> same<00:03:47.700> fabric<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.780> inside<00:03:49.230> as<00:03:49.530> on<00:03:49.799> the

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
the same fabric on the inside as on the

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.559 
the same fabric on the inside as on the
outside

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.770 

and<00:03:58.569> now<00:03:59.290> again<00:03:59.590> we<00:04:00.220> can<00:04:00.519> turn<00:04:00.790> over<00:04:01.060> and

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
and now again we can turn over and

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.350 
and now again we can turn over and
without<00:04:02.290> removing<00:04:02.950> any<00:04:03.159> of<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.489> pins<00:04:03.790> cancel

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
all the way along but the centimeter

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.119 
all the way along but the centimeter

seam allowance from one side to the
other

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
other

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.270 
other
now<00:04:09.849> I've<00:04:09.970> done<00:04:10.299> that<00:04:10.360> remove<00:04:11.290> or<00:04:11.680> my<00:04:11.950> pins

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
now I've done that remove or my pins

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.670 
now I've done that remove or my pins
again<00:04:12.549> and<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.390> can<00:04:13.629> cut<00:04:13.900> back<00:04:14.140> my<00:04:14.379> seam

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
again and I can cut back my seam

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.129 
again and I can cut back my seam
allowance<00:04:15.099> and<00:04:15.220> again<00:04:15.939> you<00:04:16.269> do<00:04:16.449> not<00:04:16.479> want<00:04:16.930> to

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
allowance and again you do not want to

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.800 
allowance and again you do not want to
have<00:04:17.410> any<00:04:17.620> more<00:04:17.829> snips<00:04:18.340> in<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:18.789> for<00:04:19.630> ease<00:04:19.780> of

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
have any more snips in this for ease of

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.040 
have any more snips in this for ease of
turning<00:04:20.500> it's<00:04:21.190> not<00:04:21.489> necessary<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.419> actually

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
turning it's not necessary it actually

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.560 
turning it's not necessary it actually
makes<00:04:23.289> it<00:04:23.500> harder<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:24.280> just<00:04:25.090> your<00:04:25.330> three

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
makes it harder so just your three

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.590 
makes it harder so just your three
millimeters<00:04:26.139> and<00:04:26.440> that's<00:04:26.740> fine<00:04:27.479> finally<00:04:28.479> you

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
millimeters and that's fine finally you

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.860 
millimeters and that's fine finally you
want<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.870> also<00:04:29.380> check<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:30.190> you<00:04:30.430> have<00:04:30.669> got<00:04:31.060> the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
want to also check that you have got the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.469 
want to also check that you have got the
same<00:04:32.380> distance<00:04:33.220> from<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.729> ruffle<00:04:34.150> all<00:04:34.300> the

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
same distance from the ruffle all the

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.779 
same distance from the ruffle all the
way<00:04:34.600> down<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.289> the<00:04:35.470> lengths<00:04:35.949> are<00:04:36.250> right<00:04:36.580> so

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
way down that the lengths are right so
