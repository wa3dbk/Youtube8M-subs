starting point from there he can cut
pieces<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:18.890> start<00:01:19.280> fitting<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:19.729> all<00:01:19.850> together

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
pieces and start fitting it all together

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.050 
pieces and start fitting it all together
Dave<00:01:21.290> had<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.680> work<00:01:21.860> with<00:01:22.070> compound<00:01:22.640> angles

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
Dave had to work with compound angles

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.180 
Dave had to work with compound angles
and<00:01:23.240> get<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.690> exhaust<00:01:24.020> through<00:01:24.470> tight<00:01:24.770> areas

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
and get the exhaust through tight areas

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.910 
and get the exhaust through tight areas
while<00:01:25.909> still<00:01:26.240> keeping<00:01:26.659> it<00:01:26.750> far<00:01:27.049> away<00:01:27.350> from<00:01:27.409> any

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
working with three inch you always have

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.750 
working with three inch you always have
a<00:01:47.510> three<00:01:48.020> inch<00:01:48.170> circle<00:01:48.680> you<00:01:49.340> don't<00:01:49.520> have<00:01:49.730> a

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
want to focus on making it look like it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.830 
want to focus on making it look like it
flows<00:02:00.370> perfectly<00:02:01.370> once<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:02.180> get<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.480> to<00:02:02.510> where<00:02:02.810> I

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
flows perfectly once I get it to where I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.780 
flows perfectly once I get it to where I
like<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.350> way<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:03.650> it<00:02:03.770> looks<00:02:04.010> and<00:02:04.430> then<00:02:04.640> go

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
like the way that it looks and then go

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.970 
like the way that it looks and then go
ahead<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.000> tack<00:02:05.330> it<00:02:05.540> into<00:02:05.720> place<00:02:05.900> from<00:02:06.770> there

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
ahead and tack it into place from there

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.649 
ahead and tack it into place from there
I'm<00:02:07.280> gonna<00:02:07.460> grab<00:02:07.700> another<00:02:07.730> one<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.269> start

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:08.659 
I'm gonna grab another one and start

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.479 
I'm gonna grab another one and start
figuring<00:02:08.869> out<00:02:09.200> how<00:02:09.530> I'm<00:02:09.769> gonna<00:02:09.920> get<00:02:10.190> through

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
figuring out how I'm gonna get through

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.390 
figuring out how I'm gonna get through
the<00:02:11.120> chassis<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:12.080> where<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.290> want<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.650> go<00:02:12.769> every

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
the chassis to where I want to go every

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.339 
the chassis to where I want to go every
so<00:02:13.610> often<00:02:13.819> you'll<00:02:14.239> want<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.540> say<00:02:14.810> well<00:02:15.019> I<00:02:15.050> think

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
so often you'll want to say well I think

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.710 
so often you'll want to say well I think
we'll<00:02:15.530> put<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.709> hanger<00:02:16.069> here<00:02:16.519> or<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> hanger<00:02:17.390> here

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
we'll put a hanger here or a hanger here

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.750 
we'll put a hanger here or a hanger here
when<00:02:18.379> you<00:02:18.470> get<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.830> certain<00:02:19.040> point<00:02:19.430> it's

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
when you get to a certain point it's

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.790 
when you get to a certain point it's
probably<00:02:20.180> best<00:02:20.360> if<00:02:20.569> you<00:02:20.629> stop<00:02:20.989> weld<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.709> up

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
probably best if you stop weld it up

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.100 
probably best if you stop weld it up
what<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.099> have<00:02:22.310> done<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.060> continue<00:02:23.239> way<00:02:23.810> back

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
what you have done and continue way back

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.460 
what you have done and continue way back
if<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.799> don't<00:02:25.099> stop<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.879> weld<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.239> up<00:02:26.470> chances

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
if you don't stop and weld it up chances

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.930 
if you don't stop and weld it up chances
are<00:02:27.650> when<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:28.159> weld<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.549> everything's

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
are when you weld that everything's

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.059 
are when you weld that everything's
going<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.180> move<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.480> little<00:02:29.599> bit

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
going to move a little bit

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.190 
going to move a little bit
following<00:02:30.819> this<00:02:30.969> process<00:02:31.299> all<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.019> way<00:02:32.049> to

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
following this process all the way to

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.199 
following this process all the way to
the<00:02:32.409> back<00:02:32.620> he<00:02:33.189> could<00:02:33.400> then<00:02:33.579> put<00:02:33.849> on<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
the back he could then put on the

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.479 
the back he could then put on the
through<00:02:34.450> design<00:02:34.870> muffler<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.349> exhaust<00:02:35.650> tips

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
through design muffler and exhaust tips

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.509 
through design muffler and exhaust tips
this<00:02:37.299> whole<00:02:37.540> Flowmaster<00:02:38.319> exhaust<00:02:38.349> will<00:02:39.219> sound

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
this whole Flowmaster exhaust will sound

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.000 
this whole Flowmaster exhaust will sound
great<00:02:39.849> on<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.510> c10<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.140> pairing<00:02:41.530> between<00:02:41.890> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
custom engine that we're having built

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.080 
custom engine that we're having built
and<00:02:43.750> then<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.590> exhaust<00:02:44.950> it's<00:02:45.700> going<00:02:45.879> to<00:02:45.939> have

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
and then the exhaust it's going to have

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:55.110 
and then the exhaust it's going to have
a<00:02:46.120> rumble<00:02:46.599> that's<00:02:47.079> on<00:02:47.260> mistake<00:02:53.760> look<00:02:54.760> at<00:02:54.939> that

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
a rumble that's on mistake look at that

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.259 
a rumble that's on mistake look at that
