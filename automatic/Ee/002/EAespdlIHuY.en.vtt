00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
his money a little bit he did not at all
and<00:01:28.680> looked<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:28.890> he<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.009> caught<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.549> little

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and looked like he got caught a little

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
and looked like he got caught a little
bit<00:01:29.909> early<00:01:30.150> went<00:01:30.299> over<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:30.630> right<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
bit early went over here right on the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.990 
bit early went over here right on the
year<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.829> he<00:01:31.920> didn't<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.579> then<00:01:32.820> from

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
year that he didn't like and then from

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.249 
year that he didn't like and then from
then<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.270> he<00:01:33.420> was<00:01:33.540> pretty<00:01:33.780> much<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.079> in

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
then on he was pretty much just in

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.679 
then on he was pretty much just in
survival<00:01:34.680> mode<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.119> I<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.420> he<00:01:36.479> was<00:01:36.570> so

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
survival mode and I think he was so

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.090 
survival mode and I think he was so
worried<00:01:37.020> about<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> power<00:01:37.439> shots<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.890> top

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
worried about the power shots up top

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.340 
worried about the power shots up top
that<00:01:38.130> he<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:39.270> wide<00:01:39.570> open<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.110> bad

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
that he just was wide open for that bad

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.380 
that he just was wide open for that bad
liver<00:01:40.560> shot<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.009> was<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> perfect<00:01:41.670> shot<00:01:41.729> from

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
liver shot it was a perfect shot from
