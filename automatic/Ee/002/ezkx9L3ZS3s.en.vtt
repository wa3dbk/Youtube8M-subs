00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.339
 many people in parents children 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.809
 great kids and even musicians 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.940
 pros tell me they would like to have 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.760
 at home a digital piano and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.380
 ask which one to choose 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.900
 their answers always made the right choice 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.060
 that of a digital piano that has 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.160
 beautiful sounds an exemplary playability 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.770
 ease of use 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.840
 not to mention the aesthetic aspects 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.769
 here is why I recommend you 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.850
 to buy a piano strings 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.199
 one of the main problems we 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.359
 meeting on most pianos 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.230
 the digital balance and two touchdowns 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.789
 of the city 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.079
 the keys must remain 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.019
 perfectly to have the sensation 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.129
 of a real piano for those who do not 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.620
 never played the piano 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.239
 you try an organ or a synthesizer 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.129
 you will immediately find that 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.190
 keys have a very light answer 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.229
 even soft if you play on a real 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.479
 piano you will have the feeling of 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.070
 literally created notes because the 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.310
 touch is heavier and offers a lot 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.350
 more sensations little piano strings 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.030
 lp 380 recreate sensations of a real 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.219
 acoustic piano by offering a touchdown 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.430
 heavier in the bass than in the 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.430
 treble 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.880
 So it is also strived to design 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.979
 are extremely realistic and very beautiful 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.330
 I could even get out piano sounds 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.790
 conventional to experiment 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.890
 others are here are some examples 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.039
 you have here so wonderful sounds of 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.039
 piano 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 1 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.790
 electric pianos 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.539
 arts for clavinet 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.409
 even really the pollsters because I can 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.409
 play my favorite song 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.690
 I have heard so many times already in 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.690
 my life 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.110
 of growth at kursaal bern 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.770
 saw that I ate bush between them 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.629
 which is great also with the body 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.150
 curved 380 knows he has a system 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.870
 of internal speakers of very very 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.640
 high quality 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.379
 I can tell you that usually 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.269
 digital pianos with this kind of 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.980
 built-in speaker system only 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:30.739
 are really not good you are not 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.889
 not natural on the lp 380 we have the 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.480
 feeling that the sound comes from the back 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.459
 exactly like on a real piano and 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.209
 it's particularly realistic when 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.760
 you play I've already spoken everything to 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.349
 the time of the sound quality the ump 380 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.720
 but in addition they are very simple to 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.659
 use a lot of other instruments 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.549
 are extremely tedious to handle 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.290
 and that makes me think of some 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.629
 mobile phones that offers you 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.950
 three thousand useless functions while 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:03.379
 you only want it 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.450
 phone with the lp 380 offer you 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.459
 very beautiful piano sounds of others 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.419
 types of sounds too and then touch 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.280
 really beautiful 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:13.519
 you'll love playing with you do not 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.049
 leave the simplicity of this 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.609
 instrument is a reflection of its quality 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.650
 extremely bright 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.060
 you have to know that the market is full of 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.070
 digital piano of very poor quality 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.349
 you will never have the reliability of 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.820
 after-sales service body she did 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.770
 over 40 years old that I work with 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.120
 ropes and never needed their sav 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.120
 but it's good to know that there is
