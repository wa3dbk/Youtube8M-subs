00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.940
 all my name is Olya and today is the last 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.889
 marathon book day i think i 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.040
 reach the site of his book marathon 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.330
 if I may say so today 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.880
 the ninth day is the last of our book 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.279
 marathon and managed to present 5 books and 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.710
 perform almost all the tasks of the Crimea 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.840
 supreme 1 will be at my end video 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.330
 honestly when i agreed 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.129
 participating marathon I thought that everyone 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.000
 the day there will be tasks I'm on it I'm 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.890
 signed but nonetheless it was 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.470
 very good experience for me in terms of 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.850
 media I am now professional to me 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.979
 it seems install the camera screen all 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.940
 my lighting do makeup for shooting 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.900
 that is, this is my point I need anyone 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.879
 professionalism is much easier for me 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.860
 I was doing was much easier 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.659
 Iâ€™m probably recording a book 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.250
 the marathon could overcome its fear of 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.379
 camera anyway even though 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.360
 I'm taking pictures here probably already would have 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.100
 camera because I could not long 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.630
 say something and of course should now 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.460
 agreed on this happening much 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.920
 less often it seems to me that this is just 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.869
 the marathon book was a wonderful practice 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.210
 for any book blogger who shoots 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.030
 video because every day it was necessary 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.369
 take pictures and if you have already agreed to 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.740
 book marathon it was impossible 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.259
 it's a thing to throw into the fire and to the least 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.840
 my position all nine days laid out 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.719
 video up was the complexity of the new complexity 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.420
 be quickly resolved so i take it with me 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.819
 I pretty read five books what most 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.069
 important i got you up and provided of course 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.710
 I would like more but do not need to put 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.869
 yourself goals that you can not fulfill 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.729
 that is, no need to jump higher than your head were 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.600
 the basic rules of the marathon and the main 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.389
 the goal for myself set them to perform what 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.759
 it seemed to me already hard for me 

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:56.679
 I coped with everything very glad that I 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.810
 took part because until the last 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.170
 of the moment it was questionable on me yet 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.889
 hung a paper call that ended 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.600
 June 23 and about the books that I went through 

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:10.690
 as part of a paper call i'm too 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.970
 I'll tell you but it will be much later I do not 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.340
 I know when I will upload books 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.800
 video probably once a week probably all 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.110
 the cut 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.940
 Yes, let 's see , at least I want to 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.680
 explain why I took part in 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.940
 marathon 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.040
 because I don't know it seems to me that ours 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.810
 super-duper community is very friendly 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.610
 feel on the same wavelength with 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.110
 other book bloggers for me were 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.630
 very important because i'm very much 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.350
 Tag I missed wrote Olya 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.890
 offered to join but that's all 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.770
 a time when there were interesting games that 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.990
 I would like to support me to interfere with my studies 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.290
 and she probably will always bother me 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.510
 because my studies are always on 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.730
 the main place and why are you on me 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.310
 still a hobby is not my job 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.440
 it is not my duty but nonetheless 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.510
 it was very interesting and I already 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.600
 she said it was good practice to me 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.360
 it seems great when the book is bloggers 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.250
 do the same thing together and 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.200
 It turned out to be very interesting to me 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.510
 I would really like this book 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.790
 Marathon we have taken root in our Russian 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.590
 beech to you and so that it passes every year 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.630
 because it is really very 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.400
 Interesting on this all I hope that 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.250
 there is still a lot of books ahead of us 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.320
