now an experienced team that's fighting

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.630 
now an experienced team that's fighting
in<00:02:26.780> there<00:02:26.870> four<00:02:27.110> fours<00:02:27.440> never<00:02:27.860> won<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.280> heat

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
in there four fours never won a heat

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.990 
in there four fours never won a heat
though<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.680> your<00:02:30.860> machine<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.819> all<00:02:31.970> I

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
though so your machine is I and all I

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.180 
though so your machine is I and all I
believe<00:02:32.510> that's<00:02:32.810> correct<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.349> what<00:02:33.650> does<00:02:33.830> I&amp;R

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
believe that's correct and what does I&amp;R

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.520 
believe that's correct and what does I&amp;R
do<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:35.090> has<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.270> full<00:02:35.630> power<00:02:35.840> flip<00:02:36.170> van<00:02:36.349> der

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
do it has a full power flip van der

approximately one-tenth of a second so

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.729 
approximately one-tenth of a second so
you<00:02:40.849> can<00:02:41.000> actually<00:02:41.030> see<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.690> naked<00:02:41.989> eye<00:02:42.080> you
