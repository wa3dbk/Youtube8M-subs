00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:15.240
 battery is you will need a usb cable 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.460
 you cut the other end of that plant 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.240
 you leave logical where you will connect 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.330
 the cable 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 you leave the tip and the other you you 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.779

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.329
 two black wire functions and the red you 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.739

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.770
 make it bigger you know let's go to the next one 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.770
 step after you cut 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.269
 the fires will fit where the pile is 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:10.710

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.740
 red and one right to black may 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.140
 this is precisely the body in the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.619
 video there but you can see it 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.909
 so it was red from copy 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.220
 red 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.959

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.159
 Find it or you'll take the lid of the daughter. 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:49.830
 only without batteries will not give even zica 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.899
 you get it and you can 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.240
 mine already on account of the cold 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.060
 can cut in the future you do the same 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.170
 procedure 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.170
 there you 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:10.380
 knowing that it takes the car there and closes it 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.990
 hurt steps and let it loose 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.930
 These end all the time, right? 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.230
 you close in the pressure and in the future it 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.440
 cut the hair but you do in make 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.440
 again 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.180
 let's go to the video game 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.599

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.610
 I'm I'm recording on because the 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.610
 the camera hate was all cast 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.970

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.550
 you can put the header well with 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.500
 who to any electronic product that 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.640
 has been following it will work 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.640
 it 's not just the xbox 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.060
 When I put it in, it will b after 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.060
 of energy 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:18.080
 not only in xbox it works in any 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:21.080
 USB port works in partnership with 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.050
 I always 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.560
 only that xbox it can give a problem 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.390
 it's a lot of energy and when you 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.550
 decided for a long time and turn off the 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.600
 Xbox will be left with a red line 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.340
 source 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.340
 only that we are concerned not only with 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.020
 taken after the globe that she 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.490
 overheated then you can not talk in the 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.580
 the power supply. 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.170
 phone that gets tempted to climb you put 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.910
 he was in the making or any other 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:54.500
 thing is it to work by faith is 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:57.110
 perfectly and the vibration will be very 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.340
 stronger much stronger 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:04.090
