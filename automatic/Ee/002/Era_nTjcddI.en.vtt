 the pay there was everything igor beauty in the area 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.240
 with one more colonial in this video let's 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.759
 learn techniques that will help us 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.230
 beat the players that in my modest 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:33.410
 opinion practice anti-game on fifa 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.680
 exactly, we'll see how to play 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.089
 efficiently against the fish gallery 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.900
 rohr and a half 15 on the back and also against 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:47.390
 the singers attack of the galera that likes and 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.090
 live doing against attacks 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.760
 Good for who does not know did rohr is the 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.890
 definition of those players who use and 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.989
 abuses of speed are those that 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.239
 simply could not play the 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.359
 played if the player was a 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.690
 more balanced speed has 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.240
 means speed and rohr means 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.970
 first in English is to have those who 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.759
 kneeling and praying for some kind of change 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.049
 for our team knows the game of a country 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:21.860
 rohr consists of 99% of making a 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.439
 against attack getting launch 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.369
 where your players can have spaces 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.490
 to run 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.799
 another boat to the rear of us, then he 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.530
 will make a beque pies to a cross case 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.360
 you can not go out in tandem with the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.500
 goalkeeper 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.740
 usually they use players who have 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.820
 zero technique and a lot of speed as 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.159
 miami is hit walk Biabiany reme 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.229
 among many others 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.259
 They call for nothing, they just call. 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.960
 players speed is sometimes 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.689
 they do not have the type technique 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.549
 Robinho Neymar however they have not 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.640
 technique to use the players only if 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.159
 they care about their speed and the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.100
 most of them use the tactic has 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.429
 five defenders to get easier 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.610
 defense by the number of players and 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.470
 try to stay against attacking because the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.570
 five defenders in the back the five 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.690
 Right back in the penalty area 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.220
 invite the opposing team to the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.370
 attack 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.790
 so it facilitates the attack but I discovered 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.310
 an easy and effective method for you 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.640
 they play a beautiful football, they do not have many 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.470
 headaches with these players 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.640
 I'm bringing you one here. 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.360
 tutorial of this 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:46.330
 Legal right to follow the following steps will 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:50.270
 have many joys against people 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.850
 first team in the Super Defensive or in the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.630
 defensive and this will lessen the chance 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.690
 of the face to engage a counterattack with 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.570
 hunter and cover they throw throwing 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.730
 staff at 12 or crossing then and 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:10.030
 identifies the face game of that piece 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.560
 size and annul the plays them covering 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.770
 possession strategy 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.840
 one suggestion is to use the tiki taka that was 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:22.010
 previously taught in another tournament 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:28.160
 here on the channel or make your own tactic 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:31.450
 possession of the pass only pass well 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.610
 ball never lose the ball with ease 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.220
 make it difficult for the opponent to have 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.260
 Possession of ball while you have possession 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.130
 there are no attacks against 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.980
 so the opponent 's game is year-end 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.860
 pass the ball well mainly against 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.170
 five at the back as this kills the guy 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.900
 when you play in the behind you have a lot 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.190
 space and in the middle field because there are few 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.330
 half is usually 26 is careful with 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.160
 the corners 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.920
 When you have a corner make a 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.930
 custom tactic not to take 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.150
 against attacks 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.810
 have to call the player next to you 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.340
 and hit the ball for him so your team 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.170
 You can have time to go back and 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.100
 recompose to the rear 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.100
 be patient that is key to everything 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.590
 that was spoken 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.810
 never hurry and do not hurry to 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.479
 reach the opponent's highest goal 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.950
 frustration that people can not 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.680
 hire kakÃ¡ 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.180
 I know it will become a boring game 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.790
 especially if you are experiencing 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.850
 the five defenders but in my opinion 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.680
 who plays like that does not want a game 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.800
 fun but only instead of goal 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.380
 sweaty to see if they can win and 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.050
 many times when they can still 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.990
 in the illusion of thinking that they play a lot 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.840
 They are flying, grandson, everything else 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.550
 now a quick example of a match 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.480
 that I did against one of these 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.910
 faces 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.270
 At first I did not imagine it was a 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.920
 made strong but with the dignitary miccoli 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.750
 muriel in the attack combined with 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.730
 balotelli in order to be able to 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.950
 defender committed and enjoy head in 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.560
 crossing and with the fact that it starts 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.840
 playing super defensive against attacking 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.920
 I criticized the children of 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.860
 his game 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.720
 You'll see that he could not 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.200
 just get on my goal 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.210
 a danger in the attacks because I 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.880
 I canceled all the guy's counterattacks 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.130
 I followed the concepts I presented 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.590
 for you in this video and this guy was 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.040
 very nervous because it simply does not 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.480
 I could play his game 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.490
 Look what I said to you guys. 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.320
 he got there kicking almost in the 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.520
 side a desperation a cross and 1 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.550
 did not hit anything 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.310
 and it looks only I arrived I made my goal and 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.360
 dribbling left and out 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.610
 rep who found the cockpit samir nasri 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.340
 alone in the back he turned upwards 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.740
 defender midway through two and hit the 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.800
 ball in the drawer with violence to make 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.890
 a goal from my personal victory 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.690
 and that's how it ended this game alone 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:15.110
 were those moments really 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.390
 Look ok, I smashed the guy in the 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.760
 ball and I managed to score there 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.090
 gave the victory so this is it below the 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.340
 made strong and leave comments as 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.460
 You left after watching this video. 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.320
 against this type of opponent, well 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.060
 required to attend a large crowd 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.190
 hug everyone, do not forget the license 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.020
 share with your favorite friends and 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.300
 to the next 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:59.069
 kits that 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:59.069
 [Applause]
