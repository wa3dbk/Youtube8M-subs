between ten and eleven when we look at
the<00:01:47.729> overall<00:01:48.030> length<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.659> her<00:01:48.899> foot<00:01:49.140> from<00:01:49.409> heel

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the overall length of her foot from heel

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.340 
the overall length of her foot from heel
to<00:01:49.680> toe<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:51.000> right<00:01:51.540> over<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.930> line<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.290> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
to toe it is right over the line of a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.590 
to toe it is right over the line of a
ten<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.950> she<00:01:53.040> would<00:01:53.280> also<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> size<00:01:54.119> ten<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
ten so she would also be a size ten and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.050 
ten so she would also be a size ten and
a<00:01:54.659> half<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.170> then<00:01:55.890> when<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.189> come<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.579> do<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
a half and then when we come and do the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.539 
a half and then when we come and do the
width<00:01:57.270> aspect<00:01:57.930> you'll<00:01:58.590> want<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.009> look<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
width aspect you'll want to look at the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.660 
width aspect you'll want to look at the
numbers<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:01.259> which<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.070> ten<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> half

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
numbers on this which the ten and a half

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.399 
numbers on this which the ten and a half
is<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.890> an<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:06.030> width<00:02:06.329> right<00:02:06.600> between<00:02:06.750> an<00:02:07.079> A<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
is on an a width right between an A and

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.190 
is on an a width right between an A and
a<00:02:07.500> double<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.849> person<00:02:09.090> has<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> size<00:02:09.899> ten

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
a double a so this person has a size ten

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.080 
a double a so this person has a size ten
and<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.349> half<00:02:10.500> there

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
and a half there

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.440 
and a half there
but<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:13.280> double-a<00:02:13.670> would<00:02:13.849> be<00:02:13.970> considered

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
but a and double-a would be considered

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.750 
but a and double-a would be considered
narrow<00:02:14.720> for<00:02:15.020> women's<00:02:15.380> V<00:02:16.160> width<00:02:16.430> would<00:02:16.640> be

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
narrow for women's V width would be

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.570 
narrow for women's V width would be
considered<00:02:17.209> medium<00:02:17.900> as<00:02:18.230> C<00:02:18.890> width<00:02:19.160> is<00:02:19.340> going<00:02:19.520> to

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
considered medium as C width is going to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.030 
considered medium as C width is going to
be<00:02:19.670> between<00:02:19.849> medium<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.660> wide<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.560> D<00:02:21.739> width

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
be between medium and wide and a D width

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.000 
be between medium and wide and a D width
and<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:23.150> going<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.390> be<00:02:23.450> wide<00:02:23.780> at<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.590> so

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
and on is going to be wide at and so

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.570 
and on is going to be wide at and so
forth<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.260> compare<00:02:27.830> right<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.370> left

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
than likely at ten and then when we look

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.850 
than likely at ten and then when we look
at<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.000> width<00:02:47.209> aspect<00:02:47.900> will<00:02:48.200> come<00:02:48.410> from<00:02:48.709> the

nine and a half arch length measurement

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.140 
nine and a half arch length measurement
that<00:02:51.170> we<00:02:51.290> had<00:02:51.500> received<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:53.030> going

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
that we had received and this is going

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.559 
that we had received and this is going
to<00:02:53.209> be<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.690> B<00:02:54.620> width<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.760> it's<00:02:56.000> going<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.209> be<00:02:56.330> a

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
to be a B width so it's going to be a

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.830 
to be a B width so it's going to be a
medium<00:02:57.410> width<00:02:58.130> it's<00:02:58.910> important<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.540> when

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
medium width it's important that when

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.280 
medium width it's important that when
you<00:02:59.989> fit<00:03:00.200> your<00:03:00.230> shoes<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:01.519> take<00:03:01.790> the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
longest foot and the widest width so in

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.910 
longest foot and the widest width so in
her<00:03:07.099> case<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:08.019> right<00:03:09.019> foot<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:09.500> going<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.769> be<00:03:09.890> a
