hey guys what's going on talin here and
we're<00:00:13.130> doing<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.190> quick<00:00:14.370> country<00:00:14.820> because<00:00:15.030> I

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
we're doing a quick country because I

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.510 
we're doing a quick country because I
just<00:00:15.269> want<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> quick<00:00:15.839> update<00:00:16.310> so<00:00:17.310> I

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
just want to do a quick update so I

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.910 
just want to do a quick update so I
finally<00:00:18.029> updated<00:00:18.539> my<00:00:18.630> realest<00:00:18.869> action<00:00:19.260> and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
finally updated my realest action and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.950 
finally updated my realest action and
holding<00:00:20.220> off<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.369> ages<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.359> too<00:00:21.750> busy

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
holding off for ages is just too busy

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.870 
holding off for ages is just too busy
and<00:00:22.230> didn't<00:00:22.619> think<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.890> did<00:00:23.010> anything<00:00:23.279> it

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
and didn't think it did anything it

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.689 
and didn't think it did anything it
makes<00:00:24.180> such<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> difference<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.279> probably

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
makes such a difference so you probably

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.929 
makes such a difference so you probably
can<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.460> but<00:00:29.460> click<00:00:29.670> over

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
can see it here but then but click over

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.490 
can see it here but then but click over
here<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.130> video<00:00:32.130> here<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.540> want

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
here and not do a video here and I want

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.660 
here and not do a video here and I want
to<00:00:34.530> show<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.890> difference<00:00:35.250> i<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.520> make

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
to show you the difference i can make

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.110 
to show you the difference i can make
here<00:00:36.230> export<00:00:37.230> settings<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.739> enables<00:00:38.309> AMD<00:00:38.940> up

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
here export settings it enables AMD up

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.479 
here export settings it enables AMD up
or<00:00:39.420> probably<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.620> an<00:00:40.680> nvidia<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.370> you

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
or probably just an nvidia one if you

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.600 
or probably just an nvidia one if you
have<00:00:41.640> nvidia<00:00:42.020> but<00:00:43.020> Marilla<00:00:43.860> Saxon<00:00:44.370> when<00:00:44.489> you

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
have nvidia but Marilla Saxon when you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.750 
have nvidia but Marilla Saxon when you
when<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.059> go<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.390> enable<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.489> it<00:00:47.489> actually

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
when you go and enable this it actually

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.569 
when you go and enable this it actually
does<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.899> hear<00:00:49.710> your<00:00:49.860> performance<00:00:50.309> at<00:00:50.430> all

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
does not hear your performance at all

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.150 
does not hear your performance at all
because<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.510> uses<00:00:51.660> UDP<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.530> record<00:00:52.800> so

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
because it uses UDP you to record so

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.819 
because it uses UDP you to record so
this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.430> basically<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:54.120> AMD<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:55.590> like

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
this is basically for AMD it's like

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.580 
this is basically for AMD it's like
shadow<00:00:56.100> play<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:57.059> little<00:00:57.449> update<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.440> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
