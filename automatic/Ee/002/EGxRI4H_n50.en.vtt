00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.810
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.220
 our youtube channel 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.230
 Today we want you two new ones 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.080
 Introducing products that are ours 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.700
 new battery operated sucker for the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.650
 pool and hot tub 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.079
 then we have the smaller one 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.509
 gets both the catfish and here 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:25.089
 is the more powerful larger device 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:28.179
 The pool blaster both devices you can 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:30.999
 both hand- operated and 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.309
 with a telescopic pole speak to the hand 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.929
 Example of hot tub for smaller pulse 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.620
 maybe also for the small children's pool 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:37.690
 in the garden 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.640
 but you can just as well 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.199
 you should attach telescopic rod 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.329
 actually a slightly larger pool 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.670
 have so you can also easily 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.359
 every dirty spot of the pool in the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.649
 scope of delivery is the sucker included 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.589
 then we have the power supply 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.629
 which charges then we have 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.399
 for each tool sucker again 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.670
 Finer filter says fine particles 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.100
 on together because both devices are very much 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.500
 Similar are doing worthy smaller ones 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.799
 catfish markus aside and 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.990
 concentrate on the priest max 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.329
 what we both devices very well 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.570
 like that on the off button 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:19.509
 each one lid is behind 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.990
 which the socket for the power supply 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.360
 thus there is potential danger 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.140
 put aside that possibly water 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.689
 can penetrate 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.640
 at the pool front they have leaves 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.619
 brush and where they then stronger 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.450
 Remove dirt or particles 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.189
 can not make the dirt again 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.990
 to get a pool is one 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.180
 membrane is thereby incorporated 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.950
 prevents the dirt in the pool 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.930
 Blaster in it is back in the basin 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.359
 gets the sucked dirt like 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.399
 mentioned is sucked in with the water 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.920
 the water comes here again to the 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.409
 side down, and so it stays 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.210
 really only the dirt we return 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.789
 open a fall the pool blaster in front 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.490
 and so you laugh very easy to 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.210
 filter says here so the dirt 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.700
 stored leaves dirt 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.940
 Earth is always easy 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.410
 remove says use empty 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.420
 and you can continue cleaning 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.370
 please do not forget about both 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.840
 pools eye a telescopic bar to 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.209
 order because this is not in 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.319
 scope of delivery we hope this 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.730
 you liked the video 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.489
 Just leave us one 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.600
