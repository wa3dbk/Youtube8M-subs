which<00:00:02.650> is<00:00:02.890> a<00:00:02.920> monotype<00:00:03.580> machine<00:00:04.029> and<00:00:04.390> it's<00:00:05.080> now

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.350 
which is a monotype machine and it's now

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.650 
which is a monotype machine and it's now
pretty<00:00:05.649> much<00:00:05.800> obsolete<00:00:06.279> because<00:00:07.060> it<00:00:07.360> was<00:00:07.480> so

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
pretty much obsolete because it was so

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.640 
pretty much obsolete because it was so
difficult<00:00:07.870> to<00:00:08.290> work<00:00:08.580> so<00:00:09.580> a<00:00:09.910> secretary<00:00:10.809> in<00:00:11.170> like

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
difficult to work so a secretary in like

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.790 
difficult to work so a secretary in like
another<00:00:11.950> part<00:00:12.370> of<00:00:12.550> the<00:00:12.639> building<00:00:13.300> would<00:00:14.230> type

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:14.800 
another part of the building would type

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.240 
another part of the building would type
out<00:00:15.040> on<00:00:15.580> a<00:00:15.639> keyboard<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:17.080> words<00:00:17.890> or<00:00:18.189> the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
out on a keyboard the words or the

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.890 
out on a keyboard the words or the
letters<00:00:18.640> that<00:00:18.820> were<00:00:18.970> needed<00:00:19.119> in<00:00:19.509> like

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
letters that were needed in like

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.620 
letters that were needed in like
sentence<00:00:20.349> form<00:00:20.680> or<00:00:20.829> whatever<00:00:21.099> and<00:00:21.489> that<00:00:22.300> would

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
sentence form or whatever and that would

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.170 
sentence form or whatever and that would
be<00:00:22.660> transferred<00:00:23.259> onto<00:00:23.410> a<00:00:23.890> long<00:00:24.250> punch<00:00:24.790> card

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
be transferred onto a long punch card

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.440 
be transferred onto a long punch card
paper<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:26.770> punch<00:00:26.950> card<00:00:27.040> paper<00:00:27.520> would<00:00:28.239> then

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
paper so the punch card paper would then

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.010 
paper so the punch card paper would then
be<00:00:28.750> brought<00:00:28.899> here<00:00:29.349> and<00:00:29.559> fed<00:00:30.399> through<00:00:30.669> here<00:00:31.180> so

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
be brought here and fed through here so

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.400 
be brought here and fed through here so
that<00:00:32.259> this<00:00:32.800> machine<00:00:33.570> could<00:00:34.570> read<00:00:34.809> the<00:00:34.989> Holts

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
that this machine could read the Holts

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.150 
that this machine could read the Holts
and<00:00:35.590> contract<00:00:36.100> so<00:00:36.309> depending<00:00:36.850> on<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.120> holes

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and contract so depending on the holes

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.229 
and contract so depending on the holes
the<00:00:39.160> machine<00:00:39.820> would<00:00:41.309> way<00:00:42.309> back<00:00:42.550> here<00:00:42.910> there's

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
the machine would way back here there's

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.240 
the machine would way back here there's
a<00:00:43.329> cartridge<00:00:43.839> that<00:00:43.899> goes<00:00:44.320> in<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:44.890> there's<00:00:45.070> no

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
a cartridge that goes in and there's no

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.130 
a cartridge that goes in and there's no
cartridges<00:00:45.789> around<00:00:46.120> here<00:00:46.420> so<00:00:46.660> I<00:00:46.690> can't<00:00:46.960> show

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
cartridges around here so I can't show

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.709 
cartridges around here so I can't show
you<00:00:47.170> but<00:00:47.530> it's<00:00:47.649> a<00:00:47.910> square<00:00:48.910> cartridge<00:00:49.480> with

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
you but it's a square cartridge with

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.200 
you but it's a square cartridge with
little<00:00:50.050> tiny<00:00:50.350> brass<00:00:50.739> letters<00:00:51.219> in<00:00:51.429> a<00:00:51.519> grid<00:00:51.820> yes

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
little tiny brass letters in a grid yes

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.520 
little tiny brass letters in a grid yes
called<00:00:52.960> up<00:00:53.140> a<00:00:53.260> matte<00:00:53.949> case<00:00:54.309> yes<00:00:54.760> or<00:00:55.059> a<00:00:55.530> matrix

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
called up a matte case yes or a matrix

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.939 
called up a matte case yes or a matrix
case<00:00:56.829> thank<00:00:57.159> you<00:00:57.249> can<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.469> machine

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
case thank you can and the this machine

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.130 
case thank you can and the this machine
depending<00:01:00.550> on<00:01:00.550> what<00:01:00.940> holes<00:01:01.300> that<00:01:01.600> was<00:01:01.749> reading

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
depending on what holes that was reading

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.649 
depending on what holes that was reading
would<00:01:02.589> push<00:01:02.890> out<00:01:03.100> each<00:01:03.330> individual<00:01:04.330> letter

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
would push out each individual letter

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.999 
would push out each individual letter
and<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:07.210> machine<00:01:07.630> would<00:01:07.780> cast<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.680> letters

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
and this machine would cast the letters

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.770 
and this machine would cast the letters
in<00:01:09.040> lead<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:11.130> back<00:01:12.130> here<00:01:12.490> is<00:01:13.090> where<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:13.509> would

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
in lead so back here is where you would

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.789 
in lead so back here is where you would
melt<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.170> lead<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.890> get<00:01:15.220> shot<00:01:15.520> through<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
melt the lead and get shot through and

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.219 
melt the lead and get shot through and
then<00:01:19.649> this<00:01:20.649> whole<00:01:20.920> part<00:01:21.460> here<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:22.450> was<00:01:22.600> an<00:01:22.719> a<00:01:22.930> it

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
then this whole part here it was an a it

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.980 
then this whole part here it was an a it
would<00:01:23.469> move<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.850> arm<00:01:25.119> would<00:01:25.329> move<00:01:25.570> so<00:01:25.960> that

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
would move this arm would move so that

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.530 
would move this arm would move so that
the<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:26.350> was<00:01:26.740> over<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:27.250> whole<00:01:27.430> forecasting<00:01:28.240> and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
the a was over the whole forecasting and

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.510 
the a was over the whole forecasting and
then<00:01:28.840> if<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.200> next<00:01:29.350> letter<00:01:29.649> was<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:29.950> sea<00:01:30.250> than

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
then if the next letter was a sea than

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.120 
then if the next letter was a sea than
it<00:01:30.640> would<00:01:30.729> all<00:01:30.880> new<00:01:31.119> and<00:01:31.450> cast<00:01:32.289> a<00:01:32.500> sea<00:01:32.710> since

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
it would all new and cast a sea since

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.889 
it would all new and cast a sea since
whole<00:01:33.369> part<00:01:33.640> was<00:01:33.820> moving<00:01:34.210> while<00:01:34.479> it<00:01:34.659> was<00:01:34.780> so

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
whole part was moving while it was so

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.660 
whole part was moving while it was so
this<00:01:35.049> is<00:01:35.110> actually<00:01:35.439> I'm<00:01:35.530> costing<00:01:36.340> machine

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
this is actually I'm costing machine

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.410 
this is actually I'm costing machine
then<00:01:36.909> yes<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:38.380> casts<00:01:38.829> monotype<00:01:39.399> so<00:01:40.240> the

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
then yes it casts monotype so the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.179 
then yes it casts monotype so the
letters<00:01:40.689> would<00:01:40.840> come<00:01:41.049> out<00:01:41.200> rather<00:01:41.860> than<00:01:42.039> a

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
letters would come out rather than a

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.190 
letters would come out rather than a
long<00:01:42.490> line<00:01:42.850> yeah<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.689> will<00:01:43.869> come<00:01:44.049> out

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
long line yeah it will come out

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.230 
long line yeah it will come out
individual<00:01:44.920> forum<00:01:45.219> but<00:01:45.460> in<00:01:45.640> individual

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
individual forum but in individual

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.740 
individual forum but in individual
letters<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:48.670> advantage<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.329> was<00:01:49.570> if

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
letters and one advantage of that was if

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.209 
letters and one advantage of that was if
you<00:01:49.780> did<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.049> spelling<00:01:50.380> mistake<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:51.070> could

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
you did a spelling mistake you could

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.010 
you did a spelling mistake you could
just<00:01:51.340> take<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.670> individual<00:01:52.210> letter<00:01:52.420> up<00:01:52.600> we

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
just take the individual letter up we

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.919 
just take the individual letter up we
ask<00:01:53.320> what<00:01:53.530> it's<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.770> one<00:01:53.950> letter<00:01:54.570> but<00:01:55.570> the

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
ask what it's the one letter but the

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.630 
ask what it's the one letter but the
unfortunate<00:01:58.929> part<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.229> there<00:01:59.740> are<00:01:59.859> so<00:02:00.130> many

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
unfortunate part is there are so many

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.380 
unfortunate part is there are so many
moving<00:02:01.060> parts<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.070> was<00:02:03.219> really<00:02:03.520> hard<00:02:04.060> to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
moving parts that it was really hard to

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.820 
moving parts that it was really hard to
maintain

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
maintain

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.540 
maintain
it's<00:02:06.610> very<00:02:07.680> mechanical<00:02:08.680> like<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.979> probably

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
it's very mechanical like you probably

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.850 
it's very mechanical like you probably
moving<00:02:09.850> at<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.090> heck<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.780> yes<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.260> they<00:02:11.320> move

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
moving at a heck of a yes and they move

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.790 
moving at a heck of a yes and they move
really<00:02:12.250> fast<00:02:12.280> so<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:12.940> like<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.390> sea<00:02:14.080> ah<00:02:14.320> that's

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
really fast so is like a sea ah that's

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.700 
really fast so is like a sea ah that's
your<00:02:15.070> matrix<00:02:15.760> day<00:02:16.060> oh<00:02:16.390> there's<00:02:16.930> matrix<00:02:17.200> this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
your matrix day oh there's matrix this

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.170 
your matrix day oh there's matrix this
is<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.980> matrix<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.400> whole<00:02:21.850> thing<00:02:22.030> is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
is the matrix so this is whole thing is

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.180 
is the matrix so this is whole thing is
called<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.510> matrix<00:02:22.930> case<00:02:23.170> or<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.650> case<00:02:23.890> and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
called a matrix case or in that case and

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.550 
called a matrix case or in that case and
these<00:02:24.340> each<00:02:24.760> individual<00:02:25.510> square<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.230> am<00:02:26.380> at

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
these each individual square is am at

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.660 
these each individual square is am at
your<00:02:27.040> matrice<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:30.040> back<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.520> see

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
your matrice and on the back you can see

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.580 
your matrice and on the back you can see
the<00:02:31.030> holes<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.660> would<00:02:31.780> correspond<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.380> the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
the holes that would correspond to the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.460 
the holes that would correspond to the
punch<00:02:32.770> card<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.990> would<00:02:35.170> be<00:02:35.200> moving

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
punch card so this would be moving

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.280 
punch card so this would be moving
around<00:02:35.920> yes<00:02:36.520> yes<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.150> if<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.810> was<00:02:37.960> an<00:02:38.050> english

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
around yes yes and if it was an english

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.560 
around yes yes and if it was an english
to<00:02:38.470> previously<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.550> push<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.940> appropriate

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
to previously and push the appropriate

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.210 
to previously and push the appropriate
one<00:02:40.690> down<00:02:40.900> into<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.230> world<00:02:41.500> but<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.040> moved

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
one down into the world but it moved

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.880 
one down into the world but it moved
really<00:02:42.400> fast<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:44.110> then<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.500> would<00:02:44.620> get<00:02:44.770> your

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
really fast so then you would get your

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.370 
really fast so then you would get your
individual<00:02:45.430> type<00:02:45.700> coming<00:02:46.120> out<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.290> is

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
individual type coming out so this is

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.990 
individual type coming out so this is
actually<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.709> monocoque<00:02:48.160> machine<00:02:48.490> this<00:02:48.820> is<00:02:48.970> a

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
actually the monocoque machine this is a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.420 
actually the monocoque machine this is a
monotype<00:02:49.510> machine<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.050> because<00:02:50.740> it<00:02:50.920> was<00:02:51.190> so

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
monotype machine and because it was so

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.230 
monotype machine and because it was so
complex<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.240> use<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:53.670> cease<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:55.000> exist

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
complex to use it cease to exist

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.300 
complex to use it cease to exist
apparently<00:02:56.050> someone<00:02:56.410> who<00:02:56.470> told<00:02:56.620> me<00:02:56.740> that<00:02:56.770> it

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
apparently someone who told me that it

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.280 
apparently someone who told me that it
never<00:02:57.670> ever<00:02:57.910> caught<00:02:58.240> on<00:02:58.450> really<00:02:58.780> in<00:02:59.080> North

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
never ever caught on really in North

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.680 
never ever caught on really in North
America<00:02:59.860> but<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.220> Britain<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:01.240> was<00:03:01.390> really

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
America but in Britain it was really

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.560 
America but in Britain it was really
popular<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.770> you<00:03:02.860> don't<00:03:03.070> apparently<00:03:04.000> find<00:03:04.270> too

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
popular so you don't apparently find too

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.100 
popular so you don't apparently find too
many<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.959> you<00:03:05.080> in<00:03:05.110> North<00:03:05.440> America
