 the day test driver genes was occurring at the edge of a road point of 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.579
 rallying the 100 meter high sand mountain from the rising 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.940
 cold-related waters in germany 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.940
 the show promises we can snowboard on sand 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.930
 it is an extraterrestrial landscape but today it is the terrain of those of 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.930
 rooms 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.289

 a rope 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.030
 it was a machine existing criteria for drawing the press 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.310
 I like it started along its colossal slopes 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.770
 reach the care round intended for 33 degrees specially drawn for 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.790
 opportunity 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.790
 it will be just 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.280
 the pulling force should be sufficient to allow young people 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.980
 scouts reach the jump ramp 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.480
 teisseire 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.420
 giving the signal to quads two hundred and fifty cubic centimeters 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.890
 but there is still a problem 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.890
 the quad does not find a road on to tow part 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.960

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.510
 never stopped 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.630
 they have to wait for the right speed to pick them the right time to let go 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.420
 the rope before the substitute everything is a question of power timing 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.580
 electric
