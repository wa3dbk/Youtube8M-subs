I'm<00:00:00.179> going<00:00:00.329> to<00:00:00.420> demonstrate<00:00:00.979> some<00:00:01.979> some

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
I'm going to demonstrate some some

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.749 
I'm going to demonstrate some some
kicking<00:00:03.000> drills<00:00:03.300> next<00:00:03.929> it's<00:00:04.830> important<00:00:05.370> to

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
kicking drills next it's important to

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.849 
kicking drills next it's important to
remember<00:00:06.060> why<00:00:06.750> we're<00:00:07.049> doing<00:00:07.200> these<00:00:07.470> kicking

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
remember why we're doing these kicking

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.919 
remember why we're doing these kicking
drills<00:00:08.150> if<00:00:09.150> we're<00:00:09.240> going<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.420> relate<00:00:09.690> them<00:00:09.870> to

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
drills if we're going to relate them to

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.280 
drills if we're going to relate them to
backstroke<00:00:10.620> then<00:00:11.300> we<00:00:12.300> we<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.990> make<00:00:13.139> sure

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
backstroke then we we have to make sure

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.620 
backstroke then we we have to make sure
that<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:13.530> communicate<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.549> athlete<00:00:15.030> well

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
that we communicate to the athlete well

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.029 
that we communicate to the athlete well
we're<00:00:15.780> actually<00:00:15.929> trying<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.379> get<00:00:16.560> out<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.770> them

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
we're actually trying to get out of them

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.769 
we're actually trying to get out of them
and<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.400> for<00:00:17.850> each<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.119> these<00:00:18.210> drills<00:00:18.539> it's

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
and and for each of these drills it's

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.220 
and and for each of these drills it's
something<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.439> little<00:00:19.650> bit<00:00:19.770> different<00:00:21.230> we're

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
something a little bit different we're

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.410 
something a little bit different we're
isolating<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.980> feet<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.550> propulsion

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
isolating the feet now the propulsion

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.939 
isolating the feet now the propulsion
that<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.779> get<00:00:24.900> from<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> feet<00:00:25.439> through<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
that we get from the feet through the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.470 
that we get from the feet through the
legs<00:00:26.160> through<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> hips<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.970> into<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> body

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
legs through the hips and into the body

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.529 
legs through the hips and into the body
and<00:00:28.010> that<00:00:29.010> means<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.269> balance

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
and that means that we have to balance

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.840 
and that means that we have to balance
the<00:00:31.500> force<00:00:31.920> that's<00:00:32.099> coming<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:32.520> through<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the force that's coming up through the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.420 
the force that's coming up through the
body<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.989> way<00:00:34.110> that's<00:00:34.350> maximally<00:00:34.920> efficient

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
body in a way that's maximally efficient

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.510 
body in a way that's maximally efficient
in<00:00:36.300> order<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.719> do<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.800> create<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
in order to do that we have to create a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.959 
in order to do that we have to create a
body<00:00:39.030> position<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.550> willing<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.700> accept

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
body position that is willing to accept

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.600 
body position that is willing to accept
a<00:00:42.570> lot<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.079> power<00:00:43.379> without<00:00:43.829> losing<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
a lot of power without losing it to

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.650 
a lot of power without losing it to
either<00:00:44.789> vibration<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.800> rotation<00:00:47.030> so<00:00:48.030> we're

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
either vibration or rotation so we're

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.299 
either vibration or rotation so we're
going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> ask<00:00:48.930> Kelsey<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.590> kick<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.219> their

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
going to ask Kelsey to kick with their

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.790 
going to ask Kelsey to kick with their
hands<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.760> her<00:00:50.850> hips<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.960> three<00:00:52.500> different

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
hands at her hips in three different

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.410 
hands at her hips in three different
positions<00:00:52.920> she's<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> start<00:00:53.969> flat<00:00:54.210> on

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
positions she's going to start flat on

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.889

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.680 
to her right side and the whole time
we're<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> watch<00:01:02.010> her<00:01:02.489> create<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.329> really

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
we're going to watch her create a really

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.990 
we're going to watch her create a really
long<00:01:05.150> connected<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.360> rigid<00:01:07.700> vessel<00:01:08.700> that's

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
long connected and rigid vessel that's

and down to the end of the pool so
Kelsey<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:14.909> go<00:01:15.090> one<00:01:15.360> length<00:01:15.630> where<00:01:16.020> you're

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
Kelsey just go one length where you're

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.920 
Kelsey just go one length where you're
starting<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.710> your<00:01:16.860> back<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> kick<00:01:18.420> great

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
side into the middle again this is just

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.330 
side into the middle again this is just
kicking<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.020> three<00:01:28.290> different<00:01:28.470> positions

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
kicking in three different positions

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.340 
kicking in three different positions
we've<00:01:29.790> got<00:01:29.939> asked<00:01:30.420> her<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> put<00:01:30.750> her<00:01:30.810> arms<00:01:31.200> at

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
we've got asked her to put her arms at

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.179 
we've got asked her to put her arms at
her<00:01:31.439> hips<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.799> or<00:01:34.799> she<00:01:35.040> can

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
her hips so that we can see or she can

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.270 
her hips so that we can see or she can
foot<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.700> focus<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.350> everything<00:01:37.350> from<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
foot really focus on everything from the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.069 
foot really focus on everything from the
back<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> head<00:01:39.000> down<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.689> her<00:01:39.780> toes<00:01:39.810> and

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
back of the head down to her toes and

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.609 
back of the head down to her toes and
creating<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.280> ideal<00:01:41.790> balance<00:01:42.659> around<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
creating the ideal balance around the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.300 
creating the ideal balance around the
force<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.070> she's<00:01:44.280> getting<00:01:44.460> from<00:01:44.790> her<00:01:44.909> feet

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.430 

now<00:01:49.909> we're<00:01:50.060> going<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.210> ever<00:01:50.659> do<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.140> again

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
now we're going to ever do that again

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.000 
now we're going to ever do that again
and<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:51.920> want<00:01:52.700> everybody<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.150> remember<00:01:53.330> that<00:01:54.010> we

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
and I want everybody to remember that we

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.910 
and I want everybody to remember that we
are<00:01:55.549> not<00:01:55.850> saying<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:56.810> these<00:01:57.170> are<00:01:57.409> positions

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
are not saying that these are positions

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.230 
are not saying that these are positions
that<00:01:58.009> we're<00:01:58.220> ever<00:01:58.369> going<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.610> be<00:01:58.790> in<00:01:58.820> in

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
that we're ever going to be in in

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.020 
that we're ever going to be in in
backstroke<00:02:00.049> I<00:02:00.460> don't<00:02:01.460> believe<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:01.729> we

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
backstroke I don't believe that we

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.760 
backstroke I don't believe that we
should<00:02:02.060> ever<00:02:02.360> be<00:02:02.540> completely<00:02:03.080> on<00:02:03.350> our<00:02:03.530> side

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
should ever be completely on our side

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.670 
should ever be completely on our side
kicking<00:02:04.190> side-to-side<00:02:05.050> nor<00:02:06.050> do<00:02:06.259> I<00:02:06.350> think<00:02:06.409> that

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
kicking side-to-side nor do I think that

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.430 
kicking side-to-side nor do I think that
we<00:02:06.860> will<00:02:07.159> ever<00:02:07.399> be<00:02:07.670> arms<00:02:08.450> by<00:02:08.690> our<00:02:08.899> side

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
we will ever be arms by our side

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.540 
we will ever be arms by our side
but<00:02:09.830> this<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.160> way<00:02:10.429> for<00:02:11.239> us<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.420> create

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
but this is a way for us to create

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.120 
but this is a way for us to create
balance<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.760> body<00:02:13.970> position<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:15.590> in

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
balance and body position in in

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.460 
balance and body position in in
isolation<00:02:16.819> from<00:02:17.239> other<00:02:17.569> parts<00:02:17.959> of<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.170> stroke

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
isolation from other parts of the stroke

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.320 
isolation from other parts of the stroke
let's<00:02:18.800> try<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.130> again

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.200 

and<00:02:26.420> each<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.380> these<00:02:27.500> positions<00:02:28.310> requires<00:02:29.060> a

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
and each of these positions requires a

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.330 
and each of these positions requires a
different<00:02:29.480> kind<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.960> balance<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.650> a

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
different kind of balance and a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.820 
different kind of balance and a
different<00:02:31.730> awareness<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.350> Kelsey<00:02:33.620> is

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
different awareness and so Kelsey is

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.920 
different awareness and so Kelsey is
making<00:02:34.160> some<00:02:34.430> really<00:02:35.090> good<00:02:35.210> subtle

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
making some really good subtle

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.130 
making some really good subtle
adjustments<00:02:36.560> through<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.460> whole<00:02:37.700> exercise

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
adjustments through this whole exercise

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.230 
adjustments through this whole exercise
to<00:02:39.140> balance<00:02:39.560> on<00:02:39.710> her<00:02:39.830> side<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.430> they<00:02:40.940> stay

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
to balance on her side and they stay

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.380 
to balance on her side and they stay
moving<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.840> straight<00:02:42.140> line<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:43.730> go<00:02:44.210> to<00:02:44.270> a

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
moving in a straight line to go to a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.240 
moving in a straight line to go to a
horizontal<00:02:44.720> position<00:02:45.110> stay<00:02:45.680> moving<00:02:45.920> in<00:02:46.190> a

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
horizontal position stay moving in a

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.960 
horizontal position stay moving in a
straight<00:02:46.310> line

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
straight line

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.690 
straight line
I<00:02:47.000> was<00:02:47.210> excellent
