00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 very good girls, athletic guys and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.100
 welcome to this video in which you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.540
 We are going to present a new section in 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.379
 the one that the taco force has a lot to 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.139
 tell 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.000
 I like the idea that good and 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.080
 You'll see how it takes us to see visits now 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.080
 start now the good starts 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.849
 as some of you already know I am a trainer 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.260
 staff and the truth is that I have a 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.189
 little time to be able to make the videos 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.289
 so I'm going to give it a try 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.690
 strong so you have your own section 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.250
 and it's practical tips on videos 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.540
 cortitos the problem is that the portal 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.920
 is a little lost because the poor one does not 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.270
 He has been able to study a lot but the truth 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.649
 who is very young and is trying 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.180
 learn but if people do not want 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.649
 learn the accept what you want is for 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.180
 the image that you want all the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.980
 visits the fashions come here 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.629
 to see the head that has porn 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.190
 they come to see me if what you see 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.840
 here just muscular with these I have 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.890
 no nonsense about the direct or anything 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.719
 people do not want to learn what 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.190
 you want to see me and out of all 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.750
 ways you already know that it messes up a lot 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.010
 and it says burradas but you can be 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.750
 calm because everything he says 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.520
 strength with this section will be of 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.240
 visas and you can have the security of 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.040
 that is true 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.770
 no burrada of those typical of the fort 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.370
 something like that is that you can not leave anything 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.900
 I got this mess because nothing taco 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.820
 let's start with the first strong 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.010
 I advise and you already know that they will be 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.440
 short tips and practical application 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.810
 so you know later so that nothing is 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.720
 nonsense let's put the pasqual mess 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.960
 all this I have to say the virgin 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.750
 Exactly with graphics and everything is everything 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.630
 very complicated I am attached to the institute 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:39.180
 the eggs the eggs 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.180
 for me that good as bad 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.409
 with the summary that you have to eat egg 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.710
 because it has a lot of proteins and 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.009
 yandel a biological value act is to say 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.110
 they are good good good good well 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.780
 which is right until the next portal 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.399
 advice friends for such a thing but not like that 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.840
 we do nothing the idea is that it is the 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.759
 whole advice because if not people are going 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.380
 to say so much for this but if this is 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.240
 a lot and this things to do it then 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.680
 He is here all day besides 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.810
 I have a dead cache and they do not pay me 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.340
 also in kind just beaten like me 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.560
 I also want tickets what happens that 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.030
 I was just debating with what we have 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.380
 come to an agreement you asked me hey 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.510
 you want to go out on the channel and have a 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.739
 own section but the agreement was that 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.570
 we had to adjust the 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.459
 content that you were given so if 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.170
 you want to have the section you know what 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.330
 you have to do because nothing was going 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.200
 again with the strong advise to see if 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.730
 this time it is already conditions and more for 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.989
 what we are discussing and all the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.000
 that we are in the world of iron 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.010
 Well, we know that the egg is very good 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.050
 It is very good because it has 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.360
 good proteins good one act value 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.980
 biological and this means then that 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.650
 has all the essential amino acids and 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.030
 also a perfect amounts 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.700
 therefore its consumption because it is going to 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.370
 benefit a lot when it comes to what 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.110
 our not the muscles now where I saw 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.340
 the problem the problem is that the 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.840
 movies have got us many 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.310
 little birds in the head 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.720
 for example when it came out and rocky more 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.549
 strong that the vinegar that was taken 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.500
 raw beech more saves and come and another and 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.390
 another there is crude without anything and now people 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.579
 He does the same, he takes the eggs and 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.019
 he messes with a sitting without cooking 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.989
 or nothing the eggs 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.760
 you have to cook them for many reasons 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.409
 ask very simple reason and is that if not 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.849
 we cook the eggs are digested many 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.319
 less protein and us what 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.790
 we want them to be by the proteins of 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.349
 the good ones according to the studies 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.879
 you can roughly say that 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.440
 when we cook an egg it 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.120
 they ran approximately 90 per 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.620
 cent to proteins and that when 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.359
 we cook the eggs and not 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.950
 we can be raw many people say that 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.269
 nothing is digested and so on but we 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.950
 we're really going to stick to the 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.150
 scientific bibliography where it has 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.439
 seen that when the eggs are eaten 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.359
 raw, they are only digested 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.099
 approximately 50% of those proteins 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.659
 which independently is not 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.609
 a good choice because when you can 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.040
 digest 90% of the proteins so that 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.930
 you're going to cut q2 if you're just going to digest the 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.400
 50 projects today we do not have this 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.410
 cook then when we 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.940
 we cook the egg we submit it 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.340
 processes 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.080
 and this heat is what denatures the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.460
 protein but denaturalize it 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.230
 it simply means the change to your 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.150
 structure but the amino acids that 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.130
 what we need are still 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.720
 there then denaturing this 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.730
 egg protein we do that already 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.890
 we are able to digest it perfectly 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.420
 the second reason why we 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.460
 the eggs with then raw is because 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.500
 they have a micronutrient a vitamin 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.330
 concrete that is biotin and obviously 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.440
 Biotin is therefore important for 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.209
 physiological processes 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.769
 But of course the same thing happens if we 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.480
 we cook the eggs the biotin not 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.560
 we will be able to absorb so it is another 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.750
 of the reasons why 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.400
 we need to cook the egg this is the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.590
 motive also quite important and it is 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.090
 to avoid food infections and 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.950
 you know the problems of Salmonella and 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.690
 others so if we cook it 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.490
 Well, those problems are not going to 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.840
 save and finally the fourth reason 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.580
 which for me is the most important of 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.260
 all and that is to see a milkshake with ten 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.030
 Raw eggs is worse than hitting a drink 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.350
 In a lye pot there are those who use 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.200
 judgments of everything to a raw egg that 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.910
 come out rotten so you already know the 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.280
 practical application so I advise you to 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.660
 today is that you cook the eggs you can 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.370
 do as you want you can do the 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.050
 iron you could fried them you can 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.729
 know you can go through water 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.439
 you can make the microwave as 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.059
 come out of the biceps the question is that at 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.159
 final the protein changes its structure and 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:04.289
 that you're going to see testing 95 are raw 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:06.240
 there it looks like the classe is like 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.979
 yellowish but when the minds at 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.020
 heat changes dryness and white and 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.460
 coagulated there is when we 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.719
 we can eat the egg protein 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.309
 well that tacos I hope that starting 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:15.900
 from now you are not plum well so 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:17.370
 least with whom is the egg is that there 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.020
 that take advantage of what he's baked 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.669
 for 6 buns throwing money all 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.139
 grams of protein is well reversed well 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.580
 that you already know if you liked it and first 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.960
 intervention only then you can give to the 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.400
 like and paste the things you are looking for 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.259
 Spanish girlfriend and that is stronger than 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.159
 the vinegar then you can leave us our 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.229
 phone number there are in the 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.939
 comments or your twitter and already 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.349
 puts little contact with you and already 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:35.909
 you know if you want more fruit tips 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.710
 then to subscribe the words already by 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.370
 tacos you know until then support is 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.370
 has returned that the vinegar
