said<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:51.989> easy<00:02:52.230> open<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:53.459> friction<00:02:53.700> fit<00:02:54.000> to

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
said it's easy open just friction fit to

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.210 
said it's easy open just friction fit to
close<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:55.019> can<00:02:55.109> always<00:02:55.319> get<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.620> panel

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
