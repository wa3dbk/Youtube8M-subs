netherrack so depending on how long you
get<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> nether<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.740> pretty<00:00:11.160> much<00:00:11.280> when

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
get to the nether is pretty much when

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.470 
get to the nether is pretty much when
you<00:00:11.580> can<00:00:11.730> build<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.000> thing<00:00:12.059> but<00:00:12.269> I'm<00:00:12.360> pretty

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
you can build this thing but I'm pretty

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.700 
you can build this thing but I'm pretty
sure<00:00:12.570> most<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.170> have<00:00:13.290> already<00:00:13.380> gone<00:00:13.650> to

going<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> take<00:01:29.040> out<00:01:29.130> two<00:01:29.310> blocks<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.729> this

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
going to take out two blocks like this

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.490 
going to take out two blocks like this
take<00:01:30.360> out<00:01:30.450> two<00:01:30.689> more<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.140> place<00:01:31.320> down

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
take out two more and then place down

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
take out two more and then place down
two<00:01:31.680> pieces<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.130> netherrack<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
two pieces of netherrack just like that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.789 
two pieces of netherrack just like that
and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.600> set<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.020> fire<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.590> flint

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
and then set it on fire with some flint

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.990 
and then set it on fire with some flint
and<00:01:34.890> steel<00:01:34.920> now<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.220> hardest<00:01:35.579> thing<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.759> get

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and steel now the hardest thing to get

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030 
and steel now the hardest thing to get
in<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.360> build<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.320> nether<00:01:37.530> act<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:37.920> you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
in this build is the nether act as you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.590 
in this build is the nether act as you
obviously<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> need<00:01:38.759> diamonds<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.479> get

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
obviously going to need diamonds to get

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.810 
obviously going to need diamonds to get
obsidian<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.530> make<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> nether<00:01:41.070> portal<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
obsidian to make the nether portal so it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.130 
obsidian to make the nether portal so it
kind<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.119> sounds<00:01:42.450> funny<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> nether

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
kind of sounds funny that the nether

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.840 
kind of sounds funny that the nether
rack<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.799> hardest<00:01:44.310> thing<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.640> for

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
rack is the hardest thing to get for

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.670 
rack is the hardest thing to get for

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
two blocks like that now I already built

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.999 
two blocks like that now I already built
my<00:01:57.630> secret<00:01:57.960> base<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.290> already<00:01:58.500> built<00:01:58.619> my<00:01:58.770> little

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
my secret base I already built my little

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.680 
a hundred percent sure that you won't
catch<00:02:15.980> on<00:02:16.160> fire<00:02:16.340> I've<00:02:16.819> never<00:02:17.209> caught<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.480> fire

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
catch on fire I've never caught on fire

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.330 
catch on fire I've never caught on fire
while<00:02:17.930> doing<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.230> but<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.680> think<00:02:18.800> water<00:02:19.160> is<00:02:19.310> a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
while doing this but I think water is a

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.520 
while doing this but I think water is a
good<00:02:19.519> precaution<00:02:20.060> just<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.930> case<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.319> catch

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
good precaution just in case you catch

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.110 
good precaution just in case you catch
on<00:02:21.739> fire<00:02:21.920> also<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.640> good<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.849> have<00:02:22.970> water

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
on fire also it's good to have water

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.089 
on fire also it's good to have water
there<00:02:23.300> too<00:02:23.480> depending<00:02:24.170> on<00:02:24.260> how<00:02:24.440> far<00:02:24.739> your<00:02:24.950> base

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
there too depending on how far your base

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.199 
there too depending on how far your base
is<00:02:25.280> gonna<00:02:25.340> go<00:02:25.550> down<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.849> can<00:02:25.940> make<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.150> thing

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
is gonna go down you can make this thing

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.699 
is gonna go down you can make this thing
like<00:02:26.450> 20<00:02:26.750> blocks<00:02:26.930> down<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.379> as<00:02:27.440> long<00:02:27.560> as<00:02:27.590> you

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
like 20 blocks down and as long as you

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.320 
like 20 blocks down and as long as you
have<00:02:27.800> water<00:02:27.980> there<00:02:28.250> you'll<00:02:28.700> be<00:02:28.760> fine<00:02:29.060> when<00:02:29.239> you

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
have water there you'll be fine when you

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.390

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
take the bowl you don't want to die and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.770 
take the bowl you don't want to die and
if<00:02:31.489> you're<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.640> PC<00:02:31.849> you<00:02:32.090> can<00:02:32.209> use<00:02:32.330> slime<00:02:32.569> block

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
if you're a PC you can use slime block

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.319 
don't have to be doing a fireplace so
what<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.620> did<00:02:42.799> for<00:02:43.069> my<00:02:43.250> fireplace<00:02:43.549> is<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.269> just

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
what I did for my fireplace is I just

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.640 
what I did for my fireplace is I just
went<00:02:44.569> ahead<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.750> put<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.989> block<00:02:45.260> like<00:02:45.470> this

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
went ahead and put a block like this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.530 
went ahead and put a block like this
with<00:02:46.010> brick<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.459> block<00:02:46.700> like<00:02:46.880> this<00:02:46.910> brick<00:02:47.329> and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
with brick a block like this brick and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.850 
with brick a block like this brick and
then<00:02:47.720> right<00:02:47.900> here<00:02:48.019> we're<00:02:48.140> gonna<00:02:48.200> use<00:02:48.410> half

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
then right here we're gonna use half

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.380 
then right here we're gonna use half
slabs<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.340> have<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:49.640> use<00:02:49.760> half<00:02:49.970> slabs<00:02:50.209> because

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
slabs you have to use half slabs because

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.030 
slabs you have to use half slabs because
they're<00:02:50.510> transparent<00:02:50.930> blocks<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:51.799> when<00:02:51.950> you

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
they're transparent blocks so when you

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.650 
they're transparent blocks so when you
go<00:02:52.190> through<00:02:52.459> them<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.849> will<00:02:53.030> not<00:02:53.180> take<00:02:53.450> any

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660
