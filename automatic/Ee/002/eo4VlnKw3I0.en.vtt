for<00:00:57.510> around<00:00:57.660> 700<00:00:58.320> k<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> most

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
for around 700 k I think not the most

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
for around 700 k I think not the most
expensive<00:00:59.640> player<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.629> still<00:01:00.809> think<00:01:01.020> he

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
expensive player but I still think he

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.049 
expensive player but I still think he
could<00:01:01.260> cost<00:01:01.469> quite<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.859> lot<00:01:02.100> he<00:01:02.489> drops<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
could cost quite a lot he drops of it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.119 
could cost quite a lot he drops of it
and<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.719> he'll<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.379> sure<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.799> quality

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and I'm he'll be sure to be quality

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.920

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
the heist but I think he'll have that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.680 
the heist but I think he'll have that
because<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.520> just<00:02:32.700> go<00:02:32.880> on<00:02:33.000> youtube<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.450> search

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
because it just go on youtube and search

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.830 
because it just go on youtube and search
Roberto<00:02:34.080> Carlos<00:02:34.350> free-kick<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.840> he's

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
Roberto Carlos free-kick and he's

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.780 
Roberto Carlos free-kick and he's
absolutely<00:02:37.250> ridiculous<00:02:38.250> he<00:02:38.430> should<00:02:38.640> be<00:02:38.760> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
absolutely ridiculous he should be a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.160 
absolutely ridiculous he should be a
legend<00:02:39.180> he's<00:02:39.300> only<00:02:39.450> recently<00:02:39.870> retired

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
legend he's only recently retired

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.290 
legend he's only recently retired
actually<00:02:40.680> but<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.459> still<00:02:41.640> think<00:02:41.880> he<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.150> make<00:02:42.240> a

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
actually but I still think he can make a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.600 
actually but I still think he can make a
legend<00:02:42.690> spot<00:02:43.020> same<00:02:43.530> with<00:02:43.709> ronaldinho<00:02:44.310> when<00:02:44.459> he

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
legend spot same with ronaldinho when he

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.640 
legend spot same with ronaldinho when he
retires<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:45.270> we<00:02:45.870> might<00:02:46.020> cover<00:02:46.260> him<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.560> a
