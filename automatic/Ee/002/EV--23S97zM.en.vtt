00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.660
 shoot down a man in broad daylight in the middle of 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.150
 town with open face at close range 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.750
 it's an image we can not 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.150
 erase and you really have to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.949
 be determined to change things of this 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 world saying it will not exist anymore 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.189
 never but all that makes sense only if 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.320
 we have a political project ie 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.150
 what to do with resistance requires 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.150
 of politically thinking the situation 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.330
 in 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.700
 still today I often refer 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.250
 on the agenda of the National Council of 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.020
 resistance 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.870
 this program written in the 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.860
 hiding structure still state 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.750
 social as we know it we 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.120
 he owes pay-as-you-go pensions 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.950
 the nationalization of energy the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.140
 social security committees 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.440
 corporate freedom of the press and 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.440
 caetera 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.880
 unfortunately this beautiful story did 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.560
 not been told and it's more than 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.560
 never the moment to tell it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.909
 the reforms that were made during 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.640
 these two years there is reforms 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.650
 which conditioned the life of France 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.159
 for a long time they were persuaded 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.520
 all that would be useful for something 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.810
 yes you had to be idealistic you had to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.810
 even be utopian 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.330
 and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.400
 this dream comes to us why not the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.990
 say from the national council of the 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.030
 resistance national council of the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.180
 resistance of the National Council of 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.180
 resistance 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.980
 what it inspires you 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.499
 what are we doing then 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:11.780
 hello a man said thank you morrison 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:11.780

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.580
 and for us the past resistance and 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 the arrest this future is a logic 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.000
 of continuity 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.410
