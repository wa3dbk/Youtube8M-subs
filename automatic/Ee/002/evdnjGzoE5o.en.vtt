00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
berries since I have a little bit of a

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.390 
berries since I have a little bit of a
very<00:03:05.989> thin<00:03:06.290> bar<00:03:06.530> on<00:03:06.709> here<00:03:06.890> when<00:03:07.040> it's<00:03:07.160> going<00:03:07.340> to

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
very thin bar on here when it's going to

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.910

top it off with some goji berries and
what<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.150> does<00:03:11.420> is<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.530> gets<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:12.860> little

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
what that does is that gets a little

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.590 
what that does is that gets a little
chewy<00:03:13.310> texture<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.120> if<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:14.270> you<00:03:14.360> don't<00:03:14.540> just

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
chewy texture and if so you don't just

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.449 
chewy texture and if so you don't just
chug<00:03:15.050> it<00:03:15.080> down<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.560> have<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.800> kind<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.040> chew<00:03:16.310> it

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
chug it down you have to kind of chew it

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.250 
chug it down you have to kind of chew it
and<00:03:16.670> that's<00:03:17.300> good<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.630> makes<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.900> more<00:03:18.080> of<00:03:18.140> a

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
and that's good it makes it more of a

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.710 
and that's good it makes it more of a
meal<00:03:18.500> versus<00:03:19.190> just<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.459> liquid<00:03:19.670> drink<00:03:20.090> there

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
meal versus just a liquid drink there

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.800 
meal versus just a liquid drink there
you<00:03:20.900> go<00:03:21.080> that's<00:03:21.590> how<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.010> make<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.239> high

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810
