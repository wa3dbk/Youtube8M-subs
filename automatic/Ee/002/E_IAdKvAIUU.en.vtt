aircraft<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.170> I've<00:00:13.259> built<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:14.280> one<00:00:14.490> was

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
aircraft that I've built this one was

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.330 
aircraft that I've built this one was
designed<00:00:15.480> by<00:00:15.750> mr.<00:00:15.900> Jasper<00:00:16.470> Bixler<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.220> is

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
designed by mr. Jasper Bixler this is

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.390 
designed by mr. Jasper Bixler this is
the<00:00:17.490> ft<00:00:18.119> Versa<00:00:18.390> wing<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:19.650> see<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.920> built<00:00:20.220> this

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the ft Versa wing you see I built this

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.390 
the ft Versa wing you see I built this
thing<00:00:20.460> as<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> pusher<00:00:21.859> this<00:00:22.859> one<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.100> scratch

thing as a pusher this one I scratch

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.790 
thing as a pusher this one I scratch
built<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:23.939> plot<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.720> out<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.199> PDF<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.740> the

I<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.559> 1,800<00:01:04.559> milliamp<00:01:05.159> hour<00:01:05.750> three<00:01:06.750> cell

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
I got a 1,800 milliamp hour three cell

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.130 
I got a 1,800 milliamp hour three cell
lipo<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:08.190> still<00:01:09.020> balances<00:01:10.020> out

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
lipo in here it still balances out

pretty<00:01:10.350> well<00:01:10.850> maybe<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.940> little<00:01:12.479> tail-heavy<00:01:13.110> at

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
pretty well maybe a little tail-heavy at

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
pretty well maybe a little tail-heavy at
the<00:01:13.619> moment<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> think<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.270> was

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the moment you know I think that was

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.320 
the moment you know I think that was
just<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.659> mantle<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> I've<00:01:17.850> never<00:01:18.030> flown<00:01:18.270> a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
just a mantle good so I've never flown a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.770 
just a mantle good so I've never flown a
delta<00:01:18.690> wing<00:01:18.840> before<00:01:20.180> haven't<00:01:21.180> tested<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.630> at

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
delta wing before haven't tested this at

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.510 
delta wing before haven't tested this at
all<00:01:21.930> we're<00:01:22.590> about<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.830> do<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> maiden<00:01:23.310> flight

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
all we're about to do the maiden flight

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.719 
all we're about to do the maiden flight
of<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.740> trying<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.920> laugh<00:01:26.070> too<00:01:26.280> much<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
of this so trying to laugh too much if I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:52.580 
of this so trying to laugh too much if I
screw<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.060> off

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.450 

so<00:01:53.130> far<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.549> good<00:01:53.580> its<00:01:53.970> handling<00:01:54.930> pretty<00:01:55.170> well

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
so far so good its handling pretty well

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.469 
so far so good its handling pretty well
it<00:01:56.460> feels<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.820> little<00:01:56.940> little<00:01:57.510> heavy<00:01:59.390> it's<00:02:00.390> not

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
it feels a little little heavy it's not

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
it feels a little little heavy it's not
quite<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.110> fast<00:02:01.140> as<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> Spitfire<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> don't

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
quite as fast as the Spitfire I don't

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.770 
quite as fast as the Spitfire I don't
think<00:02:03.170> but<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.799> far<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.250> super<00:02:06.210> impressed<00:02:06.540> for

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
think but so far it super impressed for

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.490 
think but so far it super impressed for
a<00:02:06.810> maiden<00:02:07.140> collided<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.830> trims<00:02:08.069> out<00:02:08.250> well<00:02:08.490> it's

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
a maiden collided it trims out well it's

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.180 
a maiden collided it trims out well it's
moving<00:02:10.500> pretty<00:02:10.649> good<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:13.830> not<00:02:13.980> really

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
moving pretty good and it's not really

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.610
