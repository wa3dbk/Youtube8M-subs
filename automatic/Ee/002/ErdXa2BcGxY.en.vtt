00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
at all time these things are gonna grow

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.999 
at all time these things are gonna grow
like<00:01:34.290> crazy<00:01:34.320> um<00:01:35.150> at<00:01:36.150> first<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:37.439> seeds<00:01:37.710> don't

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
like crazy um at first the seeds don't

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.370 
like crazy um at first the seeds don't
start<00:01:38.460> growing<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.060> fast<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:40.020> soon<00:01:40.259> as

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
start growing that fast but as soon as

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.090 
start growing that fast but as soon as
they<00:01:40.560> sprout<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.549> will<00:01:41.759> go<00:01:41.909> flying<00:01:42.470> with<00:01:43.470> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
they sprout they will go flying with you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.160 
they sprout they will go flying with you
know<00:01:44.220> green<00:01:44.640> growth<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.420> you'll<00:01:45.899> get

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
know green growth and you'll get

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.359 
know green growth and you'll get
probably<00:01:46.649> about<00:01:46.770> an<00:01:46.950> inch<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.310> day<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.640> these<00:01:47.990> I

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369

probably about an inch a day on these I
really<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.520> enjoying<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.720> growth<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.140> these

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
really like enjoying the growth on these

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.600 
really like enjoying the growth on these
because<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.649> look<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:52.950> freshly<00:01:53.250> cut<00:01:53.579> grass

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
