00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.430
 the budget compact camera from too heavy 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.809
 nowadays photographing 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.160
 with his smartphone and then it is not 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.400
 strange that you no longer have his device 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.869
 do not buy too much can cost over yet 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.390
 bring manufacturers one more year 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.130
 closed the budget come out packages and 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.859
 knowing happily participates 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.830
 this is the canonpowershot fourteen hundred 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.089
 price is still 100 euros 100 euros 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.039
 of course not very much of one 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.480
 compact camera and you immediately notice that 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.880
 because this canon power shot 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.740
 fourteen hundred is very basic 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.230
 5 you get a wide-angle lens that season 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.110
 of 28 millimeters and in films and so hd 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.940
 not full d-cup there is photo shoot 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.100
 you using the as d screen 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.570
 but it also has an optical viewfinder 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.100
 you don't often see in compact cameras anymore 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.290
 but just know it in this 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.490
 stopped so you can just as well 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.290
 to photograph 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.360
 what nuances or that it really is one 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.040
 optical viewfinder so he is no additional 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.730
 for example, how many photos 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.950
 you can still shoot 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.090
 you can do that via the LCD screen 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.950
 screens only not of very good ones 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.940
 quality as you can see but 100 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.830
 euro should not be too sour 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.530
 of course, although the canon powershot to 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.600
 1400 team budget model eye that still 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.040
 pretty nice has a bit of one 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.320
 thickening on the side for you well 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.680
 can photograph and that's because that 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.240
 namely on late with 2 batteries 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.920
 Instead of the normal battery 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.360
 of course for and a disadvantage advantage 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.740
 is that you are always new everywhere and always 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.909
 can purchase a battery 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.770
 it is now that you have to do that 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.570
 and that of course costs extra money 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.890
 tip just get in rechargeable battery 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.780
 what a fuss 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.730
 photography is therefore very easy 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.020
 this canon power shot to fourteen hundred 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.300
 and if you really don't know then it is 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.159
 another special question mark that lies 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.810
 practically everything you know me on 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.100
 the field of photography 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.440
 then look at the image quality then 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.940
 stands out for a camera of 100 euros 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.860
 this pound to fourteen hundred real 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.320
 he performs remarkably well 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.030
 vibrant colors and you can even have one 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.380
 little play with some depth of field 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.880
 now ours is that you don't and 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.830
 evening hours because then it is already 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.030
 look a little less quickly and can 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.670
 of course also 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.040
 nicely filming this device and it does 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.259
 he in 720p 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.420
 so and not full hd and very unfortunate 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.280
 it is that you are not capable of zooming 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.569
 only digital so now it is rico 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.730
 a bit grainy 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.010
 hello rico you can photograph up to one 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.630
 ISO of 1600 that results 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.920
 clear fleece happiness in detail 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.350
 direction of course also and flash 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.690
 a pity is that he dismissed a 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.100
 little awkward place you sit 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.480
 quickly with your fingers 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.100
 handy additions are the creative ones 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.390
 filters that you will not easily find the camera 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.040
 from around 100 euros 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.510
 he for example a toy effect or 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.260
 miniature mode is a fun to use 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.739
 play 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.739
 by effect 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.410
 fun and actually made creative 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.880
 filters this room the money equals me 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.920
 with you worth the combination between the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.019
 image quality the creative filters and 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.180
 the handy optical viewfinder make this 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.680
 camera quite complete and so I can not 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.049
 all then conclude that you are just 4 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.370
 stars and a buy you get and you are 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.080
 Well looking for a camera of about 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.250
 100 euros then I think this is the ultimate 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.569
 fashion model 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.980
 because he actually has everything alone 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.100
 that is a bit of a yarn film function 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.100
 Unfortunately
