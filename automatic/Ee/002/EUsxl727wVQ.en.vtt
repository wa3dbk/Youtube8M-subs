00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:11.580
 2012 big question 6 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:14.950
 As shown in the figure below, the function is 2.4 ab on the graph on the = =-- each x 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:20.500
 Coordinates are negative and one 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:23.460
 Pattern 2 point c 0 and No. d 0 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.880
 Answer the following questions at this time 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.520
 And 5th place 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.480
 Find coordinates for swimming 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.450
 to say that a coordinate 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.780
 I'll answer to this kind of Fu 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:42.600
 At the left side of the qualification was x- 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.600
 Qualification on the right is wide coordinates 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.540
 From the problem a is a graph 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.540
 My dozen brother you can see the x-coordinate 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.610
 Because 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:01.200
 I will write that it is good to visit here 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.740
 Because here is not written but is Inan continue 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.280
 I do not know the file ä¿µ 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.280
 Point here 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.510
 Substituting numbers into function expressions 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.150
 Another one comes out 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.060
 Here say a function is 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.800
 Is more than = dx 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:28.270
 If you 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:34.290
 Is that this -2 nerd populated than = 2x 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:36.540
 The calculated results in the -4 or more multiplying Iwanyi is so calculated to 8 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.909
 Here is the case 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.790
 It becomes coordinates 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:47.600
 Previous Hatena here also those of the graph in the fact that the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.600
 Will win 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.240
 The answer is 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.240
 Rock x was distorted to minus 8 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.960
 About questions 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:08.740
 Function -2 with the transfer of ex weapons of books more than minus 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:13.720
 Get 5 weapons from the city 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.980
 x- weapons - 251 of whether 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.980
 Range of this enemy 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:25.600
 5Speech is wide maximum and wide minimum 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.600
 Is that considered 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.250
 At first we think using graph 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.230
 x is up to -2 / college 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.270
 Because it moves 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.220
 From management 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.650
 It will be up to b 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:48.319
 Such feeling 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:51.050
 Think of the love of the time a 10 b and so on silk y considering the range of green 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.920
 I 'm fine Weiner 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:03:00.280
 When x is 0, it passes through the origin 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:03.240
 Y has grown a little further and so has y written along here 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.020
 And the top is the maximum 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:11.880
 Since most the origin is the first 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.450
 When the enemy of x sickle threat sword is the calculation in that the maximum 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.990
 by is 8 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.480
 The calculation is done at the time when Bex is 0 at first 0 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.120
 Therefore 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.120
 If the answer is 0 or more or 8 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.390
 Come on this issue at this time how 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.390
 I think there are people who don't feel comfortable . I often use graphs at schools. 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.940
 but 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.430
 How to solve using a table for those who are not comfortable 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.520
 I will explain 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:55.010
 I will write a table like this 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:57.780
 in the table because the x- weapons has is less than 1 or more to minus 2-2 1 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.370
 01 and wrote I'll 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.860
 Let's calculate each 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.510
 So if your brother is an 8- for each abnormal 8 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.620
 Yee has a -12 impression of his brother's household budget 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.070
 Brother x 02 or more at 0 x 50 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.620
 x is please you have or put brother when the 1 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:23.630
 To above the 2 Khatri 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.860
 8 means maximum 0 first 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.380
 The answer is the same as before 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:37.100
 Y will have a long eight to zero 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:39.030
 It does not matter in either graph table so as to dissolve in the way of easy to understand who he likes 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.540
 Let's get up 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:50.990
 Here are some people who often write like this, but this is a large number on the left side 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:56.350
 Please wait not to use too much because it is uncomfortable 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.350
 It was commentary up to the question of big question 6
