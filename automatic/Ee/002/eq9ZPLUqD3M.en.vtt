00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
way is to cut the first board of row to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.840 
way is to cut the first board of row to
2/3<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.050> length<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.590> full<00:03:11.890> board<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:12.760> like

2/3 the length of a full board just like
this<00:03:15.750> now<00:03:16.750> we<00:03:16.810> can<00:03:17.080> lay<00:03:17.230> this<00:03:17.380> piece<00:03:17.440> down

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
this now we can lay this piece down

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.520 
this now we can lay this piece down
insert<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.390> tongue<00:03:19.630> into<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.990> groove<00:03:20.230> at<00:03:20.410> an
