00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
called GI Joe a Real American Hero but

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.960 
called GI Joe a Real American Hero but
it'd<00:04:13.500> be<00:04:13.530> nice<00:04:13.770> if<00:04:13.830> they<00:04:14.100> kept<00:04:14.340> them<00:04:14.490> American

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.090 
it'd be nice if they kept them American
like<00:04:15.510> they<00:04:15.690> were<00:04:15.750> in<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.560> comics<00:04:16.920> in<00:04:17.010> the

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
like they were in the comics in the

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.220 
like they were in the comics in the
cartoon<00:04:17.430> series<00:04:17.640> I<00:04:17.970> mean<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.630> is<00:04:18.870> kind<00:04:19.170> of

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
cartoon series I mean that is kind of

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.450 
cartoon series I mean that is kind of
the<00:04:19.290> premise<00:04:19.710> of<00:04:19.830> this<00:04:19.980> series<00:04:22.190> so<00:04:23.190> that

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
the premise of this series so that

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.640 
the premise of this series so that
really<00:04:23.760> annoys<00:04:24.030> me<00:04:24.360> maybe<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:25.230> shouldn't<00:04:25.560> but

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
really annoys me maybe it shouldn't but

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.330 
really annoys me maybe it shouldn't but
it<00:04:25.770> does

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
it does

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.770 
it does
and<00:04:28.340> no<00:04:28.550> one<00:04:28.730> has<00:04:28.850> a<00:04:28.880> problem<00:04:29.210> with<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.600> that's

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
and no one has a problem with it that's

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.670 
and no one has a problem with it that's
the<00:04:29.900> other<00:04:30.020> thing<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.200> bugs<00:04:30.440> me<00:04:30.530> is<00:04:30.650> that

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
the other thing that bugs me is that

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.590 
the other thing that bugs me is that

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.630 
know why no one else is up in arms about
this<00:04:50.030> but<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:50.300> am<00:04:50.450> it<00:04:51.350> really<00:04:51.920> kind<00:04:52.100> of<00:04:52.220> offends

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
this but I am it really kind of offends

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.370 
this but I am it really kind of offends
me<00:04:53.290> maybe<00:04:54.290> it<00:04:54.440> shouldn't<00:04:54.770> but<00:04:54.830> it<00:04:54.950> does<00:04:56.200> but<00:04:57.200> it

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
me maybe it shouldn't but it does but it

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.740 
me maybe it shouldn't but it does but it
looks<00:04:57.620> like<00:04:57.860> if<00:04:58.180> nothing<00:04:59.180> else<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.540> movie

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
looks like if nothing else the movie

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.020 
looks like if nothing else the movie
will<00:04:59.870> be<00:04:59.900> entertaining<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:00.740> I<00:05:01.310> think<00:05:01.670> because

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
will be entertaining and I think because

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.540 
will be entertaining and I think because
I<00:05:02.060> have<00:05:02.360> much<00:05:02.840> less<00:05:03.260> knowledge<00:05:03.620> of<00:05:03.740> GI<00:05:03.950> joe<00:05:04.250> i

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
I have much less knowledge of GI joe i

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.780

do have transformers i'll probably be

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.360

it's really not the kind of movie I
generally<00:05:49.310> like<00:05:50.150> I<00:05:50.420> don't<00:05:51.020> really<00:05:51.260> go<00:05:51.410> for<00:05:51.710> the
