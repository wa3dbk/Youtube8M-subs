00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.860
 But after all 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.440

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:15.010

 It is necessary to cross bone vertically, though. 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.090
 It would be nice if the other party was not glorious, but it would be strange if I could use it as the other party 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.760
