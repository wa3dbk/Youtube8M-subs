didn't go in they got two golds at the

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.219 
didn't go in they got two golds at the
other<00:06:37.300> end<00:06:37.389> it<00:06:37.509> was<00:06:37.599> the<00:06:37.690> Panthers<00:06:38.080> that

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
other end it was the Panthers that

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.930 
other end it was the Panthers that
bounced<00:06:38.409> back<00:06:38.620> from<00:06:38.680> that<00:06:38.860> duck<00:06:39.159> asleep<00:06:39.460> yeah

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
bounced back from that duck asleep yeah

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.059 
bounced back from that duck asleep yeah
yeah<00:06:40.150> yeah<00:06:40.479> that's<00:06:40.719> shows<00:06:41.710> a<00:06:41.740> lot<00:06:42.039> of

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
yeah yeah that's shows a lot of

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.910 
yeah yeah that's shows a lot of
character<00:06:42.310> from<00:06:43.090> from<00:06:43.810> us

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:45.920 
character from from us

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.750 
character from from us
to<00:06:46.160> get<00:06:46.310> back<00:06:46.520> and<00:06:46.790> I<00:06:47.680> think<00:06:48.680> that<00:06:49.100> we<00:06:49.340> followed

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 
to get back and I think that we followed

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.990 
to get back and I think that we followed
our<00:06:49.820> game<00:06:50.060> plan<00:06:50.680> until<00:06:51.680> until<00:06:52.160> the<00:06:52.220> end<00:06:52.460> that

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
our game plan until until the end that

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.200 
our game plan until until the end that
that's<00:06:53.660> why<00:06:53.960> we<00:06:53.990> were<00:06:54.290> able<00:06:55.250> to<00:06:55.460> get<00:06:55.670> come<00:06:56.030> back

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
that's why we were able to get come back

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.330 
that's why we were able to get come back
and<00:06:56.810> then<00:06:56.960> to<00:06:57.290> great<00:06:57.530> goals<00:06:57.770> at<00:06:57.950> the<00:06:58.040> end<00:06:58.070> one

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340
