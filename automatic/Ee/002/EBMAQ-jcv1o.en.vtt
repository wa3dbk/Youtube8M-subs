the right so I want my arm to go spin

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.120 
the right so I want my arm to go spin
left<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:57.000> together<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.560> want<00:01:59.800> to<00:01:59.860> spin<00:02:00.009> them

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
left so together you want to spin them

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.600 
left so together you want to spin them
like<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.850> have<00:02:01.090> each<00:02:01.420> point<00:02:02.280> meet<00:02:03.280> kind

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
like this and have each point meet kind

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.580 
like this and have each point meet kind
of<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.819> middle<00:02:04.090> right<00:02:04.450> there<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.890> then

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
of the middle right there and then

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.919 
of the middle right there and then
they'll<00:02:06.890> right<00:02:07.100> here<00:02:07.429> did<00:02:08.360> have<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:08.569> spin<00:02:08.899> a

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
they'll right here did have a spin a

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.490 
they'll right here did have a spin a
little<00:02:09.019> bit<00:02:09.349> been<00:02:10.280> up<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:12.110> out<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.440> other

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
little bit been up and out the other

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.410 
little bit been up and out the other
direction<00:02:12.769> then<00:02:13.730> back<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.180> your<00:02:14.330> original

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
direction then back to your original

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.570 
direction then back to your original
position<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:16.390> just<00:02:17.390> keep<00:02:17.599> doing<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.580> you

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
position and just keep doing that you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.119 
position and just keep doing that you
know<00:02:19.730> until<00:02:20.269> you're<00:02:20.390> comfortable<00:02:20.569> with<00:02:21.140> each

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
know until you're comfortable with each

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:30.020 
know until you're comfortable with each
position<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.170> timing

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.970 

so<00:02:30.690> once<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.290> get<00:02:31.350> comfortable<00:02:31.440> doing<00:02:31.890> that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
so once you get comfortable doing that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.290 
so once you get comfortable doing that
then<00:02:32.640> just<00:02:33.150> do<00:02:34.110> one<00:02:34.530> beat<00:02:34.830> or<00:02:35.250> one<00:02:35.610> pedal<00:02:35.910> in

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
then just do one beat or one pedal in

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.620 
then just do one beat or one pedal in
each<00:02:37.020> position<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:38.550> it'll<00:02:39.150> end<00:02:39.420> up<00:02:39.569> looking

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
each position so it'll end up looking

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:55.930 
each position so it'll end up looking
like<00:02:39.990> this

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.450 

and<00:02:56.300> that's<00:02:56.810> pretty<00:02:57.020> much<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.650> split<00:02:58.220> time

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
and that's pretty much it a split time

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.070 
and that's pretty much it a split time
butterfly<00:02:59.860> wall<00:03:00.860> plane<00:03:01.750> can't<00:03:02.750> touch<00:03:02.900> the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
butterfly wall plane can't touch the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.290 
butterfly wall plane can't touch the
flower
