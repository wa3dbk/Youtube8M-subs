it's<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.289> going<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> be<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.710> frame<00:00:31.949> of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
it's this just going to be the frame of

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.069 
it's this just going to be the frame of
my<00:00:32.279> car<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.940> need<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.120> use<00:00:33.360> anything<00:00:33.690> really

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
my car we need to use anything really

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.979 
my car we need to use anything really
for<00:00:34.380> frame<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.040> but<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:39.059> most<00:00:39.540> important

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
for frame of it but the most important

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.660 
for frame of it but the most important
part<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> wheels<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> thrusters<00:00:41.340> so

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
part is the wheels on the thrusters so

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.049 
part is the wheels on the thrusters so
to<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:41.969> started<00:00:42.379> wheels<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.739> um<00:00:46.760> any<00:00:47.760> wheel

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
to get started wheels here um any wheel

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.500 
to get started wheels here um any wheel
you<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:49.050> okay<00:00:49.920> what<00:00:50.730> um<00:00:51.059> what<00:00:51.390> I

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
buttons you want to control the wheels

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.099 
buttons you want to control the wheels
so<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.760> put<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> arrow<00:00:57.329> keys<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.690> that's<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
so I put the arrow keys and that's the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:14.780 
so I put the arrow keys and that's the
easiest<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> control<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.760> yeah<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.979> by<00:01:14.490> default

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
easiest to control so yeah so by default

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.120 
easiest to control so yeah so by default
if<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> left<00:01:16.290> side<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.650> car<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
if it's on the left side of the car and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.890 
if it's on the left side of the car and
just<00:01:17.310> spinning<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> wrong<00:01:17.850> way<00:01:18.150> okay<00:01:18.659> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
just spinning the wrong way okay you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.740 
just spinning the wrong way okay you
have<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.110> go<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.740> press<00:01:19.979> E<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
have to go to it and press E and then it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.890 
have to go to it and press E and then it
spins<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.409> way<00:01:26.150> but<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> right

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
spins the right way but on the right

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.850 
spins the right way but on the right
side<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.470> it

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
side of it

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:38.569 
side of it
it'll<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:31.460> on<00:01:32.460> step<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:38.369> we

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
it'll to be right on step you see we

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.440 
it'll to be right on step you see we
have<00:01:38.729> working<00:01:39.140> card<00:01:40.140> base<00:01:40.490> accepted<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.270> now

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
have working card base accepted so now

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.350 
have working card base accepted so now
what<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.840> want<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:45.259> Frosty's<00:01:46.290> then<00:01:47.360> it's

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
what we want to do Frosty's then it's

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.780 
what we want to do Frosty's then it's
kind<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.600> weird<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.170> got<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:49.979> figure<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.340> how

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
kind of weird but got to figure out how

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.730 
kind of weird but got to figure out how
it<00:01:51.000> works<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.880> want<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.240> push<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
it works like so you want to push it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.859 
it works like so you want to push it
left<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.610> left<00:01:57.060> arrow<00:01:57.299> needs<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.719> push

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
left then the left arrow needs to push

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.149 
left then the left arrow needs to push
it<00:01:58.020> forwards<00:01:58.469> but<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.920> place<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it forwards but you have to place the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.690 
it forwards but you have to place the
right<00:02:00.079> thruster<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.259> right<00:02:01.469> side<00:02:01.829> just

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
right thruster on the right side just

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.800 
right thruster on the right side just
kind<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:02.939> confusing<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.570> way<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:06.259> yeah

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:21.500 

and<00:02:11.880> stick<00:02:12.880> around

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.330 

okay<00:02:23.280> fine<00:02:24.280> freezes<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.540> drag<00:02:25.840> around

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
okay fine freezes a drag around

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.540 
okay fine freezes a drag around
okay

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
okay

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.790 
okay
see<00:02:28.030> these<00:02:28.330> thrusters<00:02:28.630> have<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.140> bit<00:02:29.470> too<00:02:29.620> much

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
see these thrusters have a bit too much

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.840 
see these thrusters have a bit too much
power<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:31.800> we're<00:02:32.800> just<00:02:32.980> going<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.340> undo<00:02:34.030> long

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
power so we're just going to undo long

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:47.490 
power so we're just going to undo long
lease<00:02:41.160> those<00:02:42.160> luck<00:02:44.040> I'm<00:02:45.040> stuck<00:02:46.200> okay<00:02:47.200> then<00:02:47.410> I

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
lease those luck I'm stuck okay then I

00:02:47.500 --> 00:03:03.870 
lease those luck I'm stuck okay then I
switch<00:02:47.950> these<00:02:48.220> around<00:02:51.300> then<00:03:02.130> it's<00:03:03.130> still

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
switch these around then it's still

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.400 
switch these around then it's still
going<00:03:04.360> around<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.810> crazy<00:03:05.140> but<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.820> idea<00:03:07.410> and
