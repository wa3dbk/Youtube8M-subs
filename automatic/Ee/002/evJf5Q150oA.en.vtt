cool<00:01:37.009> I<00:01:37.280> don't<00:01:37.459> know<00:01:37.550> why<00:01:37.700> people<00:01:38.179> do<00:01:38.300> it

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
cool I don't know why people do it

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.150 
cool I don't know why people do it
so<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:40.420> just<00:01:41.420> think<00:01:41.630> it's<00:01:41.929> important<00:01:42.500> that<00:01:42.560> they

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
so I just think it's important that they

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.950 
so I just think it's important that they
have<00:01:43.459> zero<00:01:43.789> tolerance<00:01:44.030> for<00:01:44.450> bullying

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
have zero tolerance for bullying

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.870 
have zero tolerance for bullying
