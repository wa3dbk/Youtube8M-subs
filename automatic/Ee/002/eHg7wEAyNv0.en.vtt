00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
at that time and you feel like that was

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.680 
at that time and you feel like that was
your<00:00:44.430> opportunity<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.000> really<00:00:45.180> energize<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
your opportunity to really energize the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.540 
your opportunity to really energize the
Coliseum<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.320> your<00:00:46.440> teammates<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:47.010> took<00:00:47.460> it

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
Coliseum and your teammates just took it

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.680 
Coliseum and your teammates just took it
from<00:00:47.640> there<00:00:47.730> yeah<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.239> mean<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:48.420> such<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
from there yeah I mean it's such a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.959 
from there yeah I mean it's such a
game-changing<00:00:49.559> play<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.489> felt<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.760> after

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
game-changing play and I felt like after

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.209 
game-changing play and I felt like after
that<00:00:51.300> play<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.960> momentum<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.469> completely<00:00:53.100> on

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that play the momentum was completely on

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.529

our side and you know they were

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.330 
our side and you know they were
devastated<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.980> know<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.190> had<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
devastated because you know they had a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.069 
devastated because you know they had a
defensive<00:00:56.850> stop<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.719> thought<00:00:57.899> they
