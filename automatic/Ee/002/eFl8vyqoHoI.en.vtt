formula on this is fantastic like I said
and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.320> think<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.650> about<00:00:31.740> every<00:00:32.009> video<00:00:32.160> I've

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and I think just about every video I've

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.459 
and I think just about every video I've
done<00:00:32.430> with<00:00:33.360> glam<00:00:33.630> polish<00:00:34.050> I'm<00:00:34.200> never

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850 
disappointed with the formulas they're
always<00:00:36.000> super<00:00:36.329> smooth<00:00:36.809> super<00:00:36.989> easy<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.649> apply

see<00:01:16.420> through<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.810> nail<00:01:16.930> line<00:01:17.170> I<00:01:17.200> can<00:01:17.500> see

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
see through the nail line I can see

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.800 
see through the nail line I can see
where<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.860> color<00:01:18.070> is<00:01:18.190> sheer<00:01:18.729> so<00:01:19.540> it's<00:01:19.659> gonna

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
where the color is sheer so it's gonna

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.960 
where the color is sheer so it's gonna
need<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.680> formula<00:01:21.130> on<00:01:21.280> this<00:01:21.399> is<00:01:21.610> super

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
need to the formula on this is super

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.760 
need to the formula on this is super
smooth<00:01:22.270> super<00:01:22.509> easy<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.170> apply<00:01:23.380> I'm<00:01:23.619> probably

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
smooth super easy to apply I'm probably

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.320 
smooth super easy to apply I'm probably
gonna<00:01:23.979> say<00:01:24.159> that<00:01:24.340> for<00:01:24.549> all<00:01:24.580> of<00:01:24.700> these

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
gonna say that for all of these

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.969 
gonna say that for all of these
it<00:01:25.479> doesn't<00:01:25.899> feel<00:01:26.020> gritty<00:01:26.289> at<00:01:26.500> all<00:01:26.680> even

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
it doesn't feel gritty at all even

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.130 
it doesn't feel gritty at all even
though<00:01:27.070> there<00:01:27.220> is<00:01:27.369> a<00:01:27.399> good<00:01:27.909> amount<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.420> micro

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
though there is a good amount of micro

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.600 
though there is a good amount of micro
glitter<00:01:29.229> in<00:01:29.500> there<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.860> can't<00:01:30.100> feel<00:01:30.369> it<00:01:30.399> it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
glitter in there you can't feel it it

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.340 
glitter in there you can't feel it it
still<00:01:30.759> feels<00:01:30.970> like<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.090> smooth<00:01:31.420> polish<00:01:31.810> so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
still feels like a smooth polish so

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.389 
still feels like a smooth polish so
there<00:01:32.500> is<00:01:32.619> one<00:01:32.830> coat<00:01:33.070> so<00:01:33.820> here<00:01:34.000> is<00:01:34.090> two<00:01:34.330> coats

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
there is one coat so here is two coats

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.889 
there is one coat so here is two coats
this<00:01:36.399> one<00:01:36.580> builds<00:01:36.850> up<00:01:36.970> really<00:01:37.390> nicely<00:01:37.600> to

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
this one builds up really nicely to

notice the huge chunk of cotton ball on

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.670 
notice the huge chunk of cotton ball on
my<00:03:23.069> pinky<00:03:23.370> finger<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.150> there<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.659> one<00:03:24.870> coat<00:03:25.109> so

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
my pinky finger so there is one coat so

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.099 
my pinky finger so there is one coat so
here<00:03:25.859> is<00:03:25.950> two<00:03:26.220> coats<00:03:26.659> this<00:03:27.659> one<00:03:27.810> covers

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
here is two coats this one covers

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.440 
here is two coats this one covers
completely<00:03:28.349> in<00:03:28.799> two<00:03:29.040> coats<00:03:29.280> actually<00:03:30.090> can't

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
completely in two coats actually can't

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.819 
completely in two coats actually can't
think<00:03:30.629> of<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.780> glam<00:03:30.959> polish<00:03:31.319> that<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.530> have

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
think of a glam polish that I have

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.220 
think of a glam polish that I have
that's<00:03:32.280> not<00:03:32.970> opaque<00:03:33.299> in<00:03:33.510> two<00:03:33.659> coats<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.049> think

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
that's not opaque in two coats I think

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.690 
that's not opaque in two coats I think
they're<00:03:34.319> all<00:03:34.440> two<00:03:34.650> coders<00:03:34.980> police<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.549> ones

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
they're all two coders police the ones

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.460 
they're all two coders police the ones
that<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.879> have<00:03:36.060> they<00:03:36.540> also<00:03:36.720> drive<00:03:37.170> really

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
that I have they also drive really

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.420 
that I have they also drive really
really<00:03:37.590> fast

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
really fast

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.729 
really fast
all<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:39.000> these<00:03:39.150> included<00:03:39.900> every<00:03:40.260> glam<00:03:40.439> polish

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
all of these included every glam polish

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.259 
all of these included every glam polish
that<00:03:40.859> I've<00:03:40.950> had<00:03:41.069> is<00:03:41.220> dried<00:03:41.459> fast<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:41.970> it's<00:03:42.180> only

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
that I've had is dried fast so it's only

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.030 
that I've had is dried fast so it's only
two<00:03:42.480> coats<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.870> they<00:03:42.989> dry<00:03:43.139> superfast<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:43.950> they

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
two coats and they dry superfast so they

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.800 
two coats and they dry superfast so they
make<00:03:44.159> for<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.370> really<00:03:44.459> fast<00:03:44.790> manicure<00:03:45.299> so<00:03:45.629> there

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
in the first coat I can still see

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.820 
in the first coat I can still see
through<00:04:04.450> it<00:04:04.599> and<00:04:04.690> I<00:04:04.720> can<00:04:04.870> see<00:04:05.080> my<00:04:05.200> nail<00:04:05.349> line<00:04:05.590> so

through it and I can see my nail line so

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.530 
through it and I can see my nail line so
it<00:04:05.890> is<00:04:05.950> going<00:04:06.129> to<00:04:06.190> need<00:04:06.370> to<00:04:06.610> again<00:04:07.180> great

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
formula it feels really smooth despite

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.339 
formula it feels really smooth despite
the<00:04:09.790> micro<00:04:10.150> glitter<00:04:10.269> in<00:04:10.540> there<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:11.049> there<00:04:11.230> is

builds up to cover completely and two

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.210 
builds up to cover completely and two
coats<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:16.989> think<00:04:17.290> I<00:04:17.380> described<00:04:17.769> this<00:04:17.859> one<00:04:18.040> as<00:04:18.190> a

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.800 
coats I think I described this one as a
teal<00:04:18.549> with<00:04:18.790> holographic<00:04:19.150> silver<00:04:19.570> micro

teal with holographic silver micro

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.479 
teal with holographic silver micro
glitter<00:04:19.959> but<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.350> is<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.470> holographic<00:04:21.010> teal

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
glitter but it is a holographic teal

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.939 
glitter but it is a holographic teal
with<00:04:21.970> holographic<00:04:22.419> silver<00:04:22.900> micro<00:04:23.169> glitter<00:04:23.320> so

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
with holographic silver micro glitter so

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:30.750 
with holographic silver micro glitter so
there<00:04:24.130> is<00:04:24.280> two<00:04:24.520> coats<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:25.030> rehab

as<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.890> gold<00:04:57.220> ones<00:04:57.490> were<00:04:57.790> in<00:04:58.060> girl<00:04:58.270> on<00:04:58.390> fire<00:04:58.570> so

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
as the gold ones were in girl on fire so

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.550 
as the gold ones were in girl on fire so
there<00:04:59.350> is<00:04:59.470> one<00:04:59.710> coat<00:04:59.920> so<00:05:00.490> here<00:05:00.670> is<00:05:00.760> two<00:05:00.970> coats

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
there is one coat so here is two coats

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.320 
there is one coat so here is two coats
this<00:05:02.560> one<00:05:02.710> covers<00:05:03.010> completely<00:05:03.580> in<00:05:03.790> two<00:05:04.060> coats

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
this one covers completely in two coats

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.360 
this one covers completely in two coats
I<00:05:04.540> was<00:05:04.660> kind<00:05:04.870> of<00:05:05.020> skeptical<00:05:05.740> whether<00:05:06.070> this<00:05:06.190> one

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
I was kind of skeptical whether this one

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.860 
I was kind of skeptical whether this one
was<00:05:06.490> going<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.730> because<00:05:06.970> it<00:05:07.000> seems<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.510> be<00:05:07.600> the

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
was going to because it seems to be the

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.930 
was going to because it seems to be the
sheerest<00:05:08.380> on<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.830> first<00:05:09.070> coat<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.520> might<00:05:09.760> just

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
sheerest on the first coat it might just

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.460 
sheerest on the first coat it might just
be<00:05:10.000> because<00:05:10.120> it's<00:05:10.390> lighter<00:05:10.600> though<00:05:10.870> but<00:05:11.380> it

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
be because it's lighter though but it

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.530 
be because it's lighter though but it
did<00:05:11.620> cover<00:05:11.860> completely<00:05:12.160> in<00:05:12.730> two<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.450> again

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
did cover completely in two and again

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.320 
did cover completely in two and again
super<00:05:14.170> smooth<00:05:14.440> super<00:05:14.920> easy<00:05:15.100> formula<00:05:15.520> so<00:05:16.150> there

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
super smooth super easy formula so there

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.010 
super smooth super easy formula so there
is<00:05:16.480> two<00:05:16.900> coats<00:05:17.170> of<00:05:17.470> take<00:05:17.830> on<00:05:18.040> me

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.200 

the<00:05:23.590> next<00:05:23.800> polish<00:05:24.070> is<00:05:24.220> called<00:05:24.490> firework<00:05:25.000> and

probably the sheerest on the first coat
fantastic<00:05:42.550> formula<00:05:43.000> though<00:05:43.120> super<00:05:43.420> smooth

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
fantastic formula though super smooth

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.710 
fantastic formula though super smooth
super<00:05:44.290> easy<00:05:44.530> to<00:05:44.770> apply<00:05:45.010> so<00:05:45.910> there<00:05:46.090> is<00:05:46.240> one<00:05:46.480> coat

completely in two coats the blue glass
flecks<00:05:52.480> do<00:05:52.750> stand<00:05:53.020> out<00:05:53.200> pretty<00:05:53.470> well<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:53.980> this

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
flecks do stand out pretty well and this

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.890 
flecks do stand out pretty well and this
does<00:05:54.640> dry<00:05:54.820> a<00:05:54.850> little<00:05:55.030> bit<00:05:55.150> dull<00:05:55.450> so<00:05:55.630> you<00:05:55.720> will

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
hollow with the silver holographic micro

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.680 
hollow with the silver holographic micro
glitter<00:06:11.670> mixed<00:06:12.120> in<00:06:12.240> so<00:06:12.540> here's<00:06:12.750> one<00:06:12.960> coat<00:06:14.690> this

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
glitter mixed in so here's one coat this

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.450 
glitter mixed in so here's one coat this
actually<00:06:16.020> covers<00:06:16.200> really<00:06:16.650> well<00:06:16.770> on<00:06:17.100> the<00:06:17.250> first

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
actually covers really well on the first

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.950 
actually covers really well on the first
coat<00:06:17.670> it<00:06:17.880> is<00:06:17.970> gonna<00:06:18.150> need<00:06:18.330> to<00:06:18.510> because<00:06:18.720> I<00:06:18.780> can

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
coat it is gonna need to because I can

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.150 
coat it is gonna need to because I can
still<00:06:19.140> see<00:06:19.320> through<00:06:19.470> it<00:06:19.590> a<00:06:19.650> little<00:06:19.770> bit<00:06:19.890> but<00:06:20.100> I

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
still see through it a little bit but I

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.010 
still see through it a little bit but I
wasn't<00:06:20.340> expecting<00:06:20.970> it<00:06:21.060> to<00:06:21.120> cover<00:06:21.540> so<00:06:21.810> well

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
wasn't expecting it to cover so well

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.560 
wasn't expecting it to cover so well
again<00:06:22.530> fantastic<00:06:23.490> formula<00:06:23.970> super<00:06:24.180> smooth

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
again fantastic formula super smooth

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.450 
again fantastic formula super smooth
despite<00:06:25.020> the<00:06:25.140> micro<00:06:25.410> glitter<00:06:25.650> and<00:06:26.190> I<00:06:26.310> say

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
despite the micro glitter and I say

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.950 
despite the micro glitter and I say
smooth<00:06:26.730> I<00:06:26.850> mean<00:06:26.970> the<00:06:27.060> application<00:06:27.660> you<00:06:27.840> will

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
smooth I mean the application you will

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.090 
smooth I mean the application you will
still<00:06:28.140> want<00:06:28.260> a<00:06:28.320> top<00:06:28.530> coat<00:06:28.740> it<00:06:28.860> because<00:06:29.040> the

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
still want a top coat it because the

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.320 
still want a top coat it because the
micro<00:06:29.340> glitter<00:06:29.460> can<00:06:29.760> make<00:06:29.880> it<00:06:29.970> a<00:06:30.030> little<00:06:30.150> bit

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
micro glitter can make it a little bit

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.600 
micro glitter can make it a little bit
gritty<00:06:30.570> so<00:06:31.110> there<00:06:31.260> is<00:06:31.380> one<00:06:31.590> coat<00:06:31.800> so<00:06:32.400> here's

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
gritty so there is one coat so here's

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.270 
gritty so there is one coat so here's
two<00:06:32.880> coats<00:06:33.230> this<00:06:34.230> one<00:06:34.410> covers<00:06:34.680> completely<00:06:34.920> on

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
two coats this one covers completely on

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.340 
two coats this one covers completely on
two<00:06:35.520> though<00:06:35.760> it<00:06:35.850> was<00:06:35.940> nearly<00:06:36.330> opaque<00:06:36.840> in<00:06:37.080> one

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
two though it was nearly opaque in one

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.900 
two though it was nearly opaque in one
and<00:06:37.620> just<00:06:37.800> deepened<00:06:38.100> the<00:06:38.160> color<00:06:38.370> and<00:06:38.640> covered

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
and just deepened the color and covered

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.610 
and just deepened the color and covered
up<00:06:38.970> a<00:06:39.090> little<00:06:39.390> bit<00:06:39.630> of<00:06:39.720> nail<00:06:39.870> line<00:06:40.110> that<00:06:40.320> I<00:06:40.350> had

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
up a little bit of nail line that I had

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.890
