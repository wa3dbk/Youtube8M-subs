 you want the whole title is that 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.160
 is obviously significant to the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 photograph they are putting another one of 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.630

 It takes different to make my

 pennants the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.080
 paste the folded sitech water pieces 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.960

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.970
 small triangles to form my 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.000
 pennants that in the end I'm going to stick in 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.460

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.900
 photo and good 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.060
 I am going to clarify to you some doubt that they have 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.250
 asked about previous videos about 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.080
 albany n paper that is albal paper 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.390
 n is also known as apple bellum 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.960
 I told them that they could also use 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.510
 paper 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.980
 Napkin paper or some thin paper 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.510
 neither of you frustrate me of 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.760
 suddenly I think they get a little frustrated and 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.860
 they do not find the solution but good 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.890
 watch the videos well I explain them 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.990
 everything and good the last of the requirements 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.800
 of this page will be to have sweets 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.840
 candies 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.480
 I have these stickers here about 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.190
 candy that they saw that I put out there if 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.080
 you do not have chord stickers in 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.060
 that can print them draw it 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.460
 cut them what you want but 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.100
 Well the joke of this page is that 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.420
 have sweets or candies and Well 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.300
 here I'm going to paste my page 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.209
 to my base and I'm going to make a fake cooked 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.190
 with the white gel pen so that you 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.739
 give a little more life to my page and 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.569
 Well, that's how we got this 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.980
 page another of the doubts now that I 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.930
 agreement they are making me on the page 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.660
 previous of my work that if they are not 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.670
 working they can put on their school 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.140
 also if you are studying something about 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.270
 your school or if you do not study and work 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.770
 what they would like to work for 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.580
 housewives this is also a job 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.810
 then I was not frustrated and good 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.459
 we repeat the requirements of this page 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.140

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.900

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.130

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.110
