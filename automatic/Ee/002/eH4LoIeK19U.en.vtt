00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
read that but that is definitely

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.770 
read that but that is definitely
something<00:01:05.729> by<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.210> looks<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.540> they're

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
something by the looks that they're

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.630 
something by the looks that they're
looking<00:01:06.900> into<00:01:07.170> improving<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.189> because

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
looking into improving that because

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.240 
looking into improving that because
personally<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> never<00:01:09.750> used<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.380> offset<00:01:10.710> tcam

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
personally I never used the offset tcam

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
personally I never used the offset tcam
unless<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.090> might<00:01:12.270> accidentally<00:01:12.780> switch<00:01:13.020> into

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
unless I might accidentally switch into

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.719 
unless I might accidentally switch into
it<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> view<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.310> don't<00:01:14.580> really

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
it for the view and I just don't really

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.609 
it for the view and I just don't really
ever<00:01:14.909> bother<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.299> change<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.810> let's<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.320> time<00:01:16.530> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
ever bother to change it let's do time I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
ever bother to change it let's do time I
ever<00:01:16.770> really<00:01:17.070> use<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> offset<00:01:17.520> TK<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:17.970> find<00:01:18.330> it

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
ever really use the offset TK I find it

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.660 
ever really use the offset TK I find it
a<00:01:18.540> bit<00:01:18.570> weird<00:01:19.049> i<00:01:19.380> don't<00:01:19.799> really<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.009> racing

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
a bit weird i don't really like racing

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.039 
a bit weird i don't really like racing
with<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.030> i<00:01:21.090> normally<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.450> stick<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.900> this

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
with it so i normally just stick to this

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.120 
with it so i normally just stick to this
t<00:01:22.290> cam<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:23.729> rarely<00:01:23.820> go<00:01:24.750> into<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.770> cockpit

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
t cam or very rarely go into the cockpit

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.249 
t cam or very rarely go into the cockpit
view<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:27.540> definitely<00:01:27.900> cool<00:01:28.080> that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
view and that's definitely cool that

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.539 
view and that's definitely cool that
they're<00:01:28.350> looking<00:01:28.500> into<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.979> out<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.430> know

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
they're looking into that out you know

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.340 
they're looking into that out you know
if<00:01:29.909> they<00:01:30.240> changed<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.900> made<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.259> lot

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
if they changed it and made it a lot

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.440 
if they changed it and made it a lot
better<00:01:31.409> i<00:01:31.710> would<00:01:31.829> definitely<00:01:32.340> use<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.299> lot

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
better i would definitely use it a lot

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.020 
better i would definitely use it a lot
more<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.930> obviously<00:01:34.890> play<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> game<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
more and obviously play with the game a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.149 
more and obviously play with the game a
lot<00:01:36.210> more<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.630> view<00:01:36.960> because<00:01:37.200> i<00:01:37.530> think<00:01:37.920> at

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
lot more in that view because i think at

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.590 
lot more in that view because i think at
the<00:01:38.220> current<00:01:38.490> time<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:38.970> made<00:01:39.119> people<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the current time not made people have to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
the current time not made people have to
use<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.930> offset<00:01:40.049> tcam<00:01:40.619> i<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:40.890> Neil's<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
use the offset tcam i know Neil's the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.980 
use the offset tcam i know Neil's the
grid<00:01:41.700> Walker<00:01:42.060> does<00:01:42.210> from<00:01:42.450> time<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.780> time<00:01:42.840> but

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
grid Walker does from time to time but

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.620 
grid Walker does from time to time but
not<00:01:43.799> many<00:01:43.950> people<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.549> at<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> end<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> day

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
not many people do at the end of the day

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690 
not many people do at the end of the day

so you know if they have that feature in

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.889 
so you know if they have that feature in
there<00:01:47.850> they<00:01:47.939> might<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.240> well<00:01:48.360> make<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:48.689> best

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
there they might as well make it as best

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.510 
there they might as well make it as best
as<00:01:49.110> possible<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.430> it

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560

thing now at the other day after reading

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.020 
thing now at the other day after reading
your<00:02:15.480> comments<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.920> know<00:02:17.040> realizing<00:02:17.670> in

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
your comments and you know realizing in

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.150 
your comments and you know realizing in
my<00:02:18.180> brain<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:19.260> wasn't<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> very<00:02:19.620> good<00:02:19.739> idea

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
my brain that it wasn't a very good idea

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.309 
my brain that it wasn't a very good idea
because<00:02:20.310> normally<00:02:21.270> it's<00:02:21.420> not<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.750> good<00:02:22.020> that

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
because normally it's not that good that

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.110 
because normally it's not that good that
a<00:02:22.410> lot<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.590> people<00:02:22.650> saying<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.340> FIFA<00:02:23.849> it's<00:02:23.970> not

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
a lot of people saying in FIFA it's not

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.330 
a lot of people saying in FIFA it's not
that<00:02:24.270> good<00:02:24.450> either<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:25.040> that's<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.099> very<00:02:26.310> good

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
that good either and that's a very good

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.850 
that good either and that's a very good
point<00:02:26.520> because<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.150> FIFA<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:28.110> just<00:02:28.319> does<00:02:28.709> the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
point because in FIFA it just does the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.979 
point because in FIFA it just does the
same<00:02:29.069> sort<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.640> saying<00:02:30.000> over<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.599> over<00:02:30.780> again

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
same sort of saying over and over again

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.839 
same sort of saying over and over again
and<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.530> think<00:02:31.709> if<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.160> played<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.580> game<00:02:32.819> a

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
and I think if you played this game a

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.940 
and I think if you played this game a
lot<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.360> you're<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.690> big<00:02:33.900> f1<00:02:34.260> fan<00:02:34.530> you'll

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
lot and you're a big f1 fan you'll

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.680 
lot and you're a big f1 fan you'll
probably<00:02:35.220> find<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.730> quite<00:02:35.910> frustrating

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
probably find that quite frustrating

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.720 
probably find that quite frustrating
hearing<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.500> same<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.950> same<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.550> same

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
hearing the same and same and same

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.940 
hearing the same and same and same
comment<00:02:39.209> over<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.690> over<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:39.989> over<00:02:40.080> again<00:02:40.380> it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
comment over and over and over again it

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.440 
comment over and over and over again it
might<00:02:41.160> be<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> bit<00:02:41.430> boring<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.000> it's<00:02:42.300> probably

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
might be a bit boring and it's probably

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.900 
might be a bit boring and it's probably
a<00:02:42.630> good<00:02:42.780> thing<00:02:42.989> on<00:02:43.230> their<00:02:43.440> side<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.550> not<00:02:44.700> put

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
a good thing on their side to not put

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.360 
a good thing on their side to not put
the<00:02:45.000> extra<00:02:45.209> F<00:02:45.390> in<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.870> not<00:02:46.769> get<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.069> extra

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
the extra F in and not get the extra

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.009 
the extra F in and not get the extra
complaints<00:02:47.850> back<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.360> it's<00:02:48.510> all<00:02:48.630> pretty

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
complaints back that it's all pretty

complaints back that it's all pretty
much<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> same<00:02:49.380> because<00:02:49.890> FIFA's<00:02:50.700> been<00:02:50.910> doing

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
much the same because FIFA's been doing

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.880 
much the same because FIFA's been doing
