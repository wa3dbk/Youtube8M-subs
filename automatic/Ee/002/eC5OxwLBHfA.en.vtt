00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.599
 continue firing 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.259
 everything seems silent in the forest the little gyroscopes in it with birds in the air 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.599
 However, this tranquility soon disappeared from the birds brick down and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.390
 for this one loaded by lumberjacks 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.390
 the three worked together to make something from the wood in the factory 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.110
 gradually the clear skateboard becomes natural 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.250
 in the first game in the new parts of the movie that win each 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.530
 part of skate so far 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.110
 Some characters are introduced in the story is broadly 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.110
 clear but otherwise it adds little to the game itself 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.680
 yet you immediately notice the slogan of the game thieme ap but also not there either 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.770
 for nothing is because you will start a team with as much skateboard as possible 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.000
 sell the biggest brand the wind lead the skate industry 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.550
 at least that you hope or succeed is entirely up to you 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.270
 a couple of days 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.520
 of course that applies if you are good at skateboarding, the school is a coach leg 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.280
 still not available 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.979
 coach when it is a nice erected on June 30 his puberty has remained 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:23.730
 to hang 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.820
 the share of unilever skateboarding 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.620
 This makes use of this to get them to explain at a leisurely pace 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.300
 way of playing interpretation for beginners 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.650
 here you come for the first time in caracas the idea of ​​scheveningen 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.020
 the first thing to add that stands out is the choice of difficulty levels 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.790
 wwf that unrealistic and spectacularly increased as with 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.900
 There it is best to make the game even easier if you want it 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.600
 all a bit more realistic is a lot that is not up at 2 o'clock in the air 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.620
 labor 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.900
 most of them play the most difficult difficulty but if 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.810
 a bit of both was not the normal difficulty level 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.250
 perfect outcome 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.500
 this entire career mode and of course the other moodies takes place in the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.540
 be a new start of the Poortkerk 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.460
 A nice has a modern city with enough obstacle to wish you like 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.520
 looked at the chance to give you a piece of text to show for this you use of course 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.789
 re-interned frozen chicken control 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.309
 You can do a lot of great things with a little bit of a right stick 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.349
 and these things can be pretty strange 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.700
 and if you have done an extremely difficult stunt, what do you naturally want with the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.079
 share the rest of the world 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.509
 that is a problem that of course not members and literature record everything 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:32.859
 and show it to your friends 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.979
 unlike the city of escape the pitt, by the way, a hero on the board 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.719
 getting all teams out of the closet is not a crime at all in this city 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.249
 previous parts 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.699
 this gives you a more open feeling throughout the entire game 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.699
 this city is actually a big kepo hall 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.349
 as a team in this city you also have your own park 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.700
 individually from both hand that places everything the way you want 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.549
 in compiling your own course 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.799
 according to him, still trying out other things that you 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.129
 it doesn't save itself 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.269
 I feel a bit like a second quarter from in Germany 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:11.019
 the online possibilities of skate 3 have been considerably expanded 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.499
 require any challenge to play these online friends or just play in it 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:16.359
 your one 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.299
 it goes beyond that 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.559
 bisjkek not sincerely in a team 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:23.670
 something in the play mode, possible lighters 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.429
 as the guideline, of course, form a dozen measures 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:27.340
 this means that there 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.199
 beijing china was founded when a strong competition emerged 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.619
 that happened stab wounds against others 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.199
 you will find a rising ranking list 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.349
 because of this and by participating or bringing together 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.349
 last year 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.229
 No 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:56.480
 the e3 is a good sequel still better the game contains some strong ones 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:59.950
 improvements but overall that I looked a bit maybe the chance 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:01.679
 2005 

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:05.869
 a skate 2 did well youtube that also good but some mistakes from that wants 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:07.559
 say still more prosecuted 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.499
 however, this does not mean that it will remain fun for a long time with the various 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:14.359
 challenges settlement to be busy of course the game also contains its own 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.269
 mistakes but the good points in just as many heavy ones against the negatives 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.739
 the online part is perhaps the biggest improvement in the world 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.550
 Playing in a team with friends can give you many hours of fun 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.599
 experience 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.229
 if you like to skate and especially the friends this is the best 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.229
 pay their house 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:55.370
 to study 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.500
 and I always thought that spokeswoman
