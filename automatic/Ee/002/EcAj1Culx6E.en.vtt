00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 hello now i want to try 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.779
 how do these two microphones work 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.200
 Does not turn on the computer through in such 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.630
 splitter into which jack is inserted 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.400
 microphone jack he was late with him 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.949
 the usual usb and from the eyes catches 1 minus 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.910
 This thing is that she has a very 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:30.060
 short cable and accordingly will 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.470
 just hang out that's why it's not 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.040
 very comfortable it could have been done by 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.320
 length so go and already connected means 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.870
 drivers are already installed and so 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:50.579
 tested already before shooting us 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:56.360
 it remains only to choose the record I choose 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.360
 here's a ride microphones and click on record 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.510
 once again now I say blue 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.989
 microphone and now i'm talking in red 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.989
 microphone 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.520
 So 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:28.740
 But let's see the keys for the speakers, but 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.369
 the king is all clear the volume and them 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.420
 good ones 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.950
 These microphones have a recording of course 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.780
 they do terrible but on the other hand 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.270
 this is a short microphone why should he 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.159
 record with us so that he amplifies the voice 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.049
 with this in principle they both cope 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.280
 work they simultaneously get these 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.080
 microphones so it can now on different 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.920
 events 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.189
 home sing okay it was so 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.240
 little test everyone happy 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.130
 sign up thumbs up and 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.130
 Comment on everything for now.
