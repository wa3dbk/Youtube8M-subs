00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:23.600
 hello how about penguins here pengui today 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.600
 I'm with you to win 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.360
 aha pinguis are watching races 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.920
 led and that's what we're going to win the day 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.559
 from today 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.500
 so I'm going to show you how good my 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.030
 technique when game is led and up 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.210
 now it has worked quite well 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.100
 then it's time to reveal my 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.829
 secret no good is no secret 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.030
 but 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.109
 if it's a technique that I have and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.260
 usually it serves me then we're going to 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.789
 go to the sleigh race game like 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.109
 Many will already know this is a game 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.519
 multiplayer can we 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.320
 customize our LEDs if we want 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.210
 here is a penguin that has it 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.280
 personalized 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.850
 and let's join this race to 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.630
 start to try 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.080
 well my technique is to use the busts of 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.159
 ice and as fast as you can change 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.360
 on the side because it's usual that just 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.680
 after an ice bus we touch 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.030
 some rock 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.640
 they saw there was a rock and a 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.270
 although it does not reach to reach that but a 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.049
 trunk just after the ice bus 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.549
 here the same the snow mountaineer 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.820
 not falling on the trunk was on the side 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.820
 opposite 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.170
 bustelo then as they saw I arrived in 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.980
 First place with 20 coins we make 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.720
 click on ready 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.560
 let's see who more than a race 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.270
 let's try in the three 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.590
 you have to join you have to join 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.600
 two other penguins make a face 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.200
 this class that is from the party of 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:16.209
 school and skate apparently no one wants 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.019
 nobody wants to play let's go I'm recording 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.019
 who wants to play with me 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.420
 ok of 2 but not here someone is coming 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.340
 someone is missing one more 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.500
 and someone please / 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.610
 I can not believe it 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.550
 u finally 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.810
 ok let's apply the same technique 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.880
 take all the busts of ice and 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.150
 move sideways as fast as one 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.910
 it was an exception this time was the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.190
 amount of snow on the right side but 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.830
 Well that is 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.290
 uncommon in general try to have 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.830
 good reflexes and return immediately 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.800
 in between at least in between 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.690
 of the taste of ice to decide 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.200
 quickly if you have to change 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:26.819
 lane or follow where they go 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:30.330
 in this case we won another 20 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.989
 coins first of all let's see in 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.560
 which we can join not in my state 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.560
 here I think there are already 2 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.610
 they left if I can not believe it 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.980
 someone else 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.970
 I'm missing someone, please, I do not want 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.970
 again wait three hours 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.810
 I can not believe it 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.810
 because nobody edward with me ok 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.680
 I thought it had been three good not 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.650
 matter we have tied Sofia and I there 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.360
 the third penguin appeared and we already took 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.360
 the the advantage 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.620
 that we were going well we are going to take again 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:16.079
 the one that follows 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.489
 we have to dodge those rocks well and 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.019
 the rest 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.180
 It should be the follow-up there well 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.280
 and I think we practically got to 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.310
 the goal this I do not know if shorter or nothing 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.479
 more was made to me shorter and good 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.409
 we won again three wins in a row 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.470
 so I think you can try 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:39.479
 you in my method of trying to take 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.289
 all busts and change 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.289
 quickly 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.500
 from the good bus lane that's my 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.520
 technique I would like to hear in the 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.569
 comments his 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.750
 and know what you think about this 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.789
 schleck game and for now I think 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.229
 I say goodbye, there's not much more 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.159
 talk about this game from the most 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.159
 singles club penguin 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.530
 but well, I hope you have them 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.480
 liked if you do not forget to click on 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.180
 I like to leave your technique in the 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.220
 comments and as they always maintained 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.190
 brains subscribed to the channel for more tricks 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.190
 routing codes we'll see you in the next 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:27.239
 two
