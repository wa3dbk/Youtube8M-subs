really<00:02:12.900> narrow<00:02:13.110> gutted<00:02:13.500> frame<00:02:13.950> they've

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
really narrow gutted frame they've

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.990 
really narrow gutted frame they've

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.580 
managed to shrink it down drop it to 815
mills<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.390> it's<00:02:18.510> 5<00:02:18.780> mils<00:02:19.080> lower<00:02:19.290> than<00:02:19.530> the

suspension you're going to see it in the
new<00:04:00.690> ninja<00:04:00.990> family<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:01.560> it's<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.400> whole<00:04:02.730> new

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
new ninja family so it's a whole new

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.750 
new ninja family so it's a whole new
chassis<00:04:03.090> for<00:04:03.360> this<00:04:03.890> as<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:04.950> said<00:04:05.280> earlier<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
chassis for this as I said earlier the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.030 
chassis for this as I said earlier the
only<00:04:06.090> thing<00:04:06.240> that's<00:04:06.360> not<00:04:06.810> new<00:04:07.200> other<00:04:07.710> tires

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
only thing that's not new other tires

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.310 
only thing that's not new other tires
and<00:04:08.400> that's<00:04:08.910> exactly<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.390> all<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.870> panels<00:04:10.200> are

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
and that's exactly it all the panels are

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.630 
and that's exactly it all the panels are
slightly<00:04:10.620> different<00:04:11.040> because<00:04:11.370> it's

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
slightly different because it's

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.570 
slightly different because it's
narrowing<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.150> waist<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.690> new<00:04:13.110> fuel<00:04:13.410> tank

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
narrowing the waist to new fuel tank

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.660 
narrowing the waist to new fuel tank
it's<00:04:14.580> lost<00:04:14.940> three<00:04:15.360> liters<00:04:15.630> capacity<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:17.519> a<00:04:17.549> bit

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
it's lost three liters capacity to a bit

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.280 
it's lost three liters capacity to a bit
of<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.820> shame<00:04:18.030> because<00:04:18.150> it's<00:04:18.420> a<00:04:18.540> little<00:04:19.080> bit<00:04:19.170> on

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
of a shame because it's a little bit on

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.520 
of a shame because it's a little bit on
the<00:04:19.380> short<00:04:19.590> side<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:20.600> despite<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.810> set<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.320> new

world<00:04:22.740> record<00:04:22.920> for<00:04:23.250> me<00:04:23.340> I've<00:04:23.970> never<00:04:24.390> run<00:04:24.750> into

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
world record for me I've never run into

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.270 
world record for me I've never run into
a<00:04:25.020> fight<00:04:25.140> that<00:04:25.260> I've<00:04:25.380> try<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.620> find<00:04:25.890> seventh

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
a fight that I've try to find seventh

a fight that I've try to find seventh
gear<00:04:26.370> so<00:04:26.610> often<00:04:26.940> it's<00:04:27.150> porky<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:28.230> fairly

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
gear so often it's porky it's fairly

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.580 
gear so often it's porky it's fairly
short<00:04:28.860> eared<00:04:29.160> but<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.460> just<00:04:29.640> feels<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:31.110> lively

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.460 
top four and a half green hundred case
now<00:04:36.030> means<00:04:36.300> it's<00:04:36.510> going<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.810> top<00:04:37.050> out<00:04:37.230> at<00:04:37.260> about
