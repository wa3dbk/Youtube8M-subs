00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
drill a 45 degree angle into this log so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.260 
drill a 45 degree angle into this log so
that<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.650> screw<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.430> when<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:35.820> finished

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that I can screw this when I'm finished

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.200 
that I can screw this when I'm finished
down<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.409> which<00:01:37.619> would<00:01:37.770> stay<00:01:38.070> stable<00:01:38.579> now
