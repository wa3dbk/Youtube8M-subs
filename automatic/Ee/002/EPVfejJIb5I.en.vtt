usually to determine what's the maximum

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.310 
usually to determine what's the maximum
level<00:00:55.970> of<00:00:56.150> great<00:00:56.390> rift<00:00:56.660> you<00:00:56.809> are<00:00:56.989> able<00:00:57.290> to

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
level of great rift you are able to

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.460 
level of great rift you are able to
handle<00:00:58.210> once<00:00:59.210> we<00:00:59.360> joined<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.720> realm<00:00:59.900> we<00:01:00.320> will

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
handle once we joined the realm we will

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.109 
handle once we joined the realm we will
just<00:01:00.650> go<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.339> side<00:01:01.549> of<00:01:01.580> the<00:01:01.760> realm<00:01:01.970> and

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
just go to the side of the realm and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.140 
just go to the side of the realm and
teleport<00:01:02.659> out<00:01:02.860> we<00:01:03.860> do<00:01:04.040> this<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.640> obtain<00:01:04.760> a

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
teleport out we do this to obtain a

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.350 
teleport out we do this to obtain a
minimum<00:01:05.330> level<00:01:05.720> greater<00:01:06.229> rift<00:01:06.500> Keystone<00:01:07.360> so

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
minimum level greater rift Keystone so

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.210 
minimum level greater rift Keystone so
once<00:01:08.630> we<00:01:08.750> teleport<00:01:09.200> out<00:01:09.350> we<00:01:09.680> will<00:01:09.799> just<00:01:09.950> wait

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
once we teleport out we will just wait

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.370 
once we teleport out we will just wait
for<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.670> quest<00:01:10.880> finish<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.600> we'll<00:01:11.930> get<00:01:12.140> the

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
for the quest finish and we'll get the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.070 
for the quest finish and we'll get the
minimum<00:01:12.770> level<00:01:12.950> greater<00:01:13.369> if<00:01:13.610> Keystone<00:01:17.080> now

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
minimum level greater if Keystone now

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.380 
minimum level greater if Keystone now
use<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.619> Keystone<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.280> open<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.760> one<00:01:20.090> great

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
use the Keystone to open the one great

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.960 
use the Keystone to open the one great
rift<00:01:23.500> when<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:24.590> enter<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.040> rift<00:01:25.189> just<00:01:25.670> skip

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
rift when you enter the rift just skip

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.010 
rift when you enter the rift just skip
the<00:01:26.119> first<00:01:26.390> few<00:01:26.689> mobs

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
the first few mobs

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.170 
the first few mobs
this<00:01:27.740> will<00:01:27.920> allow<00:01:28.159> Slater<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.759> let<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.000> rift

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
this will allow Slater to let the rift

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.730 
this will allow Slater to let the rift
guardian<00:01:29.270> spawn<00:01:29.870> attack<00:01:30.170> in<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.470> beginning

of the rift

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.910 
of the rift
now<00:01:32.030> just<00:01:32.330> do<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.630> rift<00:01:32.780> as<00:01:32.960> usual<00:01:33.350> until<00:01:33.650> you

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
now just do the rift as usual until you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:02:14.540 
now just do the rift as usual until you
reach<00:01:34.100> around<00:01:34.430> 95%<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.750> done

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.920 

once<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.760> get<00:02:15.850> close<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.540> end<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.810> the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.590 
once you get close to the end of the
rift<00:02:17.080> just<00:02:17.620> stop<00:02:17.950> memorize<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.120> time<00:02:19.360> left

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
rift just stop memorize the time left

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.530 
rift just stop memorize the time left
