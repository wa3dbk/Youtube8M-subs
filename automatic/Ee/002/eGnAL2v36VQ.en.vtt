00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.109
 the great specialists and friends 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.260
 of 7 international vision as they are 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.929
 Marisa Pine and researcher of the grape and 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.940
 hashish repeal also specialist 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.500
 in Middle East and a teacher in 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.059
 the university of san andrÃ©s are with 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.700
 us to celebrate these nine years 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.560
 and the question goes for you 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.100
 it's about the subject that we just saw 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.420
 that said more doubt more it seems is so 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.790
 thermal current was made ago 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.230
 several years and yet it seems very 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.420
 current what do you think of the situation 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.789
 just what is happening now in 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:39.590
 this truce in gaza and in with israel a 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.930
 luck of it 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.380
 in other words I think that the 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.989
 Pedro question was rhetorical and 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.170
 networks that home is one thing yes jordan 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.540
 it's another thing there's good predisposition 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.160
 will for Palestinian unity the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.760
 question is because you do not get to a 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.980
 consensus 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.680
 It is true that the external factor 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.280
 Israeli politics plays a negative role 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.530
 in this because that is the strategy 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.110
 isolate gaza from the West Bank and that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.670
 postpone the essential issue in the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.180
 theme of Palestine which is the state 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.610
 fundamentally in other things and not 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.210
 you do not have reached any any 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.479
 solution 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.810
 Egypt remains the key actor in the 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.090
 theme of gaza and there is no will and now 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.490
 with the theme of the Islamic state has been 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.890
 remained as secondary in the agenda 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.220
 international the ballistics issue of 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.310
 conflict happened what happened a tremendous 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.500
 human tragedy was much talked about but 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.140
 is 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.550
 I regret to say that if we are realistic what 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.220
 that is anticipated is another conflict another 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.100
 cycle another cycle of violence at least 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.900
 that internally a consensus is reached 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.300
 of the Palestinians and adopt a 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.280
 strategy to avoid the new cycle of 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.830
 conflict that is going to cause you to leave 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.650
 to provoke us there is no doubt not 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.080
 see a solution was not reached anymore and 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.119
 varizat and not in Africa the situation of 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.890
 Africa let's say current and the state 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.330
 Islamic because it is so let's see what 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.440
 said President Obama 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
 regarding the Islamic state but 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.560
 I would like to know at this moment the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.560
 situation of africa was so 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.959
 convulsed if it's a problem that this 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.600
 is pressing and that comes from some 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.120
 years ago with the theme of 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.620
 Islamic movements especially in the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.500
 North of Africa and in Africa 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.420
 western these days we saw it 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.610
 about this year we saw it with the theme of 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.760
 also from boko haram of the problems 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.820
 in mali in continuous and so on then it is 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.739
 an issue that still seems to me 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.160
 same African countries have not 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.380
 have not been addressed 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.390
 and assume it as a problem they have 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.000
 than to look for some kind of solution 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.900
 internal and they were also searched in many 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.270
 situations 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.330
 the external solution including usa 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.340
 lent collaboration or offered 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.470
 just for collaboration to 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.710
 assume it but there are no answers 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.680
 strong inmates to face the good 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.330
 the question for brief for both is 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.940
 just what the president said 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.500
 obama I'll remember it somehow 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.360
 he had a very happy speech and also I 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.000
 He made the speeches of 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.430
 bush son saying here is the empire 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.810
 we are going to intervene there where 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.660
 miss 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.100
 only that they give by air not bombings that 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.100
 what do you think of this speech 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.390
 president let's say so aggressive so 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.630
 the most mentioned Africa also 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.900
 implicitly mentions Iraq and Syria but 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.630
 also not African without him I said good 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.520
 not in this sense was what I was 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.830
 saying you have to remember that the countries 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.830
 Africans had a meeting with 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.050
 less than a month with just in the USA 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.190
 where they traveled practically all the 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.500
 President 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.690
 of Africans including some who do not 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.630
 they are very on the agenda as can be 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.040
 mugabe there are some pictures a little 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.100
 complicated too and where there were some 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.650
 quite tense situations but where 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.590
 clearly are some of these 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.350
 dictators or people who was very 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.210
 committed and that has a long 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.780
 history of rights violations 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.100
 of human rights that were 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.860
 received at the doors of the house 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.430
 white it seems to me that on that side 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:27.190
 have some kind of recomposition that does not 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.930
 it is still very clearly but there would be 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.169
 what to look for there 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.300
 the speech was warmongering is true but 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.460
 Obama's policy in the Middle East 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.850
 is rather realistic in the sense 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.070
 traditional in other words it is not 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.490
 interventionist to change the medium 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:49.539
 orient as it was the pretensions of 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.440
 buzz but obama has two problems the 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:55.890
 problem is the conscience of a liberal 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.620
 being realistic you can not fail no 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.600
 think what is going on in iraq with 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.210
 the theme of the Yazidis with the theme of 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.130
 minorities with the theme with the ghost 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.230
 of the genocide there has samantha 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.210
 powers in the security council and the 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.060
 second are the internal pressures 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.900
 because it still predominates in politics 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.810
 internal US is this way of 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.240
 achieve votes that was installed with the 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.370
 conservatism from the 80's onwards 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.830
 it got stronger with both clinton and 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.960
 buzz against this and next year is 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.080
 an election year 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.030
 and this year is an election year then 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.130
 obama has to take a website but not 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.230
 there is no strategy is clear for 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.510
 how to finish this except the shelling 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.660
 which is an easy solution let's say in 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.820
 this case does not solve the good subject 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.590
 thank you very much and marisa that in 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.110
