pickled onions I think how these have
more<00:04:18.040> question<00:04:18.400> than<00:04:18.519> that<00:04:18.549> less<00:04:19.359> flavor<00:04:22.020> but

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
more question than that less flavor but

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.660 
more question than that less flavor but
the<00:04:23.080> flavor<00:04:23.290> reminds<00:04:23.740> me<00:04:26.160> it<00:04:27.160> might<00:04:27.520> be<00:04:27.640> a

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
the flavor reminds me it might be a

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.070 
the flavor reminds me it might be a
little<00:04:27.910> bit<00:04:28.210> of<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.540> really<00:04:28.780> good<00:04:28.930> wood
