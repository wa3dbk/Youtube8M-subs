what<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.560> always<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:59.060> and<00:02:00.060> then<00:02:00.180> you've<00:02:00.270> got

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
what we always do and then you've got

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.330 
what we always do and then you've got
little<00:02:00.509> box<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.810> cables<00:02:01.020> look<00:02:01.950> stay<00:02:02.130> with<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
little box of cables look stay with it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.380 
little box of cables look stay with it
being<00:02:02.430> wala<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.939> there's<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.210> many

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
being wala so there's not that many

cables<00:02:04.040> improves<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> mess<00:02:05.310> about<00:02:05.430> with<00:02:05.579> I

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
cables improves the mess about with I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.330 
cables improves the mess about with I
think<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.290> two<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.619> total<00:02:08.009> once<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.250> get

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
think it's two in total once we get

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.880 
think it's two in total once we get
inside<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.910> box<00:02:09.379> and<00:02:10.379> looks<00:02:10.590> out<00:02:10.709> that's

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
