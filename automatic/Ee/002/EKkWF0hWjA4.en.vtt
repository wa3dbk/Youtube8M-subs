00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.379 

this<00:00:08.469> is<00:00:08.590> actually<00:00:08.950> the<00:00:09.070> best<00:00:09.100> time<00:00:09.490> to<00:00:09.760> make<00:00:10.330> a

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
this is actually the best time to make a

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.299 
this is actually the best time to make a
resolution<00:00:10.809> do<00:00:11.350> not<00:00:11.559> stop<00:00:11.889> making

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
resolution do not stop making

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.180 
resolution do not stop making
resolutions<00:00:12.600> otherwise<00:00:13.600> it<00:00:14.469> does<00:00:14.680> not<00:00:14.830> happen

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
resolutions otherwise it does not happen

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.390 
resolutions otherwise it does not happen
so<00:00:15.910> we<00:00:16.539> should<00:00:16.810> start<00:00:17.170> with<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:17.410> resolution<00:00:17.740> and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
so we should start with a resolution and

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.769 
so we should start with a resolution and

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
but to do it the third thing would be to

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.359 
but to do it the third thing would be to
lose<00:01:21.220> weight<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:22.090> should<00:01:22.329> start<00:01:22.630> by<00:01:23.369> weighing

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369

where<00:01:35.320> yourself<00:01:35.770> every

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
where yourself every

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.320 
where yourself every
and<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:37.409> what<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.799> takes<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.430> lose<00:01:38.670> weight<00:01:39.000> you

basically need to work on calories and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.800 
basically need to work on calories and
the<00:01:42.869> calorie<00:01:43.229> balance<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:44.060> you<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.330> every

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
of foods like fiber metabolism also goes

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.960 
of foods like fiber metabolism also goes
up<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.530> certain<00:01:58.770> kinds<00:01:59.220> of<00:01:59.310> regular

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
up with certain kinds of regular

up with certain kinds of regular
exercises<00:02:01.220> metabolically<00:02:02.220> going<00:02:02.789> up<00:02:02.970> is<00:02:03.180> so

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
exercises metabolically going up is so

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.289 
exercises metabolically going up is so
critical<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.080> important<00:02:04.680> because<00:02:05.119> with<00:02:06.119> a
