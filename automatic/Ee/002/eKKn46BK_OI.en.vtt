 well hello girls today i want 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.490
 tell and show how to do 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:12.290
 gift box like some 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.790
 no, not stored at home 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.800
 gift bag or gift 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.720
 box or just too lazy to buy so 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.110
 don't worry yourself but this too often 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.360
 happens and so I did myself and everyone 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.869
 to the rest of whom I donate very much 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.910
 like 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.460
 if you're interested then stay with 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.710
 me it is very easy and just let's with 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.899
 you start for this we need 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.750
 10 types of cardboard line though 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.020
 there are already fewer scissors here 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.660
 ilvina felt pen pencil pen what do you 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.219
 it pleases you to draw your size 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.950
 which you want let's start 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:56.110
 some kind of trim check here we are lying around 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:08.289
 Now will your tan cardboard yet 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:08.289
 all 78 are already here 8 species about 10 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.530
 I would like to choose this 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.590
 cardboard 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.409
 I â€™ll show you a camera now 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:29.030
 it will convey how it glitters 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.960
 gleams yes a little bit transmitted 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.720
 Now I take a ruler and a marker and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:41.659
 and on the back I make a square 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:47.650
 then to cut his items box 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.650
 and we will probably be 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:56.049
 let's compare here with this leaflet 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.830
 so let's get all 100 bird 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:28.760
 let's be 12 8 centimeters 12 by 12 here 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:31.340
 so the treatment of the square now me it 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.230
 need to cut with cardboard of course 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.160
 harder will work through the paper 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.260
 class paper is easier to chase and generally out 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.910
 there are more pluses 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:49.390
 with you cut out a square 12 by 12 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.390
 centimeters so now we start already 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:03:01.400
 fold it like origami we fold 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:05.590
 first in diagonal diagonally 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.590
 like a triangle 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:15.600
 very hard work so i will 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:22.800
 helping yourself with this is just fine 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:35.190
 old here now we do this another 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:41.360
 side of course it's not very convenient 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.360
 how from the card to peel here such here 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:54.030
 pieces here she finds until 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.910
 see of course let's continue on u 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.640
 we've got here is such a little thing, he 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.620
 next we add so 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.620
 triangles to the middle 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:26.370
 here there is no marker need 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:28.830
 it's not very hard here 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.370
 it turned out such a thing here he 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:38.490
 more so we left and now the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:41.820
 We add up the middle, and here are 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:47.640
 plot we need marker plus 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:55.290
 bye this spring smooth out with this 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:05:02.130
 the parties are also doing oh how all the same 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:04.340
 hard always worked sbu model or 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.810
 something softer 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.810
 first time doing with the cardboard 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:22.919
 have done just such a little thing now we 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:26.850
 it is open to you here and so we 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:33.830
 it turns out this here again when 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:33.830
 we lay like this 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:44.780
 further what we do we add here and 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.780
 I will build on and seredinochke 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:59.570
 also fold the second side that 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:04.870
 we got further we so here 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.870
 a little open doing so here 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:14.889
 once again where are we doing doing and 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:29.419
 wrap it yourself 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:39.010
 inward here is one female ready and also with 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:39.010
 the other side we do and bend over here 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:46.280
 now we need to press every part 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.610
 if you want to use the arrow 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.620
 I will use the steppler 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:54.139
 they saw an adhesive tape called 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:58.010
 Scotch tape box is ready 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:01.699
 the same way you can make a lid 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:04.220
 boxes for exactly the same, I have more 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:06.530
 did not recognize how the cap can be made 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:10.010
 less this box is always a cap 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:12.979
 It turns out the same to as a box 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:17.479
 it means there must add some 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:21.229
 decorations as a present and cover all this 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:23.300
 lid here so here is such here 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:28.190
 I wonder the king she turned out 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:31.659
 if you are interested make a request and i 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.659
 do something else for you 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:50.000
 that here is such a box 

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.680
