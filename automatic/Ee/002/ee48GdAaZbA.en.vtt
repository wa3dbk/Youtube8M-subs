00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.109
 perhaps the images are conclusive possible 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.540
 of 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.290
 the strong storm 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.870
 from the first moment the communications between asturias and the 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 plateau were given 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.930
 but stay until the 10th by the 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.300
 achieving in this way 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.600
 transport to light 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.080
 who had moved 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 reason for the constitution bridge 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.980
 the images that he contemplates 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.180
 when already the railway 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.930
 very importantly affected not only the road itself but also 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.390
 to electrical installations 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.910
 skate in ariany security facilities telecommand communications 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.110
 cables and poles were dragged more than 200 meters to the road 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.090
 national 630 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.090
 that was also short 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.240
 of snow on the road 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 it reached 7 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.030
 the material recovery works were done with huge 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.070
 difficulties 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.500
 because of the large amount of accumulated snow 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 and the strong blizzard exists 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.269
 the recovery of the cables was extremely difficult 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.269
 being buried by the avalanche 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.349
 for these works had to resort to all human and material means 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.959
 available 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.579
 in this sense we must emphasize 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.209
 already good part 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.789
 previously to rescue 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:35.389
 respective populations 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.389
 that had been left in 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:41.429
 the exploration works are 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.429
 in combination with the worst equipment 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.769
 we observe one of the provisional accesses to the road 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.769
 that were 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:06.340
 a very affected point was the north mouth 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.340
 the number eight days 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.159
 4 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.739
 very close to this point there was the derailment of a game of 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.519
 scout locomotives 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.999
 to be in 4 hours against evil coming from four meters high 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.719
 another of the most punished areas was the number one 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.529
 count design together with a magnifying glass take care of your interior with a layer of snow of 2 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.279
 meters high

 when we lose Sunday the machines your blog 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:46.749
 this layer of snow was compacted 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:48.489
 reaching the vault 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.730
 and causing embedment of one of the exploration groups and the 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.730
 derailment of the other 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.889
 exploration tasks had to be interrupted for five hours at 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.199

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.189
 Inti after strenuous efforts 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.189
 traffic was restored at 1 30 hours a day 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.189
 as final work 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:25.229
 had to proceed to leave freezing snow and ice the overcrowding of the 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.569
 contributed greatly to the proper functioning of the heaters 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.770
 elect 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.379
 we do not want to stop highlighting 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.379
 the sacrifice and dedication demonstrated by our agents 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.140
 that in many cases they were working without interruption and in 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.819
 very harsh conditions 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.340
 more than 48 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.340
 until leaving it viesques 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.389
 This is the decisive role 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.539
 although some of them accuse a notorious lack
