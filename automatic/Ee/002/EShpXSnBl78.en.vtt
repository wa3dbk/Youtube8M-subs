00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.349 
unique and I think you're gonna get it
right<00:00:23.460> away<00:00:28.460> okay<00:00:29.460> let's<00:00:29.699> jump<00:00:29.939> right<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.210> here

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
right away okay let's jump right in here

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.089 
right away okay let's jump right in here
see<00:00:30.599> how<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.869> works<00:00:31.019> you'll<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:31.710> as<00:00:31.859> easy

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
see how it works you'll see it's as easy

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.090 
see how it works you'll see it's as easy
as<00:00:32.369> pie<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.930> will<00:00:34.050> pick<00:00:34.289> a<00:00:34.350> photo<00:00:34.680> from<00:00:34.920> our

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
as pie so we will pick a photo from our

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.920 
as pie so we will pick a photo from our
library<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.850> although<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.480> take<00:00:36.629> a<00:00:36.660> new

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
library here although you can take a new

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.869 
library here although you can take a new
photo<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> camera<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.980> either<00:00:38.309> way<00:00:38.610> works

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
photo with a camera to either way works

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.510 
photo with a camera to either way works
and<00:00:39.410> immediately<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:40.980> generated<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
and immediately we have generated a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.069 
and immediately we have generated a
hundred<00:00:41.850> different<00:00:41.969> effects<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.809> see

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
hundred different effects you can see

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.920 
hundred different effects you can see
how<00:00:43.289> fast<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.949> thing<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.449> can<00:00:45.600> swipe

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
how fast this thing is so you can swipe

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.020 
how fast this thing is so you can swipe
through<00:00:45.989> these<00:00:46.559> things<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.550> which<00:00:47.820> one

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
through these things and see which one

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.849 
through these things and see which one
works<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.719> doesn't<00:00:49.170> work<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
works and doesn't work that the

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.160 
works and doesn't work that the
particular<00:00:50.160> picture<00:00:50.579> you've<00:00:50.820> chosen<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.989> can

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
particular picture you've chosen you can

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.020 
particular picture you've chosen you can
jump<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> main<00:00:53.160> menu<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.640> then

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
jump out to the main menu and then

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.389 
jump out to the main menu and then
navigate<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.719> various<00:00:55.109> categories<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:56.100> find

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
navigate the various categories to find

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.090 
navigate the various categories to find
one<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:57.149> suits<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.600> photo<00:00:57.930> let's<00:00:58.920> choose<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
one that suits that photo let's choose a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.069 
one that suits that photo let's choose a
black<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.550> white<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.940> here<00:01:00.239> will<00:01:00.510> move<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
black and white one here will move the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.900 
black and white one here will move the
slider<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.559> change<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> effect<00:01:02.429> a<00:01:02.519> little<00:01:02.760> bit

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
slider to change the effect a little bit

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.119 
slider to change the effect a little bit
and<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.690> we'll<00:01:03.899> say<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> defect<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> will

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and then we'll say a defect and it will

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.370 
and then we'll say a defect and it will
generate<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.610> hundred<00:01:06.060> new<00:01:06.240> effects<00:01:06.720> based<00:01:07.110> on

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
generate a hundred new effects based on

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.830 
generate a hundred new effects based on
that<00:01:07.500> layer<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.009> you<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.460> created<00:01:08.840> so

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that layer that you have just created so

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
that layer that you have just created so
you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.140> something<00:01:10.439> that's<00:01:10.560> totally

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you can get something that's totally

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.700 
you can get something that's totally
unique<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.759> very<00:01:12.030> much<00:01:12.270> yours

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.490 

as<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:19.180> begin<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.510> use<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.900> app<00:01:20.049> more<00:01:20.320> and

as you begin to use the app more and

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.350 
as you begin to use the app more and
more<00:01:20.680> you'll<00:01:21.130> come<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.520> discover<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:22.060> some

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
more you'll come to discover that some

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.030 
more you'll come to discover that some
of<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.510> effects<00:01:22.810> are<00:01:22.990> great<00:01:23.200> for<00:01:23.409> landscapes

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
of the effects are great for landscapes

it changes the intensity of the overlay
the<00:03:04.879> hard<00:03:05.120> light<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.540> luminosity<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:07.129> use<00:03:07.250> a

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
the hard light the luminosity we use a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.740 
the hard light the luminosity we use a
lot<00:03:07.370> of<00:03:07.579> different<00:03:07.610> blending<00:03:08.239> modes<00:03:08.510> with

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
lot of different blending modes with

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.210 
lot of different blending modes with
this<00:03:08.930> app<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.500> we<00:03:09.650> do<00:03:09.799> something<00:03:10.129> a<00:03:10.190> little

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
this app and we do something a little

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.250 
this app and we do something a little
bit<00:03:10.489> different<00:03:10.970> every<00:03:11.150> time<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:11.840> you're<00:03:12.019> sure

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
bit different every time so you're sure

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.920 
bit different every time so you're sure
to<00:03:12.410> find<00:03:12.440> something<00:03:12.709> that's<00:03:13.099> unexpected<00:03:13.930> nice

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
to find something that's unexpected nice

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.110 
to find something that's unexpected nice
and<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.769> can<00:03:15.980> make<00:03:16.099> it<00:03:16.250> very<00:03:16.280> much<00:03:16.609> uniquely

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
and you can make it very much uniquely

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.520 
and you can make it very much uniquely
your<00:03:17.269> own<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.720> think<00:03:17.959> that's<00:03:18.170> half<00:03:18.349> the<00:03:18.379> fun

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
your own and I think that's half the fun

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.099 
your own and I think that's half the fun
as<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.040> explorations<00:03:19.730> I<00:03:20.269> hope<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.959> have<00:03:20.989> a

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
as the explorations I hope you have a

00:03:21.109 --> 00:04:18.680 
as the explorations I hope you have a
great<00:03:21.290> time

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690
