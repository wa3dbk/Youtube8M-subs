00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.000
 understand why to take a brief tour on 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.570
 dense web app 14 since we 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.050

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.519

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.260
 who had failed to access a 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.950

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.860

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.920
 hallucinating and was kind then goes 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.170
 usually the store selects pink 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.690
 I personally like the packages 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.590
 I like to see these players me 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.690

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.880
 very pretty really very pretty and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.140
 above all we have just discovered that 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:29.729
 as fifa 14 coaches there is also the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.070

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.530
 myth but who is who buys it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.460
 especially that you are seeing this 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.280

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.619

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.960
 normal ok 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.280
 or there is also paolo di canio manzoni from 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.120

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.880
 then there is pilgrims come it is usually him 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.100
 another, however, is 350 per sannin e 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.220
 as there is an auction on ebay for 5 euros 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.570

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.920
 annoying console every time 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.830
 The console is the final convenient search 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.950
 for the now on web apps in usa it is excellent 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.989

 that there is the consumables stack that is 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:47.890

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.070
 finaliss 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.990
 you describe there was practically neither that me 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.370
 itself but we could make a video if there 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.620
 people want 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.060
 we arrive at 50 I like we can do 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.070
 a video on style shirts only 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.870
 introducing them are hoods that in 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.340
 based on the agreement to give it bonuses to 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.979
 players 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.350
 in any case, from this video 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.520
 it was for introductory purposes only 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.789
 on the contrary, let's try to look a moment 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.470
 as are the new formations since 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.139
 they have also introduced training 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.820
 the one then false 9 and arriving not 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:36.240
 bend over by looking at my training 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.240
 of the first music hands on the barrier 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.020
 and there is one thing to say there are 5 4 3 3 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:50.310
 ethical their playmaker that the form 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:55.200
 the marlos trento is more offensive 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:58.320
 mx ass but that's okay anyway 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.140

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.010
