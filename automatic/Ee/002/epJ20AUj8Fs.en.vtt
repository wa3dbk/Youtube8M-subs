00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 Hello everyone, I am Alena to him 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:10.920
 taking my voice as I barely speak 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.880
 so say today and show you how 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.670
 make doll stand monster high 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 because the model very often releases 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.470
 dolls without coasters and it is very disappointing 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.369
 because you can not put 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.369
 qqq pineapple need 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.520
 Stand only more accurate color completely 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.309
 we will need a stand 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.379
 which doll printer high is of course 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.329
 if you have not then you can 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.640
 do well of any type 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.300
 you will need rei you will know ordinary sticks 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.840
 I only have sushi sticks 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:04.399
 pizza stick will fit and 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.399
 therefore, you will need a cardboard 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:18.360
 take the cardboard and here are the conditions of life and do 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.060
 i made 6 since i do two 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.939
 coasters and do in the middle mind such 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.150
 here are the points about where we will be 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:32.729
 make holes 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:35.340
 now we have to cut it i 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.110
 cut two since so far i want 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.740
 make of 2 i am now he ate and by day 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.350
 every hole 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:52.369
 a dragon which is exactly one hole 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.369
 they do 2 threads I insert 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:05.730
 I start to glue 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:12.930
 so I stuck it if I put a heavy 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:19.290
 stuck well but for now our body 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:31.440
 sock and dry again we start doing 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:31.440
 here it is here we take checked 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.950
 the judge goes like that 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.980
 now the fun begins 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.820
 we build our stand 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:57.790
 take here these staining coashes are you 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:04.250
 the very last moment but take our 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.750
 base and wand now we take glue 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.220
 time surely bed 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.430
 any 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:20.450
 can a napkin or even a piece of paper to 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:26.800
 no matter how dirty the surface is 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.800
 so fill it like this 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.830
 and paste 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.840
 here 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.410
 I put the stand and tied it 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.290
 so that it is dry and now while I am writing from 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.670
 admin 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.900
 you and I do another 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.110
 we take a small piece 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.120
 doing these three things here 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.590
 small of and pushing in to 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.720
 held tight now when stand 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.260
 your dried up 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.440
 you can paint it in any color afterwards 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:29.460
 you must take the ribbon in the color of clothes 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.350
 your dolls 100 will not be noticeable in 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.300
 general musician take so here 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:42.830
 probably better to stick like this 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:47.280
 in place when you already paint here 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:51.900
 how would a rail bow tied you 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.990
 Now I'll show you here so that when 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.790
 knitting it costs 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.770
 so you can try it on 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:04.140
 I paint to paint 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.810
 silver paint not acrylic usually i 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.220
 then I will varnish 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.950
 you can not do this also need 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:15.150
 to paint 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:22.070
 yourself here is a stick well, well, I painted like you 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:22.070
 see further only already 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.959
 when it is dry it will be possible to put 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:33.849
 now I do nâ€™t risk it 

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:41.139
 what else can the doll get dirty 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:41.139
 that was all for now
