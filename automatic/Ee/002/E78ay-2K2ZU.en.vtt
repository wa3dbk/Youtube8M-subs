00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.510 

so<00:05:50.070> I<00:05:50.100> have<00:05:50.370> to<00:05:50.520> draw<00:05:50.790> this<00:05:51.570> is<00:05:51.780> scorned<00:05:52.110> or

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
so I have to draw this is scorned or

00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:07.910 
so I have to draw this is scorned or
sabak<00:05:53.520> replica<00:06:06.140> huh<00:06:07.140> he's<00:06:07.530> not<00:06:07.650> even<00:06:07.830> gonna

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
sabak replica huh he's not even gonna

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.070 
sabak replica huh he's not even gonna
bother<00:06:08.130> doing<00:06:08.670> anything<00:06:08.850> else<00:06:09.210> yes<00:06:09.930> that

bother doing anything else yes that

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.660 
bother doing anything else yes that
makes<00:06:10.230> sense<00:06:10.320> no<00:06:11.040> reason<00:06:11.310> to<00:06:11.370> throw<00:06:11.580> away

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
makes sense no reason to throw away

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.210 
makes sense no reason to throw away
creature<00:06:12.030> this<00:06:12.240> turn<00:06:13.430> if<00:06:14.430> you're<00:06:14.640> him<00:06:16.220> well

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
creature this turn if you're him well

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.220 
creature this turn if you're him well
his<00:06:17.520> two<00:06:17.670> cars<00:06:17.880> are<00:06:18.000> probably<00:06:18.210> blanks<00:06:18.660> so<00:06:18.900> I

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
his two cars are probably blanks so I

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:28.660 
his two cars are probably blanks so I
got<00:06:19.890> that<00:06:19.920> going<00:06:20.190> for<00:06:20.460> me<00:06:20.610> I<00:06:20.700> guess<00:06:27.260> all<00:06:28.260> right

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
got that going for me I guess all right

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.890 
got that going for me I guess all right
all<00:06:29.670> I<00:06:29.730> have<00:06:30.090> left<00:06:30.270> to<00:06:30.420> do<00:06:30.600> is<00:06:31.700> bluff

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
all I have left to do is bluff

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:45.320 
all I have left to do is bluff
pointlessly<00:06:43.340> all<00:06:44.340> right<00:06:44.430> I<00:06:44.610> lose<00:06:44.820> this<00:06:44.940> one<00:06:45.090> I

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
pointlessly all right I lose this one I

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.120 
pointlessly all right I lose this one I
felt<00:06:46.260> like<00:06:46.320> the<00:06:46.440> SEC<00:06:46.590> was<00:06:46.680> really<00:06:46.920> good

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
felt like the SEC was really good

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.010 
felt like the SEC was really good
obviously<00:06:47.670> meant<00:06:47.970> to<00:06:48.090> mold<00:06:48.330> this<00:06:48.450> game<00:06:48.720> I

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
obviously meant to mold this game I

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.500 
obviously meant to mold this game I
think<00:06:49.440> my<00:06:49.560> nan<00:06:49.890> Mulligan<00:06:50.310> game<00:06:50.460> one<00:06:50.670> is<00:06:50.850> still

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
think my nan Mulligan game one is still

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.800 
think my nan Mulligan game one is still
fine<00:06:52.290> I<00:06:52.530> mean<00:06:52.680> he<00:06:52.830> was<00:06:53.040> down<00:06:54.000> to<00:06:54.150> five<00:06:54.300> cars<00:06:54.600> and

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
fine I mean he was down to five cars and

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.220 
fine I mean he was down to five cars and
I<00:06:54.930> think<00:06:55.230> I<00:06:55.290> hands<00:06:55.500> find<00:06:55.740> fine<00:06:56.400> anyway<00:06:57.169> it<00:06:58.169> just

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230 
I think I hands find fine anyway it just

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.950 
I think I hands find fine anyway it just
so<00:06:58.560> worked<00:06:58.800> out<00:06:58.980> that<00:06:59.419> he<00:07:00.419> had<00:07:00.510> the<00:07:00.630> right<00:07:00.750> draw

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
so worked out that he had the right draw

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.320 
so worked out that he had the right draw
five<00:07:01.350> and<00:07:01.620> I<00:07:01.710> got<00:07:02.340> stuck<00:07:02.520> on<00:07:02.550> stuck<00:07:03.000> on<00:07:03.120> lands
