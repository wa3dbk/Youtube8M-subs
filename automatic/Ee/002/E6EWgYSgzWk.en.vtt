I'm<00:00:23.039> saying<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.580> right<00:00:23.760> terminology<00:00:24.180> here

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
I'm saying the right terminology here

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.570 
I'm saying the right terminology here

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
but anyhow what we're gonna do is we're

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.519 
but anyhow what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:00:26.640> wrap<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.119> smaller<00:00:27.420> one<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:28.320> like

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
gonna wrap this smaller one just like

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.980 
gonna wrap this smaller one just like
this<00:00:29.279> little<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.820> little<00:00:29.880> larger<00:00:30.480> size<00:00:30.689> here

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
this little this little larger size here

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.250 
this little this little larger size here
and<00:00:31.460> so<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> pattern<00:00:33.600> all<00:00:33.989> there

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and so you can see the pattern all there

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
and so you can see the pattern all there
is<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.880> single<00:00:35.880> bar<00:00:36.059> running<00:00:36.480> down<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
is is a single bar running down the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.610 
is is a single bar running down the
center<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:38.570> weaved<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.840> there<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
center and it's weaved in there and the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.520 
center and it's weaved in there and the
back<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:41.100> looks<00:00:41.309> like<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.600> straight<00:00:42.600> wrap<00:00:42.840> but

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
back just looks like a straight wrap but

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.170 
back just looks like a straight wrap but
it's<00:00:43.770> very<00:00:43.920> strong<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.670> gonna<00:00:44.879> come

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
it's very strong it's not gonna come

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.240 
it's very strong it's not gonna come
loose<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.410> know<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.800> see<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
loose on you you know I can see here and

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.790 
loose on you you know I can see here and
mess<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> all<00:00:48.000> day<00:00:48.180> long<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.690> what<00:00:49.469> holds

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
mess with it all day long and what holds

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.880 
mess with it all day long and what holds
it<00:00:49.920> well<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.390> fact<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.899> where<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
it well is is the fact that where it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.720 
it well is is the fact that where it
runs<00:00:53.070> through<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> bottom

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
runs through this I here on the bottom

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
runs through this I here on the bottom
we<00:00:56.730> used<00:00:57.260> standard<00:00:58.260> paracord<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.800> not

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
we used standard paracord it's not

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.099 
we used standard paracord it's not
gutted<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.430> it<00:01:00.030> kind<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.300> helps<00:01:00.539> stabilize<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
gutted so it kind of helps stabilize a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.950 
gutted so it kind of helps stabilize a
little<00:01:01.320> bit<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.309> makin<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> wraps<00:01:02.969> but

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
little bit as you makin the wraps but

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.469 
little bit as you makin the wraps but
we'll<00:01:04.439> show<00:01:04.470> how<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> tie<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.150> you'll

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
we'll show how to tie this and you'll

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.210 
we'll show how to tie this and you'll
see<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:06.810> tight<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.770> want<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> make<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
see how tight we really want to make the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.700 
see how tight we really want to make the
wraps<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:09.479> anyhow<00:01:09.780> let's<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.260> started<00:01:10.590> with

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
wraps so anyhow let's get started with

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.679 
wraps so anyhow let's get started with
that

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
that

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.050 
that
so<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> first<00:01:13.020> step<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.820> there's

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
so the first step you can see there's

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
so the first step you can see there's
going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.270> two<00:01:15.900> holes<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.950> little<00:01:17.159> pry

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
going to be two holes in this little pry

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.429 
going to be two holes in this little pry
bar<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.750> you're<00:01:18.869> gonna<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.229> is

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
bar here and what you're gonna do is

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.840 
bar here and what you're gonna do is
you're<00:01:19.560> gonna<00:01:19.619> start<00:01:20.009> by<00:01:20.490> taking<00:01:20.640> your

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
you're gonna start by taking your

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.859 
you're gonna start by taking your
paracord<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.360> longer<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
paracord and this is a little longer I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.660 
paracord and this is a little longer I
think<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:26.040> three<00:01:26.369> feet<00:01:26.549> of

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
think this is about three feet of

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.980 
think this is about three feet of
paracord<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.119> definitely<00:01:27.540> don't<00:01:27.630> need<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
paracord you definitely don't need this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.690 
paracord you definitely don't need this
much<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.380> think<00:01:28.439> it'll<00:01:28.710> hold<00:01:28.890> about<00:01:29.189> two<00:01:29.460> feet

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
much I think it'll hold about two feet

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
much I think it'll hold about two feet
of<00:01:29.790> paracord<00:01:30.030> which<00:01:30.450> that's<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> purpose<00:01:31.890> of

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
of paracord which that's the purpose of

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.859 
of paracord which that's the purpose of
doing<00:01:32.130> something<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.119> not<00:01:33.299> only<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
doing something like this to not only to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.840 
doing something like this to not only to
you<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.829> something<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.310> grip<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> with

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
you know have something to grip it with

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.940 
you know have something to grip it with
which<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:37.079> Ridge<00:01:37.229> line<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.740> makes

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
which this little Ridge line here makes

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.749 
which this little Ridge line here makes
a<00:01:38.040> nice<00:01:38.220> grip<00:01:38.600> are<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.750> actually<00:01:40.049> using<00:01:40.229> these

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
a nice grip are you actually using these

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.249 
a nice grip are you actually using these
but<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.150> great<00:01:42.360> way<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.540> store

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
but it's just a great way to store

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.550 
but it's just a great way to store
paracord<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.250> case<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.610> need<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.560> first

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
step we're going to come through the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.719 
step we're going to come through the
back<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.290> thing<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:50.990> like<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.259> and

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
back of this thing just like this and

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.469 
back of this thing just like this and
what<00:01:53.729> you're<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.180> with<00:01:54.329> this

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
what you're going to do with this

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.730 
what you're going to do with this
section<00:01:54.930> when<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.170> come<00:01:55.320> through<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> back

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
section when you come through the back

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.060 
section when you come through the back
is<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.729> kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.619> you're<00:01:58.619> gonna<00:01:58.740> kind<00:01:58.979> of

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
is this is kind of you're gonna kind of

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.060 
is this is kind of you're gonna kind of
measure<00:01:59.450> what<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.600> want<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.740> thing<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.979> look

measure what you want this thing to look

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.999 
measure what you want this thing to look
like<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.549> end<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.290> this<00:02:04.290> tail<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.770> comes

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
like in the end so this tail that comes

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.340 
like in the end so this tail that comes
past<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.670> end<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.240> pry<00:02:06.659> bar<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.140> is

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
past the end of the pry bar here is

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.800 
past the end of the pry bar here is
actually<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> length<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:09.090> your

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
actually going to be the length of your

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.140 
actually going to be the length of your
little<00:02:10.080> loop<00:02:10.289> or<00:02:10.530> your<00:02:10.649> lanyard<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> end

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
little loop or your lanyard in the end

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
little loop or your lanyard in the end
here<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.450> can

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
here you can

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.830 
here you can
Tyl<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.860> you're<00:02:14.040> not<00:02:14.220> or<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:15.120> do<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> simple

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
Tyl and you're not or just do a simple

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.449 
Tyl and you're not or just do a simple
overhand<00:02:16.200> knot<00:02:16.440> like<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.860> did<00:02:17.010> with<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.280> one

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
overhand knot like I did with this one

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.170 
overhand knot like I did with this one
too<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:19.140> anyhow<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.950> make<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.400> come<00:02:21.000> through

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
too so anyhow you make that come through

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.360 
too so anyhow you make that come through
the<00:02:21.270> back<00:02:21.450> like<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> said<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.860> then<00:02:23.130> all<00:02:23.250> you're

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
the back like I said and then all you're

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.040 
the back like I said and then all you're
going<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.520> do<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:24.140> wrap<00:02:26.480> around<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:27.840> this

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
going to do is wrap around it like this

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.330 
going to do is wrap around it like this
and<00:02:28.500> your<00:02:28.709> first<00:02:28.950> wrap<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.370> gonna<00:02:31.819> secure

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
and your first wrap is gonna secure

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.520 
and your first wrap is gonna secure
actually<00:02:35.690> now<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.750> I'm<00:02:36.930> thinking<00:02:37.080> about<00:02:37.290> it

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
actually now that I'm thinking about it

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.750 
actually now that I'm thinking about it
it<00:02:37.650> might<00:02:37.770> be<00:02:37.830> better<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:40.310> make<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.489> first

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
it might be better to make the first

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.520 
it might be better to make the first
wrap<00:02:42.560> well<00:02:43.560> let's<00:02:44.130> go<00:02:44.280> with<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.519> other<00:02:44.849> way<00:02:45.120> I

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
wrap well let's go with the other way I

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.050 
wrap well let's go with the other way I
think<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.830> will<00:02:46.920> be<00:02:47.069> better<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.550> think<00:02:47.760> that's

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
think it will be better I think that's

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.890 
think it will be better I think that's
why<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.239> did<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.590> anyhow<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.130> first<00:02:50.340> wrap

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
why I did that so anyhow the first wrap

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.880 
why I did that so anyhow the first wrap
secures<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:53.130> first<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.760> guess<00:02:54.890> standing

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
secures that that first I guess standing

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.870 
secures that that first I guess standing
part<00:02:56.360> secures<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.690> there<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:59.700> want

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
part secures that in there and you want

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.449 
part secures that in there and you want
to<00:02:59.940> make<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.209> as<00:03:00.420> tight<00:03:00.600> as<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.459> kind

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
to make this as tight as you can so kind

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.509 
to make this as tight as you can so kind
of<00:03:02.489> veer<00:03:02.730> off<00:03:02.880> camera<00:03:03.269> here<00:03:03.420> why<00:03:03.569> tighten<00:03:03.989> this

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
of veer off camera here why tighten this

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.470 
of veer off camera here why tighten this
so<00:03:05.519> then<00:03:05.670> as<00:03:05.819> you're<00:03:06.000> bringing<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.390> around

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
so then as you're bringing it around

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.610 
so then as you're bringing it around
you're<00:03:07.470> gonna<00:03:07.590> take<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:07.890> center<00:03:08.340> part<00:03:09.620> and

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
you're gonna take that center part and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.170 
you're gonna take that center part and
just<00:03:10.769> loop<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.100> over<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:14.580> idea<00:03:14.880> here<00:03:15.060> is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
just loop it over and the idea here is

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.110 
just loop it over and the idea here is
to<00:03:15.209> keep<00:03:15.450> tightening<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.080> whole<00:03:16.200> time<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:17.120> you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
to keep tightening the whole time so you

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.460 
to keep tightening the whole time so you
want<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.329> make<00:03:18.450> sure<00:03:18.600> this<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.930> really<00:03:19.260> tight

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
want to make sure this is really tight

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.860 
want to make sure this is really tight
and<00:03:19.769> until<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:20.700> get<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:21.030> first<00:03:21.299> wrap<00:03:21.630> on

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
and until you get that first wrap on

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.199 
and until you get that first wrap on
here<00:03:24.079> like<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.549> then<00:03:26.549> you'll<00:03:26.760> start<00:03:26.970> locking

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
here like that then you'll start locking

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.199 
here like that then you'll start locking
it<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.680> which<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.799> can<00:03:28.950> see<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.910> there's<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
it in which you can see so there's the

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.599 
it in which you can see so there's the
first<00:03:33.390> wrap<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:35.040> I'm<00:03:35.160> just<00:03:35.310> going<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.519> be

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
doing this err it definitely won't be as

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.680 
doing this err it definitely won't be as
good<00:04:22.070> it'll<00:04:23.070> get<00:04:23.190> all<00:04:23.220> loose<00:04:23.520> on<00:04:23.759> you<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.120> then

and tight as this one so again all I'm

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.580 
and tight as this one so again all I'm
doing<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.520> just<00:04:32.550> repeating<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.210> pattern

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
doing is just repeating that pattern

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.990 
doing is just repeating that pattern
kind<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:34.650> an<00:04:34.740> under<00:04:35.009> over<00:04:35.280> thing<00:04:37.759> it's<00:04:38.759> a<00:04:38.789> very

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
kind of an under over thing it's a very

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:54.170 
kind of an under over thing it's a very
simple<00:04:39.270> wrap<00:04:40.820> not<00:04:41.820> too<00:04:41.970> complicated<00:04:42.300> at<00:04:42.630> all

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.390
