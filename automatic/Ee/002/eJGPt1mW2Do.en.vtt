00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
crisis for example one of the big

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.760 
crisis for example one of the big
outstanding<00:00:51.390> questions<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.990> understanding

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
outstanding questions is understanding

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.330 
outstanding questions is understanding
the<00:00:53.340> optimal<00:00:53.790> funding<00:00:54.090> structure<00:00:54.450> for<00:00:54.630> banks

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
one of the reasons the financial crisis

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.660

was<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.080> severe<00:00:58.470> as<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.160> banks

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
was as severe as it is is because banks

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.050 
was as severe as it is is because banks
use<00:01:00.060> primarily<00:01:00.990> debt<00:01:01.290> financing<00:01:01.830> and<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.490> when

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
use primarily debt financing and so when

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.630 
use primarily debt financing and so when
their<00:01:03.570> profits<00:01:04.020> drop<00:01:04.410> many<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> banks

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
their profits drop many of the banks

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
their profits drop many of the banks
find<00:01:06.300> themselves<00:01:06.720> underwater<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.380> unable<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
find themselves underwater and unable to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.610 
find themselves underwater and unable to
continue<00:01:08.370> doubt<00:01:08.670> government<00:01:09.090> support<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
continue doubt government support and so

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.990 
continue doubt government support and so

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
in new ways but ultimately create value
