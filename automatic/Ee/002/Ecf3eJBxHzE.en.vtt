shape you see there on just a thick
piece<00:00:16.390> of<00:00:16.450> cardstock<00:00:16.950> sort<00:00:17.950> of<00:00:18.010> make<00:00:18.130> a<00:00:18.160> little

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
piece of cardstock sort of make a little

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.570 
piece of cardstock sort of make a little
template<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:20.320> then<00:00:20.859> you<00:00:20.949> want<00:00:21.130> to<00:00:21.189> put<00:00:21.400> that

on an edge and then I'm just going to

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:57.540 
on an edge and then I'm just going to
trace<00:00:28.539> it<00:00:28.750> out<00:00:28.900> with<00:00:29.170> any<00:00:29.740> pin<00:00:56.310> okay<00:00:57.310> now<00:00:57.490> you

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550
