00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.880
 how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.780
 tutorial I will teach you how to restore a 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.869
 backup on our samsung galaxy s 58 30 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.730
 m as we know a boat is a 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.929
 support of the entire system of our 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.900
 equipment this is used when it is done 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:27.630
 some procedure and this procedure 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.960
 it goes wrong then restoring the boat 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.379
 it will remain as we had it before 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.390
 if you pass them a glass 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.420
 remember to always put it inside the 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.710
 flower mode folder and within the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.420
 backup folder of our sd memory 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.339
 they always have to put it with the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.050
 original name of the backup 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.930
 as you see in this case in the value that 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.940
 I have here is a date because if you 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.370
 they change their names when trying to 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.559
 restore it will mark them a 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.379
 deconfiguration and just do not know 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.839
 You can restore it well to start with 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.970
 tutorial we have to put the file 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.039
 global mode that I leave in the 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.580
 description of the video in the root of 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:15.910
 our memory sd now let's move on to 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.100
 phone to restore our 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.649
 bank we need to enter mode 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.789
 recommended if they have the server or 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.960
 specific as I am very easy to do 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.369
 we just have to go to the bar 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.740
 notifications 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.009
 and we select the penultimate option that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.009
 He says 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.979
 As you will see, three options appear 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.580
 the first says the robot the second says 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.440
 recovery and the third division put 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.800
 we select option 2 which is 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.640
 recovery cos and then crush 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.640
 in accept 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.820
 but if you do not have this room we need 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.930
 do it the traditional way 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.930
 we will begin by turning off criminal 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:16.490
 now we keep oppressed volume more 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.490
 with my power animation 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.019
 once it descends we can release the 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.019
 buttons 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.100
 and now as you see and we enter the mode 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.050
 recovery on phones now 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.480
 we select the second option that says 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.480
 broad sd card 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.849
 and we select the balloon folder if 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.050
 Now what we have to do is go to 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.050
 the option that says backup and rest 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.650
 we select the second option that says 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.989
 response 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.989
 and as you will see here our paco appears 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.040
 Now what we have to do is 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.670
 press home 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.410
 and we select option 10 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.410
 and we wait for it to be restored 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.250
 to use the video and we'll come back when 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.250
 be restored 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.670
 well as you will see it's already finished 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.070
 restoring the bank now only remains 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.030
 select the finished ragusis option 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.030
 which is the first 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.410
 as you can see the boat was restored 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.410
 satisfactorily 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.240
 well that would be all for the tutorial of 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.069
