00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
so this thing basically this truck runs

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.060 
so this thing basically this truck runs
like<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:32.870> brand-new<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:36.260> thing<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.680> this

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
like it's brand-new this thing it this

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.530 
like it's brand-new this thing it this
thing<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.310> kind<00:02:37.460> of<00:02:37.490> airtight<00:02:37.910> in<00:02:38.060> here<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.420> it

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
thing is kind of airtight in here so it

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.260 
thing is kind of airtight in here so it
makes<00:02:38.690> sound<00:02:39.020> kind<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.350> weird<00:02:39.410> but<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:41.030> thing

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
makes sound kind of weird but this thing

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.490 
makes sound kind of weird but this thing
runs<00:02:41.600> pretty<00:02:42.110> good

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
runs pretty good

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.320 
runs pretty good
I<00:02:42.530> mean<00:02:43.370> I'll<00:02:43.490> rip<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.850> up<00:02:43.910> because<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.210> can

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
I mean I'll rip it up because you can

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.730 
I mean I'll rip it up because you can
hear<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:46.300> so<00:02:47.300> let's<00:02:48.140> go<00:02:48.230> around<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.500> block<00:02:48.710> so

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
hear it so let's go around the block so

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.110 
hear it so let's go around the block so
you<00:02:49.040> can<00:02:49.160> kind<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.430> see<00:02:49.610> how<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:49.940> thing

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
you can kind of see how this thing

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.710 
you can kind of see how this thing
drives<00:02:51.910> I'm<00:02:52.910> gonna<00:02:53.090> try<00:02:53.210> to<00:02:53.270> hold<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.540> camera

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
drives I'm gonna try to hold the camera

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.360 
drives I'm gonna try to hold the camera
here<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.290> dry<00:02:54.590> at<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.770> same<00:02:54.950> time<00:02:55.190> which

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
here and dry at the same time which

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:10.340 
here and dry at the same time which
would<00:02:55.490> be<00:02:55.610> kind<00:02:55.820> of<00:02:55.850> fun<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:58.340> away<00:02:58.910> here<00:02:59.180> we<00:02:59.300> go

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.590 

this<00:03:10.890> thing<00:03:11.130> has<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> real<00:03:11.640> loose<00:03:11.850> steering<00:03:12.210> so

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
this thing has a real loose steering so

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.810 
this thing has a real loose steering so
it's<00:03:12.780> very<00:03:13.020> easy<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.520> turn<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:16.370> this<00:03:17.370> thing<00:03:17.640> it

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
it's very easy to turn and this thing it

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.050 
it's very easy to turn and this thing it
has<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> tendency<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:19.340> oversteer<00:03:20.340> if<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.850> don't

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
has a tendency to oversteer if I don't

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.910 
has a tendency to oversteer if I don't
I'm<00:03:21.270> not<00:03:21.300> careful<00:03:21.720> here<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:22.380> let's<00:03:22.620> go<00:03:22.800> ahead

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
I'm not careful here so let's go ahead

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:44.940 
I'm not careful here so let's go ahead
and<00:03:23.220> go<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.460> way

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.699 

this<00:03:45.520> thing<00:03:45.760> drives<00:03:46.090> pretty<00:03:46.510> good<00:03:46.780> for<00:03:47.170> for<00:03:47.680> a

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
this thing drives pretty good for for a

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.970 
this thing drives pretty good for for a
1998<00:03:48.690> but<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.900> truck<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.260> mean<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.560> has<00:03:50.709> its

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
1998 but this truck I mean it has its

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.650 
1998 but this truck I mean it has its
faults<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.459> mean<00:03:51.610> it<00:03:51.760> has<00:03:51.879> dents<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.420> scratches

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
faults I mean it has dents and scratches

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.949 
faults I mean it has dents and scratches
and<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:54.069> four-wheel<00:03:54.430> drive<00:03:54.580> on<00:03:55.390> this<00:03:55.660> truck

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
and the four-wheel drive on this truck

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.250 
and the four-wheel drive on this truck
works<00:03:56.349> pretty<00:03:56.709> good<00:03:57.040> but<00:03:57.310> sometimes<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.870> it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
works pretty good but sometimes it it

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.570 
works pretty good but sometimes it it
doesn't<00:03:59.500> want<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.830> really<00:03:59.950> back<00:04:00.160> up<00:04:00.190> and

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
doesn't want to really back up and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.350 
doesn't want to really back up and
reverse<00:04:01.769> any<00:04:02.769> faster<00:04:03.250> than<00:04:03.459> five<00:04:03.910> miles<00:04:04.150> an

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
reverse any faster than five miles an

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.059 
reverse any faster than five miles an
hour<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:04.750> it's<00:04:04.959> not<00:04:05.110> really<00:04:05.290> meant<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.650> anyway

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
hour and it's not really meant to anyway

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.370 
hour and it's not really meant to anyway
but<00:04:06.340> it's<00:04:06.940> like<00:04:07.090> whatever<00:04:09.810> this<00:04:10.810> truck<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.140> mean

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
but it's like whatever this truck I mean

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.550 
but it's like whatever this truck I mean
a<00:04:11.410> frunze<00:04:11.769> pretty<00:04:12.099> good<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:13.110> we've<00:04:14.110> pulled<00:04:14.410> I

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
a frunze pretty good and we've pulled I

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.740 
a frunze pretty good and we've pulled I
have<00:04:14.739> I<00:04:14.950> had<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.220> 23-foot<00:04:15.730> both<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.269> used<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.570> pull

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
have I had a 23-foot both I used to pull

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.039 
have I had a 23-foot both I used to pull
with<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.910> just<00:04:18.910> do<00:04:19.150> all<00:04:19.180> kinds<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.570> stuff

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
with it and just do all kinds of stuff

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:27.210 
with it and just do all kinds of stuff
with<00:04:20.079> it<00:04:25.350> I'm<00:04:26.350> just<00:04:26.470> gonna<00:04:26.650> sit<00:04:26.919> here<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:27.070> wait

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
with it I'm just gonna sit here and wait

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.990 
with it I'm just gonna sit here and wait
on<00:04:27.310> this<00:04:27.460> light<00:04:27.639> to<00:04:27.760> change<00:04:27.940> over<00:04:32.850> but<00:04:33.850> this

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
on this light to change over but this

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.790 
on this light to change over but this
truck<00:04:34.300> when<00:04:34.450> it<00:04:34.600> came<00:04:34.750> standard<00:04:35.169> this<00:04:35.500> was<00:04:35.650> the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
truck when it came standard this was the

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.340 
truck when it came standard this was the
last<00:04:36.010> year<00:04:36.220> for<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.729> 1998<00:04:37.330> Silverado<00:04:37.750> was

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
last year for the 1998 Silverado was

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.650 
last year for the 1998 Silverado was
last<00:04:38.680> year<00:04:38.950> if<00:04:39.040> they<00:04:39.160> made<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.490> 5.7<00:04:40.389> liter<00:04:40.570> v8

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
last year if they made the 5.7 liter v8

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.180 
last year if they made the 5.7 liter v8
and<00:04:41.260> then<00:04:42.040> they<00:04:42.190> changed<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:42.729> over<00:04:42.820> to<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.169> 5.3

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
and then they changed it over to a 5.3

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.070 
and then they changed it over to a 5.3
liter<00:04:45.190> v8<00:04:45.280> and<00:04:45.850> they<00:04:46.479> just<00:04:46.630> increased<00:04:46.990> the

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
liter v8 and they just increased the

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.379 
liter v8 and they just increased the
torque<00:04:47.410> on<00:04:47.560> it<00:04:47.620> to<00:04:47.889> make<00:04:48.100> up<00:04:48.310> for<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:48.970> smaller

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
torque on it to make up for the smaller

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.409 
torque on it to make up for the smaller
engine<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.050> from<00:04:50.889> the<00:04:51.039> 5.3<00:04:51.580> then<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.120> went<00:04:52.240> to

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
engine and from the 5.3 then it went to

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.750 
engine and from the 5.3 then it went to
a<00:04:52.450> six<00:04:52.780> liter<00:04:53.050> and<00:04:53.320> then<00:04:54.130> from<00:04:54.430> there<00:04:54.610> I<00:04:54.639> went

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
a six liter and then from there I went

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.450 
a six liter and then from there I went
to<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.210> 6.6<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.229> six<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.710> six<00:04:56.950> point<00:04:57.190> six

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
to a 6.6 the six and the six point six

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.520 
to a 6.6 the six and the six point six
liters<00:04:57.820> are<00:04:58.210> both<00:04:58.479> diesel<00:04:58.750> this<00:04:59.229> is<00:04:59.410> an

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
liters are both diesel this is an

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.909 
liters are both diesel this is an
unleaded<00:05:00.000> so<00:05:01.000> I'm<00:05:01.090> in<00:05:01.270> this<00:05:01.389> truck<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:01.960> this

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
unleaded so I'm in this truck and this

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.790 
unleaded so I'm in this truck and this
was<00:05:03.400> kind<00:05:03.610> of<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:04.050> sweer<00:05:05.050> of<00:05:05.260> the<00:05:05.380> deal

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
was kind of the sweer of the deal

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:13.529 
was kind of the sweer of the deal
I<00:05:11.130> don't<00:05:12.130> really<00:05:12.280> hotrod<00:05:12.760> this<00:05:12.970> truck<00:05:13.270> but

I don't really hotrod this truck but
sometimes<00:05:14.110> if<00:05:14.350> I<00:05:14.470> fly<00:05:14.800> gonna<00:05:15.070> this<00:05:15.280> thing<00:05:15.490> it

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
sometimes if I fly gonna this thing it

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:28.189 
sometimes if I fly gonna this thing it
does<00:05:16.060> pretty<00:05:16.300> good<00:05:16.389> for<00:05:17.050> for<00:05:17.590> its<00:05:17.710> age

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.359 

yeah<00:05:29.199> the<00:05:29.319> only<00:05:29.559> stuff<00:05:29.799> that<00:05:29.829> I<00:05:29.979> have<00:05:30.219> to

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:30.369 
yeah the only stuff that I have to

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:32.879 
yeah the only stuff that I have to
really<00:05:30.899> I've<00:05:31.899> had<00:05:32.109> to<00:05:32.199> replace<00:05:32.529> that<00:05:32.739> was

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
really I've had to replace that was

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.979 
really I've had to replace that was
major<00:05:33.129> was<00:05:33.399> the<00:05:33.579> intake<00:05:33.879> manifold<00:05:34.329> gasket<00:05:34.749> and

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:34.989 
major was the intake manifold gasket and

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:39.029 
major was the intake manifold gasket and
the<00:05:35.859> power<00:05:36.069> steering<00:05:36.429> has<00:05:36.759> a<00:05:36.789> tendency<00:05:37.889> to<00:05:38.889> go

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
the power steering has a tendency to go

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.599 
the power steering has a tendency to go
out<00:05:39.249> fairly<00:05:39.609> often<00:05:39.909> and<00:05:41.099> that<00:05:42.099> was<00:05:42.249> kind<00:05:42.429> of<00:05:42.489> a

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:42.609 
out fairly often and that was kind of a

00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:46.349 
out fairly often and that was kind of a
headache<00:05:44.429> like<00:05:45.429> I<00:05:45.549> said<00:05:45.759> this<00:05:45.879> steering<00:05:46.239> is

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:46.359 
headache like I said this steering is

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:48.089 
headache like I said this steering is
pretty<00:05:46.599> loose<00:05:46.899> I<00:05:47.079> mean<00:05:47.229> one<00:05:47.379> finger<00:05:47.679> can<00:05:47.859> turn

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
pretty loose I mean one finger can turn

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.509 
pretty loose I mean one finger can turn
the<00:05:48.249> turn<00:05:48.639> the<00:05:48.759> wheel<00:05:48.909> pretty<00:05:49.329> good<00:05:49.889> so<00:05:50.889> we

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:51.519 
the turn the wheel pretty good so we

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:58.589 
the turn the wheel pretty good so we
should<00:05:51.699> be<00:05:51.729> going<00:05:52.029> in<00:05:52.149> a<00:05:52.209> minute<00:05:52.449> here<00:05:57.509> see<00:05:58.509> if

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
should be going in a minute here see if

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:07.290 
should be going in a minute here see if
I<00:05:58.689> can<00:05:58.839> make<00:05:58.989> this<00:05:59.139> turn<00:05:59.469> easily

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.439 

that<00:06:08.300> was<00:06:08.479> a<00:06:08.509> little<00:06:08.839> bit<00:06:08.929> of<00:06:09.020> a<00:06:09.110> gun<00:06:09.319> there
