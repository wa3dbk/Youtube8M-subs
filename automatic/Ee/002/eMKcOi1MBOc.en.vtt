00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.700
 hello everyone with you lenovo this video i 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.540
 I'll tell you about the favorite decorative 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.259
 cosmetics 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.950
 in the last 2 months and so what am i 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.650
 enjoyed 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.650
 from foundation creams it was such 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.990
 oriflame foundation from art studio 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.150
 me in shade 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.570
 oliver means i showed it to them 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.279
 several times already we are having with 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.830
 light reflecting consistency 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.949
 he has a pretty liquid but at the same time 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.199
 it masks some reddening well 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.620
 but the only negative is probably that 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.600
 the effect is not so long playing so let's say 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.570
 that is, it falls as if through 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.140
 some time here from what will be if 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.820
 distribute it in daylight 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.239
 It creates such an effect photoshop which 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.269
 very beautifully transmitted through the same 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.890
 camera but as I said literally 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.199
 after a few hours this effect 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.769
 disappears or to achieve it again 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.809
 need to update the foundation of powder i 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.570
 enjoyed all also their crumbly 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.500
 powders from pupa shade unfortunately not here 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.950
 you will already be saved 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.610
 but there was the darkest table and saw in 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.560
 the store 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.120
 from browser blush I'm still 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.810
 enjoyed armenians from bourgeois 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.980
 sculptor in shade 01 melts glue glue 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.480
 rose he goes with highlighter 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.140
 in the kit and here's a brush 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.390
 which but honestly you can say 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.680
 useless but I go highlighter sometimes 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.350
 she used just enough 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.710
 tough for Armenians blush you probably even 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.190
 don't see they are so tender pink 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.200
 with a peach shimmer 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.630
 colder further from the browser 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.050
 faberlic av kim bronzer he goes with them 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.550
 in one shade from a series of secret story 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.890
 matt bronzer that's enough 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.110
 I have already used a lot though due to 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.370
 the fact that he baked him enough 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.760
 very, very long time here so it looks 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.789
 on hand is very good 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.690
 pigmented at the same time im and not 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.330
 go too far that is, he is very good 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.800
 stew on face and highlighter 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.610
 used this highlighter 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.510
 gold 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.990
 here w7 moonlight chapter helped for sale 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.710
 on sites like ebay who cares here 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.990
 there is a small shimmer and you 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.800
 multicolored and mostly present 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.750
 roses are so close but him 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.550
 you will not be visible from the shadows and I 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.820
 did you use shadows from oriflame 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.670
 which is called moment duet specifically 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.180
 this chick me starry night here goes 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.450
 such a milky yellow tint and sulfur and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.740
 such delicate shades that day in 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.280
 good enough principle 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.880
 pigmented stew well and not 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.190
 Vulgar looks like the minimum in Kiev 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.730
 it is quite clear that for the evening I consider 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:08.470
 not well convey their color 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.720
 also for daytime makeup too i 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:16.150
 I use the shadows of the 3 fly cocktail series 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.010
 so they look like a peach here 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.989
 pink shade and such too complex 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:28.450
 brown lilac something like 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:31.510
 that they are also not bright just beautiful 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.570
 suitable for day makeup at work 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.410
 I alternated these previous shadows from 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.260
 oriflame and more for the evening Katia and 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.590
 one too i use shadows about 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.350
 fours from the autumn palette long ago 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.540
 I wanted to buy these shadows, and that's on 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.000
 I took some good discount 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.430
 I was very pleased not to say that 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.970
 wow presentation 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:02.459
 smart but for the shadows and I think you 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.459
 quite even considering their topic 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.530
 top row I think that's enough 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.299
 good pigmentation me she is quite 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.610
 arranging a prayer at all is gorgeous 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.670
 holding does not crumble and roll off and 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:20.380
 during the working day just 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:23.440
 sit perfectly and of course the base under the shadows 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.050
 and enjoyed from jeans like this 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.740
 she has so killed the consistency here 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.470
 exactly 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.630
 strikes and the base shadows look brighter even 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.940
 than packing unlike base father vince 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.630
 which only slightly extends them 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.479
 stamina 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.819
 but it is brighter and the color does not make further for 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.940
 eyebrow i used a pencil for 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:44.979
 eyebrow from essense shade 03 light brown 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.889
 so here it looks like it goes with 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.800
 Glitter is not matte, and reinforcing and I 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.960
 balm base for eyelashes and eyebrows 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.800
 which is called from the company belordesign 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.370
 Here is a Belarusian company very well 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.380
 held throughout the day 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.979
 so on and used mineral 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.759
 basis ted papers function at full 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.330
 trolls 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:12.490
 many times and showed a video about 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.229
 I have a lot of mineral makeup 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.319
 reviews of this word is very me 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:20.130
 I liked the perfect fit in color 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:23.319
 so I use it with pleasure 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.630
 further pencil from oriflame black here 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:29.110
 such an express circuit is called a 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.270
 which gives a clear black line exactly 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.120
 rich black shade not gray 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.330
 some kind of pale black is black 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.370
 which looks like in the eyes looks 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.509
 whether it is like a liquid eyeliner gel then 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:46.509
 there is bright and keeps the whole day and also 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.330
 eyeliner I used everything like that 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:51.789
 Here are Siberian health companies 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.250
 she is capillary in shade 02 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.940
 she's brown on me already 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.849
 dries up 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.610
 but in itself is a very handy thing 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:03.099
 because literally two waving hands and 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.409
 you already let eyes for a coupe as well 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.990
 use balm both body shop 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.690
 he smells so small 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.580
 small so light shade and on 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.740
 lips look like such a pancake or on 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.909
 pink while of course another plus 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.460
 soften you smell very good and with 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:26.380
 us on what we need finger namazov pulled 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:30.250
 tassel here but it does not bother me gave 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:32.169
 enjoyed brilliance ivan color 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.040
 trend like this angel all shades 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:37.070
 principle already know this brilliance 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.370
 such a soft pink cold shade 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:44.630
 which basically fits any 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:47.600
 to any glitter makeup all 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.940
 I used the essence of this 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.360
 coated 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:55.910
 he is called on top shade 03 hypothesis 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.450
 can be used on top of any lipstick 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:02.900
 then incorporates so let's say 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:05.480
 a lot of colorful glitters her well 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:09.950
 and such close or independently in 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:12.020
 shine looks so simple 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.620
 transparent with a lot of color 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.600
 sparkle 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.370
 also enjoyed from the Belarusian company 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.700
 relays which is called 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:23.300
 the elite that sent me to the walls on 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.580
 foot 985 didn’t hesitate too 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.480
 in vain her taxi praises such a brush 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.800
 which i love is not silicone fluffy 

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.060
 the same begins to wither so much and 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.070
 time but 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.550
 ideally it lengthens twists 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:39.380
 shares dream volume gorgeous and 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:42.050
 I used cereals like these two 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:45.290
 Varnish most often this from Rome and Landon 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.180
 Lycra pro in shade 306 velvet rose 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:50.390
 so cool pink shade and 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.850
 so milky pink here we are bengal 

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:55.960
 frame in shade 

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:59.360

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.520
 under any style so say this your 

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.940
 tassels I will not show everything from me 

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.740
 nothing has changed all the same brushes 

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.360

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.500
 thanks for watching everyone fine 

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.800
