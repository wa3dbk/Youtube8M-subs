00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.780
 hello friends my name is 'key' ortiz 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.490
 Welcome to sweet finish where 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.850
 you always have the best taste of 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.850
 mouth 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.380
 Today we will prepare a pallet 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.440
 pineapple with blackberry taking advantage of 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.750
 warmth and summer and everything will see 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.530
 how delicious is this recipe 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.079
 we only need a quarter cup 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.710
 of pineapple juice 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.879
 a cup of blackberries I're afraid of the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.120
 I found this frozen that they serve very 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.430
 good for making snow or pallets 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.949
 We have here a pineapple where we will 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.770
 split it and we're going to use two cups of 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:57.720
 pineapple in squares 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.350
 and we're going to use a spoonful of honey 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.010
 of corn in a blender we are going to liquefy 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.400
 the pineapple pieces the pineapple juice and 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.950
 the honey until leaving a smooth puree this 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.380
 It is added to the paddle molds up 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.300
 half of the mold we keep two 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.570
 spoonfuls of this puree and right there 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.450
 we add the blackberries we liquefy everything and 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.259
 we add this mixture to the rest of the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.810
 pallet mold we cover the mold and 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.060
 we keep in the freezer at least 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.240
 four hours good friends then here 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.000
 we already have our frozen pallets 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.579
 if they do not have I have these molds for 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.280
 pallets that I got but if they do not have 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.399
 molds can do it as they want in a 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.740
 tequila glass cup and with a 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.390
 wooden stick or in a small cup 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.260
 disposable and with a wooden stick 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.380
 as well 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.520
 It can 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.820
 and at the time of not to fight much in 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.119
 take it out we put a little water 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:08.700
 around so they come out easily and 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.700
