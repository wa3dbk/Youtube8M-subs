now where are the temples well this
depends<00:02:10.769> on<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.940> card<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.870> course<00:02:12.900> where

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
depends on the card and of course where

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.620 
depends on the card and of course where
you're<00:02:13.470> sitting<00:02:13.799> because<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:15.000> way<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.209> look<00:02:15.510> at

you're sitting because the way I look at

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.170 
you're sitting because the way I look at
the<00:02:15.720> card<00:02:15.959> so<00:02:16.889> if<00:02:17.010> I'm<00:02:17.130> sitting<00:02:17.340> here<00:02:17.819> this

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
the card so if I'm sitting here this

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.360 
the card so if I'm sitting here this
would<00:02:18.359> tell<00:02:18.569> me<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.900> above<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.950> temple

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
would tell me that above the temple

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.460 
would tell me that above the temple
there's<00:02:21.000> going<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.299> be<00:02:21.329> theirs<00:02:21.780> there<00:02:22.109> has<00:02:22.290> to

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
there's going to be theirs there has to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.069 
there's going to be theirs there has to
be<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.620> lake<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.030> left<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.359> it<00:02:24.480> there<00:02:24.780> has<00:02:24.900> to

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
be a lake to the left of it there has to

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.250 
be a lake to the left of it there has to
be<00:02:25.109> a<00:02:25.200> volcano<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.920> then<00:02:26.630> below<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.660> there<00:02:28.139> has

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
be a volcano and then below it there has

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.490 
be a volcano and then below it there has
to<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.560> mountain<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.819> with<00:02:30.389> the<00:02:31.049> changing

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
to be a mountain so with the changing

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.099 
to be a mountain so with the changing
landscape<00:02:31.769> these<00:02:32.579> conditions<00:02:33.269> will<00:02:33.810> end<00:02:33.959> up

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
landscape these conditions will end up

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:35.509 
landscape these conditions will end up
being<00:02:34.319> fulfilled<00:02:34.530> at<00:02:34.889> some<00:02:35.100> point<00:02:35.310> or<00:02:35.459> another

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
being fulfilled at some point or another

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.240 
being fulfilled at some point or another
okay<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:37.139> course<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.709> were<00:02:37.889> to<00:02:38.069> play

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
okay and of course if you were to play

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.890 
okay and of course if you were to play
the<00:02:38.700> conditions<00:02:39.209> would<00:02:39.359> be<00:02:39.420> slightly

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
the conditions would be slightly

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.449 
the conditions would be slightly
different<00:02:40.230> because<00:02:40.620> you're<00:02:40.859> seeing<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> card

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
different because you're seeing the card

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.920 
different because you're seeing the card
from<00:02:41.670> your<00:02:41.790> perspective

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
from your perspective

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.009 
from your perspective
so<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:44.010> this<00:02:44.129> particular<00:02:44.340> case<00:02:44.969> one<00:02:45.629> spot

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
so for this particular case one spot

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.619 
so for this particular case one spot
that<00:02:46.049> would<00:02:46.349> be<00:02:46.469> good<00:02:46.680> would<00:02:47.010> be<00:02:47.420> let's<00:02:48.420> see

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
that would be good would be let's see

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.149 
that would be good would be let's see
well<00:02:50.269> yeah<00:02:51.269> here<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.959> particular<00:02:52.379> Island<00:02:52.799> I

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
well yeah here this particular Island I

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.020 
well yeah here this particular Island I
have<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> lake<00:02:54.299> that's<00:02:55.019> above<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.920> I'm<00:02:56.280> playing

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
have a lake that's above it I'm playing

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.149 
have a lake that's above it I'm playing
from<00:02:57.269> this<00:02:57.480> side<00:02:57.719> I<00:02:57.989> have<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> volcano<00:03:01.159> that's

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
from this side I have a volcano that's

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.520 
from this side I have a volcano that's
to<00:03:02.969> the<00:03:03.030> left<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.719> that's<00:03:04.319> why<00:03:04.469> you

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
to the left of it and that's why you

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.020 
to the left of it and that's why you
have<00:03:04.709> these<00:03:04.829> dashed<00:03:05.189> lines<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.819> better

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
have these dashed lines to a better

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.539 
have these dashed lines to a better
orient<00:03:06.510> yourself<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.139> we<00:03:07.739> have<00:03:07.920> mountains

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
orient yourself and we have mountains

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.229 
orient yourself and we have mountains
below<00:03:09.299> it<00:03:09.659> okay<00:03:10.230> once<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.129> place<00:03:11.340> your<00:03:11.489> temple

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
below it okay once you place your temple

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.110 
below it okay once you place your temple
they<00:03:13.079> have<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:14.370> effect<00:03:14.609> of<00:03:14.760> giving<00:03:15.060> you

points at the end of the games and of

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.610 
points at the end of the games and of
course<00:03:17.760> they'll<00:03:18.419> end<00:03:18.599> up<00:03:18.720> giving<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.169> more

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
actions and more objective cars as you

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.759 
actions and more objective cars as you
move<00:03:22.859> along<00:03:22.980> as<00:03:23.099> this<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.700> player<00:03:23.939> II<00:03:24.769> so

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
move along as this is the player II so

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.339 
move along as this is the player II so
as<00:03:25.859> you<00:03:26.010> build<00:03:26.220> more<00:03:26.459> temples<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.989> reveal

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
as you build more temples you reveal

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.920 
as you build more temples you reveal
more<00:03:28.560> options<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:30.329> game<00:03:30.480> will<00:03:30.599> actually

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
more options and the game will actually

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.280 
more options and the game will actually
end<00:03:30.959> when<00:03:31.439> a<00:03:31.709> player<00:03:32.340> builds<00:03:32.849> his<00:03:33.359> or<00:03:33.629> her<00:03:33.810> last

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
end when a player builds his or her last

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.140 
end when a player builds his or her last
temple<00:03:35.989> so<00:03:36.989> that's<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.439> gist<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.459> just<00:03:39.060> a

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
temple so that's the gist of it just a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.869 
temple so that's the gist of it just a
game<00:03:39.359> I'm<00:03:40.139> not<00:03:40.349> show<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:41.040> objectives<00:03:41.609> will

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
game I'm not show the objectives will

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.909 
game I'm not show the objectives will
vary<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.510> instance<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:42.989> could<00:03:43.109> have<00:03:43.290> two

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
vary for instance you could have two

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.860 
vary for instance you could have two
points<00:03:44.340> for<00:03:44.519> temple<00:03:44.909> on<00:03:45.030> an<00:03:45.150> island<00:03:45.299> with<00:03:45.540> the

points for temple on an island with the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.920 
points for temple on an island with the
trees<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:49.650> one<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.389> three<00:03:51.389> points<00:03:51.629> per

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
trees this one is three points per

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.219 
trees this one is three points per
temples<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.949> are<00:03:53.010> one<00:03:53.609> portage<00:03:54.269> away<00:03:54.599> from

the island thera a Portage's because of

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.349 
the island thera a Portage's because of
course<00:03:58.709> not<00:03:58.919> everything<00:03:59.340> will<00:03:59.699> be<00:03:59.819> connected

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
course not everything will be connected

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.659 
course not everything will be connected
but<00:04:00.959> in<00:04:01.169> the<00:04:01.319> game<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.739> possible<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.459> move

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
but in the game it is possible to move

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.240 
but in the game it is possible to move
from<00:04:02.970> one<00:04:03.239> doc<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:04.109> another<00:04:04.470> on<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.769> same

okay and so you'll end when the two here

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.660 
okay and so you'll end when the two here
and<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.410> score<00:04:13.680> points<00:04:13.860> based<00:04:14.220> on<00:04:14.430> these

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
and you score points based on these

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.430 
and you score points based on these
objectives<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.629> you<00:04:15.750> have<00:04:15.930> on<00:04:16.230> the

objectives<00:04:16.949> and<00:04:17.160> of<00:04:17.400> course<00:04:17.699> the<00:04:18.600> maps<00:04:19.669> deadly

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
objectives and of course the maps deadly

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.030 
objectives and of course the maps deadly
and<00:04:20.940> they<00:04:21.570> have<00:04:21.720> varying<00:04:22.079> difficulty<00:04:22.650> levels

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
and they have varying difficulty levels

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.360 
and they have varying difficulty levels
of<00:04:23.250> course<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.669> have<00:04:23.790> easy<00:04:24.750> because<00:04:25.620> 3<00:04:26.130> to

of course you have easy because 3 to

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.480 
of course you have easy because 3 to
uncover<00:04:26.790> only<00:04:27.030> worth<00:04:27.510> one<00:04:27.810> point<00:04:28.340> but<00:04:29.340> the

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
possible actions is to buy maps and

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.240 
possible actions is to buy maps and
depending<00:04:49.919> on<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:51.530> value<00:04:52.530> of<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.830> map<00:04:52.979> the

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
depending on the value of the map the

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.890 
depending on the value of the map the
cost<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.669> purchase<00:04:53.940> will<00:04:54.330> be<00:04:54.360> different

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
cost to purchase will be different

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.900 
cost to purchase will be different
another<00:04:55.620> thing<00:04:55.950> that<00:04:55.979> I<00:04:56.190> should<00:04:56.610> specify

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
another thing that I should specify

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.540 
another thing that I should specify
because<00:04:57.540> of<00:04:57.660> course<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.560> icons<00:04:58.979> being<00:04:59.250> very

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
because of course the icons being very

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.010 
because of course the icons being very
important<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.150> can<00:05:00.300> end<00:05:00.570> in<00:05:00.750> a<00:05:00.840> situation

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
important you can end in a situation

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.770 
important you can end in a situation
where<00:05:01.680> you're<00:05:01.800> getting<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.220> map<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.780> well

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
where you're getting a map that well

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.680 
where you're getting a map that well
there<00:05:04.470> is<00:05:04.590> no<00:05:04.760> possible<00:05:05.760> solution<00:05:05.820> for<00:05:06.600> you

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
there is no possible solution for you

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.320 
there is no possible solution for you
which<00:05:07.050> is<00:05:07.260> why<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.950> can<00:05:08.160> invoke<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.729> Oracles

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
which is why you can invoke the Oracles

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.050 
which is why you can invoke the Oracles
at<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:09.660> end<00:05:09.780> of<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:10.190> instead<00:05:11.190> of<00:05:11.220> drawing<00:05:11.610> the

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
at the end of the instead of drawing the

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.000 
at the end of the instead of drawing the
first<00:05:12.300> out<00:05:12.539> for<00:05:12.750> free<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.229> can<00:05:13.260> use<00:05:13.530> an<00:05:13.680> action

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
first out for free you can use an action

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.400 
first out for free you can use an action
and<00:05:14.190> request<00:05:14.700> a<00:05:14.970> symbol<00:05:15.539> so<00:05:15.960> you're<00:05:16.080> going<00:05:16.289> to

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
and request a symbol so you're going to

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.250 
and request a symbol so you're going to
flip<00:05:16.650> tiles<00:05:17.100> let's<00:05:17.310> say<00:05:17.460> I<00:05:17.490> want<00:05:18.000> a<00:05:18.030> volcano<00:05:18.600> so

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
flip tiles let's say I want a volcano so

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.140 
flip tiles let's say I want a volcano so
I'll<00:05:19.350> flip<00:05:19.590> tiles<00:05:19.860> until<00:05:20.070> I<00:05:20.220> get<00:05:20.460> one<00:05:20.669> that's

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
I'll flip tiles until I get one that's

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.550 
I'll flip tiles until I get one that's
going<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.360> be<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:21.600> tile<00:05:21.810> out<00:05:21.960> play<00:05:22.169> next<00:05:22.350> turn

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
going to be the tile out play next turn

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.730 
going to be the tile out play next turn
okay<00:05:23.960> thanks<00:05:24.960> very<00:05:25.110> much<00:05:25.139> for<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.440> overview

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
okay thanks very much for the overview

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.890 
okay thanks very much for the overview
wins<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.340> expected<00:05:26.789> release<00:05:26.910> dates<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:27.750> then

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
wins the expected release dates and then

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.629 
wins the expected release dates and then
something<00:05:28.139> in<00:05:28.320> mind<00:05:28.500> currently<00:05:29.280> we're

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
something in mind currently we're

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.730 
something in mind currently we're
evaluating<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.419> production<00:05:31.080> schedule<00:05:31.590> and

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
evaluating the production schedule and

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.490 
evaluating the production schedule and
everything<00:05:31.830> but<00:05:32.400> at<00:05:33.270> this<00:05:33.630> time<00:05:33.690> I'd<00:05:34.139> say<00:05:34.349> that

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
everything but at this time I'd say that

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.800 
everything but at this time I'd say that
origins<00:05:35.010> might<00:05:35.250> be<00:05:35.430> a<00:05:35.460> fair<00:05:35.940> target<00:05:36.419> for<00:05:36.630> so

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
origins might be a fair target for so

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.210 
origins might be a fair target for so
roughly<00:05:37.740> mid-2014<00:05:38.930> mid-2014<00:05:39.930> yes<00:05:40.320> okay

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
roughly mid-2014 mid-2014 yes okay

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.890 
roughly mid-2014 mid-2014 yes okay
thanks<00:05:41.669> very<00:05:41.820> much<00:05:41.849> whatever<00:05:42.120> view<00:05:42.360> hope<00:05:42.720> that

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
thanks very much whatever view hope that
