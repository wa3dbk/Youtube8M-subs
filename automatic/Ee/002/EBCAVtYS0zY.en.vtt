00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello good night see if you no longer know 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.860
 how you play a song that is not 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.160
 which I usually hang from orbits 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.679
 John Lennon for the meat or any of 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.269
 these singers but that is the song 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.880
 of a movie the death had a 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.920
 price in the movie of the year 1965 that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.590
 yes that allows you to work a little bit 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 ligatures and touches under and already 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.670
 you will see how an interesting song is 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.870
 to practice it is also pretty 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.870
 the lid of labor explained 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.680
 t 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.070
 do not 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.200
 do not 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.770
 no no 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.770
 do not 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.680
 t 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.680
 no no no 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.629
 do not 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.069
 d 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.650
 well you have seen that this song 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.650
 has very few minor re chords' 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.030
 Sun 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.000
 yes flat that can be put here but 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:30.820
 well I then put it here 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.550
 this position is equivalent to this this 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.760
 and this this you know you can not 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.970
 put like that you can put it like that and you can 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.350
 put so I prefer this time in 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.750
 concrete go using this same 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.430
 position and sliding it down the stick more 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.650
 down below 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.719
 it is really above everything else 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.519
 down on the neck is higher than pitch 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:58.030
 alright then those are the chords and the 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.030
 rhythm 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.200
 that is the basic risk 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.860
 you see and when I play re minor expired in 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.140
 the fourth string the fourth largest is the 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.000
 note therefore the fundamental note of 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.650
 the cor de re minor de re major de 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.170
 respective of all the rays all the 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.830
 that they ask for straight and then I make a 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:25.540
 ligature with the third rope 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.540
 raising your finger and stepping 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.150
 fifth quarter 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.220
 that was very similar to what it sounds like in 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.220
 the soundtrack of this movie 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.960
 ligature 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.470
 I love 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.039
 when we passed and prison fav I 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.430
 what I do to give them a little 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:08.990
 flavor more of the west is simply 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.990
 all the bordones 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.579
 when 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.579
 you do not know what 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.860
 do not 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.220
 with this sound of gordon is only 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.289
 is watching one more is imagining is 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.560
 one more riding the horses there by 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.560
 West 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.350
 those are the two basic touches that there are 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.419
 to use in this song with a 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.430
 a little bit of practice because it sounds good 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.889
 especially one that has the ability to 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.150
 that the whistle does not like me the whistle 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.039
 it works well 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.630
 if the ball had not been consumed it 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.120
 You can cut and as I do I 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.569
 got it certainly goes better until 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.569
 the next
