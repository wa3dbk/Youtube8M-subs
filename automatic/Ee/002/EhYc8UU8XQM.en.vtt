I think they stick a little less yea
they<00:02:21.040> stick<00:02:21.340> less<00:02:22.230> they<00:02:23.230> shuffle<00:02:23.620> about<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
they stick less they shuffle about the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.390 
they stick less they shuffle about the
same<00:02:24.810> if<00:02:25.810> not<00:02:26.110> better<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.980> just<00:02:27.160> feels<00:02:27.280> like

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
same if not better it just feels like

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.240 
same if not better it just feels like
they're<00:02:27.580> more<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:27.970> sticky<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.070> they

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
they're more like sticky and it they

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.530 
they're more like sticky and it they
like<00:02:30.400> harder<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.790> harder<00:02:31.030> that's<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.240> shuffle

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
like harder and harder that's a shuffle

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.460 
yeah I could tell that these are a
player's<00:04:32.419> choice<00:04:32.630> because<00:04:32.900> like<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.289> don't

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
player's choice because like I don't

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.110 
player's choice because like I don't
know<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:33.770> personally<00:04:34.400> use<00:04:34.610> players<00:04:34.880> toys

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
know that I personally use players toys

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.029 
know that I personally use players toys
but<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.539> could<00:04:35.960> use<00:04:36.139> these<00:04:36.320> like<00:04:36.680> these<00:04:36.889> are

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
but I could use these like these are

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.680 
but I could use these like these are
these<00:04:37.550> are<00:04:37.580> high<00:04:37.759> like<00:04:37.940> much<00:04:38.060> mostly<00:04:38.360> like

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
these are high like much mostly like

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.810 
these are high like much mostly like
slippery<00:04:39.110> like<00:04:39.259> ultra<00:04:39.800> pros<00:04:39.979> and<00:04:40.280> they're

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
slippery like ultra pros and they're

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.159 
slippery like ultra pros and they're
really<00:04:41.000> easy<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.240> shuffle<00:04:41.599> because

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
really easy to shuffle because

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.300 
really easy to shuffle because
throughout<00:04:42.410> like<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.710> whole<00:04:42.830> tournament<00:04:43.039> I

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
throughout like a whole tournament I

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.189 
throughout like a whole tournament I
mean<00:04:43.460> it'd<00:04:43.759> be<00:04:43.820> nice<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:44.120> have<00:04:44.389> sleeves<00:04:45.110> that

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
mean it'd be nice to have sleeves that

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.480 
mean it'd be nice to have sleeves that
you<00:04:45.259> can<00:04:45.380> actually<00:04:45.470> shuffle<00:04:45.889> so<00:04:46.099> well<00:04:48.280> I'd<00:04:49.280> say

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
you can actually shuffle so well I'd say

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.610 
you can actually shuffle so well I'd say
I<00:04:49.520> still<00:04:49.759> like<00:04:49.940> your<00:04:50.150> player's<00:04:50.900> choice<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.530> I

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
I still like your player's choice and I

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.960 
I still like your player's choice and I
guess<00:04:51.830> I'm<00:04:51.949> not<00:04:51.979> as<00:04:52.190> disgusting<00:04:52.490> as<00:04:52.699> I<00:04:52.820> thought

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
guess I'm not as disgusting as I thought

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.870 
guess I'm not as disgusting as I thought
um<00:04:54.130> but<00:04:55.130> these<00:04:55.520> are<00:04:55.820> definitely<00:04:56.180> nice<00:04:56.870> leaves

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
um but these are definitely nice leaves

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.370 
um but these are definitely nice leaves
like<00:04:58.880> I<00:04:59.060> like<00:04:59.240> I<00:04:59.449> like<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.810> wiggly<00:05:00.050> shuffle

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
like I like I like the wiggly shuffle

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.620 
like I like I like the wiggly shuffle
because<00:05:01.039> I<00:05:01.460> noticed<00:05:02.090> when<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.270> was<00:05:02.330> shuffling

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
because I noticed when I was shuffling

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.969 
because I noticed when I was shuffling
these<00:05:02.840> like<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:03.229> wasn't<00:05:03.409> dropping<00:05:03.650> as<00:05:03.830> many

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979

these like I wasn't dropping as many
cards<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:05.030> then<00:05:05.210> when<00:05:05.330> I<00:05:05.389> shuffling<00:05:05.750> these<00:05:05.870> I

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
cards and then when I shuffling these I

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.689 
cards and then when I shuffling these I
was<00:05:06.199> dropping<00:05:06.440> more<00:05:06.979> cards<00:05:07.310> it's<00:05:07.520> like<00:05:07.669> a
