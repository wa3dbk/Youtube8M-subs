00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
camera is picking it up but usually just

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.230

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
just makes a little stickier so it

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.780 
just makes a little stickier so it
doesn't<00:03:59.240> just<00:03:59.390> drip<00:03:59.840> off<00:04:00.370> when<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.490> ribs<00:04:01.640> are

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790
