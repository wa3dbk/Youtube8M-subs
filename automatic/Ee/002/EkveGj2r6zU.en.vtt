almost<00:01:38.540> just<00:01:39.540> look<00:01:39.780> at<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> shoe<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.320> just

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
almost just look at the shoe is just

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.840 
almost just look at the shoe is just
like<00:01:40.650> almost<00:01:40.860> totally<00:01:41.220> different<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
like almost totally different this is a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.300 
like almost totally different this is a
lighter<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:43.170> lighter<00:01:43.409> cement<00:01:43.920> grey<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
lighter that lighter cement grey and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.639 
lighter that lighter cement grey and
this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.729> they<00:01:45.720> call<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.110> cool<00:01:46.409> grey

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
this is that they call this cool grey

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.460 
this is that they call this cool grey
but<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> darker<00:01:48.110> start<00:01:49.110> picking<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
but it's like a darker start picking the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.830 
but it's like a darker start picking the
usual<00:01:49.770> typical<00:01:50.310> cool<00:01:50.579> grey<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.659> has

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
usual typical cool grey and this has

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.520 
usual typical cool grey and this has
that<00:01:55.020> new<00:01:55.200> tumbled<00:01:55.649> nubuck<00:01:56.430> favoring<00:01:56.850> using

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
that new tumbled nubuck favoring using

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.959 
that new tumbled nubuck favoring using
this<00:01:58.530> has<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:59.009> tumbled<00:01:59.520> leather<00:01:59.549> here

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
this has a little tumbled leather here

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.690 
this has a little tumbled leather here
and<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.390> has<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> stiff<00:02:01.140> leather<00:02:02.009> on

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
and then this has a stiff leather on

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.100 
and then this has a stiff leather on
leather<00:02:02.729> right<00:02:03.329> there<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:03.869> here

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.359 

they<00:02:08.110> could<00:02:08.319> have<00:02:08.410> put<00:02:08.530> an<00:02:08.619> infrared<00:02:08.890> jump<00:02:09.280> me

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
they could have put an infrared jump me

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.720 
they could have put an infrared jump me
on<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.580> back<00:02:09.729> but<00:02:09.940> they<00:02:10.030> needed<00:02:10.209> black<00:02:14.730> them

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
on the back but they needed black them

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.070 
on the back but they needed black them
in<00:02:15.879> a<00:02:15.910> little<00:02:16.090> quick<00:02:16.239> comparison<00:02:16.569> for<00:02:16.989> you

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
in a little quick comparison for you

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.500 
in a little quick comparison for you
guys<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.650> think<00:02:18.400> about<00:02:18.640> picking<00:02:18.940> these<00:02:19.060> joints

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
guys I think about picking these joints

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.449 
guys I think about picking these joints
up<00:02:19.690> these<00:02:19.870> are<00:02:20.050> April<00:02:20.349> twelfth<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.920> these

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
up these are April twelfth and these

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.009 
up these are April twelfth and these
world<00:02:21.790> where<00:02:21.970> these<00:02:22.239> were<00:02:22.480> released<00:02:22.840> today

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
world where these were released today

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.900 
world where these were released today
January<00:02:23.860> 25th<00:02:25.170> let<00:02:26.170> me<00:02:26.260> know<00:02:26.379> which<00:02:26.500> ones<00:02:26.910> you

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
January 25th let me know which ones you

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.190 
January 25th let me know which ones you
guys<00:02:28.120> would<00:02:28.330> take<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.810> had<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.019> choose
