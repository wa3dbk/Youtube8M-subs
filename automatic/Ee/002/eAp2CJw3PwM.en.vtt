how to switch kickflip on a fingerboard

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.540 
how to switch kickflip on a fingerboard
a<00:00:25.990> switch<00:00:26.990> flip<00:00:27.170> is<00:00:27.380> a<00:00:27.410> kickflip<00:00:27.860> performed<00:00:28.460> in

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
a switch flip is a kickflip performed in

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.609 
a switch flip is a kickflip performed in
the<00:00:28.640> switch<00:00:28.850> stance<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:29.810> everything<00:00:30.380> is<00:00:30.500> the

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
the switch stance so everything is the

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.109 
the switch stance so everything is the
complete<00:00:30.980> opposite<00:00:31.460> from<00:00:31.520> a<00:00:31.760> regular

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
complete opposite from a regular

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.119 
complete opposite from a regular
kickflip<00:00:32.509> from<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.199> direction<00:00:33.469> you<00:00:33.680> ride<00:00:33.890> in

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
kickflip from the direction you ride in

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.559 
kickflip from the direction you ride in
to<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.430> movements<00:00:34.789> of<00:00:34.879> your<00:00:34.909> fingers<00:00:35.329> you

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:35.569 
to the movements of your fingers you

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.000 
to the movements of your fingers you
should<00:00:35.899> really<00:00:36.079> learn<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.319> switch<00:00:36.739> ollie

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
should really learn to switch ollie

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.399 
should really learn to switch ollie
before<00:00:37.489> trying<00:00:37.789> this<00:00:37.969> trick<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:38.749> once<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:39.260> can

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:39.409 
before trying this trick so once you can

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:40.779 
before trying this trick so once you can
do<00:00:39.499> that<00:00:39.649> you're<00:00:40.010> ready<00:00:40.129> to<00:00:40.280> learn<00:00:40.429> switch

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
do that you're ready to learn switch

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.239 
do that you're ready to learn switch
kick<00:00:40.999> flips<00:00:41.239> here's<00:00:41.870> how<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.050> do<00:00:42.199> them<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:43.100> do<00:00:43.219> a

rotating towards you and keep your hand

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.960 
rotating towards you and keep your hand
above<00:01:01.249> the<00:01:01.429> board<00:01:01.699> as<00:01:01.969> it<00:01:01.999> rotates<00:01:03.850> once<00:01:04.850> the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
above the board as it rotates once the

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.039 
above the board as it rotates once the
board<00:01:05.150> completes<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.479> single<00:01:05.780> kickflip

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
board completes a single kickflip

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.260 
board completes a single kickflip
rotation<00:01:06.560> catch<00:01:07.010> it<00:01:07.160> with<00:01:07.250> both<00:01:07.430> fingers<00:01:07.790> land

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
rotation catch it with both fingers land

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.630 
rotation catch it with both fingers land
and<00:01:08.600> roll<00:01:08.810> away<00:01:08.920> switch<00:01:09.920> flips<00:01:10.190> are<00:01:10.280> generally

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
and roll away switch flips are generally

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.830 
and roll away switch flips are generally
a<00:01:10.700> lot<00:01:10.910> more<00:01:10.970> difficult<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.630> learn<00:01:11.780> than

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
a lot more difficult to learn than

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.420 
a lot more difficult to learn than
knowledge<00:01:12.170> flips<00:01:12.560> because<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.190> don't<00:01:13.340> have

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
knowledge flips because you don't have

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.040 
knowledge flips because you don't have
that<00:01:13.520> same<00:01:13.700> forward<00:01:14.120> momentum<00:01:14.240> that's<00:01:14.900> why

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
that same forward momentum that's why

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.180 
that same forward momentum that's why
when<00:01:15.200> you're<00:01:15.320> doing<00:01:15.500> a<00:01:15.560> switch<00:01:15.770> flip<00:01:15.950> it's

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
when you're doing a switch flip it's

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.830 
when you're doing a switch flip it's
really<00:01:16.430> important<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:16.850> pop<00:01:17.000> really<00:01:17.390> hard<00:01:17.690> off

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
really important you pop really hard off

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.630 
really important you pop really hard off
the<00:01:17.870> tail<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:18.800> get<00:01:18.950> your<00:01:19.070> board<00:01:19.250> Hein<00:01:19.460> up

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
the tail so you get your board Hein up

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.160 
the tail so you get your board Hein up
into<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.060> air<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.240> complete<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.780> full<00:01:20.990> rotation

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
into the air to complete a full rotation

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.780 
into the air to complete a full rotation
however<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:22.160> want<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.370> make<00:01:22.490> sure<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:22.700> don't

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
however you want to make sure you don't

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.730 
however you want to make sure you don't
do<00:01:22.940> what's<00:01:23.120> called<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.450> rollback<00:01:23.750> that's<00:01:24.530> where

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
do what's called a rollback that's where

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.350 
do what's called a rollback that's where
you<00:01:24.830> begin<00:01:25.100> riding<00:01:25.430> forward<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.120> do<00:01:26.210> your

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
you begin riding forward to do your

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.030 
you begin riding forward to do your
switch<00:01:26.600> flip<00:01:26.870> but<00:01:27.260> then<00:01:27.380> go<00:01:27.470> back<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.860> other

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
switch flip but then go back the other

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.070 
switch flip but then go back the other
direction<00:01:28.250> before<00:01:28.820> popping<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.330> board<00:01:29.570> to

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
direction before popping the board to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.690 
direction before popping the board to
try<00:01:30.230> to<00:01:30.350> get<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.620> tainment<00:01:30.920> nollie<00:01:31.340> type

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
try to get the tainment nollie type

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.580 
try to get the tainment nollie type
momentum<00:01:32.270> just<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.690> know<00:01:32.810> what<00:01:33.050> not<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.440> do

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
momentum just so you know what not to do

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.870 
momentum just so you know what not to do
this<00:01:33.890> is<00:01:34.100> what<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.250> switch<00:01:34.490> vote<00:01:34.670> for<00:01:34.820> the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
this is what a switch vote for the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.959 
this is what a switch vote for the
rollback<00:01:35.150> looks<00:01:35.390> like

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.249 

now<00:01:39.969> just<00:01:40.210> like<00:01:40.329> with<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.479> nollie<00:01:40.719> flip<00:01:41.020> when

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
now just like with a nollie flip when

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.179 
now just like with a nollie flip when
you<00:01:41.320> do<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.439> switch<00:01:41.740> flip<00:01:41.979> your<00:01:42.159> wrist

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
you do a switch flip your wrist

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.039 
you do a switch flip your wrist
shouldn't<00:01:42.640> be<00:01:42.700> turning<00:01:42.939> at<00:01:43.179> all<00:01:43.329> just<00:01:43.929> your

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
shouldn't be turning at all just your
