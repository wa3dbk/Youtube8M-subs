with this part one here which I polished

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840

up<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.680> little<00:01:13.710> bit<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.220> I'll<00:01:14.369> fix<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.729> as

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
up just a little bit but I'll fix it as

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.429 
up just a little bit but I'll fix it as
we<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.090> back<00:01:15.299> through<00:01:15.330> alright<00:01:16.170> we're<00:01:16.350> going

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
we go back through alright we're going

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.249 
we go back through alright we're going
to<00:01:16.530> start<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.909> key<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.150> G<00:01:18.450> now<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:19.080> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
to start in the key of G now this is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.980 
to start in the key of G now this is
actually<00:01:19.650> written<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.310> a-flat<00:01:20.990> but

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
actually written here in a-flat but

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.690 
actually written here in a-flat but
that's<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.740> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> bummer<00:01:23.549> for

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
that's really going to be a bummer for

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.109 
that's really going to be a bummer for
us<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.150> I'm<00:01:24.360> imagining<00:01:24.659> they<00:01:25.049> probably<00:01:25.320> tuned

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
us so I'm imagining they probably tuned

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.789 
us so I'm imagining they probably tuned
differently<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.540> played<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.590> key<00:01:28.770> of

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
differently and played it in the key of

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.539 
differently and played it in the key of
G<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.460> that's<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.450> we're<00:01:30.570> gonna<00:01:30.689> do<00:01:30.869> here

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
G so that's what we're gonna do here

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.010 
G so that's what we're gonna do here
probably<00:01:32.549> used<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> capo<00:01:33.180> or<00:01:33.329> something<00:01:33.720> so

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
probably used a capo or something so

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.640 
probably used a capo or something so
we're<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.229> gonna<00:01:34.439> play<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> key<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.220> G<00:01:35.460> here
