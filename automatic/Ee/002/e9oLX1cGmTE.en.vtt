00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 staring at people a bit like 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.580
 we think the branch is a sharing to 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.980
 People are going to try to bring the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.179
 advantage for the river is here speaking 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.590
 that you have to eliminate the match from 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.230
 anyway 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.000
 if possible, fine, let's try to see 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.619
 with the advantage how it was that people 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.560
 found it until he could not 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.789
 a goal off and that we had a 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.119
 A little more tranquility, we 'll go 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.849
 to try to bring an edge 11 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.830
 but I did not say if I could eliminate the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.590
 game back will be very important until 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.630
 For this time we will be inactive 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.309
 You will have an inter season 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.010
 people can focus only on the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.559
 Brazil, we can not wait until 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.480
 day 29 and day 30 that you can play against 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.610
 the bridge in the second game at home then 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.110
 by then the maracanã will be more beautiful 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.899
 from what is now 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.430
 It is not but if it is to have the game back 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.170
 We did not pronounce each other but counted 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.670
 that we had the game back and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.620
 get rating 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.820
 He is already accustomed if there is no game. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.870
 Wednesday and Sunday and went to complain that it is 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.399
 game behind game 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.250
 if you have no game and complain that you do not have 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.400
 together is one thing that happened but for 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.630
 blame our day on one of not 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.700
 get to the finals of Rio 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.070
 they will make nobody like to train more 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.159
 It's already what we need. 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.689
 idle time was by mistake of own 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.220
 group and if he would not be playing the finals 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.390
 so this time we have to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.630
 enjoy as much as possible and 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.500
 training so that we did not see 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.369
 they struggled like as how they end up 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 taking the canopy from the northeast 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.130
 ended up being a bit even more publicized 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.229
 here mainly to the finals but 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.850
 no doubt tomorrow at the next moment 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.130
 before the start, jorginho must pass 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.689
 a more specific thing think 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.759
 highlighting some athletes who may 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.750
 make a difference so we do not come 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.369
 Why do not we want to be? 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.689
 surprised if we get 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.990
 repeat right 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.310
 in addition to repeating the team only 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.700
 in the last games he presented a football 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.320
 much better today 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.060
 this is usually the way we live with 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.240
 the jorginho is no doubt now 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.250
 no problems at all and that comes 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.370
 playing well even when he did not play with 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.110
 team theoretically the team presented 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.790
 a good football the scheme is being 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.540
 practically repeated the last 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.160
 departures 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.540
 that you already get to have a little 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.280
 plus the face of the river 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.459
 but we know we need to improve. 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.500
 much more the flamengo that enters always is 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.290
 r depends on the championship that the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.400
 history has not been the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.410
 people know that we need 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.840
 reinforcements the board is chasing after 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.280
 This team is still going to do a lot 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.019
 joys to fans coming and going 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.069
 answers after the board is 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.180
 promising 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.560
 sure we'll get along well 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.319
 far in Brazil in the Brazilian Cup 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.170
 also has the South American Cup 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.549
 progress we have three competitions he 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.849
 can carry the larger goal that is the 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.400
 Liberators are good, I said good and until the 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.560
 hotel end up getting to know each other, right? 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.870
 It had started with the defense 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.910
 then another was another yesterday in 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.049
 recent games ended up fixing more 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.060
 gonçalves and renato santos and renato 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.109
 Sergio added a little more to the renata 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.180
 Abreu just saw a little more in the 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.470
 front stood out a little 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.190
 more goals and this is good for the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.410
 team 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.209
 I understand that we have players in the 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.970
 good that has quality as the cause of the side 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.130
 of the cleric santana who are there 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.200
 prepared to enter then this is good the 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.450
 jorginho has everyone ready to play and 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.970
 all want to adapt the best 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.690
 Possible style is a guy's face 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.519
 always being honest is honest all 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.530
 world is a sincere face nobody 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.030
 said the athlete he finishes and speaks in the face 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.780
 even leaves the player a little more 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.109
 quiet 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.769
 it gives space for athletes to talk to 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.350
 he 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.150
 there are few coaches who 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.250
 that they give this space to the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.459
 athlete to come to his or her opinion and 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.959
 in football there are 13 senators who are 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.989
 owners of the truth that is what he wants and 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.290
 just today not he have played for 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:02.410
 have played well in not being a player won 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.660
 the world cup then and he both he 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.170
 as he turned on the pro athletic space 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.609
 Also, what do you think we end up reaching? 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.810
 111 at certain times together and 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.720
 that leaves us a little more 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.400
 quiet for lack of time and 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.840
 this stop we had was very 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.549
 good for us to assimilate a little 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.340
 The more he wants what we see 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.920
 follow the stadio stadio granillo 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:29.020
 field is good and it's a crowd 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.910
 Fanatic, we do not know what to see. 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.560
 should be one of the few places 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.270
 you should not divide the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.540
 this state when you vents in 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.710
 China will also attend in mass but 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.030
 the flamengo supporter who went to 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.230
 stadium can be sure that they will leave 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.860
 satisfied because it will present a good 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.300
 soccer 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.580
 This part is ninja. That's where we are. 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.060
 we made the preseason already at the beginning of 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.090
 year and three months later and there is another 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.790
 the bad part of football is only one side 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.600
 But we do not have time to stay. 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:04.840
 standing there we go to we get there 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.600
 there are 15 or 10 days but it 's the trip is right 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.100
 It's already over, we already have. 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.100
 to prepare for what we are going to 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.410
 to egypt nor correct phone as 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.030
 does this rate is the worst part but 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.419
 rest of the good structure 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.180
 in the rooms the field gym very good 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.840
 then this athlete is important neither for 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.880
 who likes a side there to fish 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.640
 I clearly asked the holder easier 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.650
 to rest but I told you is the part 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.950
 Bad is this but the jorginho that the cast 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.050
 it will be good if you have really had 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.510
 someday it would be more important to 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.970
 adapt to the cast so that people 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.850
 can the Brazilian start there 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.660
 stop can be a cup of Brazil 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:52.110
 begin well to finish the 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.110
 year well too 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.290
 Once Flamengo, always Flamengo
