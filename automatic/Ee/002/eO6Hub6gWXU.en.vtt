00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
early childhood education to me is

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.060 
early childhood education to me is
putting<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.170> basement<00:00:10.620> under<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.920> house

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
putting the basement under the house

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.549 
putting the basement under the house
it's<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.760> beginning<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.900> child's

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
it's the beginning of a child's

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.709 
it's the beginning of a child's
educational<00:00:14.130> experience<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.880> if<00:00:15.480> it's<00:00:15.660> a

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
educational experience and if it's a

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.330 
educational experience and if it's a
good<00:00:15.870> experience<00:00:16.259> then<00:00:16.650> they're<00:00:16.800> excited<00:00:17.250> to

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
good experience then they're excited to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.740 
good experience then they're excited to
keep<00:00:17.520> coming<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.850> school<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> keep

keep coming to school and to keep

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.210 
keep coming to school and to keep
learning<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.440> if<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.650> build<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.039> good

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
learning and if we build a good

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.070 
learning and if we build a good
foundation<00:00:20.430> then<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.480> rest<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> house

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
foundation then the rest of the house

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.019 
foundation then the rest of the house
will<00:00:22.289> go<00:00:22.410> up<00:00:22.500> more<00:00:22.650> easily<00:00:22.770> and<00:00:23.279> be<00:00:23.490> very<00:00:23.699> solid

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
will go up more easily and be very solid

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.900 
will go up more easily and be very solid
and<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> think<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.650> critical<00:00:26.460> time<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
and so I think it's a critical time in a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.000 
and so I think it's a critical time in a
child's<00:00:27.240> education<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:28.080> I'm<00:00:28.590> really<00:00:28.769> proud

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010
