I<00:02:52.489> actually<00:02:53.120> believed<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.930> if<00:02:54.079> Roald<00:02:54.290> Dahl

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
I actually believed that if Roald Dahl

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.410 
I actually believed that if Roald Dahl
was<00:02:54.590> still<00:02:55.010> alive<00:02:55.280> he<00:02:55.790> would<00:02:55.910> probably<00:02:56.299> have

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
was still alive he would probably have

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.550 
was still alive he would probably have
enjoyed<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.750> movie<00:02:57.049> too

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
enjoyed that movie too

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.140 
enjoyed that movie too
since<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.010> follows<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.459> book<00:02:58.640> more<00:02:58.910> closely

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
since it follows the book more closely

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.000 
since it follows the book more closely
than<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.480> previous<00:02:59.930> film<00:03:00.140> which<00:03:00.620> he<00:03:00.769> didn't

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
than the previous film which he didn't

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.990 
than the previous film which he didn't
like

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
movies if only they tried it sooner but

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.520 
movies if only they tried it sooner but
anyhow<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:23.360> is<00:03:23.420> probably<00:03:23.870> one<00:03:24.080> of<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.230> best

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530
