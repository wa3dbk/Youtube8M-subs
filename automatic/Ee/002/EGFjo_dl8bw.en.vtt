00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.830

 Accessories such as the micro usb

 another cable with a cable 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.559

 and last but not least we have 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.829
 various paper sheets of the cabaret 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.450
 Wireless are as the name implies 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.610
 wireless headphones 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.860
 you have the possibility the headphones 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.949
 with a cable or use them 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.360
 easy to connect via bluetooth 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.329
 Alternatively, you can also on the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.430
 right ear shell via nfc pair what 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.350
 very handy is the headphones 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.500
 consist largely of aluminum 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.540
 and hard plastic on your head you feel 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.010
 really comfortable and forehead 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.830
 not there with one 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 upholstered rubbery material is the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.729
 Earcups are upholstered 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.170
 imitation leather covered and feel 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.240
 really pleasant 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.040
 also for adjustment is 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.840
 you have to take care of the iron 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.060
 pull the headphones for you 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.369
 what's wrong with me here 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.650
 noticed is the size i have 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.540
 Although a big head just fit 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.409
 the headphones are really straight for me 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.450
 Perfect 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.490
 The temple would be a bit shorter 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.439
 already become problematic if you 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.000
 can not require the headphone times 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.829
 you can hinge them thanks to the two 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.570
 to save space and fold them 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.820
 then in the included bag 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.130
 stowed something very positive for me 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.439
 he noticed the headphones 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.869
 extremely sturdy stirrups here you can 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.810
 really turn and yes pull there 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.909
 just does not happen very robust 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.890
 next to the micro usb connection we have 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.719
 then two more light indicators for the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.030
 battery and for the bluetooth connection 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.729
 then there are two more 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.259
 microphones for calling by cable 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.490
 The headphones do not need to be in operation 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.920
 turned 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.140
 a remote is located on the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.060
 Earcups works through touch and 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.130
 Press if you want to make louder 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.870
 you have to paint the ear when 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.790
 Change or pause the song 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.740
 you want to just sideways on the side 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.720
 push ear but now we come 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.910
 times to sound are the sound 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.400
 headphones at a very high level 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.500
 shrouds and middle deeps are all very 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.170
 balanced and thus all can be 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.850
 music easily hear what 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.100
 lovers do not come here either 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.320
 in short, the bass player is strong, too 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.120
 not so he controls over for the 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.610
 you have optimal sound even then 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.310
 the possibility with the cembra sound app 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.470
 to adjust the eco quieter so that he for 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.480
 meets every taste in music 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.790
 I really like the headphones a lot 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.620
 Well this robustly processed the battery 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.990
 keeps wonderful long you have great 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.270
 features like nfc and the touch 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.250
 user interface on the earphones like that 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.260
 you do not always need annoying cables 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.850
 accident on the battery to be empty 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.190
 you should still be able to do that 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.320
 continue to use cable if you have the 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.390
 you want to buy product link below 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.090

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.210
