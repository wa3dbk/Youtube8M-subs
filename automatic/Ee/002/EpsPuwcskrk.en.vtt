the<00:01:04.970> whole<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.449> England<00:01:05.570> not<00:01:05.930> just<00:01:06.260> the

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
the whole of England not just the

we're gonna have to do second best go
just<00:01:48.050> here<00:01:48.200> somewhere

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
just here somewhere

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.620 
just here somewhere
it<00:01:49.310> looks<00:01:49.490> like<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.760> wires<00:01:50.000> are<00:01:50.210> close<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.600> us

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
it looks like the wires are close to us

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.560 
it looks like the wires are close to us
but<00:01:50.930> they're<00:01:51.080> not<00:01:51.200> they're<00:01:51.850> 80<00:01:52.850> yards<00:01:53.360> further

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570

that's right and so we put some handy
visual<00:03:21.470> aids<00:03:21.650> along<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.610> try<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:22.940> explain

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
visual aids along to try and explain

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.450 
visual aids along to try and explain
this<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.510> little<00:03:23.630> bit<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.200> he<00:03:24.860> tell<00:03:25.130> us<00:03:25.220> what<00:03:25.340> the

this a little bit so he tell us what the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.100 
this a little bit so he tell us what the
kind<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.790> key<00:03:26.000> elements<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.480> knockdown

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
kind of the key elements of knockdown

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
kind of the key elements of knockdown
power<00:03:27.380> are<00:03:27.880> done<00:03:28.880> its<00:03:29.180> speed<00:03:29.600> size<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.830> white

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
power are done its speed size and white

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.080 
power are done its speed size and white
at<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.340> shop<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.720> can<00:03:33.440> have<00:03:33.800> two

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
at a shop so you can have two

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.310 
at a shop so you can have two
projectiles<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.570> fundamentally<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.230> same

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
projectiles and fundamentally the same

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.640 
projectiles and fundamentally the same
size<00:03:36.740> yeah<00:03:37.210> but<00:03:38.210> one<00:03:38.360> of<00:03:38.390> them<00:03:38.660> some<00:03:39.140> way<00:03:39.320> more

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
size yeah but one of them some way more

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.980 
size yeah but one of them some way more
than<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:40.310> cricket<00:03:40.880> ball<00:03:41.000> similar<00:03:41.630> size<00:03:41.810> to

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
than a cricket ball similar size to

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.620 
than a cricket ball similar size to
tennis<00:03:42.260> ball<00:03:42.440> yeah<00:03:43.120> yeah<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.300> that's<00:03:44.480> gonna

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
tennis ball yeah yeah so that's gonna

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.660 
tennis ball yeah yeah so that's gonna
have<00:03:44.810> more<00:03:45.140> energy<00:03:47.920> laid<00:03:48.920> shot<00:03:49.160> hitting<00:03:49.400> and

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
have more energy laid shot hitting and

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.850 
have more energy laid shot hitting and
steel<00:03:49.850> shot<00:03:50.150> yeah<00:03:50.450> ladies<00:03:51.230> always<00:03:51.500> going<00:03:51.800> to

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
steel shot yeah ladies always going to

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.570 
steel shot yeah ladies always going to
give<00:03:52.010> more<00:03:53.860> fascinated<00:03:54.860> deforms<00:03:55.280> as<00:03:55.400> well

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
give more fascinated deforms as well

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.250 
give more fascinated deforms as well
basically<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:56.780> means<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:02.990> other<00:04:03.110> thing

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
basically that means and the other thing

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.470 
basically that means and the other thing
of<00:04:03.320> course<00:04:03.380> is<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:04.040> speed<00:04:04.160> so<00:04:04.700> for<00:04:05.120> example<00:04:05.420> if

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
of course is the speed so for example if

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.420 
of course is the speed so for example if
I<00:04:05.570> was<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:05.720> chuck<00:04:05.959> this<00:04:06.110> tennis<00:04:06.440> ball<00:04:06.620> at<00:04:07.280> your

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
I was to chuck this tennis ball at your

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.030 
I was to chuck this tennis ball at your
face<00:04:07.760> very<00:04:08.060> gently<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:09.410> would<00:04:09.560> annoy<00:04:09.800> you

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
face very gently it would annoy you

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.949 
face very gently it would annoy you
yeah<00:04:10.610> if<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.180> was<00:04:11.300> to<00:04:11.360> chuck<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.600> tennis<00:04:11.810> ball

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
yeah if I was to chuck the tennis ball

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.710 
yeah if I was to chuck the tennis ball
you<00:04:12.080> had<00:04:12.290> very<00:04:12.440> hard<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:14.060> would<00:04:14.240> probably

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
you had very hard it would probably

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.530 
you had very hard it would probably
result<00:04:14.840> in<00:04:15.080> me<00:04:15.260> visiting<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.860> na<00:04:16.239> was<00:04:17.239> unlikely

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
result in me visiting a na was unlikely

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.680 
result in me visiting a na was unlikely
yes<00:04:18.130> so<00:04:19.130> we're<00:04:19.280> gonna<00:04:19.370> demonstrate<00:04:19.609> that<00:04:20.090> with

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
yes so we're gonna demonstrate that with

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.600 
yes so we're gonna demonstrate that with
our<00:04:20.870> handy<00:04:21.229> dummy<00:04:21.470> because<00:04:22.160> only<00:04:22.280> wasn't

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
our handy dummy because only wasn't

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.400
