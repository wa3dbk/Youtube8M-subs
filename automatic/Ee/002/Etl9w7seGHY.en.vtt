think<00:04:43.570> that<00:04:44.110> they<00:04:44.770> must<00:04:44.920> be<00:04:45.100> doing<00:04:45.340> it

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
think that they must be doing it

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.010 
think that they must be doing it
somewhere<00:04:45.700> else<00:04:45.760> obviously<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.780> don't<00:04:46.900> even

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
somewhere else obviously I don't even

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.970 
somewhere else obviously I don't even
know<00:04:47.140> if<00:04:47.200> it's<00:04:47.320> available<00:04:47.380> yet

stations<00:04:49.750> around<00:04:49.960> in<00:04:50.050> there<00:04:50.140> seems<00:04:50.380> kind<00:04:51.250> of

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
stations around in there seems kind of
