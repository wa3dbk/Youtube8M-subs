I'm going to use as my guide for how big
to<00:00:40.800> make<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.980> beer<00:00:41.309> koozie<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.469> have<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.559> scrap

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
to make the beer koozie I have a scrap

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.920 
to make the beer koozie I have a scrap
piece<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.100> reflectix<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.360> I'm<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.600> use

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
piece of reflectix that I'm going to use

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.139 
piece of reflectix that I'm going to use
and<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.500> gonna<00:00:46.649> wind<00:00:46.890> up<00:00:47.129> being<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> bottom

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
and it's gonna wind up being the bottom

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.090 
and it's gonna wind up being the bottom
of<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:49.649> beer<00:00:49.860> koozie<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.620> I'm<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> trace

doing the common man measurements here
and<00:01:33.229> I'm<00:01:33.320> going<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.500> roll<00:01:33.710> this<00:01:34.060> all<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.240> way

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
intersects and then I'm gonna cut this

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.150 
intersects and then I'm gonna cut this
out<00:01:53.020> so<00:01:54.020> what<00:01:54.170> I'll<00:01:54.290> do<00:01:54.440> now<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.649> I'll<00:01:54.920> roll

out so what I'll do now is I'll roll
this<00:01:55.399> in<00:01:56.270> here<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:56.810> then<00:01:57.530> we're<00:01:57.619> going<00:01:57.710> to

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
this in here and then we're going to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:07.290 
this in here and then we're going to
tape<00:01:58.040> it<00:01:58.250> with<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.700> reflectix

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.280 

you

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.100 

now<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:11.980> have<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.400> reflectix<00:02:12.909> tape<00:02:13.180> on

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
now I have the reflectix tape on

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.320 
now I have the reflectix tape on
holding<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.500> sides<00:02:14.710> together<00:02:15.240> what<00:02:16.240> I'm

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
holding the sides together what I'm

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.320 
holding the sides together what I'm
gonna<00:02:16.420> do<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:17.070> put<00:02:18.070> our<00:02:18.160> bottom<00:02:18.460> piece<00:02:18.610> on<00:02:18.850> put

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
gonna do is put our bottom piece on put

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.460 
gonna do is put our bottom piece on put
it<00:02:19.420> upside<00:02:19.750> down<00:02:21.510> keep<00:02:22.510> my<00:02:22.630> can<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:23.020> there<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.440> I

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
it upside down keep my can in there so I

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.760 
it upside down keep my can in there so I
can<00:02:23.740> gauge<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.870> will<00:02:26.080> cut<00:02:26.320> equal

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
can gauge it and I will cut equal

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:35.370 
can gauge it and I will cut equal
lengths<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:28.320> tape<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:33.270> use<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.870> secure<00:02:35.230> my

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
lengths of tape to use to secure my

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:47.130 
lengths of tape to use to secure my
bottom<00:02:35.710> piece<00:02:35.920> on<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.950> piece

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:58.330 

you

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.570 

now<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.550> have<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> bottom<00:03:00.120> taped<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:02.340> top

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
now that I have the bottom taped the top

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.309 
now that I have the bottom taped the top
is<00:03:02.849> kind<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.330> close<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.750> want<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:03.959> have<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.140> little

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
is kind of close I want to have a little

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.620 
is kind of close I want to have a little
gap<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:04.890> I'm<00:03:04.980> going<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.190> trim<00:03:05.540> probably<00:03:06.540> about

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
gap so I'm going to trim probably about

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.180 
gap so I'm going to trim probably about
a<00:03:06.690> quarter<00:03:07.050> inch<00:03:07.080> off<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.069> make

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
a quarter inch off this just to make

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.520 
a quarter inch off this just to make
sure

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:28.699
