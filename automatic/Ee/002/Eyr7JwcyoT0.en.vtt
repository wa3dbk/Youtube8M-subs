00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.000
 I want to say a few words about 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.260
 I chose components for 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.160
 of his 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.879
 Greek BBC 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.530
 now fashionable title 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.559
 assistants how to proceed 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.559
 big score to play 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.119
 unusual one character trait 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.630
 what exactly 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.009
 it would seem that here steve jobs 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.869
 this officer is down 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.399
 I'm to some extent 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:31.800
 also such a person 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.870
 that is, I started to play 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.710
 to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.930
 naturally from the motherboard 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.280
 as a result I chose 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.180
 resource 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.010
 8 27 UAH pro 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.920
 except from alex 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.570
 cut the fee but again I started 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.290
 with the same board only without prefix 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.920
 about 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.700
 started to flare up 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.100
 what is he 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.970
 of that which does not need anything extra 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.750
 it seemed 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.440
 something is missing 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.670
 due to the fact that i love 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.870
 install more in the computer 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.110
 AFC blower fan 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.750
 and it should be quiet 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.930
 utilizer and everything is exactly the system kicker 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960
 stove mates 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.680
 there should be enough 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.460
 connectors 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.190
 fans 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.620
 it seemed that without the console about 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.180
 motherboard 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.759
 to bid 1 less 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.170
 here they are with 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.410
 thought 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.470
 tons 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.440
 four 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.240
 enough 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.030
 in order to 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.010
 I could 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.660
 connect everything i need per year 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.820
 Firstly Secondly 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.190
 on 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.320
 inside the market without a test box 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.190
 one person asked if you can 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.780
 I will have 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.800
 that is, it was originally planned 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.750
 to install 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.820
 CPU 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.140
 soon 5 3 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.900
 2100 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.100
 but again as a result 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.490
 long thinking and fingering i 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.830
 stopped at core i5 35 50 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.830
 since it's his stock 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.739
 but accordingly the embedded video is 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.079
 in these intel processors 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.349
 and again rake more powerful video 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.329
 core i5 350 processors 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:24.959
 due to the fact that with the case for more 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.719
 how 22 nanometer technology 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.229
 fathers video clip 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:32.879
 decided Lipetsk Eagles 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.849
 ambulance 3 3100 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.799
 Before video two thousand here a little bit 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:38.870
 men that is, initially 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.339
 it was supposed that 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:41.859
 will not be enough 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.619
 what do we see accordingly 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.859
 chipset board was observed 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.339
 which will support the possibility of conclusions 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.749
 I saw you see here 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.859
 connectivity for 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.669
 regional development 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.779
 new document should he have 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.729
 apparently such monitor supplies 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.649
 word chose a fee on the track Taraz 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:04.719
 CPU 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.099
 and more powerful too expensive 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.049
 then he 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.699
 I got sick 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:12.379
 long loading 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.309
 Winchester operating system 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:15.730
 to which 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.029
 already five years with the more I have 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:20.869
 secondly noisy secondly slow 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.779
 the diploma decided to go to create them 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:26.249
 started sixty four gigabytes 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.149
 until it came to choice 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:31.319
 disappeared from the sale and I had to buy 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.949
 128 gigabytes 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.289
 but I'm glad it happened 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:38.409
 already there 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.259
 create ate 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.879
 plus the set is mounting count 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.040
 for me it was a surprise for something 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.249
 connect 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:48.429
 I did not expect to see 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:50.419
 Well, respectively, bread 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.979
 ask handles for mounting yourself 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.329
 we can take and body 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.219
 entering a different final moment 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:59.139
 tactics 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.379
 who also have to apply 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.869
 jp morgan tr3 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.129
 kingston 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.789
 two strips of 4 b 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:11.479
 soon after it 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.259
 like so 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:14.659
 who who 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.719
 18 more 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:17.629
 this layer 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:18.849
 greek letter 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.340
 while the second case 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.259
 one more such moment 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.330
 why I didn't know 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.330
 moles operating ratings 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.139
 cause 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.870
 I don't even know 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.810
 I don't know why I don't know maybe 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.990
 small 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.370
 I mean, I didn't plan it. 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.620
 stuff in some kind of questions 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.659
 space is more than enough 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.419
 but it happened so apparently like 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.650
 worked 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.600
 Anticipating not what I wanted later 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.129
 it's all transferable 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.050
 in the hull 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.069
 horizontal arrangement 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.300
 up to 100 km 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300
 so-called 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.860
 put together this whole system 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.790
 so he has power naturally 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.139
 microcredit in poland payment policy 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.719
 and the hull will mean 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:12.740
 Haifa and equipment 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.089
 silverstone 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.389
 where do i get it with him 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.279
 saw and how it was all transferred but 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:21.279
 while we run in 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.370
 what will the company account of the pfr be working on 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.039
 about the video card 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.650
 originally planned 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.129
 to consider 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.429
 video and connect the monitor tv in 

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:35.120
 my case 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.060
 under 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.499
 embedded video 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:39.520
 but im 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.479
 some time after thinking 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.809
 I decided to install all the same 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:46.180
 discrete graphics card 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.659
 ratings force 650 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.090
 I ordered it 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.289
 Mr. Wart 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.169
 and then after this time read a review 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.300
 and she was quite weak once 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.289
 really descent on the street kvetnogo map then 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.180
 need a couple more powerful 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.309
 rebooted 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.559
 m Kamaz ii 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:08.689
 and ford 650 tee ah 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:10.639
 with one gigabyte on board 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.580
 but cats will come accordingly 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.180
 so for now and install not 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.180
 will be 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.860
 I will stop 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.110
 on the fact that there is 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.189
 and try 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:21.520
 also embedded video for one 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.699
 see how 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.139
 will work 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.580
 without a list of this video card 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.099
 but also such a moment as 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.449
 process cooler 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.639
 boxing crash i ordered the boxing version 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.520
 before this processor 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.289
 I don't know, but it's strange 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.360
 buy processors canopy separately there 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.939
 born literally in the village 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:46.289
 some 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.139
 up to ten dollars 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.879
 to swap processors way 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.409
 integrator Nikulin 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:57.529
 grand opera more than three years a year 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:58.770
 and for two years 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.840
 plenipotentiary dollars for the year west pay no 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.099
 so scary 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:03.800
 what will be installed 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.330
 but the actor who now stands on 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.069
 other end of the country are universal 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.069
 that is, there is a situation when problems 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:13.029
 here for one with 505 in the era 

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:15.909
 and I also saw this once 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:17.059
 here 

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:17.870
 we are all for now
