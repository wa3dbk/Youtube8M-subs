00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.060 
hi and welcome my name is Julien Carson

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.370 
hi and welcome my name is Julien Carson
in<00:00:13.180> today's<00:00:13.480> episode<00:00:13.660> of<00:00:13.930> the<00:00:14.050> complete

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
in today's episode of the complete

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.080 
in today's episode of the complete
picture<00:00:14.560> we're<00:00:15.130> going<00:00:15.309> to<00:00:15.400> be<00:00:15.490> taking<00:00:15.820> a<00:00:15.880> look

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
picture we're going to be taking a look

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.730 
picture we're going to be taking a look
at<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.420> differences<00:00:17.050> between<00:00:17.109> making

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
at the differences between making

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.890 
at the differences between making
changes<00:00:18.369> using<00:00:18.850> quick<00:00:19.300> develop<00:00:19.750> in

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
changes using quick develop in

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.170 
changes using quick develop in
Lightroom's<00:00:20.350> library<00:00:20.800> module<00:00:21.220> versus<00:00:21.970> using

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
Lightroom's library module versus using

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.320 
Lightroom's library module versus using
the<00:00:22.420> develop<00:00:22.900> module<00:00:23.190> so<00:00:24.190> I<00:00:24.460> think<00:00:24.640> most<00:00:25.000> of<00:00:25.210> us

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
the develop module so I think most of us

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.330 
the develop module so I think most of us
are<00:00:25.510> more<00:00:25.990> familiar<00:00:26.170> with<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:27.010> develop

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
are more familiar with the develop

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.920 
are more familiar with the develop
module<00:00:27.430> so<00:00:27.789> I'll<00:00:27.910> go<00:00:28.029> ahead<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:28.330> tap<00:00:28.510> the<00:00:28.720> D

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
module so I'll go ahead and tap the D

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.380 
module so I'll go ahead and tap the D
key<00:00:29.199> and<00:00:29.410> move<00:00:29.859> over<00:00:30.070> to<00:00:30.190> there<00:00:30.460> what's

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
key and move over to there what's

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.779 
key and move over to there what's
important<00:00:31.869> to<00:00:32.020> know<00:00:32.259> is<00:00:32.559> that<00:00:32.800> any<00:00:33.160> changes

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
important to know is that any changes

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:35.459 
important to know is that any changes
that<00:00:33.820> I<00:00:34.000> make<00:00:34.329> here<00:00:34.569> are<00:00:34.749> going<00:00:35.229> to<00:00:35.350> be

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 
that I make here are going to be

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.309 
that I make here are going to be
absolute<00:00:36.280> so<00:00:37.149> let's<00:00:37.569> just<00:00:37.780> make<00:00:37.899> some<00:00:37.960> quick

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:38.319 
absolute so let's just make some quick

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:41.729 
absolute so let's just make some quick
changes<00:00:38.350> here<00:00:39.069> I<00:00:39.219> might<00:00:39.850> want<00:00:40.149> to<00:00:40.269> say<00:00:40.989> use<00:00:41.469> my

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
changes here I might want to say use my

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.590 
changes here I might want to say use my
temperature<00:00:42.489> slider<00:00:42.789> and<00:00:43.089> make<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:43.329> a<00:00:43.389> bit

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
temperature slider and make this a bit

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.739 
temperature slider and make this a bit
more<00:00:43.870> yellow<00:00:44.109> I<00:00:44.499> might<00:00:45.039> want<00:00:45.309> to<00:00:45.460> change

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:45.749 
more yellow I might want to change

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.110 
more yellow I might want to change
exposure<00:00:46.749> and<00:00:47.170> also<00:00:47.319> change<00:00:47.769> my<00:00:48.069> blacks<00:00:48.609> here

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
exposure and also change my blacks here

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.360 
exposure and also change my blacks here
and<00:00:49.299> as<00:00:49.780> I<00:00:49.929> do<00:00:49.989> that<00:00:50.139> I<00:00:50.530> might<00:00:50.710> also<00:00:50.920> want<00:00:51.280> to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
and as I do that I might also want to

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.029 
and as I do that I might also want to
pull<00:00:51.850> down<00:00:51.879> the<00:00:52.269> brightness<00:00:52.479> and<00:00:52.960> maybe<00:00:53.679> add<00:00:54.010> a

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
pull down the brightness and maybe add a

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.849 
pull down the brightness and maybe add a
little<00:00:54.280> bit<00:00:54.609> of<00:00:54.639> clarity<00:00:55.149> all<00:00:55.839> right<00:00:56.019> so<00:00:56.589> let's

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
little bit of clarity all right so let's

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.189 
little bit of clarity all right so let's
say<00:00:57.069> I've<00:00:57.219> made<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.729> changes<00:00:58.269> that<00:00:58.479> I<00:00:58.539> want<00:00:58.899> to

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
say I've made the changes that I want to

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.500 
say I've made the changes that I want to
to<00:00:59.559> this<00:00:59.829> image<00:01:00.339> actually<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.209> think<00:01:01.299> it's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
to this image actually I think it's

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.969 
to this image actually I think it's
looking<00:01:01.749> a<00:01:01.809> little<00:01:01.959> bit<00:01:02.109> too<00:01:02.319> yellow<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:02.769> let's

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
looking a little bit too yellow so let's

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.560 
looking a little bit too yellow so let's
bring<00:01:03.159> that<00:01:03.219> temperature<00:01:03.789> slider<00:01:04.030> down<00:01:04.269> a<00:01:04.330> bit

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
bring that temperature slider down a bit

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.960 
bring that temperature slider down a bit
more<00:01:04.720> okay<00:01:05.290> so<00:01:05.470> now<00:01:05.950> we've<00:01:06.220> made<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.460> changes

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
more okay so now we've made the changes

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.390 
more okay so now we've made the changes
that<00:01:07.120> I<00:01:07.240> have<00:01:07.270> look<00:01:07.480> that<00:01:07.720> I<00:01:07.750> want<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.410> you<00:01:09.220> can

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
that I have look that I want and you can

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.190 
that I have look that I want and you can
see<00:01:09.610> down<00:01:09.820> here<00:01:09.850> on<00:01:10.030> my<00:01:10.090> filmstrip<00:01:10.720> I<00:01:10.900> have

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
see down here on my filmstrip I have

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.930 
see down here on my filmstrip I have
multiple<00:01:11.740> images<00:01:12.190> that<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.370> want<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:12.820> apply

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
multiple images that I want to apply

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.740 
multiple images that I want to apply
those<00:01:13.360> same<00:01:13.750> changes<00:01:14.260> to<00:01:14.800> now<00:01:15.760> I<00:01:16.060> have<00:01:16.720> a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
those same changes to now I have a

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.900 
those same changes to now I have a
variety<00:01:17.380> of<00:01:17.410> ways<00:01:17.650> I<00:01:17.920> can<00:01:18.100> do<00:01:18.220> this<00:01:18.370> right<00:01:18.640> I

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
variety of ways I can do this right I

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.360 
variety of ways I can do this right I
could<00:01:19.210> click<00:01:19.450> on<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.870> next<00:01:20.230> image<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.770> then<00:01:21.340> I

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
could click on the next image and then I

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.220 
could click on the next image and then I
could<00:01:21.700> simply<00:01:22.180> click<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.690> previous<00:01:23.110> button

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
could simply click the previous button

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.530 
could simply click the previous button
and<00:01:23.740> that<00:01:24.070> would<00:01:24.280> apply<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.640> same<00:01:25.060> changes

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
and that would apply the same changes

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.090 
and that would apply the same changes
that<00:01:25.690> were<00:01:25.750> applied<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.380> previous<00:01:26.860> file

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
that were applied to the previous file

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.020 
that were applied to the previous file
or<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:28.390> could<00:01:28.750> select<00:01:29.310> multiple<00:01:30.310> images<00:01:30.460> at<00:01:30.850> one

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
or I could select multiple images at one

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.510 
or I could select multiple images at one
time<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.780> then<00:01:32.320> with<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.680> image<00:01:33.040> that<00:01:33.280> has

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
time and then with the image that has

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.970 
time and then with the image that has
the<00:01:33.550> changes<00:01:34.210> applied<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:34.870> could<00:01:35.350> click<00:01:35.590> on<00:01:35.800> the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
the changes applied I could click on the

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.400 
the changes applied I could click on the
sync<00:01:36.370> button<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:37.000> tell<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.720> what<00:01:37.900> I<00:01:37.930> want<00:01:38.170> to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
sync button and tell it what I want to

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.170 
sync button and tell it what I want to
sync<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:39.010> in<00:01:39.130> this<00:01:39.220> case<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.700> white<00:01:39.910> balance

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
sync so in this case the white balance

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.740 
sync so in this case the white balance
maybe<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.080> basic<00:01:41.530> tone<00:01:41.860> also<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:43.240> clarity

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
maybe the basic tone also the clarity

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.560 
maybe the basic tone also the clarity
down<00:01:43.960> here<00:01:44.410> and<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:45.430> don't<00:01:46.090> think<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.270> made<00:01:46.420> any

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
down here and I don't think I made any

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.910 
down here and I don't think I made any
changes<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.080> color<00:01:47.290> so<00:01:47.530> we<00:01:47.620> can<00:01:47.650> leave<00:01:47.860> that

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
changes to color so we can leave that

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.500 
changes to color so we can leave that
off<00:01:48.220> but<00:01:48.370> you<00:01:48.460> could<00:01:48.610> see<00:01:48.730> I<00:01:48.760> could<00:01:48.850> be<00:01:49.000> syncing

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
off but you could see I could be syncing

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.840 
off but you could see I could be syncing
any<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.470> different<00:01:50.650> attributes<00:01:51.550> of<00:01:51.640> any

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
any of the different attributes of any

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.580 
any of the different attributes of any
of<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.120> panels<00:01:52.510> here<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.320> we<00:01:53.440> could

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
of the panels here so we could

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.350 
of the panels here so we could
synchronize<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.490> now<00:01:54.730> you<00:01:54.790> can<00:01:54.970> see<00:01:55.150> that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
synchronize and now you can see that

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.840 
synchronize and now you can see that
those<00:01:55.600> same<00:01:55.900> set<00:01:56.230> of<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.560> changes<00:01:57.550> have<00:01:57.730> been

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
those same set of of changes have been

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.840 
those same set of of changes have been
applied<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.420> next<00:01:58.810> file<00:01:59.020> or<00:01:59.500> we<00:02:00.220> can<00:02:00.400> even

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
applied to the next file or we can even

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.330 
applied to the next file or we can even
create<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.240> preset<00:02:02.050> and<00:02:02.320> we<00:02:02.620> would<00:02:02.770> do<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:03.100> by

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
create a preset and we would do that by

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.790 
create a preset and we would do that by
just<00:02:03.370> clicking<00:02:03.909> on<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.630> plus<00:02:04.900> icon<00:02:05.140> here<00:02:05.620> next

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
just clicking on the plus icon here next

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.580 
just clicking on the plus icon here next
to<00:02:06.010> presets<00:02:06.520> we<00:02:07.270> can<00:02:07.450> save<00:02:07.750> this<00:02:07.990> into<00:02:08.259> a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
to presets we can save this into a

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.979 
to presets we can save this into a
specific<00:02:09.009> folder<00:02:09.610> if<00:02:09.849> we<00:02:10.000> want<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:10.569> then

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
specific folder if we want to and then

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.750 
specific folder if we want to and then
again<00:02:11.260> we<00:02:11.439> just<00:02:11.680> check<00:02:12.069> all<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.370> those

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
again we just check all of those

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.610 
again we just check all of those
different<00:02:13.329> sliders<00:02:14.109> or<00:02:14.290> all<00:02:14.409> of<00:02:14.439> the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
different sliders or all of the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.660 
different sliders or all of the
different<00:02:14.889> changes

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
different changes

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.059 
different changes
that<00:02:15.970> we've<00:02:16.120> made<00:02:16.450> let's<00:02:17.260> give<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.620> name<00:02:17.650> in

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
that we've made let's give it a name in

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.630 
that we've made let's give it a name in
this<00:02:18.490> case<00:02:18.959> correct<00:02:20.280> Painted<00:02:21.280> Hills<00:02:21.750> and

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
click create now you might have made

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.890 
click create now you might have made
presets<00:02:27.970> for<00:02:28.120> other<00:02:28.360> things<00:02:28.420> like<00:02:28.750> for

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
presets for other things like for

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.390 
presets for other things like for
example<00:02:29.380> maybe<00:02:29.530> taking<00:02:29.920> your<00:02:30.010> images<00:02:30.280> to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
example maybe taking your images to

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.370 
example maybe taking your images to
black<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.730> white<00:02:30.910> or<00:02:31.209> adding<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.599> sepia<00:02:32.080> tone

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
black and white or adding a sepia tone

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.780 
black and white or adding a sepia tone
there's<00:02:32.830> all<00:02:32.980> sorts<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.430> different<00:02:33.760> reasons

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
there's all sorts of different reasons

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.540 
there's all sorts of different reasons
to<00:02:34.510> create<00:02:34.870> presets<00:02:35.440> but<00:02:35.950> what<00:02:36.069> I<00:02:36.100> really

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
to create presets but what I really

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.850 
to create presets but what I really
wanted<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:36.910> show<00:02:37.270> here<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:38.170> no<00:02:38.680> matter

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
wanted to show here is that no matter

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.820 
wanted to show here is that no matter
how<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.370> make<00:02:39.910> your<00:02:40.090> changes<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.530> let's<00:02:41.709> go

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
how you make your changes so let's go

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.590 
how you make your changes so let's go
ahead<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.069> select<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.700> next<00:02:42.850> two<00:02:43.090> files<00:02:43.360> and

ahead and select the next two files and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.900 
ahead and select the next two files and
we'll<00:02:43.720> actually<00:02:43.870> apply<00:02:44.350> this<00:02:44.410> preset<00:02:45.040> no

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
we'll actually apply this preset no

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.420 
we'll actually apply this preset no
matter<00:02:46.090> how<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.510> make<00:02:47.050> these<00:02:47.290> changes<00:02:47.950> to

those values that you change are

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.640 
those values that you change are
absolute<00:02:54.100> so<00:02:54.940> regardless<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:56.049> what<00:02:56.230> image<00:02:56.530> I

in<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.080> basic<00:02:59.500> panel<00:02:59.739> you'll<00:03:00.310> notice<00:03:00.370> that

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
in the basic panel you'll notice that

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.479 
in the basic panel you'll notice that
for<00:03:01.239> example<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:02.110> exposure<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.100> blacks

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
for example the exposure and the blacks

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.759 
for example the exposure and the blacks
and<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.390> clarity<00:03:04.810> settings<00:03:05.290> will<00:03:05.440> be<00:03:05.620> the

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
and the clarity settings will be the

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.949 
and the clarity settings will be the
same<00:03:06.010> for<00:03:06.280> each<00:03:06.489> image<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:07.600> we've<00:03:07.780> got

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
same for each image so we've got

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.190 
same for each image so we've got
exposure<00:03:08.380> plus<00:03:08.650> 75<00:03:09.310> blacks<00:03:09.970> 29<00:03:10.660> let's<00:03:10.989> go<00:03:11.140> to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
exposure plus 75 blacks 29 let's go to

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.280 
exposure plus 75 blacks 29 let's go to
the<00:03:11.350> next<00:03:11.560> image<00:03:11.739> same<00:03:12.519> thing<00:03:12.790> plus<00:03:13.180> 75<00:03:13.750> plus

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
the next image same thing plus 75 plus

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.420 
the next image same thing plus 75 plus
29<00:03:15.030> again<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.209> next<00:03:16.420> image<00:03:16.750> plus<00:03:17.080> 75<00:03:17.560> plus<00:03:18.010> 29

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
29 again the next image plus 75 plus 29

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.610 
29 again the next image plus 75 plus 29
so<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.670> can<00:03:18.819> see<00:03:19.030> any<00:03:19.360> change<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.200> make<00:03:20.410> and

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
so you can see any change you make and

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.140 
so you can see any change you make and
then<00:03:20.799> synchronize<00:03:21.489> whether<00:03:21.850> you're

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
then synchronize whether you're

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.849 
then synchronize whether you're
synchronizing<00:03:22.480> using<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.170> previous<00:03:23.560> button

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
synchronizing using the previous button

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.340 
synchronizing using the previous button
the<00:03:24.489> synchronize<00:03:25.000> button<00:03:25.239> or<00:03:25.540> if<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.049> create

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
the synchronize button or if you create

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.800 
the synchronize button or if you create
a<00:03:26.380> preset<00:03:26.859> those<00:03:27.489> changes<00:03:28.180> are<00:03:28.329> going<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.690> be

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
a preset those changes are going to be

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.690 
a preset those changes are going to be
absolute<00:03:29.670> alright<00:03:31.440> what<00:03:32.440> happens<00:03:33.040> then<00:03:33.310> if<00:03:33.489> we

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
absolute alright what happens then if we

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.440 
absolute alright what happens then if we
go<00:03:33.880> back<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:35.140> library<00:03:35.769> module<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.549> use

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
go back to the library module and use

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.349 
go back to the library module and use
quick<00:03:37.930> develope<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.560> make<00:03:38.739> changes<00:03:39.359> well

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
quick develope to make changes well

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.449 
quick develope to make changes well
let's<00:03:40.570> take<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.780> look<00:03:41.049> at<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.380> next<00:03:41.890> set<00:03:42.430> of

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
let's take a look at the next set of

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.940 
let's take a look at the next set of
images<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.510> can<00:03:43.660> see<00:03:43.720> here<00:03:44.109> that<00:03:44.230> each<00:03:44.500> one<00:03:44.829> of

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
images you can see here that each one of

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.250 
images you can see here that each one of
these<00:03:45.070> images<00:03:45.549> is<00:03:45.910> very<00:03:46.450> unique<00:03:46.810> they're<00:03:47.049> shot

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
these images is very unique they're shot

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.199 
these images is very unique they're shot
under<00:03:47.560> very<00:03:47.739> different<00:03:48.280> lighting<00:03:48.579> conditions

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
under very different lighting conditions

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.449 
under very different lighting conditions
and<00:03:49.359> in<00:03:49.930> fact<00:03:50.260> let's<00:03:50.769> even<00:03:51.040> jump<00:03:51.250> back<00:03:51.430> to

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
and in fact let's even jump back to

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.880 
and in fact let's even jump back to
develop<00:03:51.940> for<00:03:52.090> one<00:03:52.209> moment<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.930> point<00:03:53.290> out<00:03:53.500> that

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
develop for one moment to point out that

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.849 
develop for one moment to point out that
each<00:03:54.130> one<00:03:54.850> has<00:03:54.880> its<00:03:55.510> own<00:03:55.600> set<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.230> unique

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
each one has its own set of unique

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.309 
each one has its own set of unique
Corrections<00:03:57.670> applied<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.329> it<00:03:58.450> so<00:03:59.109> in<00:03:59.230> this

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
Corrections applied to it so in this

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.470 
Corrections applied to it so in this
case<00:03:59.590> for<00:03:59.769> example<00:03:59.970> we've<00:04:00.970> changed<00:04:01.329> the

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
case for example we've changed the

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.990 
case for example we've changed the
exposure<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.200> negative<00:04:02.620> 33<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.430> we've<00:04:03.819> added

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
exposure to negative 33 and we've added

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.120 
exposure to negative 33 and we've added
a<00:04:04.209> clarity<00:04:04.600> of<00:04:04.630> 80<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.170> if<00:04:05.590> we<00:04:05.709> move<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:06.100> the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
a clarity of 80 and if we move to the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.949 
a clarity of 80 and if we move to the
next<00:04:06.430> image<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:07.269> can<00:04:07.420> see<00:04:07.630> that<00:04:07.840> this

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
next image you can see that this

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.780 
next image you can see that this
exposure<00:04:08.440> values<00:04:08.950> been<00:04:09.100> changed<00:04:09.609> to<00:04:09.670> a

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
exposure values been changed to a

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.360 
exposure values been changed to a
different<00:04:10.120> numeric<00:04:11.109> value<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.920> clarity

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
different numeric value and the clarity

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.699 
different numeric value and the clarity
has<00:04:12.430> also<00:04:12.609> been<00:04:12.850> changed<00:04:13.090> so<00:04:13.780> each<00:04:14.109> one<00:04:14.500> of

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
has also been changed so each one of

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.430 
has also been changed so each one of
these<00:04:14.859> images<00:04:15.160> has<00:04:15.910> been<00:04:16.440> individually

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
these images has been individually

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.029 
these images has been individually
corrected<00:04:18.359> but<00:04:19.359> they<00:04:19.840> all<00:04:20.079> look<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.620> little<00:04:20.889> bit

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
corrected but they all look a little bit

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.100 
corrected but they all look a little bit
dark<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.609> me<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:22.479> wouldn't<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:22.780> be<00:04:22.900> nice<00:04:23.080> if

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
dark to me so wouldn't it be nice if

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.100 
dark to me so wouldn't it be nice if
there<00:04:23.320> was<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.590> way<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:24.060> simply<00:04:25.060> select<00:04:25.390> a<00:04:25.870> range

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
there was a way to simply select a range

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.990 
there was a way to simply select a range
of<00:04:26.349> images<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.830> then<00:04:27.250> add<00:04:27.550> like<00:04:27.789> a

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
of images and then add like a

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.660 
of images and then add like a
third<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.390> stop<00:04:28.450> or<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.900> stop<00:04:29.350> to<00:04:30.010> each<00:04:30.310> one<00:04:30.640> of

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
third of a stop or a stop to each one of

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.990 
third of a stop or a stop to each one of
those<00:04:30.880> images<00:04:31.380> regardless<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.620> their<00:04:33.520> numeric

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
those images regardless of their numeric

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.660 
those images regardless of their numeric
values<00:04:34.510> that<00:04:34.720> is<00:04:35.110> their<00:04:35.260> starting<00:04:35.830> point<00:04:36.160> well

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
values that is their starting point well

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.130 
values that is their starting point well
that's<00:04:36.940> what<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.390> can<00:04:37.570> do<00:04:37.720> with<00:04:37.900> quick

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
that's what you can do with quick

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.340 
that's what you can do with quick
development<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:38.920> we<00:04:39.490> go<00:04:39.640> back<00:04:39.670> to<00:04:40.090> grid<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.630> I

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
development so we go back to grid and I

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.640 
development so we go back to grid and I
will<00:04:41.560> select<00:04:42.040> these<00:04:42.570> five<00:04:43.570> images<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.470> all

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
will select these five images that all

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.440 
will select these five images that all
look<00:04:44.920> a<00:04:45.010> little<00:04:45.160> bit<00:04:45.370> underexposed<00:04:45.670> to<00:04:46.330> me

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
look a little bit underexposed to me

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.490 
look a little bit underexposed to me
even<00:04:47.170> though<00:04:47.320> they've<00:04:47.500> all<00:04:47.770> had<00:04:48.370> custom

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
even though they've all had custom

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.200 
even though they've all had custom
adjustments<00:04:50.500> made<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:50.770> them<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.490> I'll<00:04:52.030> come

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
adjustments made to them and I'll come

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.300 
adjustments made to them and I'll come
over<00:04:52.240> here<00:04:52.480> in<00:04:52.870> quick<00:04:53.260> develop<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.860> exposure

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
over here in quick develop to exposure

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.580 
over here in quick develop to exposure
and<00:04:54.670> you<00:04:55.060> can<00:04:55.210> see<00:04:55.450> that<00:04:55.630> there's<00:04:55.840> two<00:04:55.900> icons

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
and you can see that there's two icons

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.340 
and you can see that there's two icons
well<00:04:56.920> there's<00:04:57.160> four<00:04:57.340> icons<00:04:57.820> but<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.810> icons<00:04:59.170> on

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
well there's four icons but the icons on

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.570 
well there's four icons but the icons on
the<00:04:59.410> Left<00:04:59.620> will<00:04:59.830> obviously<00:05:00.100> take<00:05:00.280> the

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
the Left will obviously take the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.670 
the Left will obviously take the
exposure<00:05:00.910> down<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.870> icons<00:05:02.230> on<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.500> right

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
exposure down the icons on the right

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.230 
exposure down the icons on the right
take<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.100> exposure<00:05:03.400> up<00:05:03.640> and<00:05:03.790> you<00:05:03.850> can<00:05:04.000> see

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
take the exposure up and you can see

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.120 
take the exposure up and you can see
with<00:05:04.450> that<00:05:04.480> tooltip<00:05:05.110> that<00:05:05.290> it's<00:05:05.680> either<00:05:05.830> going

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
with that tooltip that it's either going

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.100 
with that tooltip that it's either going
to<00:05:06.220> increase<00:05:06.580> exposure<00:05:06.970> by<00:05:07.240> one<00:05:07.480> stop<00:05:07.810> that's

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
to increase exposure by one stop that's

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.810 
to increase exposure by one stop that's
the<00:05:08.350> larger<00:05:08.710> jump<00:05:08.919> that<00:05:09.070> has<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.370> two<00:05:09.550> arrows

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
the larger jump that has the two arrows

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.780 
the larger jump that has the two arrows
or<00:05:10.030> by<00:05:10.690> just<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.140> third<00:05:11.410> of<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.650> stop<00:05:11.710> so<00:05:12.640> if<00:05:12.700> I

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
or by just a third of a stop so if I

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.030 
or by just a third of a stop so if I
think<00:05:12.850> I<00:05:13.090> want<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.360> make<00:05:13.510> a<00:05:13.690> large<00:05:14.080> adjustment

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
think I want to make a large adjustment

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.860 
think I want to make a large adjustment
then<00:05:15.130> I'll<00:05:15.220> go<00:05:15.370> ahead<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.700> click<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.000> increase

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
then I'll go ahead and click to increase

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.740 
then I'll go ahead and click to increase
the<00:05:17.080> exposure<00:05:17.470> one<00:05:17.860> stop<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:18.580> that<00:05:19.419> is<00:05:19.720> a

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
the exposure one stop and that is a

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.500 
the exposure one stop and that is a
relative<00:05:20.620> adjustment<00:05:21.400> so<00:05:21.730> that<00:05:21.880> each<00:05:22.120> one<00:05:22.390> of

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
relative adjustment so that each one of

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.140 
relative adjustment so that each one of
these<00:05:22.600> images<00:05:23.020> is<00:05:23.290> going<00:05:23.950> to<00:05:24.070> have<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.580> full

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
these images is going to have a full

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.290 
these images is going to have a full
stop<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:25.960> exposure<00:05:26.470> added<00:05:27.070> to<00:05:27.220> it<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.550> that's

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
stop of exposure added to it and that's

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.570 
stop of exposure added to it and that's
true<00:05:28.660> of<00:05:28.810> any<00:05:29.050> of<00:05:29.260> these<00:05:29.410> settings<00:05:29.860> so<00:05:30.370> for

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
true of any of these settings so for

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.640 
true of any of these settings so for
example<00:05:30.970> if<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.330> wanted<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:32.050> increase<00:05:32.500> the

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
example if I wanted to increase the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.770 
example if I wanted to increase the
blacks<00:05:33.490> or<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.910> fill<00:05:34.210> lights<00:05:34.479> or<00:05:34.750> even
