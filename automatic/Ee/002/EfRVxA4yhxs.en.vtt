00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:08.370
 Well then this time we look at the kind of structure boiler of this boiler 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:12.990
 I think that want to go 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:17.999
 First of all, it is the type of boiler, but there are various types of boilers . 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.160
 But first it's classified according to the purpose of use you want to remember 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:25.990
 So what kind of thing is it? 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:30.460
 There is a place where water has been accumulated, and if it is heated with a deco mushroom, something comes out of here 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:37.650
 It's coming, but it's the case that something like this is coming out and that mokomoku comes out too much 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:42.720
 It is called a steam boiler. It is a steam boiler that heats up and steam comes out. 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:48.150
 Something comes out when I was overdone, but this is not the above 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:52.590
 Misleadingly this type of water comes out and this is what this is called a hot water boiler 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:57.330
 It is classification according to purpose of use than we mentioned earlier 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.640
 Divided what has divided it is the fact that whether to use something coming out of the boiler of the two 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.649
 People 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.550
 Become a hot-water boilers and steam boilers long-term boiler and how divided Tteyuu Yes I hot water boiler 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.659
 I will 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.150
 Also there various ways to lose it is the other also Well Well I'm there but not say 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:15.070
 Next time is here 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:19.890
 Classification according to structure What is this structure? 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:25.380
 To say that if the boiler is in what kind of structure you are able to what is how to divide Yes 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.100
 First of all , there is a construction boiler and a cast iron boiler in the division method according to the structure if it is widely opened . 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.650
 I will 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.820
 Guy that can literally steel in Goshoji that has been there is that if say this configuration and cast iron This 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.070
 This is the configuration boiler 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.970
 If cast iron boilers are made of medium iron or if it is a fixed spoiler, everyone the difference between steel and cast iron 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.880
 but 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.270
 It says I steel 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:48.220
 Toka's clapping pounding is that the train is not it there is a hand 2 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.590
 Because it is heat treatment or something like that, it is steel that I made stronger than I like 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.880
 It is a guy say Japanese sword and Kaa if 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.230
 Aisle say and do is cast iron is made in the configuration steel is not that sort of 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.750
 That's right yeah 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.460
 I pour cast iron and melted iron into a mold and make it my favorite shape and it is cast iron 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.619
 It's kinda like grilled 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.300
 Taiyaki pours in flour, but pours in the iron which melted in its cullin hole and becomes the form of the brother 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.290
 It is cast iron to say 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.220
 It is literally what steel is to say what kind of difference this is 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.630
 It is strong reason 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:26.770
 Is more of Well cast iron boilers because I can say that the Tteyuu little brittle Those who cast iron 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:31.330
 It seems that there are various applications and restrictions, and this side will be seen later 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.260
 It is kun, but anyway it is said that composition boiler and cast iron boiler are largely 2 minutes 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.840
 I can do it 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:41.300
 If we look at the high correction boiler further 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.540
 It is and will be further subdivided Yoisho' steel boiler structure boiler also round boiler 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:49.430
 And can be divided into water tube boiler low pressure 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.370
 And Taoyuan Chinese medicine, et al outcrop of further vertical boilers annular boiler It is this Mar boiler 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.830
 You can finely subdivided Fu called boiler 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.400
 Also natural circulation boiler Professor because water tube boiler 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.760
 It can be painted separately with forced circulation boiler once-through boiler 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.440
 To say divide Well because middle-ceiling boiler is then 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.950
 You also or told to Fu I mean become Sectional boiler Now is a here Nema this 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.630
 I think I do not understand well if there is only a classification 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.819
 Let's go next, right ? Well, those are those details of these boilers 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.310
 Wind 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.310
 I would like to introduce you if you are
