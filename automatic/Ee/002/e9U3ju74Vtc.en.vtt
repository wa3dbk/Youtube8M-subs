00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.800
 paris france is the opening of the most 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:11.290
 great air show 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.120
 the pilot's breasts plow the sky and the 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.980
 Excited fiction admires airplanes 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.980
 most fierce and fastest ever seen 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.180
 the most lethal tactical jet is the infamous 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.180
 Russian 1029 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.349
 the car anatoli pilot surprises the 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.739
 people with their challenge maneuvers 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.739
 mortal 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.940
 his grand finale starts with a pass from 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.699
 low level by the field 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.370
 accelerates dangerously low to 180 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.040
 kilometers per hour and it sticks to just 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.830
 90 meters above the people 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.590
 then winner and direct the jet towards 7 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.470
 but when trying to gain speed 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.900
 flamazo in the right engine tries to 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.600
 get away from the spectators but from 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.680
 soon the plane turns sharply and it 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.680
 precipitates to earth 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.130
 and assume that it had to be fatal 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.570
 from my place it was seen that the plane 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.030
 pilot and the fireball were together 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.320
 can you see that the problem started here 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.990
 when the flame came out of the turbine 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.600
 right and it happened when once it 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.399
 introduced the engine of the same in a 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.500
 fraction of a second I knew that the plane 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.540
 I was going stars 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.549
 at such a low altitude Anatoli did not have 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.440
 time to recover the jet 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.310
 hit more than 400 on the ground 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.310
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.750
 It was hard to believe that someone could 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.750
 escape to such a terrible shock 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.619
 But again 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.479
 in the last possible second the seat 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.810
 of anatoly injection throws it out 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810
 of the airplane 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.990
 now it is only 60 meters from the earth 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.940
 with the precise time to open the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.220
 paraguay 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.800
 Hard landing to less than two 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.790
 seconds of his dangerously expulsion 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.790
 near death 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.110
 rescuers remove anatoli from 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.330
 that place incredibly still food 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.310
 only 24 hours appears in a 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.010
 press conference with no more 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.050
 lesions that a purple eye not many 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.450
 They expected 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.410
 the pilot would survive this given the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.410
 delay 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.910
 I think a less experienced pilot 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.910
 I would have died
