in<00:00:04.750> patients<00:00:05.750> with<00:00:06.049> aortic<00:00:06.770> valve<00:00:07.100> disease

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
in patients with aortic valve disease

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.790 
in patients with aortic valve disease
they<00:00:07.730> form<00:00:07.970> into<00:00:08.599> two<00:00:09.050> big<00:00:09.320> categories

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:11.800 
they form into two big categories

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.799 
they form into two big categories
patients<00:00:12.800> who've<00:00:13.010> got<00:00:13.340> a<00:00:13.610> or<00:00:14.210> ik<00:00:14.330> valves<00:00:14.690> that

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
patients who've got a or ik valves that

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.980 
patients who've got a or ik valves that
have<00:00:14.960> narrowed<00:00:15.349> down<00:00:15.380> and<00:00:16.070> are<00:00:16.820> calcified<00:00:17.660> and

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
have narrowed down and are calcified and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.070 
have narrowed down and are calcified and
that's<00:00:18.440> typically<00:00:18.860> in<00:00:19.130> elderly<00:00:19.640> patients<00:00:20.080> and

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
that's typically in elderly patients and

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.560 
that's typically in elderly patients and
the<00:00:21.260> patients<00:00:21.770> have<00:00:21.920> leaking<00:00:22.430> valves<00:00:22.910> those

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
the patients have leaking valves those

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.080 
the patients have leaking valves those
are<00:00:23.810> typically<00:00:24.170> younger<00:00:24.770> patients<00:00:25.340> a<00:00:25.520> leaky

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
are typically younger patients a leaky

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.599 
are typically younger patients a leaky
or<00:00:26.119> two<00:00:26.420> valve<00:00:26.689> can<00:00:26.960> possibly<00:00:27.740> be<00:00:28.039> salvaged

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
or two valve can possibly be salvaged

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.120 
or two valve can possibly be salvaged
and<00:00:28.850> repair<00:00:29.439> particularly<00:00:30.439> if<00:00:30.650> you<00:00:30.830> have<00:00:30.859> a

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
and repair particularly if you have a

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.229 
and repair particularly if you have a
type<00:00:31.970> of<00:00:32.300> valve<00:00:32.739> which<00:00:33.739> fairly<00:00:34.370> many<00:00:34.760> people

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
type of valve which fairly many people

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.509 
type of valve which fairly many people
are<00:00:35.389> born<00:00:35.719> with<00:00:35.809> what<00:00:36.170> we<00:00:36.319> call<00:00:36.559> a<00:00:36.589> bicuspid

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
are born with what we call a bicuspid

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.869 
are born with what we call a bicuspid
aortic<00:00:37.999> valve<00:00:38.569> so<00:00:38.809> we<00:00:38.960> are<00:00:39.139> doing<00:00:39.769> repairs<00:00:40.639> of

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
aortic valve so we are doing repairs of

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.479 
aortic valve so we are doing repairs of
those<00:00:41.030> valves<00:00:41.539> if<00:00:41.839> the<00:00:42.589> Artic<00:00:42.889> valve<00:00:43.100> cannot

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
those valves if the Artic valve cannot

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.199 
those valves if the Artic valve cannot
be<00:00:43.839> repaired<00:00:44.839> we<00:00:45.409> would<00:00:45.620> have<00:00:45.829> to<00:00:46.100> replace<00:00:46.760> it

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:47.209 
be repaired we would have to replace it

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:49.270 
be repaired we would have to replace it
and<00:00:47.389> if<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:47.809> replace<00:00:48.319> the<00:00:48.679> valve<00:00:48.889> there<00:00:49.129> are

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
and if you replace the valve there are

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.149 
and if you replace the valve there are
several<00:00:49.699> options<00:00:50.089> you<00:00:50.600> have<00:00:51.409> a<00:00:51.440> choice<00:00:51.829> of

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
several options you have a choice of

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.009 
several options you have a choice of
having<00:00:52.369> a<00:00:52.609> mechanical<00:00:53.269> valve<00:00:53.449> which<00:00:53.780> has<00:00:53.989> a

we do a two to three inch incision right

aortic valve the advantages of minimally
invasive<00:01:26.390> surgery<00:01:27.289> is<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:27.500> you<00:01:27.859> get<00:01:28.039> a

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
invasive surgery is that you get a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.950 
invasive surgery is that you get a
smaller<00:01:28.490> scar<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.179> get<00:01:29.329> a<00:01:29.359> little<00:01:29.600> bit<00:01:29.719> less

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
smaller scar and get a little bit less

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.669 
smaller scar and get a little bit less
pain<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:31.490> get<00:01:31.700> less<00:01:32.060> chance<00:01:32.929> of<00:01:33.140> blood<00:01:33.380> loss
