00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
drum gets really really low and then

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.240 
drum gets really really low and then
also<00:01:30.259> even<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> citrus<00:01:31.890> Barry<00:01:32.070> that's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
also even with the citrus Barry that's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.910 
also even with the citrus Barry that's
about<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> third<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.939> health<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.590> go<00:01:34.890> away

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
about a third of health it can go away

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.149 
about a third of health it can go away
really<00:01:35.369> fast<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.950> kangaskhan<00:01:37.950> use

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
really fast with that so kangaskhan use

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.249 
really fast with that so kangaskhan use
the<00:01:38.280> sucker<00:01:38.520> punch<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.150> trying<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> get<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the sucker punch on it trying to get the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.810 
the sucker punch on it trying to get the
prediction<00:01:40.770> doesn't<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> lot<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.579> damage

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
prediction doesn't do a lot of damage

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.389 
prediction doesn't do a lot of damage
because<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> ferry<00:01:42.630> typing<00:01:43.140> makes<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.070> Dark

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
because that ferry typing makes the Dark

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.100 
because that ferry typing makes the Dark
type<00:01:44.579> Sucker<00:01:45.090> Punch<00:01:45.360> not<00:01:45.720> very<00:01:45.930> effective

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
type Sucker Punch not very effective

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.260 
type Sucker Punch not very effective
against<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> eats<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.939> hit<00:01:48.090> pretty

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
against it so it eats up that hit pretty

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.390 
break down to whoever's talonflame his
fastest<00:03:47.859> i<00:03:47.949> feel<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:49.510> i<00:03:49.540> mean<00:03:49.870> if<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.400> opponent

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
fastest i feel so i mean if the opponent

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.400 
fastest i feel so i mean if the opponent
talonflame<00:03:51.819> was<00:03:52.269> faster<00:03:52.629> and<00:03:52.870> was<00:03:53.109> able<00:03:53.230> to

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
talonflame was faster and was able to

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.500 
talonflame was faster and was able to
like<00:03:53.530> KO<00:03:54.040> Garchomp<00:03:54.699> i<00:03:54.879> don't<00:03:55.269> know<00:03:55.329> i<00:03:55.449> don't

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
like KO Garchomp i don't know i don't

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.330 
like KO Garchomp i don't know i don't
know<00:03:55.750> where<00:03:55.930> this<00:03:56.019> would<00:03:56.169> have<00:03:56.290> gone<00:03:56.340> however

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
know where this would have gone however

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.509 
know where this would have gone however
the<00:03:58.239> opponent<00:03:58.690> focused<00:03:59.199> fires<00:03:59.500> talonflame<00:04:00.099> as

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
the opponent focused fires talonflame as

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.879 
the opponent focused fires talonflame as
there<00:04:00.970> was<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.120> beautiful<00:04:01.930> protect<00:04:02.319> prediction

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
there was a beautiful protect prediction

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.309 
there was a beautiful protect prediction
which<00:04:03.549> just<00:04:03.849> makes<00:04:04.030> talonflame<00:04:04.480> go<00:04:04.870> down<00:04:05.049> to

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
which just makes talonflame go down to

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.259 
which just makes talonflame go down to
the<00:04:06.389> rocks<00:04:07.389> yeah<00:04:08.379> I'm<00:04:08.680> totally<00:04:09.579> good<00:04:09.910> the

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
the rocks yeah I'm totally good the

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.659 
the rocks yeah I'm totally good the
stone<00:04:10.510> edge<00:04:10.690> right<00:04:10.870> there<00:04:11.190> so<00:04:12.190> talonflame

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
stone edge right there so talonflame

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.939 
stone edge right there so talonflame
goes<00:04:13.000> down<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.359> that<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.959> prediction<00:04:14.470> I<00:04:14.590> feel

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
goes down to that the prediction I feel

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:16.890 
goes down to that the prediction I feel
was<00:04:15.220> an<00:04:15.400> error<00:04:15.669> on<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:16.060> opponent<00:04:16.510> like<00:04:16.630> he

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
was an error on the opponent like he

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.029 
was an error on the opponent like he
shouldn't<00:04:17.109> have<00:04:17.199> focused<00:04:17.590> barred<00:04:17.769> he<00:04:17.919> would

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
shouldn't have focused barred he would

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.650 
shouldn't have focused barred he would
have<00:04:18.250> gotten<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.549> plus<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:19.090> Garchomp<00:04:19.299> by<00:04:19.599> the

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
have gotten the plus to Garchomp by the

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.140 
have gotten the plus to Garchomp by the
way<00:04:20.099> but<00:04:21.099> this<00:04:21.310> is<00:04:21.459> why<00:04:21.609> I<00:04:21.640> could<00:04:21.849> see<00:04:22.030> the

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
way but this is why I could see the

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.510 
way but this is why I could see the
focus<00:04:22.450> fire<00:04:22.630> on<00:04:22.659> talonflame<00:04:23.140> brave<00:04:23.590> bird

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
focus fire on talonflame brave bird

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.129 
focus fire on talonflame brave bird
would

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
would

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.610 
would
knocked<00:04:25.560> out<00:04:25.800> greninja<00:04:26.539> so<00:04:27.539> it<00:04:27.900> just<00:04:28.319> kind<00:04:28.530> of

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
knocked out greninja so it just kind of

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.170 
knocked out greninja so it just kind of
creates<00:04:28.949> a<00:04:29.039> really<00:04:29.219> interesting<00:04:29.610> scenario

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
creates a really interesting scenario

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.519 
creates a really interesting scenario
but<00:04:30.840> in<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.110> end<00:04:31.229> our<00:04:31.879> our<00:04:32.879> side<00:04:33.240> wins<00:04:33.569> so<00:04:34.259> this

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:34.529 
but in the end our our side wins so this

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.100 
but in the end our our side wins so this
is<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.710> good<00:04:35.460> battle<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.270> just<00:04:36.449> demonstrates<00:04:36.659> a

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
is a good battle it just demonstrates a

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.959 
is a good battle it just demonstrates a
lot<00:04:37.259> of<00:04:37.319> the<00:04:37.379> VGC<00:04:37.860> I<00:04:38.069> want<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.639> break<00:04:38.789> down<00:04:38.909> that

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:38.969 
lot of the VGC I want to break down that

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.179 
lot of the VGC I want to break down that
last<00:04:39.330> turn<00:04:39.509> a<00:04:39.569> bit<00:04:39.810> more<00:04:39.960> because<00:04:40.560> talonflame

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:41.189 
last turn a bit more because talonflame

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:43.070 
last turn a bit more because talonflame
the<00:04:41.759> opponent<00:04:42.090> talonflame<00:04:42.300> probably<00:04:42.810> had<00:04:42.930> at

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
the opponent talonflame probably had at

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.140 
the opponent talonflame probably had at
Ko<00:04:43.289> potential<00:04:43.830> on<00:04:43.979> Garchomp<00:04:44.219> and<00:04:44.669> then

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
Ko potential on Garchomp and then

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.100 
Ko potential on Garchomp and then
talonflame<00:04:45.900> had<00:04:46.229> a<00:04:46.259> KO<00:04:46.499> potential<00:04:47.039> on<00:04:47.249> a

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
talonflame had a KO potential on a

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.980 
talonflame had a KO potential on a
greninja<00:04:49.110> which<00:04:49.800> means<00:04:50.240> brave<00:04:51.240> which<00:04:51.749> means

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
greninja which means brave which means

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.929 
greninja which means brave which means
like<00:04:52.199> you<00:04:52.469> could<00:04:52.710> have<00:04:52.740> hit<00:04:53.129> Garchomp<00:04:53.639> with

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:53.939 
like you could have hit Garchomp with

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.269 
like you could have hit Garchomp with
the<00:04:54.150> opponent<00:04:54.870> talonflame<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.650> then<00:04:56.159> that

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:56.279 
the opponent talonflame and then that

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.649 
the opponent talonflame and then that
would<00:04:56.460> have<00:04:56.550> been<00:04:56.669> just<00:04:56.729> a<00:04:57.029> clear<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.569> then

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
would have been just a clear and then

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.269 
would have been just a clear and then
whoever's<00:04:58.050> talonflame<00:04:58.349> was<00:04:58.620> fastest<00:04:59.099> would

00:04:59.269 --> 00:04:59.279 
whoever's talonflame was fastest would

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.059 
whoever's talonflame was fastest would
have<00:04:59.370> won<00:04:59.550> I'm<00:04:59.789> not<00:05:00.719> sure<00:05:00.960> so<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.800> battle
