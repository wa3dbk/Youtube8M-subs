I<00:00:02.570> wanted<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.659> be<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.810> doctor<00:00:04.080> since<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.770> was<00:00:04.920> a

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
I wanted to be a doctor since I was a

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.150 
I wanted to be a doctor since I was a
child<00:00:05.130> my<00:00:05.670> father's<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.359> cardiologist<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.500> he

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
child my father's a cardiologist and he

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.290 
child my father's a cardiologist and he
would<00:00:08.309> come<00:00:08.429> home<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.639> had<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.210> much

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
would come home and had so much

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.780 
would come home and had so much
enthusiasm<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:10.320> what<00:00:10.650> he<00:00:10.920> was<00:00:11.040> practicing<00:00:11.429> I

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
enthusiasm for what he was practicing I

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.150 
enthusiasm for what he was practicing I
think<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.540> enthusiasm<00:00:13.320> rubbed<00:00:13.740> off<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:14.130> me

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
think that enthusiasm rubbed off on me

think that enthusiasm rubbed off on me
and<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.330> got<00:00:15.480> older<00:00:16.340> it's<00:00:17.340> really<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and as I got older it's really the the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.790 
and as I got older it's really the the
blend<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.690> science<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.320> taking<00:00:19.590> care<00:00:19.740> of

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
blend of science and taking care of

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
became more involved in knowing them and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.810 
became more involved in knowing them and
understanding<00:01:00.620> who<00:01:01.160> they<00:01:01.190> were<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:01.550> where

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.080 
it really made me love primary care and

it made me want to stay in the area and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.150 
it made me want to stay in the area and
continue<00:01:08.509> working<00:01:08.690> there<00:01:09.050> it<00:01:09.770> wasn't<00:01:10.070> just

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
continue working there it wasn't just

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.400 
continue working there it wasn't just
the<00:01:10.280> patients<00:01:10.759> it<00:01:10.880> was<00:01:10.970> on<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.660> faculty<00:01:11.900> that

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
the patients it was on the faculty that

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.700 
the patients it was on the faculty that
that<00:01:13.009> taught<00:01:13.250> me<00:01:13.430> they<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:14.390> know<00:01:14.450> they<00:01:14.810> they

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
that taught me they you know they they

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.029 
that taught me they you know they they
were<00:01:15.770> able<00:01:16.160> to<00:01:16.460> give<00:01:16.580> me<00:01:16.610> more<00:01:16.850> autonomy<00:01:21.039> when

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
were able to give me more autonomy when

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.529 
were able to give me more autonomy when
you're<00:01:22.190> being<00:01:22.310> cared<00:01:22.910> for<00:01:22.970> in<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.240> teaching

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
you're being cared for in a teaching

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.770 
you're being cared for in a teaching
facility<00:01:23.690> and<00:01:24.619> atmosphere<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:25.630> Education<00:01:26.630> and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
facility and atmosphere of Education and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.840 
facility and atmosphere of Education and
excitement<00:01:27.440> that<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:28.310> think<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:28.729> the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
excitement that I think is the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.570 
excitement that I think is the
foundation<00:01:29.539> for<00:01:29.750> our<00:01:30.140> patient<00:01:30.800> care<00:01:31.009> you

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
foundation for our patient care you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.999 
foundation for our patient care you
really<00:01:31.759> have<00:01:31.940> multiple<00:01:32.390> layers<00:01:32.660> of<00:01:32.810> of<00:01:33.560> care

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
really have multiple layers of of care

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.460 
really have multiple layers of of care
so<00:01:34.399> you<00:01:35.119> know<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.330> resident<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.229> first

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
so you know the resident is the first

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.080 
so you know the resident is the first
line<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.009> they're<00:01:37.190> going<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:37.640> take<00:01:37.789> care<00:01:38.030> of

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
line so they're going to take care of

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.639 
line so they're going to take care of
you<00:01:38.149> but<00:01:38.300> they're<00:01:38.420> also<00:01:38.539> being<00:01:38.899> supervised<00:01:39.500> by

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
you but they're also being supervised by

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.670 
you but they're also being supervised by
more<00:01:40.369> experienced<00:01:40.820> faculty<00:01:41.060> members<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.350> I

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
more experienced faculty members so I

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.070 
more experienced faculty members so I
think<00:01:42.920> it's<00:01:43.190> less<00:01:43.940> likely<00:01:44.660> that<00:01:44.810> something

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
think it's less likely that something

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.359 
think it's less likely that something
will<00:01:45.320> fall<00:01:45.500> through<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.770> cracks<00:01:45.800> because<00:01:46.190> you

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
will fall through the cracks because you

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.660 
will fall through the cracks because you
haven't<00:01:46.640> sort<00:01:47.119> of<00:01:47.179> a<00:01:47.240> web<00:01:47.509> of<00:01:47.840> care<00:01:48.460> taken<00:01:49.460> care

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
haven't sort of a web of care taken care

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.560 
haven't sort of a web of care taken care
of<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:51.100> our<00:01:52.100> interactions<00:01:52.880> are<00:01:53.090> much<00:01:53.330> more

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
of you our interactions are much more

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.390 
of you our interactions are much more
dependent<00:01:54.110> on<00:01:54.229> each<00:01:54.290> other<00:01:54.650> to<00:01:54.799> provide

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
dependent on each other to provide

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.810 
dependent on each other to provide
better<00:01:56.030> patient<00:01:56.360> care<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:57.619> don't<00:01:57.920> think<00:01:58.580> that

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
better patient care I don't think that

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.539 
better patient care I don't think that
collaboration<00:01:59.720> is<00:02:00.140> good<00:02:00.710> enough<00:02:00.950> anymore<00:02:01.159> I

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
collaboration is good enough anymore I

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.640 
collaboration is good enough anymore I
think<00:02:01.790> we<00:02:01.909> really<00:02:02.240> need<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.750> be<00:02:02.900> on<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.439> same

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
think we really need to be on the same

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.450 
think we really need to be on the same
