00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.580 

okay<00:07:06.280> well<00:07:06.580> name<00:07:06.790> busy<00:07:07.150> emergency<00:07:07.449> services

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.690 

Saburo<00:07:11.010> here<00:07:12.590> okay

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.470 

Landen<00:07:16.800> just<00:07:17.800> made<00:07:17.980> it<00:07:18.210> the<00:07:19.210> end<00:07:19.300> of<00:07:19.420> the

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480 
Landen just made it the end of the

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.180 
Landen just made it the end of the
runway<00:07:19.690> is<00:07:19.930> right<00:07:20.170> there

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
runway is right there

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.890 
runway is right there
this<00:07:21.490> was<00:07:21.670> one<00:07:21.850> of<00:07:21.880> the<00:07:22.060> few<00:07:22.240> situations<00:07:22.510> where

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:22.900 
this was one of the few situations where

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.110 
this was one of the few situations where
you<00:07:23.110> have<00:07:23.140> to<00:07:23.350> turn<00:07:23.710> off<00:07:23.950> the<00:07:24.190> engines<00:07:24.580> on

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 
you have to turn off the engines on

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.400 
you have to turn off the engines on
purpose

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.410 
purpose

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.710 
purpose
governor<00:07:27.190> failure<00:07:27.580> on<00:07:27.760> both<00:07:28.060> engines<00:07:28.510> death

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
governor failure on both engines death

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.650 
governor failure on both engines death
meant<00:07:28.990> that<00:07:29.170> we<00:07:29.320> had<00:07:29.500> full<00:07:30.310> thrust<00:07:30.700> and<00:07:30.940> the

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:31.660 
meant that we had full thrust and the

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.930 
meant that we had full thrust and the
turtles<00:07:31.990> were<00:07:32.170> not<00:07:32.380> working<00:07:32.620> so<00:07:33.550> we<00:07:33.670> had<00:07:33.820> to

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:33.940 
turtles were not working so we had to

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.330 
turtles were not working so we had to
turn<00:07:34.090> off<00:07:34.270> engine<00:07:34.600> 1<00:07:34.840> then<00:07:35.530> apply<00:07:35.770> as<00:07:36.100> much

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.340 
turn off engine 1 then apply as much

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.420 
turn off engine 1 then apply as much
drag<00:07:36.640> as<00:07:36.820> possible<00:07:37.270> with<00:07:37.420> beer<00:07:37.660> and<00:07:37.690> claps<00:07:38.170> and

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.430 
drag as possible with beer and claps and

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.080 
drag as possible with beer and claps and
spoilers<00:07:39.430> and<00:07:39.730> then<00:07:40.590> arrival<00:07:41.590> on<00:07:41.680> final<00:07:42.160> turn

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.090 
spoilers and then arrival on final turn

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.570 
spoilers and then arrival on final turn
of<00:07:43.240> the<00:07:43.420> second<00:07:43.750> engine<00:07:44.050> and<00:07:44.200> then<00:07:45.070> glide<00:07:45.340> down

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:45.580 
of the second engine and then glide down

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.640 
of the second engine and then glide down
to<00:07:45.730> the<00:07:45.820> roller<00:07:46.000> I<00:07:46.690> hope<00:07:47.140> you<00:07:47.380> like<00:07:47.500> the

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:47.650 
to the roller I hope you like the

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.180 
to the roller I hope you like the
situation<00:07:47.910> we'll<00:07:48.910> try<00:07:49.120> to<00:07:49.180> make<00:07:49.450> some<00:07:49.660> more

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.190 
situation we'll try to make some more

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.920 
situation we'll try to make some more
failures<00:07:51.190> like<00:07:51.430> this<00:07:51.790> and<00:07:52.120> even<00:07:52.570> probably

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:52.930 
failures like this and even probably

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.440 
failures like this and even probably
worse<00:07:53.170> in<00:07:53.830> the<00:07:54.010> next<00:07:54.130> video<00:07:54.490> so<00:07:54.970> see<00:07:55.210> you<00:07:55.270> guys

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:55.450 
worse in the next video so see you guys

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.900 
worse in the next video so see you guys
bye
