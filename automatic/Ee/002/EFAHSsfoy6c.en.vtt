00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
what it was I don't think people realize

what it was I don't think people realize
just<00:01:06.630> how<00:01:06.780> close<00:01:07.170> he<00:01:07.409> was<00:01:07.439> having<00:01:08.250> blood

nearly<00:01:09.270> half<00:01:09.450> his<00:01:09.600> blood<00:01:09.869> volume<00:01:10.159> into<00:01:11.159> his

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
nearly half his blood volume into his

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
nearly half his blood volume into his
belly<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.670> mean<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.119> had<00:01:12.240> happened<00:01:12.420> quickly

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
belly I mean if it had happened quickly

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.730 
belly I mean if it had happened quickly
rather<00:01:13.590> than<00:01:13.799> okay<00:01:13.950> over<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> period<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.000> time

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
rather than okay over a period of time

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.510 
rather than okay over a period of time
we<00:01:16.740> wouldn't<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.100> having<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.400> discussion

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
worth it and with Havasu the thing I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.830 
worth it and with Havasu the thing I
learned<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.000> don't<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.270> don't<00:01:24.420> know<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
learned I don't I don't know if it was a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.270 
learned I don't I don't know if it was a
good<00:01:25.020> thing<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.470> learned<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.130> only

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
good thing I learned that you can only

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.770 
good thing I learned that you can only
tolerate<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:26.759> much<00:01:26.970> pain<00:01:27.270> before<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.630> pass

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
tolerate so much pain before you pass

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.380 
tolerate so much pain before you pass
out<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:29.009> figured<00:01:29.280> I'd<00:01:29.369> already<00:01:29.549> been

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
out and I figured I'd already been

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.670 
out and I figured I'd already been
through<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> most<00:01:30.869> pain<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.350> could<00:01:31.530> ever

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
through the most pain I could ever

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.940 
through the most pain I could ever
possibly<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:32.460> through<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.590> really<00:01:34.799> wasn't

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
possibly go through so it really wasn't

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.420 
possibly go through so it really wasn't
anything<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> fear<00:01:36.049> most<00:01:37.049> people<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:38.070> they

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
anything to fear most people if they

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.069 
anything to fear most people if they
think<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.060> know<00:01:39.150> they<00:01:39.299> get<00:01:39.420> an<00:01:39.570> accident

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
think you know they get an accident

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.340 
think you know they get an accident
doing<00:01:41.070> something<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:41.670> love<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:43.110> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
doing something they love if it if it
