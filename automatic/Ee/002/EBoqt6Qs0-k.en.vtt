one<00:00:00.900> two<00:00:01.079> three<00:00:01.319> again<00:00:01.769> this<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:02.850> video

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.120 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.220 

6:07<00:00:06.290> yeah<00:00:07.319> model<00:00:08.780> 2003<00:00:10.220> we<00:00:11.220> here<00:00:11.820> solve

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
6:07 yeah model 2003 we here solve

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.129 
6:07 yeah model 2003 we here solve
problem<00:00:13.230> for<00:00:13.620> finding<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.370> crankshaft

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
problem for finding the crankshaft

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.570 
problem for finding the crankshaft
position<00:00:16.139> sensor<00:00:16.970> yes<00:00:18.560> here<00:00:19.560> if<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.949> can<00:00:20.249> focus

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
position sensor yes here if we can focus

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.109 
position sensor yes here if we can focus
it<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.929> can<00:00:22.140> see<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.980> crankshaft<00:00:23.759> position

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
it we can see the crankshaft position

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.720 
it we can see the crankshaft position
sensor<00:00:26.210> first<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.419> remove<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.789> houses<00:00:31.730> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
sensor first we remove the houses the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.920 
sensor first we remove the houses the
house<00:00:35.060> from<00:00:36.060> the<00:00:36.390> bump<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.670> then<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:39.630> can

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
house from the bump and then we can

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.060 
house from the bump and then we can
found<00:00:43.130> we<00:00:44.130> can<00:00:44.340> find<00:00:45.080> this<00:00:46.080> position<00:00:46.380> sensor

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
found we can find this position sensor

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.100 
found we can find this position sensor
it's<00:00:47.250> hard<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.790> find<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:49.850> if<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.510> it's

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
it's hard to find it if you can see it's

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:06.690 
it's hard to find it if you can see it's
under<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:55.350> bump<00:00:56.120> connection<00:00:59.900> let's<00:01:00.900> here

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.080 

so<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:07.850> can<00:01:08.090> see<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.630> wires<00:01:08.840> two<00:01:10.090> wires

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
so you can see the wires two wires

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.109 
so you can see the wires two wires
connect<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:12.049> this<00:01:12.290> connector<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.130> just<00:01:13.850> we

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
connect to this connector and just we

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.399 
connect to this connector and just we
lose<00:01:15.280> this<00:01:16.280> one<00:01:16.520> this<00:01:17.380> bolts<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.799> we<00:01:19.520> can

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
lose this one this bolts and we can

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.859 
lose this one this bolts and we can
remove<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:23.630> sensor<00:01:24.080> directly<00:01:25.509> this<00:01:26.509> is<00:01:26.690> the

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
remove the sensor directly this is the

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:35.039 
remove the sensor directly this is the
sensor<00:01:27.229> here<00:01:31.000> can<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.119> focus

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.719 

can<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.859> see<00:01:36.009> hinge<00:01:38.640> yeah<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:41.049> is<00:01:41.229> helpful

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
can you see hinge yeah this is helpful

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.749 
can you see hinge yeah this is helpful
somebody<00:01:42.729> need<00:01:43.060> if<00:01:43.840> it's<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.679> car<00:01:44.979> doesn't

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
somebody need if it's the car doesn't

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.929 
somebody need if it's the car doesn't
have<00:01:46.030> any<00:01:47.219> spark<00:01:48.219> on<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.880> blog<00:01:49.319> spark<00:01:50.319> plugs

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
have any spark on the blog spark plugs

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.529 
have any spark on the blog spark plugs
the<00:01:51.939> problem<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:53.590> on<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.100> crankshaft

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
the problem it's on the crankshaft

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:01.979 
the problem it's on the crankshaft
position<00:01:55.539> sense<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.959> this<00:01:56.860> one<00:01:58.860> thank<00:01:59.860> you
