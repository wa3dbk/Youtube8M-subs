I'm<00:00:00.179> counting<00:00:00.510> over<00:00:00.630> from<00:00:00.930> Burbank<00:00:01.260> High

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
I'm counting over from Burbank High

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.050 
I'm counting over from Burbank High
School<00:00:01.740> and<00:00:01.949> today<00:00:02.310> we're<00:00:02.550> going<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.700> learn<00:00:02.850> to

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
School and today we're going to learn to

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.300 
School and today we're going to learn to
solve<00:00:03.270> quadratic<00:00:03.629> equations<00:00:04.310> using

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310

let's solve x squared equals 4

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.880 
let's solve x squared equals 4
this<00:00:20.699> means<00:00:21.029> some<00:00:21.539> number<00:00:21.990> times<00:00:22.289> itself

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
this means some number times itself

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.540 
this means some number times itself
equals<00:00:23.220> 4<00:00:24.439> now<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.500> solve<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.099> would<00:00:26.430> take

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
equals 4 now to solve this we would take

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.849 
equals 4 now to solve this we would take
the<00:00:26.730> square<00:00:27.029> root<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.359> both<00:00:27.480> sides<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.710> end

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
square root of 4 the square root of 4

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.400 
square root of 4 the square root of 4
means<00:00:36.210> some<00:00:36.719> number<00:00:37.170> times<00:00:37.469> itself<00:00:38.160> equals<00:00:38.489> 4

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
means some number times itself equals 4

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.799 
means some number times itself equals 4
well<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.500> turns<00:00:40.739> out<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.100> number<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.579> 2<00:00:44.809> we

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
well it turns out that number is 2 we

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.639 
well it turns out that number is 2 we
can<00:00:45.960> check<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.410> by<00:00:46.640> noticing<00:00:47.640> 2<00:00:48.300> times<00:00:48.750> 2

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
can check this by noticing 2 times 2

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
can check this by noticing 2 times 2
equals<00:00:50.510> 4<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.100> also<00:00:53.100> negative<00:00:53.910> 2<00:00:54.199> times

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
equals 4 and also negative 2 times

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.389 
equals 4 and also negative 2 times
negative<00:00:55.710> 2<00:00:56.070> equals<00:00:57.140> 4<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:59.100> why<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
negative 2 equals 4 that's why the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.820 
negative 2 equals 4 that's why the
plus/minus<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.359> me<00:01:01.370> now<00:01:02.370> try<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> different<00:01:03.000> one

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
plus/minus is me now try a different one

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.080 
plus/minus is me now try a different one
let's<00:01:04.830> try<00:01:05.070> x<00:01:05.580> squared<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.960> equals<00:01:08.090> negative

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
let's try x squared with equals negative

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.010 
let's try x squared with equals negative
1<00:01:10.490> now<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.760> case<00:01:11.970> what<00:01:12.360> number<00:01:12.780> times

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
1 now in this case what number times

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.070 
1 now in this case what number times
itself<00:01:13.290> equals<00:01:13.860> negative<00:01:14.310> 1<00:01:14.780> we'll<00:01:15.780> start

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
itself equals negative 1 we'll start

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.469 
itself equals negative 1 we'll start
this<00:01:16.200> problem<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.680> same<00:01:16.860> way<00:01:17.330> take<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
this problem the same way take the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.420 
this problem the same way take the
square<00:01:18.750> root<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.080> both<00:01:19.200> sides<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.130> x

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
square root of both sides and we get x

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.330 
square root of both sides and we get x
equals<00:01:20.900> plus<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:22.049> minus<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.619> square<00:01:22.799> root<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
equals plus or minus the square root of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.359 
equals plus or minus the square root of
negative<00:01:23.549> 1<00:01:24.229> what<00:01:25.229> number<00:01:25.680> times<00:01:26.040> itself

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
negative 1 what number times itself

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.380 
negative 1 what number times itself
equals<00:01:26.909> negative<00:01:27.540> 1<00:01:27.990> well<00:01:28.950> 1<00:01:29.250> times<00:01:29.549> 1<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.090> 1

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
equals negative 1 well 1 times 1 is 1

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.530 
equals negative 1 well 1 times 1 is 1
and<00:01:30.689> negative<00:01:31.320> 1<00:01:31.590> times<00:01:31.979> negative<00:01:32.100> 1<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.700> still

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and negative 1 times negative 1 is still

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.760 
and negative 1 times negative 1 is still
1<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.640> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.000> strange<00:01:36.439> it<00:01:37.439> turns

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
1 so this is kind of strange it turns

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.490 
1 so this is kind of strange it turns
out<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.270> use<00:01:39.570> an<00:01:39.780> imaginary

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
out that we have to use an imaginary

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.530 
out that we have to use an imaginary
number<00:01:40.650> call<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> eye<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:42.119> solve<00:01:42.360> this

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
number call the eye to solve this

equals plus or minus negative 1 times 16

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.400 
equals plus or minus negative 1 times 16
times<00:02:33.800> 2<00:02:35.240> now<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.300> product<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.930> these<00:02:37.080> three

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
times 2 now the product of these three

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.110 
times 2 now the product of these three
numbers<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:38.040> negative<00:02:38.580> 32

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
numbers is negative 32

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.060 
numbers is negative 32
but<00:02:39.780> when<00:02:39.930> written<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.650> we<00:02:40.890> can

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
but when written like this we can

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.400 
but when written like this we can
clearly<00:02:41.340> see<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.700> 16<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.810> perfect<00:02:42.989> square

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
clearly see that 16 is a perfect square

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.610 
clearly see that 16 is a perfect square
so<00:02:44.220> we<00:02:44.370> can<00:02:44.400> pull<00:02:44.730> out<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.090> root<00:02:45.330> 4<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.140> put<00:02:46.500> it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
so we can pull out the root 4 and put it

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.280 
so we can pull out the root 4 and put it
in<00:02:46.770> front<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> radical<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:48.540> let's<00:02:48.900> do<00:02:49.110> that

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
in front of the radical so let's do that

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.080 
in front of the radical so let's do that
x<00:02:49.620> equals<00:02:50.459> plus<00:02:50.910> or<00:02:51.209> minus<00:02:51.290> 4<00:02:52.670> times<00:02:53.670> negative

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
x equals plus or minus 4 times negative

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.430 
x equals plus or minus 4 times negative
1<00:02:54.870> times<00:02:55.739> 2<00:02:56.420> now<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:57.480> need<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.840> deal<00:02:58.020> with<00:02:58.230> that

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
1 times 2 now we need to deal with that

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.100 
1 times 2 now we need to deal with that
negative<00:02:58.950> 1<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.940> deal<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.480> negative<00:03:00.900> 1

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
negative 1 to deal with that negative 1

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.630 
negative 1 to deal with that negative 1
we<00:03:01.410> pull<00:03:01.709> its<00:03:01.980> root<00:03:02.310> now<00:03:02.550> it's<00:03:03.090> root<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:04.640> so

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
we pull its root now it's root is I so

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.460 
we pull its root now it's root is I so
we're<00:03:05.820> left<00:03:05.970> with<00:03:06.299> x<00:03:07.140> equals<00:03:07.790> plus<00:03:08.790> or<00:03:09.090> minus

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
we're left with x equals plus or minus

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.170 
we're left with x equals plus or minus
4i<00:03:10.470> times<00:03:12.350> rad<00:03:13.350> 2<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.100> there's<00:03:14.670> nothing<00:03:15.030> more

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
4i times rad 2 and there's nothing more

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.970 
4i times rad 2 and there's nothing more
we<00:03:15.360> can<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.660> with<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:15.989> there's<00:03:16.590> no<00:03:16.769> more

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
we can do with this there's no more

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.770 
we can do with this there's no more
perfect<00:03:17.459> square<00:03:17.730> as<00:03:17.880> we<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.150> factor<00:03:18.570> out<00:03:18.660> of

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
perfect square as we can factor out of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.630 
perfect square as we can factor out of
the<00:03:18.870> radical<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:22.260> now<00:03:22.680> let's<00:03:22.920> talk<00:03:23.100> about<00:03:23.160> some

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
the radical so now let's talk about some

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:41.900 
the radical so now let's talk about some
properties<00:03:24.080> by<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.980> imaginary<00:03:26.610> number

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.080 

any<00:03:42.540> number<00:03:42.990> to<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.530> first<00:03:43.860> power<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.520> simply

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
any number to the first power is simply

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.090 
any number to the first power is simply
itself

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
itself

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.850 
itself
so<00:03:47.100> either<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:47.760> first<00:03:48.000> power<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:49.020> now

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
so either the first power is I now

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.310 
so either the first power is I now
remember<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.670> also<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.630> square<00:03:51.930> root<00:03:52.230> of

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
remember I is also the square root of

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.210 
remember I is also the square root of
negative<00:03:52.500> one<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.850> we'll<00:03:54.000> put<00:03:54.210> equals<00:03:55.220> square

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
negative one so we'll put equals square

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.530 
negative one so we'll put equals square
root<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.580> negative<00:03:56.790> one

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
root of negative one

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.150 
root of negative one
what<00:03:58.470> about<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:59.010> squared<00:04:00.380> but<00:04:01.380> we<00:04:01.410> can<00:04:01.710> rewrite

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
what about I squared but we can rewrite

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.920 
what about I squared but we can rewrite
I<00:04:02.370> square<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.970> as<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.270> square<00:04:03.570> root<00:04:03.630> of

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
I square it as the square root of

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.690 
I square it as the square root of
negative<00:04:04.050> 1<00:04:04.470> times<00:04:04.710> the<00:04:05.160> square<00:04:05.310> root<00:04:05.490> of

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
negative 1 times the square root of

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:13.580 
negative 1 times the square root of
negative<00:04:05.880> one<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:11.220> we<00:04:11.460> get<00:04:12.140> negative<00:04:13.140> 1

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
negative one and we get negative 1

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.100 
negative one and we get negative 1
because<00:04:13.980> any<00:04:14.460> square<00:04:14.820> root<00:04:15.090> times<00:04:15.540> itself

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
because any square root times itself

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.410 
because any square root times itself
gives<00:04:16.440> us<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.160> radicand<00:04:17.640> in<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.150> case

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
gives us the radicand in this case

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.539 
gives us the radicand in this case
negative<00:04:18.900> 1

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
negative 1

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.440 
negative 1
what<00:04:20.549> about<00:04:20.640> I<00:04:21.049> cubed<00:04:22.490> we<00:04:23.490> can<00:04:23.670> rewrite<00:04:24.120> haya

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
what about I cubed we can rewrite haya

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:32.050 
what about I cubed we can rewrite haya
cubed<00:04:24.900> as<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.680> squared<00:04:26.450> times<00:04:27.450> I

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.660 

well<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.300> squared<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.200> was<00:04:34.320> negative<00:04:34.770> 1<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:35.280> I

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
well I squared it was negative 1 and I

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.170 
well I squared it was negative 1 and I
was<00:04:36.240> just<00:04:36.540> I<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:37.320> we<00:04:37.920> end<00:04:38.070> up<00:04:38.220> with<00:04:38.430> negative<00:04:38.700> 1

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
was just I so we end up with negative 1

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.670 
was just I so we end up with negative 1
times<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:40.640> and<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:42.540> equals<00:04:43.250> maybe<00:04:44.250> divine

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
times I and that equals maybe divine

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.620 
times I and that equals maybe divine
what<00:04:46.680> about<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.890> in<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.400> fourth<00:04:50.330> well<00:04:51.330> we<00:04:51.450> can

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
what about I in the fourth well we can

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.750 
what about I in the fourth well we can
rewrite<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.530> fourth<00:04:52.830> as<00:04:53.100> I<00:04:53.840> squared

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
rewrite I to the fourth as I squared

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.980 
rewrite I to the fourth as I squared
times<00:04:56.760> I<00:04:57.030> squared<00:04:59.030> each<00:05:00.030> of<00:05:00.240> these<00:05:00.330> I<00:05:00.510> squared

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
times I squared each of these I squared

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.090 
times I squared each of these I squared
is<00:05:01.350> a<00:05:01.380> negative<00:05:01.500> 1<00:05:02.070> so<00:05:02.460> we<00:05:02.580> get<00:05:03.560> negative<00:05:04.560> 1

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
is a negative 1 so we get negative 1

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.380 
is a negative 1 so we get negative 1
times<00:05:05.850> negative<00:05:06.030> 1<00:05:06.480> and<00:05:07.760> negative<00:05:08.760> 1<00:05:09.000> times

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
times negative 1 and negative 1 times

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.730 
times negative 1 and negative 1 times
negative<00:05:09.570> 1<00:05:09.960> is<00:05:09.990> simply<00:05:10.530> 1<00:05:11.630> do<00:05:12.630> one<00:05:13.050> more<00:05:13.320> I<00:05:13.560> to

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
negative 1 is simply 1 do one more I to

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.440 
negative 1 is simply 1 do one more I to
the<00:05:14.070> fifth<00:05:16.430> we<00:05:17.430> could<00:05:17.610> rewrite<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.180> of<00:05:18.360> the

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
the fifth we could rewrite I of the

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.980 
the fifth we could rewrite I of the
fifth<00:05:18.720> as<00:05:18.960> I<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.920> the<00:05:20.280> fourth<00:05:21.860> times<00:05:22.860> I<00:05:23.250> and

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
fifth as I to the fourth times I and

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.740 
fifth as I to the fourth times I and
let's<00:05:24.990> see<00:05:25.140> I<00:05:25.290> have<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.740> fourth<00:05:26.130> was<00:05:27.000> 1<00:05:27.390> 1

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
let's see I have the fourth was 1 1

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:34.360 
let's see I have the fourth was 1 1
times<00:05:28.710> eyes<00:05:29.070> and

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.350 

hi<00:05:35.370> again<00:05:35.670> and<00:05:37.430> if<00:05:38.430> we<00:05:38.580> were<00:05:38.700> to<00:05:38.790> continue<00:05:39.000> this

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
hi again and if we were to continue this

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.590 
hi again and if we were to continue this
with<00:05:39.720> out<00:05:39.900> of<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.080> six<00:05:40.440> seven<00:05:41.070> eight<00:05:41.370> etc

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
with out of the six seven eight etc

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.660 
with out of the six seven eight etc
we'd<00:05:42.870> actually<00:05:43.020> notice<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.650> pattern<00:05:43.860> the

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
we'd actually notice a pattern the

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.890 
we'd actually notice a pattern the
pattern<00:05:44.700> goes<00:05:45.150> like<00:05:45.360> this

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
pattern goes like this

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.330 
pattern goes like this
I<00:05:47.660> negative<00:05:48.660> 1<00:05:49.220> negative<00:05:50.220> I<00:05:51.470> 1<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:52.830> then<00:05:53.250> the

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
I negative 1 negative I 1 and then the

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.360 
I negative 1 negative I 1 and then the
pattern<00:05:53.550> starts<00:05:54.030> again<00:05:54.270> with<00:05:54.300> I<00:05:55.070> minus<00:05:56.070> 6

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
pattern starts again with I minus 6

to the 20th as I to the fourth raised to
the<00:06:22.410> 5th<00:06:22.680> power<00:06:22.850> which<00:06:23.850> would<00:06:24.000> be<00:06:24.210> I<00:06:24.480> to<00:06:24.750> the

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
now I to the fourth is 1 so this equals

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.770 
now I to the fourth is 1 so this equals
1<00:06:34.050> times<00:06:34.919> 1<00:06:35.190> times<00:06:35.490> 1<00:06:36.030> times<00:06:36.510> 1<00:06:37.050> times<00:06:37.890> 1<00:06:38.780> 1

let's<00:06:48.060> try<00:06:48.270> I<00:06:48.360> to<00:06:48.630> the<00:06:48.930> 21st<00:06:51.890> we<00:06:52.890> can<00:06:53.070> rewrite<00:06:53.460> I

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
let's try I to the 21st we can rewrite I

to the 21st as I to the 20th times I
well<00:07:00.660> we<00:07:00.780> just<00:07:00.930> found<00:07:01.110> out<00:07:01.350> I<00:07:01.620> to<00:07:01.680> the<00:07:01.980> 20th<00:07:02.520> is

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:02.730 
well we just found out I to the 20th is

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:11.810 
well we just found out I to the 20th is
1<00:07:03.180> so<00:07:03.900> this<00:07:04.080> can<00:07:04.290> be<00:07:04.320> rewritten<00:07:04.560> as<00:07:04.919> 1<00:07:05.220> times<00:07:05.550> I
