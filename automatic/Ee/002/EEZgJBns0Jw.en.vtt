00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.470
 hello that such video tutorial number 5 of 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.570
 course windows server 2003 and we continue 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.670
 with a new video in which we see how 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.400
 install and configure the hcp service 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.050
 in our server well it's about 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.779
 Dynamic configuration protocol 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.669
 host a tcp / ip standard designed to 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.259
 simplify the administration of the 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.670
 ip configuration of the equipment 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.610
 our network 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.040
 hcp dynamically assigns directions 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.230
 ip for a time known as 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.540
 granting time to the stations of 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.830
 work distributing in addition others 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.320
 configuration parameters between 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.300
 authorized network clients such as 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.800
 the link port or the dns servers 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.770
 good to carry out the extraction 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.590
 of the hcp service we will use the start 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.460
 the control panel in add or remove 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.570
 programs within the window add or 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.890
 remove programs in add or remove 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.890
 windows components 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.680
 we will look for network services 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.860
 what are they 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.670
 we will select them 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.410
 we will click on details and here we will mark 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.060
 Dynamic configuration protocol 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:20.280
 host of hcp click on accept and then 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.500
 in next the installation will begin 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.830
 remember that it is necessary to have the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.470
 windows or the installation disk of 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.500
 windows server 2003 and once finished 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.740
 the installation then we are going to finish 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.220
 and we will have installed the hcp 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.920
 we closed the seats of this window 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.350
 and now we will click on start in 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.360
 administrative tools and we will do 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.200
 click on hcp to start configuring 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 the hcp 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.450
 we will begin by defining new areas 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.720
 for this we have to click on 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.120
 our server and we will click with the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.690
 right mouse button over it and 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.580
 click on the new field 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.820
 we are shown a creation assistant 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.380
 of a new field whose first window 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.450
 then we simply click on next 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.790
 in the next window of the assistant 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.670
 we must indicate the name that we associate 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.290
 to the new field 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.719
 in this case 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.719
 I call my field oliver informatics 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.470
 and a description 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.450
 For example, an area that will provide services 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.710
 hcp 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.760
 to the entire network 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.740
 of oliver computer point is we press 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.930
 the next 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.610
 then we must indicate the range 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.660
 of ip addresses that will serve 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.600
 our server dhcp 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.550
 in our case we will indicate that the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.650
 next sipe to be seen in the range 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:58.040
 ranging from 192 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:05.480
 168 150 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:08.150
 at 192 168 1 200 so that it would be of 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.760
 hcp can assign 150 ip addresses to 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.930
 the clients 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.709
 and we reserve from 1 to 49 for 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.450
 the router address of our house 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.420
 as well as the other equipment that 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.880
 connect to our network 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.849
 we also saved him from 201 to 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.830
 the 254 to any other element 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.410
 susceptible to having ip addresses 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.160
 static as our own server 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.510
 that has the 220 as well as can also 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.080
 be acr access point printer 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.610
 wireless etcetera well also say 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:49.430
 that the mask is about we will use 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:52.290
 will be of length 24 or 255 155 255 0 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.849
 we press the following 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:59.480
 and in the next window it appears 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.480
 add exclusions 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.599
 in our case, not 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.540
 we will not add exclusions so 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.400
 we know directly the following 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.200
 and here we must specify the duration 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.109
 of the granting of addresses to 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.969
 client teams we will leave our case 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.949
 which it is a default option 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.900
 eight-day assistants we are in 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.810
 following 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.960
 our window we will select the 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.419
 option sets these options now 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.080
 we press the next one and here then 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.030
 we must indicate the address 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.819
 the router the door of the cee 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.099
 default a paramount parameter 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.379
 that should be served through this cp to the 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.169
 client teams and in this case 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.039
 we will indicate in the address of the router 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.379
 of the network 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:51.060
 in my case 192 168 11 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.150
 click on add 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.250
 and then the next 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.810
 comes now let's configure Mr. dns 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.800
 which will be associated with our customers 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.540
 we will specify as domain name 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.870
 of the primary domain that manages 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.500
 our server team in this case or 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.650
 computer level point is already 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.970
 then we write the name of 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.580
 our servers that is the box 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.220
 server name or free server 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.410
 the name of my team and we will click on 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.550
 solve and we will appear here in 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.120
 address expected from the next of 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:30.330
 our server we know how to add 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.220
 and the next without center allows us 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.590
 define the ip address of our 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.169
 server wins true that in our case 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.639
 we are not going to use any we will press 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.009
 directly the next 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.800
 and finally he asks us if we want 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:45.569
 activate this scope now of course 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.400
 we'll give it to that if we want to activate 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.840
 this area will now click on 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.300
 next and finally finally 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.780
 we will press finish to conclude this 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.660
 assistant 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.040
 so that the service remains hcp 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.530
 finally operative should be 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.120
 used by the active directory for 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.430
 serve s &amp; p address to customers of the 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.010
 domain 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.570
 and then we will have to press again 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.420
 on our server with the button 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:12.240
 right mouse and click on 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.510
 authorize well done this if we press 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.670
 now f5 to refresh the window we see 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.500
 like the arrow that is the red arrow 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.570
 that was pointing down now 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.930
 it is green and points upwards with 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:27.540
 this we will have our our 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:31.370
 dhcp server serving ip addresses 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.720
 in the field that we have set up good 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.610
 we will mention that it is an interesting 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.640
 option that we can configure in the 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.620
 dhcp server although we at the moment 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.600
 We will not use in the reservation of 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.550
 directions that allows us to the 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.260
 dhcp server always grant the same 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.350
 ip address to the clients we want 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:52.830
 to configure this this option we must 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:56.640
 place over reserve and click with the 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:59.550
 right button and on new reservation here 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.530
 we must indicate a reservation name 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.139
 the name is usually used 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.270
 of the team 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:08.930
 the ip address we want to say nothing 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.580
 to that team and the mac address of the 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.259
 computer network card so that 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.969
 this ip address will never be served to 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:15.349
 another team that is not the one with the 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:18.199
 network card that mac directions 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:20.779
 that we have indicated here we have of 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:24.020
 moment we are not going to make any 

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:25.759
 reserve close this window 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.919
 indicate also that when our 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.509
 dhcp server begins to serve 

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:31.910
 ip addresses to our customers 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:34.280
 network in the concessions folder of 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.409
 addresses for each ip address 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.840
 granted will be shown an entry with 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:40.909
 the address given to the team that has 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.639
 been served the expiration date of the 

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:45.379
 of the good concession with this 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:47.389
 we conclude today's video spoke to them 

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:49.569
 raúl de sol and computer sails up 

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:49.569
 then
