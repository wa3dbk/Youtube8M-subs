00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:07.829 

okay<00:00:05.979> another<00:00:06.220> common<00:00:06.640> function<00:00:07.149> of<00:00:07.450> the<00:00:07.629> left

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:07.839 
okay another common function of the left

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:09.990 
okay another common function of the left
hand<00:00:08.080> when<00:00:08.260> playing<00:00:08.559> the<00:00:08.799> guitar<00:00:09.129> is<00:00:09.400> muting

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
hand when playing the guitar is muting

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.430 
hand when playing the guitar is muting
and<00:00:10.349> muting<00:00:11.349> is<00:00:11.620> simply<00:00:12.780> resting<00:00:13.780> your<00:00:13.960> finger

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
and muting is simply resting your finger

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.839 
and muting is simply resting your finger
on<00:00:15.180> the<00:00:16.180> strings<00:00:16.950> and<00:00:17.950> not<00:00:18.189> pushing<00:00:18.640> down<00:00:18.820> so

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849 
on the strings and not pushing down so

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.620 
on the strings and not pushing down so
you<00:00:19.210> end<00:00:19.599> up<00:00:19.689> getting<00:00:19.750> up<00:00:21.000> basically<00:00:22.000> a<00:00:22.119> rhythm

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
you end up getting up basically a rhythm

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.580 
you end up getting up basically a rhythm
type<00:00:23.050> sound

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
type sound

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.620 
type sound
now<00:00:25.050> muting<00:00:26.050> is<00:00:26.770> something<00:00:27.189> that<00:00:27.399> comes<00:00:28.360> into

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
now muting is something that comes into

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.880 
now muting is something that comes into
play<00:00:28.840> when<00:00:29.079> you're<00:00:29.200> playing<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.469> lot<00:00:29.619> of<00:00:29.649> rhythm

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
play when you're playing a lot of rhythm

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.880 
play when you're playing a lot of rhythm
guitar<00:00:30.450> it<00:00:31.450> allows<00:00:32.200> you<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:32.410> create<00:00:32.649> some

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
guitar it allows you to create some

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.220 
guitar it allows you to create some
interesting<00:00:33.219> rhythms<00:00:33.879> and<00:00:34.120> so<00:00:34.809> I<00:00:34.840> think<00:00:35.020> the

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
interesting rhythms and so I think the

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.350 
interesting rhythms and so I think the
best<00:00:35.379> way<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:35.590> illustrate<00:00:35.800> muting<00:00:36.490> is<00:00:36.730> to<00:00:37.000> show

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
best way to illustrate muting is to show

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.940 
best way to illustrate muting is to show
you<00:00:37.420> how<00:00:37.690> it<00:00:37.840> works<00:00:38.020> so<00:00:38.260> I'll<00:00:38.380> play<00:00:38.560> a<00:00:38.590> simple

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
you how it works so I'll play a simple

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.780 
you how it works so I'll play a simple
rhythm<00:00:39.280> I'm<00:00:39.970> gonna<00:00:40.090> play<00:00:40.270> one<00:00:40.480> chord<00:00:40.840> here

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
rhythm I'm gonna play one chord here

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.910 
rhythm I'm gonna play one chord here
that's<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:42.940> cord<00:00:43.240> and<00:00:43.630> with<00:00:44.470> my<00:00:44.620> right<00:00:44.890> hand

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
that's the cord and with my right hand

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.770 
that's the cord and with my right hand
I'm<00:00:45.280> going<00:00:45.430> to<00:00:45.490> use<00:00:45.610> one<00:00:45.910> strum<00:00:46.270> pattern<00:00:46.630> which

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
I'm going to use one strum pattern which

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.400 
I'm going to use one strum pattern which
is<00:00:46.810> just<00:00:47.140> down<00:00:47.230> up<00:00:47.650> down<00:00:47.800> up<00:00:47.860> so<00:00:48.190> it's<00:00:48.310> gonna<00:00:48.400> be

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.130 

and<00:00:53.880> I'm<00:00:54.880> gonna<00:00:55.090> play<00:00:55.630> it<00:00:55.720> first<00:00:55.960> without

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
and I'm gonna play it first without

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.690 
and I'm gonna play it first without
using<00:00:56.590> any<00:00:56.739> muting<00:00:57.130> so<00:00:57.280> you<00:00:57.340> can<00:00:57.460> see<00:00:57.579> what

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
using any muting so you can see what

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.500 
using any muting so you can see what
that<00:00:57.730> would<00:00:57.970> sound<00:00:58.090> like

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
that would sound like

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.110 
that would sound like
so<00:00:58.810> here's<00:00:59.170> playing<00:00:59.530> that<00:00:59.680> same<00:00:59.890> chord<00:01:00.220> using

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
so here's playing that same chord using

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.080 
so here's playing that same chord using
the<00:01:01.210> down-up<00:01:01.600> strum<00:01:02.110> pattern<00:01:05.399> okay<00:01:06.399> not<00:01:07.060> that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
the down-up strum pattern okay not that

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.059 
the down-up strum pattern okay not that
interesting<00:01:07.810> but<00:01:08.079> might<00:01:08.469> be<00:01:08.590> useful<00:01:08.770> in

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:09.069 
interesting but might be useful in

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.609 
interesting but might be useful in
certain<00:01:09.429> songs<00:01:09.789> certain<00:01:10.389> situations<00:01:10.929> but

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
certain songs certain situations but

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.559 
certain songs certain situations but
let's<00:01:11.889> try<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.159> same<00:01:12.549> I'll<00:01:12.850> keep<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.270> exact

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:13.569 
let's try the same I'll keep the exact

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.120 
let's try the same I'll keep the exact
same<00:01:13.810> strum<00:01:14.200> pattern<00:01:14.560> with<00:01:14.740> my<00:01:14.889> right<00:01:15.100> hand

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
same strum pattern with my right hand

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.270 
same strum pattern with my right hand
but<00:01:16.090> I'm<00:01:16.210> going<00:01:16.539> to<00:01:16.600> mute<00:01:17.289> with<00:01:17.649> my<00:01:17.799> left<00:01:18.039> hand

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
but I'm going to mute with my left hand

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.760 
but I'm going to mute with my left hand
so<00:01:18.460> I'm<00:01:18.579> going<00:01:18.759> to<00:01:18.819> play<00:01:19.299> that<00:01:19.479> chord<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.319> I'm

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
so I'm going to play that chord and I'm

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.760 
so I'm going to play that chord and I'm
going<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:20.979> release<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.490> chord<00:01:22.619> keeping<00:01:23.619> my

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
going to release the chord keeping my

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.919 
going to release the chord keeping my
fingers<00:01:24.130> in<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.369> exact<00:01:24.639> same<00:01:24.880> position<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.869> I

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
fingers in the exact same position so I

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.749 
fingers in the exact same position so I
push<00:01:26.229> down<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:27.310> create<00:01:27.579> the<00:01:27.729> chord<00:01:27.999> I<00:01:28.329> let<00:01:28.959> go

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
push down to create the chord I let go

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.760 
push down to create the chord I let go
again<00:01:30.759> my<00:01:31.090> fingers<00:01:31.450> don't<00:01:31.600> move<00:01:31.840> but<00:01:32.289> they

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
again my fingers don't move but they

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.260 
again my fingers don't move but they
just<00:01:32.979> kind<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.159> rest<00:01:33.399> on<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.639> strings<00:01:33.969> which

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
just kind of rest on the strings which

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.440 
just kind of rest on the strings which
mutes<00:01:34.630> them<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:35.950> let's<00:01:36.729> try<00:01:37.060> all<00:01:37.270> that

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
mutes them and so let's try all that

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.199 
mutes them and so let's try all that
together<00:01:37.840> now<00:01:38.049> I'm<00:01:38.170> going<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.439> strum<00:01:39.399> with<00:01:40.090> my

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
together now I'm going to strum with my

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.529 
together now I'm going to strum with my
right<00:01:40.420> hand<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:41.009> play<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.759> chords<00:01:43.329> in<00:01:43.420> my

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
right hand and play the chords in my

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.269 
right hand and play the chords in my
left<00:01:43.569> hand<00:01:43.899> and<00:01:44.079> mute<00:01:44.380> as<00:01:44.590> well<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.009> here's

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:45.279 
left hand and mute as well so here's

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:48.959 
left hand and mute as well so here's
somehow<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.579> same<00:01:47.279> rhythm<00:01:48.279> pattern<00:01:48.849> would

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
somehow that same rhythm pattern would

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:56.039 
somehow that same rhythm pattern would
sound<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:55.149> can<00:01:55.270> see<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.509> gets<00:01:55.659> much<00:01:55.869> more

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
sound you can see it gets much more

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.959 
sound you can see it gets much more
interesting<00:01:56.109> that<00:01:56.649> way<00:01:56.709> so<00:01:57.369> what<00:01:57.520> I'm<00:01:57.609> doing

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
interesting that way so what I'm doing

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:05.359 
interesting that way so what I'm doing
there<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:58.179> I'm<00:01:58.450> pushing<00:01:58.869> down<00:01:58.899> pushing

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.199 

pushing<00:02:06.369> pushing<00:02:07.119> down<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.590> when<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:08.740> let<00:02:09.009> go

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
pushing pushing down and when I let go

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.970 
pushing pushing down and when I let go
again<00:02:10.209> my<00:02:10.360> fingers<00:02:10.720> are<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.770> same

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
again my fingers are in the same

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.440 
again my fingers are in the same
positions<00:02:12.430> all<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:12.939> to<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.269> go<00:02:13.420> back

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
positions all I have to do is go back

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.059 
positions all I have to do is go back
down<00:02:13.810> but<00:02:14.319> they're<00:02:14.439> not<00:02:14.560> they're<00:02:15.040> just

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
down but they're not they're just

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.300 
down but they're not they're just
resting<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:15.909> top<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.239> strings

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
resting on top of the strings

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.309

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
can change the combination of when I

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.210 
can change the combination of when I
push<00:02:28.659> with<00:02:28.900> my<00:02:29.049> left<00:02:29.260> hand<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.560> get<00:02:29.739> different

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
push with my left hand and get different

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.380 
push with my left hand and get different
rhythms<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:30.879> I'm<00:02:31.510> not<00:02:31.750> limited<00:02:32.099> I<00:02:33.239> can<00:02:34.239> also

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
rhythms so I'm not limited I can also

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.550 
rhythms so I'm not limited I can also
get<00:02:34.629> something<00:02:34.989> like<00:02:35.110> this<00:02:39.959> again<00:02:40.959> watch<00:02:41.349> the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
get something like this again watch the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:54.420 
get something like this again watch the
right<00:02:41.739> hand<00:02:42.010> nothing<00:02:42.459> changed<00:02:43.000> there<00:02:53.430> anyway

that's<00:02:54.849> how<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.030> get<00:02:55.180> interesting<00:02:55.690> rhythms

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
that's how you get interesting rhythms

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.530 
that's how you get interesting rhythms
is<00:02:56.379> by<00:02:56.950> using<00:02:57.910> muting<00:02:58.780> with<00:02:59.049> the<00:02:59.170> left<00:02:59.349> hand
