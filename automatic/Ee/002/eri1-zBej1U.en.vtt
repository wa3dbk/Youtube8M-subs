00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
works and here let me see go ahead here

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.330 
works and here let me see go ahead here
so<00:02:17.390> since<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:18.049> is<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.290> new<00:02:18.440> case<00:02:18.920> though<00:02:19.250> it's

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
so since this is a new case though it's

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.990 
so since this is a new case though it's
going<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:19.580> be<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:20.090> little<00:02:20.540> bit<00:02:20.780> hard<00:02:21.880> look<00:02:22.880> at

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
going to be a little bit hard look at

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.140 
going to be a little bit hard look at
that<00:02:23.290> perfectly<00:02:24.290> has<00:02:24.739> three<00:02:25.130> angles<00:02:25.489> has<00:02:25.940> this

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
that perfectly has three angles has this

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.660 
that perfectly has three angles has this
angle<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:27.680> also<00:02:27.980> has<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.850> angle<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:30.430> all<00:02:31.430> the
