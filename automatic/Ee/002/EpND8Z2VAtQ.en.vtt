down to your pitch section here click a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.379 
down to your pitch section here click a
second<00:01:27.289> and<00:01:27.499> it's<00:01:27.799> up<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.249> major<00:01:28.670> second<00:01:29.179> so<00:01:29.270> now

second and it's up a major second so now
it's<00:01:29.509> in<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.689> key<00:01:29.869> of<00:01:29.990> G<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:30.439> we'll<00:01:30.950> hear<00:01:31.130> how

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
it's in the key of G and we'll hear how

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:45.000 
it's in the key of G and we'll hear how
that<00:01:31.340> sounds

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.530 

so<00:01:46.010> you<00:01:46.100> can<00:01:46.220> see<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.700> hear<00:01:46.940> how<00:01:47.090> easy<00:01:47.330> that

original key so you have three ways to
adjust<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.090> pitch<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.510> first<00:02:02.780> is<00:02:02.960> by<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.170> set

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
adjust the pitch the first is by the set

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.480 
adjust the pitch the first is by the set
intervals<00:02:04.040> here<00:02:04.400> second<00:02:05.000> third<00:02:05.360> fourth<00:02:05.960> fifth

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
intervals here second third fourth fifth

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.060 
intervals here second third fourth fifth
octave<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.730> can<00:02:08.540> go<00:02:08.630> up<00:02:08.810> by<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.290> half<00:02:09.530> step<00:02:09.560> or

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
octave you can go up by a half step or

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.460 
octave you can go up by a half step or
down<00:02:10.820> by<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.060> half<00:02:11.330> step<00:02:11.360> with<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.690> large<00:02:11.990> plus<00:02:12.290> or

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
down by a half step with a large plus or

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.890 
down by a half step with a large plus or
minus<00:02:12.740> buttons<00:02:13.070> or<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.880> can<00:02:13.970> go<00:02:14.150> up<00:02:14.330> by<00:02:14.510> micro

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
minus buttons or you can go up by micro

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.020 
minus buttons or you can go up by micro
tones<00:02:15.170> or<00:02:15.680> down<00:02:16.190> by<00:02:16.340> micro<00:02:16.640> tones<00:02:16.820> with<00:02:17.000> the

small<00:02:17.450> plus<00:02:17.780> or<00:02:17.960> minus<00:02:18.200> button<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.890> that's<00:02:19.130> it

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
small plus or minus button and that's it

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.620 
small plus or minus button and that's it
it's<00:02:19.430> really<00:02:19.550> that<00:02:19.730> simple<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:20.120> move<00:02:20.390> and

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
it's really that simple to move and

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.410 
it's really that simple to move and
transpose<00:02:21.230> any<00:02:21.530> tune<00:02:21.890> or<00:02:22.160> backing<00:02:22.910> track<00:02:23.180> or

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
transpose any tune or backing track or

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.490 
transpose any tune or backing track or
lick<00:02:23.630> or<00:02:23.780> whatever<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.410> you're

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
lick or whatever it is that you're

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.920 
lick or whatever it is that you're
practicing<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.940> can<00:02:26.000> also<00:02:26.180> adjust<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.600> tempo

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
practicing you can also adjust the tempo

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.380 
practicing you can also adjust the tempo
in<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.230> exact<00:02:27.530> same<00:02:27.740> way<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.790> here<00:02:29.120> we<00:02:29.240> have

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
in the exact same way so here we have

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.260 
in the exact same way so here we have
presets<00:02:30.250> rather<00:02:31.250> than<00:02:31.400> intervals<00:02:32.030> we<00:02:32.150> have

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
presets rather than intervals we have

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.610 
presets rather than intervals we have
preset<00:02:32.600> percentages<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:33.950> have<00:02:34.130> 20<00:02:34.490> 30<00:02:34.850> 50

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
preset percentages so you have 20 30 50

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.760 
preset percentages so you have 20 30 50
75<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.040> 90<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:37.730> if<00:02:37.820> I<00:02:37.850> click<00:02:38.060> 75<00:02:38.630> it's<00:02:39.620> now

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
75 and 90 so if I click 75 it's now

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.640 
75 and 90 so if I click 75 it's now
gonna<00:02:39.980> play<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.340> backing<00:02:40.670> track<00:02:41.020> at<00:02:42.020> 75%

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
gonna play the backing track at 75%

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.680 
gonna play the backing track at 75%
three-quarters<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.820> original<00:02:44.180> tempo<00:02:44.480> but

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
three-quarters of the original tempo but

00:02:44.690 --> 00:03:03.660 
three-quarters of the original tempo but
keep<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.080> key<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.620> here's<00:02:45.920> how<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.130> sounds

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.070 

so<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.730> can<00:03:04.850> hear<00:03:05.000> how<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.240> original<00:03:05.690> key<00:03:05.900> was

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
so you can hear how the original key was

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.660 
so you can hear how the original key was
still<00:03:06.230> there<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.470> was<00:03:06.590> still<00:03:06.740> in<00:03:06.830> FN<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:07.430> now<00:03:07.550> it

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
still there I was still in FN but now it

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.880 
still there I was still in FN but now it
was<00:03:07.760> at<00:03:07.880> 3/4<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.660> tempo<00:03:08.990> so<00:03:09.650> when<00:03:09.770> you're

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
was at 3/4 of the tempo so when you're

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.500 
was at 3/4 of the tempo so when you're
working<00:03:10.040> on<00:03:10.430> playing<00:03:11.000> with<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.150> backing<00:03:11.480> track

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
working on playing with a backing track

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.390 
working on playing with a backing track
or<00:03:11.960> working<00:03:12.230> out<00:03:12.320> licks<00:03:12.650> or<00:03:12.800> learning<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.130> song

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
or working out licks or learning a song

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.220 
or working out licks or learning a song
you<00:03:13.850> can<00:03:14.000> adjust<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.420> tempo<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.780> fit<00:03:15.050> your

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
you can adjust the tempo to fit your

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.680 
you can adjust the tempo to fit your
your<00:03:15.560> current<00:03:15.830> practice<00:03:16.190> routine<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:17.420> again

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
your current practice routine so again

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.360 
your current practice routine so again
to<00:03:17.870> go<00:03:17.960> back<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.320> original<00:03:18.380> tempo<00:03:18.950> I<00:03:18.980> click

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
to go back to the original tempo I click

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.910 
to go back to the original tempo I click
the<00:03:19.910> reset<00:03:20.270> button<00:03:20.330> there<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.650> can<00:03:21.770> go<00:03:21.890> up
