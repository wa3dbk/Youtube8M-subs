00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
of cars and no it's not customizable I'm

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.219 
of cars and no it's not customizable I'm
not<00:01:59.159> sure<00:01:59.460> how<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.729> store<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.630> might<00:02:00.990> be

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
not sure how you store this it might be

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.109 
not sure how you store this it might be
I<00:02:01.710> think<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.399> store<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.909> your

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
I think you have to store it in your

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.969 
I think you have to store it in your
hangar<00:02:03.509> because<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.899> probably<00:02:04.380> won't<00:02:04.649> fit

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
hangar because this probably won't fit

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:05.630 
hangar because this probably won't fit
in<00:02:05.130> your<00:02:05.189> garage

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
but yeah so those are the probably

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.050 
but yeah so those are the probably
