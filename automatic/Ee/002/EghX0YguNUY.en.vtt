to<00:01:43.380> shoot<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> robots<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.220> get<00:01:44.340> out<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:44.670> it's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
to shoot the robots and get out but it's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.120 
to shoot the robots and get out but it's
it's<00:01:45.090> narrow<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.689> pac-man<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
it's narrow like pac-man so the so the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.530 
it's narrow like pac-man so the so the
goal<00:01:47.369> was<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.520> hundred<00:01:47.820> thousand<00:01:48.180> dollars<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
goal was a hundred thousand dollars and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.569 
goal was a hundred thousand dollars and
they're<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> s<00:01:49.860> do<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.369> project

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
they're not going to s do this project

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
they're not going to s do this project
once<00:01:50.909> gets<00:01:51.090> funded<00:01:51.450> which<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> shame<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
once gets funded which is a shame for a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.310 
once gets funded which is a shame for a
couple<00:01:52.710> reasons<00:01:52.740> because<00:01:53.130> obviously<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.689> 140

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
couple reasons because obviously is 140

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.870 
couple reasons because obviously is 140
backers<00:01:55.680> only<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.189> that's<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.610> lot<00:01:56.790> of

backers only and that's not a lot of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700 
backers only and that's not a lot of
support<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:58.290> obviously<00:01:58.560> there's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
support for this but obviously there's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.530 
support for this but obviously there's
in<00:01:58.770> television<00:01:59.189> fans<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.090> what's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
in television fans but it's what's

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.810 
in television fans but it's what's

but<00:02:37.710> I'm<00:02:37.770> just<00:02:38.400> trying<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.270> wrap<00:02:39.510> my<00:02:39.540> head

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
but I'm just trying to wrap my head

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.740 
but I'm just trying to wrap my head
around<00:02:39.840> one<00:02:40.470> hundred<00:02:40.500> thousand<00:02:41.220> dollars<00:02:41.750> yes

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
around one hundred thousand dollars yes

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.450 
around one hundred thousand dollars yes
that's<00:02:43.050> what<00:02:43.290> I'm<00:02:43.380> trying<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:44.190> sort<00:02:44.340> of

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
that's what I'm trying to it's sort of

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.250 
that's what I'm trying to it's sort of
strange<00:02:44.790> because<00:02:45.210> again<00:02:45.600> it's<00:02:45.750> not<00:02:45.870> like<00:02:46.110> if

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
strange because again it's not like if

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.510 
strange because again it's not like if
these<00:02:46.380> were<00:02:46.530> if<00:02:46.740> these<00:02:46.860> weren't<00:02:47.040> developed<00:02:47.310> at

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
these were if these weren't developed at

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.980 
these were if these weren't developed at
all<00:02:47.640> from<00:02:47.790> scratch<00:02:47.940> okay<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.510> can<00:02:48.660> see<00:02:48.840> them

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
all from scratch okay you can see them

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.780 
all from scratch okay you can see them
needing<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.410> money<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.770> put<00:02:49.890> into<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.370> I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
needing the money to put into that and I

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.370 
needing the money to put into that and I
would<00:02:50.970> assume<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.330> they're<00:02:51.660> too<00:02:51.810> got<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
would assume that they're too got the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.380 
would assume that they're too got the
rights<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.710> do<00:02:52.920> these<00:02:53.100> otherwise<00:02:53.640> why<00:02:53.850> go

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
rights to do these otherwise why go

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.480 
rights to do these otherwise why go
through<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.660> development<00:02:55.070> cycles<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.220> get<00:02:56.370> to

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
through the development cycles to get to

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.800 
through the development cycles to get to
that<00:02:56.580> point<00:02:56.790> right<00:02:57.180> for<00:02:57.420> these<00:02:57.510> new<00:02:57.660> versions

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
that point right for these new versions

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.460 
that point right for these new versions
um<00:02:59.330> so<00:03:00.330> yeah<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.480> mean<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:00.870> not<00:03:01.020> much<00:03:01.140> more<00:03:01.170> I

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
um so yeah I mean it's not much more I

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.350 
um so yeah I mean it's not much more I
can<00:03:01.530> really<00:03:01.770> say<00:03:02.010> about<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.460> is<00:03:02.730> probably<00:03:03.210> will

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
can really say about it is probably will

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.010 
can really say about it is probably will
not<00:03:03.480> get<00:03:03.660> funded<00:03:04.140> um<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.430> for<00:03:05.640> those<00:03:05.730> few<00:03:06.600> dozen

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
not get funded um so for those few dozen

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.540 
not get funded um so for those few dozen
fans<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.650> television<00:03:08.040> games<00:03:08.190> out<00:03:08.370> there<00:03:08.400> to
