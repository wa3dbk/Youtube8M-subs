00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.560

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.160
 a lot happened in my life, right? 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.360

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.400
 own in my financial part has changed 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.890
 much too was much was too much 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.230
 companies that are 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.880
 coming here for three lagoons generating 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.940
 a lot of work for people from here to people 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.930
 I thought you were going to work outside 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.640
 I and an employee and a telephone 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.949
 I had no service going to work. 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.800
 also on the phone did not ring and today 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.289
 people at the companies, right? 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.500
 the two companies operating in the area 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:59.109
 pulp production in the region and third 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:06.120
 Also, we already have grace April and 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:09.260
 not only but not as a speculative boom 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:14.760
 but rumors because I've never experienced it 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:18.690
 I'm happening but until the medicare 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.210
 year and heard only and I believe I think 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:27.840
 from I came to have dignity of 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.250
 life is to be able to eat in this chaos to offer 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.890
 something essential for someone else 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.540
 need if the party will 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.080
 international paper and support and now 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.080
 golden 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.840
 the forest fair of three lagoons she has 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.019
 a great mission and is to present the sector 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.870
 for the lagoon community 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.739
 with the community and around the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.110
 three ponds 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.120
 the really thriving fair to be a 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.640
 first forest event of this size 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.239
 here in the state and here in the region 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.330
 in fact the fair surprises everyone by 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.220
 quality by quantity is by the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.060
 entrepreneurs who are here exposing their 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.560
 products 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.870
 I think this fair represents the 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.620
 maturity of the sector in the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.870
 region 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.269
 when you do business when you 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.340
 you generate a critical mass asserts 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.920
 other companies first arrived here 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.470
 are coming and moving a whole 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.380
 sequence a value chain that the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.910
 people call where several companies end up 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.940
 complementing the business of companies 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.040
 anchors then this event here in three 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.859
 ponds is the landmark is a sign of 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.430
 maturity and strength of this sector here 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.440
 in the region 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.109
 I think it's going to make a difference. 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.000
 in the history of mato grosso do sul 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.940
 What is happening these days? 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.620
 the whole enterprise of this nature 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.920
 how the fair does it have this purpose 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.069
 make people entrepreneurs 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.049
 talk and produce business and 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.209
 mainly results for the sector 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.019
 I was quite impressed is very 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.630
 well assembled is thus level with the 1st 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.569
 the level of professionalism 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.060
 very good that impresses us more 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.639
 once it reinforces that the city and the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.710
 is ready for new 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:42.040
 levels of economic development 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:45.750
 is the consolidation of the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.750
 forests here in our state 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.810
 this week residents of three lagoons and 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.580
 visitors of the city could meet a 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.860
 little about production that helps 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.840
 the economy of the municipality in a 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.730
 full of curiosities and see the 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.010
 the noise of such a big machine 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.900
 doing all this power with this 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.400
 capacity and does not draw the attention of 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.260
 world is everybody wants to see is a lot 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.540
 Beautiful is really very beautiful, your 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.940
 francisco also could not resist 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.400
 in the demonstration of the chainsaws he does not 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.229
 had doubts he took to cut a 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.690
 piece of eucalyptus with the equipment 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.340
 who was exhibited at the fair due to 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.949
 eucalyptus planting 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.500
 we have to adapt every day 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:27.479
 but is crossed to see to learn that 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.490
 In the future I intend to work in this 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:34.620
 This branch is not up to 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.000
 no productive activity we are 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.289
 against activities that are not 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.620
 sustainable 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:43.650
 so planted forest is a good deal 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.449
 the rural sector and we like it 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.780
 that farmers and producers 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:52.080
 consider whether the 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.129
 their way to landscape activities 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.129
 always telling the truth 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.930
 one of the great attractions of the fair east 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.430
 space with multiple computers and simulate 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.220
 the forest harvest 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.180
 The simulator teaches all the steps of the 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.860
 process 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.680
 there you have learned how to peel the 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.260
 Eucalyptus is already thinking about working in the 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.870
 opportunities can grow and the will 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.180
 It's also very interesting. 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.100
 we want the region of three ponds 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.200
 really change her social reality 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.200
 through the forests planted right
