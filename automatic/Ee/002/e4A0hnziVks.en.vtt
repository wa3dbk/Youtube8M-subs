00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.639
 This is a lesson on the program therefore for sites from 

00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:21.109
 these meetings circle 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.800
 Today I will tell you how to use st. 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.080
 filter panels look for photos you 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.759
 announce kilometer 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.429
 for starters we have to 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:31.699
 understand that 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.469
 any train that happens he 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.020
 going to a given folder 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.310
 for this, I chose to buy from me 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.360
 is most of mine 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.450
 photos 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.090
 and so i will search 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.060
 First of all we have the text 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.360
 this is any text here you can choose 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.280
 either it will be any text that can 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.800
 be fans file 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.670
 either this is the file name of Kiev birth signatures and 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.620
 then liza this about 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.660
 signed 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.550
 then we remove whether this text 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.830
 so many begin with this word which 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.800
 we lead 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.100
 let's say i rub trouble the words machine 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.210
 he also I have a little keyword 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.780
 cars 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.700
 how could I not let yes the program finds it 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.710
 Mudflowers choose 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.510
 keywords that contain there 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.420
 this search parameter 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.409
 Well, as a rule, it is easier to choose 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.690
 contains it all 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.560
 this way more specific 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.810
 Polish 1 Prague 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.900
 a machine 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.620
 Excellent, I found often the schedule 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.040
 farther 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.130
 we have the attributes panel these are the ones 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.860
 attributes that assign 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.800
 photos 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.990
 flags marked 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.270
 flag photographs not marked or 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.760
 marked for deletion 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.280
 and ratings from one to five 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 where 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.510
 percent as you can see we have to know what 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.650
 no longer brown 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.400
 Borodin can be more or equal 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.520
 given is less than or equal to 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.550
 or 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.729
 clear equal to given 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.150
 rating value 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.319
 if we have 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.740
 panels 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.740
 attribute panels we have a choice of color and 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.340
 respectively, Taurus and color 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.819
 tags 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.089
 in any color 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:13.839
 can also be combined if you 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.859
 want to find pictures of which 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:16.930
 percent 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.790
 on board until the retainer is marked 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.290
 different colors you want in one place 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.009
 see here so it turns out 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.929
 can be combined than not only flowers 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.929
 can be combined with each other 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.049
 attributes for example red color 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.089
 and parents 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:33.569
 more than three you can do the same 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.439
 with flags 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.029
 meta data 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:38.569
 the method is simple enough 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.489
 there are some options for example 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.459
 date 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.340
 and visual form the table here is just 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.029
 shown our 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:48.149
 the photo 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.729
 you can choose half a date 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:51.970
 sensitivity 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.259
 used lenses or some 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.459
 she label we assigned to these 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.559
 photos 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.399
 most convenient most universal 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:01.849
 data searches 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.349
 so that you can replace the parameters 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.249
 search ie instead of sensitivity 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.089
 for example can be attributed 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:09.949
 I 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.859
 at least for the country too 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.049
 in this 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.120
 searches yes a box of photography takes 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.479
 I now have to choose the whole diaphragm here 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.949
 2008 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.739
 accordingly, the choice is greater 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.609
 he is all dates 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.409
 accordingly for all the debts i can 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.769
 pen diaphragm is the same with lenses 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.379
 same water layer 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.400
 among other things you can do more 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.399
 specific search queries 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.239
 First you can do it by choosing 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.139
 specific folder 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.039
 and using search only in this folder 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.299
 protons 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.290
 it is very rare when you really need 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.470
 much more convenient to use 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.199
 combination for example 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.199
 I want to find him all the photos from Prague 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.819
 which 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.699
 red 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.519
 or for example how who have a rating 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.769
 more than three 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.279
 when are you going big 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:06.669
 the number of such combination 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.499
 if you have them less often 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:11.249
 use that permanent neman 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:13.789
 choose a filter 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.079
 and here we have a filter new Malkin 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.439
 not good because they are not needed in general, but 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:19.859
 for such group 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.779
 Prague type queries rated 4 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.529
 we can save our 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.840
 and our settings as a press 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.010
 and name it accordingly and how 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.509
 you will understand it 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.309
 now the percentage 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:36.379
 canceling it then i can just here 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.229
 choose in pharmacies 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.729
 prague when plus get them a sample 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.099
 which do not need 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.020
 but I admire with NATO I can either 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.879
 rename or delete them easily 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:47.599
 highly 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.509
 to manage 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.240
 Studio
