about<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> important<00:01:11.970> points<00:01:12.270> is

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
about this the important points is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.880 
about this the important points is
whether<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.900> gram<00:01:13.110> positive<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> gram

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
whether it's a gram positive a gram

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.700 
whether it's a gram positive a gram
negative<00:01:14.250> tell<00:01:14.369> me<00:01:14.490> guys<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.060> gram

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
negative tell me guys it's a gram

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.390 
negative tell me guys it's a gram
positive<00:01:17.360> rod<00:01:18.360> or<00:01:18.600> abasa<00:01:19.229> line<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.790> rod

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
positive rod or abasa line it's a rod

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.190 
positive rod or abasa line it's a rod
okay

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
okay

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.410 
okay

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
whether it's pong sports or not yes it's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.270 
whether it's pong sports or not yes it's
a<00:01:27.570> spore<00:01:27.900> forming<00:01:28.290> bacteria<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.829> forms<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
a spore forming bacteria it forms a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.539 
a spore forming bacteria it forms a
suppose<00:01:29.810> right<00:01:30.810> whether<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.860> an<00:01:32.100> analogue

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
suppose right whether it's an analogue

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.109 
suppose right whether it's an analogue
or<00:01:32.729> arrow

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
or arrow

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.620 
or arrow
it's<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.890> anaerobe<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:36.090> important

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it's a anaerobe that's really important

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.120 
it's a anaerobe that's really important
so<00:01:38.329> why<00:01:39.329> look<00:01:40.290> at<00:01:40.380> these<00:01:40.650> three<00:01:40.920> features

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so why look at these three features

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.160 
so why look at these three features
these<00:01:41.460> three<00:01:42.060> features<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.049> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
these three features you see in a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.520 
these three features you see in a
bacillus<00:01:43.790> cereus<00:01:44.790> okay<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.780> bacillus

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
bacillus cereus okay or bacillus

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.270 
bacillus cereus okay or bacillus
bacteria<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.110> Arabs<00:01:49.530> ok

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
bacteria so this but they are Arabs ok

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.819 
bacteria so this but they are Arabs ok
they<00:01:50.549> are<00:01:50.579> Arabs<00:01:53.540> but<00:01:54.680> tetany

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
they are Arabs but tetany

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.969 
they are Arabs but tetany
is<00:01:55.950> anaerobe<00:01:56.659> okay

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.190 

so<00:02:01.729> got<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.509> producer<00:02:02.810> important

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
so got it and the producer important

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.059 
so got it and the producer important
toxin<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:03.619> is<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.770> tetanus<00:02:04.100> toxin<00:02:09.069> right

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
toxin that is a tetanus toxin right

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.710 
toxin that is a tetanus toxin right
these<00:02:10.700> are<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:10.940> important<00:02:11.300> their<00:02:11.420> ground

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
these are the important their ground

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.870 
these are the important their ground
positive<00:02:12.140> rods<00:02:12.319> spore-forming<00:02:12.890> anaerobes

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
positive rods spore-forming anaerobes

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.550 
positive rods spore-forming anaerobes
and<00:02:14.120> produce<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.569> toxin<00:02:14.750> known<00:02:15.020> as<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.170> tetanus

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
and produce a toxin known as a tetanus

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.040 
and produce a toxin known as a tetanus
toxin<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.160> how<00:02:16.910> does<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.239> act<00:02:17.390> I'm<00:02:17.569> going<00:02:17.989> to

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
toxin and how does it act I'm going to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.530 
toxin and how does it act I'm going to
tell<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.350> shortly<00:02:18.970> okay<00:02:19.970> now<00:02:20.180> what's<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
tell you shortly okay now what's the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:31.030 
tell you shortly okay now what's the
reservoir<00:02:25.630> it's<00:02:26.630> nothing<00:02:27.019> but<00:02:27.110> soil<00:02:27.819> okay<00:02:30.040> and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
reservoir it's nothing but soil okay and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.300 
reservoir it's nothing but soil okay and
how<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.519> is<00:02:31.670> transmitted<00:02:32.390> through<00:02:33.200> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
how it is transmitted through the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.900 
how it is transmitted through the
puncture<00:02:34.310> wound<00:02:34.700> right<00:02:36.670> if<00:02:37.670> it's

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
puncture wound right if it's

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.720 
puncture wound right if it's
contaminated<00:02:38.239> with<00:02:38.660> other<00:02:38.840> metal<00:02:39.140> our<00:02:40.130> human

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
contaminated with other metal our human

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.880 
contaminated with other metal our human
body<00:02:40.940> can<00:02:41.299> say<00:02:41.480> also<00:02:41.690> okay<00:02:43.930> right<00:02:44.930> mm-hmm<00:02:45.769> and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
body can say also okay right mm-hmm and

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.680 
body can say also okay right mm-hmm and
it<00:02:46.190> also<00:02:46.370> requires<00:02:46.810> low<00:02:47.810> tissue<00:02:48.110> oxygenation

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
it also requires low tissue oxygenation

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.250 
it also requires low tissue oxygenation
e:h<00:02:51.519> low<00:02:52.519> tissue<00:02:52.790> oxygenation<00:02:53.090> that's<00:02:53.930> really

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
e:h low tissue oxygenation that's really

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.720 
e:h low tissue oxygenation that's really
very<00:02:54.410> important<00:02:54.769> for<00:02:54.799> USMLE<00:02:55.370> step<00:02:55.430> on

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
very important for USMLE step on

now<00:03:07.910> important<00:03:08.450> thing<00:03:08.630> what's<00:03:09.109> so<00:03:09.230> important

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
now important thing what's so important

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:10.960 
now important thing what's so important
that's<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.070> toxin<00:03:10.400> that's<00:03:10.579> known<00:03:10.760> as<00:03:10.790> the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
that's the toxin that's known as the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.360 
that's the toxin that's known as the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.259 
stock site tetanus toxin let me shut
okay<00:03:16.579> tetanus<00:03:17.230> toxin<00:03:18.310> how<00:03:19.310> does<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.640> act<00:03:19.820> it

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
okay tetanus toxin how does it act it

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.150 
okay tetanus toxin how does it act it

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.290 

you<00:03:59.680> are<00:03:59.770> it<00:03:59.890> when<00:04:00.100> inhibitors<00:04:00.640> are<00:04:00.700> inhibited

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
you are it when inhibitors are inhibited

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.230 
you are it when inhibitors are inhibited
then<00:04:01.750> excited<00:04:02.500> ray<00:04:02.650> will<00:04:03.100> take<00:04:03.910> a<00:04:03.940> leading
