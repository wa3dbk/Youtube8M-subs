and<00:01:33.759> C<00:01:34.030> will<00:01:34.329> proceed<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.079> next<00:01:35.319> step

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
and C will proceed to the next step

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.429 
and C will proceed to the next step
all<00:01:36.369> right<00:01:37.030> previously<00:01:37.600> in<00:01:37.719> step<00:01:37.960> one<00:01:38.229> you

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
all right previously in step one you

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.830 
all right previously in step one you
would<00:01:38.560> have<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.950> install<00:01:39.369> we<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:39.789> C<00:01:40.030> for<00:01:40.270> Syria

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
would have to install we and C for Syria
