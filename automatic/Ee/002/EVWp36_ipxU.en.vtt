want the sports to be about 200 grams or

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.630 
want the sports to be about 200 grams or
so<00:01:25.520> really<00:01:26.520> couldn't<00:01:26.940> out<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:29.490> trouble

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
so really couldn't out there the trouble

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.969 
so really couldn't out there the trouble
is<00:01:30.000> even<00:01:30.299> though<00:01:30.990> I've<00:01:31.110> given<00:01:31.350> him<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> week<00:01:31.679> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
is even though I've given him a week to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.919 
is even though I've given him a week to
hard<00:01:32.460> enough<00:01:33.350> I've<00:01:34.350> managed<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:36.690> dink

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
hard enough I've managed just to dink

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.149 
hard enough I've managed just to dink
the<00:01:37.080> skin<00:01:37.350> look<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.860> they've<00:01:37.979> not

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the skin look at that so they've not

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.559 
the skin look at that so they've not
hardened<00:01:38.610> off<00:01:38.700> at<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.240> that's<00:01:39.360> an

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
hardened off at all so that's an

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.749 
hardened off at all so that's an
absolutely<00:01:40.170> fantastic<00:01:40.409> sport<00:01:42.500> perfect<00:01:43.500> sized

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
absolutely fantastic sport perfect sized

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.859 
absolutely fantastic sport perfect sized
ruined<00:01:44.759> already

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
ruined already

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.010 
ruined already
so<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.280> eating<00:01:47.819> so<00:01:48.630> obviously

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
so that's one for eating so obviously

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.490 
so that's one for eating so obviously
tender<00:01:49.560> isn't<00:01:49.890> isn't<00:01:50.190> enough<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.350> them

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
tender isn't isn't enough to have them

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.620 
tender isn't isn't enough to have them
the<00:01:52.590> skins<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.180> extra

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the skins up so we have to be extra

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.469 
the skins up so we have to be extra
careful<00:01:54.840> now<00:01:55.609> not<00:01:56.609> to<00:01:56.759> damage<00:01:56.939> any<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
careful now not to damage any of the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:06.190 
careful now not to damage any of the
skins<00:02:01.759> now<00:02:02.759> watching<00:02:03.119> some<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.329> these<00:02:04.250> too<00:02:05.250> big

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
skins now watching some of these too big

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.569 
skins now watching some of these too big
so<00:02:07.200> obviously<00:02:07.560> giving<00:02:07.829> them<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.979> bit<00:02:08.130> too<00:02:08.340> long

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579 
so obviously giving them a bit too long

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.219 
so obviously giving them a bit too long
but<00:02:08.880> there<00:02:08.970> should<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.149> some<00:02:09.390> decent<00:02:09.780> ones<00:02:09.959> now

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
but there should be some decent ones now

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.210
