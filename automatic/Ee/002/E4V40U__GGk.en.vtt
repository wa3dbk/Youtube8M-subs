00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:08.069
 welcome to look back because two 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.440
 but never know and if you all 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.690
 have seen a stale at least 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.450
 once you can become a professor here 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.810
 send and deepen them like that anyway 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.970
 a flight we'll see soon 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.320
 become 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.260
 Of course, I had to go there a bit 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.320
 help that all pressure now once 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.600
 So, once you use Cajun 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.149
 so we have airline ticket 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.520
 however it comes to keeping or 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.719
 We can do that with a plane ticket 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.180
 now finally fly by also one 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.890
 time or of course more we can 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.770
 finally after 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.289
 we were able to go ahead after positive though 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:59.399
 none go there to the airport 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.770
 Panama City and then it's snowing 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.199
 already christmas 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.479
 you actually know it my cleaning 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.939
 well go here in the airport rhine 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.090
 and we talked with the nice ones 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:19.010
 stewardess at the switch and she asks us 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.500
 if your part is this protein white board 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.730
 no idea, no german name 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:31.070
 the place will definitely fly 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:33.620
 but mysterious place the same flight 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.990
 animation like the first flight we did 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.720
 there in the ghost villa there 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.390
 have flown and now we are here 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.860
 a completely new place for these dolls white 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.670
 and black did not exist yet and explore 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.350
 we the Simply drop this one sets 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.680
 seek protection a band inventor can 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.610
 only act for hours 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.970
 currently in the period we have to show 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.810
 not streets so nicholls very topics 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:13.280
 get started 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:19.340
 here is looking for protection and now of course 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:22.670
 so you see here all pokÃ©mon moment 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.880
 seen that is not color strong that 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.750
 is also great he does not find her 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.940
 but also clear otherwise we would have 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.790
 that would not work anyway 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.180
 So get in here for a swim 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:44.570
 pleasure in bringing us something here as well 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.250
 always a top drank very well and wanted 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.580
 just 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.050
 make the detectors though I believe 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.370
 that there are no hidden ones here 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.290
 items find what you are here but only one 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.900
 break of the 5 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.140
 What you can do here on everyone 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.930
 not further and look what you can 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.780
 here are definitely finds a 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:14.310
 Product and her colored janas as paria 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:18.400
 and chance the pre-stage of it 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.720
 max then you can also find if 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.500
 to be cool with leon and tommy sieg 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.340
 and by that you can also find if 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.950
 you fish with a too sick if 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.730
 You can still find a full-page dolls 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.870
 but here you will find this only once 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.660
 and even if one us what me 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.970
 denies a bit of nevermann here 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.459
 goes down and slammed us 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.140
 no longer in a short time after 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.209
 event to sneeze reason whatsoever 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.610
 there is already the problem that mine 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.620
 namely max sachs auto sees 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.290
 bit strange that he finds max 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.140
 not that bit black as you are now 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.260
 not being racist but that 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.070
 does not look normal and saves me 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.680
 First we drove to fight the s-max 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.700
 below you can also see our max is one 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.220
 bit different 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.730
 why is that plus why is that? 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.850
 plus 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.269
 I do not know I do not look 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.269
 Let's 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:34.900
 ok oh so it 's a genius marx than that 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.090
 I would never have thought possible 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.370
 martina a lot if you rehearse all once 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.800
 who has seen one can 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.250
 here apparently pushing the market 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.540
 the I think as never before in the 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.580
 version seen 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.470
 okay you could yourself gold crystal 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:00.950
 holzinger and hard god an apparent 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:02.420
 but that was the policy that belongs 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.490
 has it running 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.570
 we should take care of that but that 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.730
 Shit that does not matter with story 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:14.420
 here that has sex with the story 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.100
 this and yes we can find so caught 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.330
 It's not that cool either 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.920
 hard to catch 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.010
 We have been to a lift 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:26.040
 being trapped 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.110
 names do not give with the max and 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.620
 that 's it , there you can here too 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.690
 do not do 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.960
 but at least you can can at the moment 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.210
 Of course, get the item up there 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.030
 Of course we do not want to measure that 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:45.570
 because we are already here very well 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:49.230
 pick up and get us the big piece 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:52.320
 nuggets so that was a nice place 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.260
 I still did not know that 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.500
 but finding out could be so 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:01.680
 Japanese reads hugo cow not so 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:09.080
