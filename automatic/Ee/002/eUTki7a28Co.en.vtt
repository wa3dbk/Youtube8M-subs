00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:07.490
 today we will talk about the kidneys the kidneys are 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.559
 of the parenchyma tosi organs 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.040
 this means that they are full organs and 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.019
 no cables are organs 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.420
 retroperitoneal what is peritoneum 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.490
 the appraiser is essentially a leaflet 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.039
 visceral covering the organs level 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.779
 in the abdominal cavity the territory 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.210
 can be divided into two components 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.789
 this is a cross section la 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.830
 portion precisely covering the organs 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.079
 such as the stomach and one 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.210
 front portion and canvas duffel bag 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.039
 next to the vertebrae a bag in the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.839
 rear well located in the part 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:43.429
 rear as for example also the 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:46.579
 pancreas and kidneys for a feature 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:49.940
 to be of a shape more or less 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.109
 beans and beans are located in 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.339
 proximity of the spine 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:58.459
 in the purse now also lumbar the offenders 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.979
 precisely they are two symmetrical organs namely 

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:03.260
 they are practically identical and are found 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.180
 on both sides of the body 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.509
 what I have explained to you precisely the kidney 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.390
 also it essentially splits a little bit 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.520
 I didn't want the superior in the portion 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.380
 lower we find broad semiticus of 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.979
 letters in the wrist or the impossibility 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.310
 these are the dimensions of t12 lei 12 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.020
 cm long and about 6 wide 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.539
 centimeters is a front diameter 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.049
 transverse rear about 3 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:33.110
 centimeters the kidney 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.530
 the two kidneys have a weight that is around 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.740
 around 100 g specifically 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.770
 man 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.700
 we are around 150 women in the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.490
 about 135 of an upper pole 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.289
 colognola and a little lower and 2 margin 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:54.319
 1 medial is a lateral note 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.659
 convex March 20 th at the concave if 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.740
 make it a section of the kidney this is 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.229
 one of the most important features 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.990
 of the king we find two portions 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.220
 as main portion just more 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.110
 external led him in more internal to 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.770
 strangers called cortical la 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.160
 medullary internal portion 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.990
 domino the king all.re yellow have instead 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.610
 the quarter dog in red and those 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.820
 structures we see are called pyramids 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.350
 renal kidney had as an optional e 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.140
 while we find portion to see 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.360
 kylie lorena le ranieri is that 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.880
 a very important schooling 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.660
 because it is a body that needs for years 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.180
 of note 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.930
 much blood richest one-fifth of 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.640
 cardiac output and therefore we have two 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.670
 one arterial branches I don't know much 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.020
 important the cur then I find ourselves 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.590
 so a fake that comes from 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.000
 styria award and the arterial vessel the vessel 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.880
 we do if instead that it comes from 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.720
 vena cava the venous vessel carries precisely 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.780
 the blood riffro towards the heart while 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.840
 no martina since the blood towards the 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.830
 kidney for filtration 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.610
 now I call myself another feature 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.580
 important in renal anatomy though 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.740
 this is let's say a little finer and therefore 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.480
 a bit of telescopic antonioni before 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.930
 we spoke from anatomy 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.330
 macroscopic then a characteristic 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.320
 fundamental to know the rennes and the 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.530
 his unit 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.540
 let's say functional which is the neutron ne 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.190
 make this point how to see from all over 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.190
 a series of mounds 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.980
 first of all we find the portion 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.260
 initial is not that it takes the name of 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:43.140
 mosman's toxic the success portion of the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.110
 proximal twisted tube that is 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.470
 continue the anxiety that the former 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.150
 continue the distal just then finished 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.630
 of the collector tube that collects the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.550
 so many contracted tubules to stand then 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.400
 the capsule again receives one 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.790
 vascular structure that is precisely 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.500
 consisting of claws or martyrdom 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.970
 referent is the art riola afferente the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.000
 blood comes through the artery 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:17.880
 the offerer and is filtered is one very 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.450
 filtered the flow the blood arrival 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.000
 in the efferent riola art 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.440
 these are the concepts of antonia 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.440
 sample is named after one euro 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.290
 then we at the level of the fragment 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.970
 we will make the poma capsule the tuber 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.670
 against which the next doe 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.190
 contract to stand up there is the cupolo 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.460
 collector 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.710
 if you liked it I will make others 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.470
 subscribe visit the facebook page 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.770
 just put it there if there is video 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.860
 liked it I like it 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.250
 and see you soon with the next one 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.250
