00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
for it to get to a boiling point and at

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:08.149 
for it to get to a boiling point and at
that<00:01:00.570> point<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.170> add<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> almonds<00:01:07.159> ok

now we're going to add the 2 cups of
almonds<00:01:11.240> at<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.390> point<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> change

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
almonds at this point I like to change

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.789 
almonds at this point I like to change
to<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.770> wooden<00:01:14.580> spoon<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:19.320> you'll<00:01:19.650> continue

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
to the wooden spoon and you'll continue

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:27.670 
to the wooden spoon and you'll continue
to<00:01:20.130> stir<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:21.950> for<00:01:22.950> about<00:01:23.570> 8<00:01:24.570> minutes

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.510 

depending<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.740> where<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.310> heat

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
depending on where you have your heat

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.670 
depending on where you have your heat
set<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.920> it'll<00:01:32.610> look<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:33.720> liquidy<00:01:33.990> for

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
set to and it'll look really liquidy for

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.490 
set to and it'll look really liquidy for
a<00:01:34.710> while<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.600> eventually<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.810> liquid<00:01:37.380> will

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
a while and eventually that liquid will

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.210 
a while and eventually that liquid will
start<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.920> thicken<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.710> once<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.890> thickens

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
start to thicken up and once it thickens

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.950 
start to thicken up and once it thickens
up<00:01:41.400> all<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.090> sudden<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> moisture<00:01:42.840> will

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
up all of a sudden the moisture will

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.700 
up all of a sudden the moisture will
start<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:44.210> disappear<00:01:45.210> at<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.350> point<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
start to disappear at that point you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.550 
start to disappear at that point you
want<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.950> spread<00:01:47.280> them<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.490> onto<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> pan<00:01:48.560> so

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
want to spread them out onto a pan so

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.240 
want to spread them out onto a pan so
we'll<00:01:49.710> stir<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.479> about<00:01:51.479> 7<00:01:52.290> more<00:01:52.740> minutes

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.859 

ok<00:01:56.250> we're<00:01:56.460> about<00:01:56.610> 5<00:01:56.909> minutes<00:01:57.210> into<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
ok we're about 5 minutes into the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.590 
ok we're about 5 minutes into the
stirring<00:01:58.759> you<00:01:59.759> can<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.270> starting<00:02:00.570> to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
stirring you can see it's starting to

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.850 
stirring you can see it's starting to
thicken<00:02:00.719> up<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.259> little<00:02:01.409> bit

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
thicken up a little bit

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.060 
thicken up a little bit
we'll<00:02:02.759> keep<00:02:02.939> stirring<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.869> 2<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.710> 3<00:02:04.920> more

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
we'll keep stirring this for 2 to 3 more

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.479 
we'll keep stirring this for 2 to 3 more
minutes<00:02:06.320> as<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.469> get<00:02:07.590> close<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.220> point

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
minutes as you get close to the point

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.919 
minutes as you get close to the point
where<00:02:08.640> all<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.000> moisture<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.479> gone<00:02:09.629> you'll

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
where all the moisture is gone you'll

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.809 
where all the moisture is gone you'll
it'll<00:02:10.289> start<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.590> smell<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:12.379> burning

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
it'll start to smell like it's burning

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:34.950 
it'll start to smell like it's burning
just<00:02:14.510> keep<00:02:14.719> stirring

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.270 

okay<00:02:35.960> you'll<00:02:36.140> notice<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.590> our<00:02:36.680> moisture<00:02:37.190> is

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
okay you'll notice that our moisture is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.740 
okay you'll notice that our moisture is
now<00:02:37.750> disappearing<00:02:38.750> quickly<00:02:40.390> we'll<00:02:41.390> stir<00:02:41.630> in

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
now disappearing quickly we'll stir in

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.200 
now disappearing quickly we'll stir in
here<00:02:41.870> for<00:02:42.050> just<00:02:42.230> another<00:02:42.440> second<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:44.060> looks

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
here for just another second that looks

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.130 
here for just another second that looks
like<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.510> solves<00:02:44.840> right<00:02:45.050> out<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:46.060> then<00:02:47.140> we'll

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
like it solves right out and then we'll

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:57.130 
like it solves right out and then we'll
just<00:02:48.290> pour<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:49.070> our<00:02:49.430> tray<00:02:49.940> here<00:02:56.140> now

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
just pour it on to our tray here now

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.300 
just pour it on to our tray here now
we'll<00:02:57.290> just<00:02:57.410> spread<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.830> out

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
we'll just spread it out

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.340 
we'll just spread it out
I<00:03:01.360> make<00:03:02.360> them<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:02.630> they're<00:03:02.750> not<00:03:02.780> all<00:03:03.020> stuck

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
I make them so they're not all stuck

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.800 
I make them so they're not all stuck
together<00:03:03.530> break<00:03:04.100> up<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.430> ones<00:03:04.610> that<00:03:04.850> are<00:03:04.970> in

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810
