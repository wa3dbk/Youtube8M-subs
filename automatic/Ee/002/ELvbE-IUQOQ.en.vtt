00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello today we are going to prepare a cake of 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.580
 lemon a cake which is very 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.010
 helped because it does not work so much for 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.080
 have breakfast to eat and also 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.179
 It is very tasty, you can combine it 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.320
 with a lot of things 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:22.029
 let's see we will prepare the dough 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.029
 we will look for the eggs one by one 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.530
 and mix with sugar 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.410
 i 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.150
 we will beat 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.829
 until they get together 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.829
 well in the eggs with the sugar 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.210
 we will incorporate the ingredients 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.210
 slowly 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.120
 we will incorporate the lemon yogurt 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.259
 imagine 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.380
 and 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.510
 the oil is usually cast 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.340
 olive oil in this case we have 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.900
 used sunflower oil this 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.760
 It depends on whether you like it to be a 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.760
 little bit more acid a little bit softer 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.239
 we will throw the previously sieved flour 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.480
 the measures of the ingredients you know 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.739
 which are measurements of yogurt 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.629
 that we have already measured before 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.629
 to do it all much faster 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.340
 let's incorporate 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.340
 the true one of the world 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.110
 We have previously washed the lemon 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.010
 dried and scratched like everything we have 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.810
 at home 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.760
 Hard stay gives it a very rich flavor 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.760
 goodbye to the biscuit of 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.280
 same 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.569
 let's incorporate 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.569
 yeast 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.460
 well we have the cake dough 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.199
 Now we have to put it in the oven 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.639
 about 40 minutes at 160 degrees and 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.190
 previously we had to make a 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.539
 little bit of flour for the mold that 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.410
 we have put together with butter so that 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.410
 Do not stick in the oven
