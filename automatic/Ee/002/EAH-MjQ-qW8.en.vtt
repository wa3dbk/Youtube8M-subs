00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.200
 chronicles I do not know how to pronounce the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.090
 true 12 without bad memories on 2 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.820
 but good you'll really have in the 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.760
 title if it is 1 or 2 good everything is 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.669
 divided into six parts forgiveness are five 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.090
 parts are four 160 megabytes and the 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:29.550
 126 meg approximately one fifth is 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.700
 uploaded to mega by me and the game you in 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.649
 English language and in formats did yes wrong 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.980
 I do not remember so well let's go to 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.980
 start 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.450
 [Music] 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.579
 because the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:00.300
 although they will have 55 and since they are five 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.860
 parts but let's go I'll show the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.989
 process of being with the first link already 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.610
 which is exactly the same for all 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.500
 the parts 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.240
 those that click on a link of 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.160
 surprise on this page should wait 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.680
 five seconds the time these five 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.920
 seconds to click on jump 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.509
 advertising tests believe that there 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.400
 this page will appear that will be the one of 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.800
 mega as you will see that it is loading where 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.810
 wait for karim completely and a 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.510
 once you finish loading the third the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.230
 next page is active 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.230
 good 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.790
 here we are simply going to give you that in 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.990
 download and then automatically not 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.760
 I wanted to be like is to create 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.290
 confirmations the download speed 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.080
 and the download time depend 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.790
 totally from your internet so good 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.580
 once you download the five parts 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.620
 they announced to the agent extracted more 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.430
 forgiveness unloaded then we will have 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.800
 the five parts 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.080
 in my case it has this folder what 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.600
 follow below is to select the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.000
 five parts click you have on some of 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.650
 you are selected and we are going to click 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.020
 in outside files or extract here 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.660
 in this case to extract files for 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.590
 ask me where I want to extract it and 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.780
 I'm going to choose a desk for more 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:17.130
 accessibility after they click on 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.990
 extract will begin this will appear extra 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.910

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.570
 sergio punto did and I really like 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.390
 that the processing bar reaches 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.630
 one hundred percent per meter accelerated the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.630
 video 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.190
