issue with stability control light on

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.960 
issue with stability control light on
which<00:00:22.140> solves<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.619> effects<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.130> where<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
which solves the effects to where the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.089 
which solves the effects to where the
car<00:00:24.150> handles<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.840> also<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> safety<00:00:25.619> part<00:00:26.010> of

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
car handles and also the safety part of

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.970 
car handles and also the safety part of
the<00:00:26.160> vehicle<00:00:26.660> we've<00:00:27.660> managed<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:27.990> sort<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the vehicle we've managed to sort it the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.560 
the vehicle we've managed to sort it the
issue<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.699> steering<00:00:30.150> box<00:00:30.390> has<00:00:30.539> been

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
issue was is that steering box has been

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.590 
issue was is that steering box has been
initially<00:00:31.170> set<00:00:31.410> up<00:00:31.640> incorrectly<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:33.390> off

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
initially set up incorrectly on off

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.020 
initially set up incorrectly on off
center<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.290> they<00:00:34.980> redo<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> whole<00:00:35.730> steering

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
center so they redo the whole steering

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.990 
center so they redo the whole steering

four<00:00:49.039> we<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.160> an<00:00:50.250> issue<00:00:50.399> which<00:00:50.700> has<00:00:50.730> been

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
four we have an issue which has been

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.020 
four we have an issue which has been
done<00:00:51.300> under<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.629> way<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:53.030> potential

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
done under this way because potential

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660 
done under this way because potential
customer<00:00:54.510> believes<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.289> vehicles<00:00:55.680> news<00:00:55.949> that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
customer believes the vehicles news that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.459 
customer believes the vehicles news that
it's<00:00:56.789> been<00:00:56.969> modified<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.480> who<00:00:57.960> knows<00:00:58.140> what

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
it's been modified with who knows what

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.279 
it's been modified with who knows what
what<00:00:58.770> parts<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> what<00:00:59.789> standard<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.989> let's

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
what parts and to what standard so let's

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.689 
what parts and to what standard so let's
have<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.440> bit<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.710> look<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> car<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:02.430> as

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
have a bit of a look at the car now as

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.889 
have a bit of a look at the car now as
we<00:01:02.850> walk<00:01:02.969> through<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.390> step<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.660> through<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
we walk through and step you through a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.390 
we walk through and step you through a
couple<00:01:04.170> teams<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.530> are<00:01:04.619> not<00:01:04.710> only<00:01:04.860> unsafe

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
couple teams that are not only unsafe

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.250 
couple teams that are not only unsafe
that<00:01:06.060> will<00:01:06.240> affect<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> vehicle<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.170> this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
that will affect the vehicle and this

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.429 
that will affect the vehicle and this
long-term<00:01:08.330> reliability<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:10.140> let's<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
long-term reliability so let's have a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.520 
long-term reliability so let's have a
look<00:01:10.590> here

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.260 

first<00:01:15.159> of<00:01:15.310> all<00:01:15.400> we<00:01:15.549> can<00:01:15.640> have<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:15.820> look<00:01:16.030> at<00:01:16.119> the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
first of all we can have a look at the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.200 
first of all we can have a look at the
way<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.510> brake<00:01:16.720> lines<00:01:16.960> have<00:01:17.170> been<00:01:17.260> done

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
way the brake lines have been done

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.330 
way the brake lines have been done
they're<00:01:19.210> actually<00:01:19.540> rubbing<00:01:20.260> together<00:01:20.409> and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
they're actually rubbing together and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.130 
they're actually rubbing together and
they're<00:01:21.640> not<00:01:21.760> sort<00:01:22.119> of<00:01:22.210> restrained<00:01:22.690> it<00:01:22.840> apart

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
they're not sort of restrained it apart

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.660 
they're not sort of restrained it apart
so<00:01:23.380> I<00:01:23.409> can't<00:01:23.680> rub<00:01:23.860> together<00:01:24.009> rub<00:01:24.310> through

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
so I can't rub together rub through

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.219 
so I can't rub together rub through
obviously<00:01:25.479> that's<00:01:25.810> going<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:25.990> be<00:01:26.080> an<00:01:26.140> issue

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
obviously that's going to be an issue

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.210 
obviously that's going to be an issue
with<00:01:26.470> bit<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:27.009> vibration<00:01:27.400> over<00:01:27.850> time<00:01:29.220> zooming

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
with bit of vibration over time zooming

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.399 
with bit of vibration over time zooming
back<00:01:30.369> again<00:01:30.640> with<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.880> other<00:01:31.000> side<00:01:31.240> here<00:01:31.600> the

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
back again with the other side here the

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.070 
back again with the other side here the
way<00:01:32.530> they've<00:01:32.710> done<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.070> intake<00:01:33.790> to<00:01:34.060> be<00:01:34.300> mine

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
way they've done the intake to be mine

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.109 
way they've done the intake to be mine
leaves<00:01:35.409> it<00:01:35.560> hard<00:01:35.800> up<00:01:35.979> against<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.460> brake

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
leaves it hard up against the brake

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.230 
leaves it hard up against the brake
reservoir<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:38.380> tight<00:01:38.649> taped<00:01:39.070> up<00:01:39.340> so<00:01:40.149> I'm

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
reservoir it's tight taped up so I'm

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.609 
reservoir it's tight taped up so I'm
wondering<00:01:40.420> how<00:01:40.630> long<00:01:40.780> that'll<00:01:40.960> last<00:01:41.049> under

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
wondering how long that'll last under

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.550 
wondering how long that'll last under
boost<00:01:41.860> this<00:01:42.310> is<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.490> turbo<00:01:42.759> diesel<00:01:43.229> move<00:01:44.229> across

boost this is a turbo diesel move across

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.550 
boost this is a turbo diesel move across
here<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.799> bit<00:01:44.950> further<00:01:45.220> you<00:01:45.430> can<00:01:45.520> see<00:01:45.759> high

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
here a bit further you can see high

here a bit further you can see high
electrical<00:01:47.560> cables<00:01:48.009> again<00:01:48.220> rubbing<00:01:48.729> against

electrical cables again rubbing against

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.660 
electrical cables again rubbing against
the<00:01:49.350> master<00:01:50.350> cylinder<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:51.190> with<00:01:51.399> a<00:01:51.460> bit<00:01:51.580> of

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
the master cylinder so with a bit of

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.100 
the master cylinder so with a bit of
time<00:01:51.850> no<00:01:52.090> doubt<00:01:52.149> that<00:01:52.420> will<00:01:52.509> rub<00:01:52.659> through<00:01:52.929> and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
time no doubt that will rub through and

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.139 
time no doubt that will rub through and
lose<00:01:53.259> all<00:01:53.409> your<00:01:53.530> brake<00:01:53.770> fluid<00:01:53.909> there<00:01:54.909> just<00:01:55.090> a
