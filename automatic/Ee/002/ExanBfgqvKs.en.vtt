okay<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.469> my<00:00:01.620> latest<00:00:01.890> project<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.000> have

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
okay this is my latest project I have

okay this is my latest project I have
called<00:00:03.750> it<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.529> castor<00:00:05.190> bot<00:00:05.400> because<00:00:05.790> it<00:00:06.210> uses

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
called it the castor bot because it uses

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.129 
called it the castor bot because it uses
a<00:00:06.779> caster<00:00:07.350> wheel<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:10.040> small<00:00:12.139> Arduino

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139

controlled by a ps3 controller much the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.830 
controlled by a ps3 controller much the
same<00:00:25.380> as<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.070> remote-control<00:00:26.820> car<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.359> in

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
same as the remote-control car in in

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230 
same as the remote-control car in in
fact<00:00:28.260> exactly<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> same<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.400> the

mine<00:00:32.820> which<00:00:33.030> will<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> look<00:00:33.420> -<00:00:33.890> except

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
mine which will have a look - except

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.250 
mine which will have a look - except
it's<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> lot<00:00:35.250> more<00:00:35.430> interesting<00:00:35.850> because<00:00:36.260> not

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it's a lot more interesting because not

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.770 
it's a lot more interesting because not
only<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.309> control<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> round<00:00:39.149> or<00:00:39.510> grind

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
only can I control the round or grind

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.119 
only can I control the round or grind
around<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> also<00:00:40.710> has<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.540> gimbal<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.660> it

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
around but it also has a gimbal on it

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.979 
around but it also has a gimbal on it
now<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.489> don't<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> camera<00:00:45.180> before<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
now I don't have a camera before at the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.910 
now I don't have a camera before at the
moment<00:00:46.289> maybe<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.950> day<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> GoPro<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.920> fpv

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
moment maybe one day a GoPro with a fpv

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.560 
moment maybe one day a GoPro with a fpv
video<00:00:50.399> system<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:50.910> at<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> moment<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.539> just

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
video system but at the moment it just

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.810 
video system but at the moment it just
has<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> light<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.500> an<00:00:53.190> ultrasonic<00:00:53.670> range

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
has a light and an ultrasonic range

tops<00:03:04.070> but<00:03:04.820> I<00:03:04.910> got<00:03:05.120> them<00:03:05.270> pretty<00:03:05.390> limo<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:06.110> a

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
caster wheel from Ace Hardware so here I

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.310 
caster wheel from Ace Hardware so here I
will<00:03:10.700> set<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.360> camera<00:03:11.690> down<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.020> turn<00:03:12.200> this

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
will set the camera down and turn this

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:24.840 
will set the camera down and turn this
thing<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:16.000> wish<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.239> little<00:03:17.570> wider<00:03:17.870> angle

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.509 

and<00:03:25.850> there<00:03:26.000> we<00:03:26.090> go<00:03:26.410> okay<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:27.440> much<00:03:28.010> like<00:03:28.250> in<00:03:28.430> my

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
and there we go okay so much like in my

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.410 
and there we go okay so much like in my
previous<00:03:28.760> video<00:03:32.920> here<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.519> Arduino<00:03:35.120> and

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
previous video here is the Arduino and

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.330 
previous video here is the Arduino and
I'll<00:03:36.410> put<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.650> back<00:03:36.709> here<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.040> can<00:03:37.130> see<00:03:37.250> it

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
I'll put it back here so you can see it

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.110 
I'll put it back here so you can see it
here's<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:38.170> ps3<00:03:39.170> controller<00:03:39.910> guys<00:03:40.910> have<00:03:41.030> to

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
here's the ps3 controller guys have to

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.600 
here's the ps3 controller guys have to
get<00:03:41.239> really<00:03:41.360> close<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:42.320> when<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.739> press<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.370> PS

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
get really close so when I press the PS

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.460 
get really close so when I press the PS
button<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:44.450> controller<00:03:44.780> comes<00:03:44.989> on<00:03:45.200> starts

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
button the controller comes on starts

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.810 
button the controller comes on starts
blinking<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:46.010> you'll<00:03:46.130> notice<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.550> in<00:03:46.700> the

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
blinking and you'll notice that in the

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.300 
blinking and you'll notice that in the
background<00:03:47.239> this<00:03:47.450> starts<00:03:47.720> blinking<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:49.190> when

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
background this starts blinking and when

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.699 
background this starts blinking and when
this<00:03:49.430> blinks<00:03:49.850> rapidly<00:03:50.360> this<00:03:51.050> becomes<00:03:51.440> solid

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
this blinks rapidly this becomes solid

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.080 
this blinks rapidly this becomes solid
and<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.160> indicates<00:03:52.610> that<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:52.850> have

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
and that indicates that I have

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.699 
and that indicates that I have
communication<00:03:56.290> there's<00:03:57.290> not<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.410> whole<00:03:57.560> lot<00:03:57.590> of

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
communication there's not a whole lot of

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.170 
communication there's not a whole lot of
space<00:03:57.980> in<00:03:58.160> my<00:03:58.250> desk<00:03:58.489> here<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.760> driving<00:03:58.940> around

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
space in my desk here to driving around

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.600 
space in my desk here to driving around
but<00:03:59.450> we'll<00:03:59.690> do<00:03:59.840> our<00:03:59.959> best

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.309 

so<00:04:06.610> I<00:04:06.640> use<00:04:06.849> this<00:04:07.030> two<00:04:07.450> sticks<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.959> drive<00:04:08.170> it

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
so I use this two sticks to drive it

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.649 
so I use this two sticks to drive it
much<00:04:08.469> like<00:04:08.680> tank<00:04:08.920> drive<00:04:11.849> it's<00:04:12.849> extremely<00:04:13.390> fast

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
much like tank drive it's extremely fast

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.650 
much like tank drive it's extremely fast
and<00:04:13.930> very<00:04:14.140> precise<00:04:14.560> when<00:04:15.549> turning<00:04:15.939> and<00:04:16.269> in

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
and very precise when turning and in

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.420 
and very precise when turning and in
small<00:04:16.959> areas<00:04:17.169> but<00:04:17.470> it's<00:04:17.650> not<00:04:18.130> very

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
small areas but it's not very

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.640 
small areas but it's not very
interesting<00:04:18.609> in<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.449> straight<00:04:20.019> line<00:04:20.049> for<00:04:20.560> long

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
interesting in a straight line for long

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:29.999 
interesting in a straight line for long
distances<00:04:21.190> because<00:04:21.340> it's<00:04:21.729> quite<00:04:22.060> slow<00:04:28.710> now<00:04:29.710> I

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
distances because it's quite slow now I

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.900 
distances because it's quite slow now I
can<00:04:30.340> control<00:04:30.759> the<00:04:31.889> well<00:04:32.889> there<00:04:33.250> maybe<00:04:33.789> you

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
can control the well there maybe you

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.140 
can control the well there maybe you
guys<00:04:34.090> have<00:04:34.150> noticed<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:35.020> gimbal<00:04:35.530> is<00:04:35.650> pointing

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
guys have noticed the gimbal is pointing

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.999 
guys have noticed the gimbal is pointing
backwards<00:04:37.150> I<00:04:37.419> had<00:04:37.960> originally<00:04:38.199> intended<00:04:38.979> for

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
backwards I had originally intended for

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.060 
backwards I had originally intended for
to<00:04:39.310> drive<00:04:39.520> in<00:04:39.729> this<00:04:39.880> direction<00:04:40.650> but<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.800> just

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
to drive in this direction but it just

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.550 
to drive in this direction but it just
so<00:04:42.190> happened<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.639> the<00:04:43.150> for<00:04:43.960> whatever<00:04:44.139> reason

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
so happened that the for whatever reason

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.170 
so happened that the for whatever reason
it's<00:04:44.710> actually<00:04:44.979> because<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.699> angle<00:04:45.849> of

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
it's actually because the the angle of

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.529 
it's actually because the the angle of
the<00:04:46.500> base<00:04:47.500> is<00:04:47.800> slightly<00:04:48.130> tilted<00:04:48.580> forward<00:04:48.940> that

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
the base is slightly tilted forward that

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.270 
the base is slightly tilted forward that
the<00:04:49.930> caster<00:04:50.320> wheel<00:04:50.470> works<00:04:50.740> better<00:04:50.979> when<00:04:51.220> I

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
the caster wheel works better when I

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.279 
the caster wheel works better when I
Drive<00:04:51.550> it<00:04:51.729> in<00:04:51.849> this<00:04:52.000> direction<00:04:52.210> not<00:04:53.080> this

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
Drive it in this direction not this

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.300 
Drive it in this direction not this
direction<00:04:53.680> so<00:04:55.410> everything<00:04:56.410> sort<00:04:56.620> of<00:04:56.710> pointed

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
direction so everything sort of pointed

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.290 
direction so everything sort of pointed
backwards<00:04:57.699> but<00:04:58.150> it's<00:04:58.479> okay<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:59.130> works<00:05:00.150> so<00:05:01.150> now

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
backwards but it's okay it works so now

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.480 
backwards but it's okay it works so now
we'll<00:05:01.479> go<00:05:01.720> over<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.110> gimbal<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.919> gimbal<00:05:03.280> I

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
we'll go over the gimbal the gimbal I

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.610 
we'll go over the gimbal the gimbal I
can<00:05:03.880> activate<00:05:04.180> by<00:05:04.330> holding<00:05:04.780> down<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:05.050> l1<00:05:05.349> key

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
can activate by holding down the l1 key

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.010 
can activate by holding down the l1 key
and<00:05:05.889> then<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.729> right<00:05:06.910> joystick<00:05:07.210> now<00:05:07.720> I<00:05:07.750> was

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
and then the right joystick now I was

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.740 
and then the right joystick now I was
complete<00:05:08.349> control<00:05:08.560> over<00:05:08.889> it<00:05:09.570> it's<00:05:10.570> actually

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
complete control over it it's actually

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.080 
complete control over it it's actually
quite<00:05:11.080> smooth<00:05:11.650> but<00:05:12.070> because<00:05:12.430> of<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.699> lack<00:05:12.880> of

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
quite smooth but because of the lack of

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.770 
quite smooth but because of the lack of
resolution<00:05:13.449> from<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.909> ps3<00:05:15.909> controller<00:05:15.940> stick

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
resolution from the ps3 controller stick

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.700 
resolution from the ps3 controller stick
it<00:05:17.199> feels<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.979> little<00:05:18.490> rough<00:05:19.199> when<00:05:20.199> running<00:05:20.470> it

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
it feels a little rough when running it

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.350 
it feels a little rough when running it
although<00:05:20.919> you'll<00:05:21.280> notice<00:05:21.550> that<00:05:21.669> if<00:05:21.789> I<00:05:21.909> go<00:05:21.940> to

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
although you'll notice that if I go to

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.250 
although you'll notice that if I go to
set<00:05:22.659> positions<00:05:23.110> it's<00:05:23.320> quite<00:05:23.560> smooth<00:05:23.919> I<00:05:25.260> can

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
set positions it's quite smooth I can

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.080 
set positions it's quite smooth I can
turn<00:05:26.470> on<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.830> light<00:05:29.729> which<00:05:30.729> would<00:05:30.909> stop

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
turn on the light which would stop

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.399 
turn on the light which would stop
making<00:05:31.300> noise<00:05:31.570> yeah<00:05:31.810> I<00:05:31.840> could<00:05:31.960> turn<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.169> light

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
making noise yeah I could turn the light

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:33.750 
making noise yeah I could turn the light
and<00:05:32.680> I<00:05:32.710> could<00:05:32.860> turn<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:33.070> range<00:05:33.280> find<00:05:33.550> it<00:05:33.669> and

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
and I could turn the range find it and

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.710 
and I could turn the range find it and
you'll<00:05:33.849> notice<00:05:34.030> that<00:05:34.180> when<00:05:34.300> I<00:05:34.330> turn<00:05:34.570> on<00:05:34.630> the

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
you'll notice that when I turn on the

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.480 
you'll notice that when I turn on the
rangefinder<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.470> red<00:05:35.889> LED<00:05:36.310> in<00:05:36.400> the

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
rangefinder the red LED in the

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.820 
rangefinder the red LED in the
background<00:05:36.909> will<00:05:37.090> light<00:05:37.300> up<00:05:37.449> that<00:05:38.440> indicates

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
background will light up that indicates

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.290 
background will light up that indicates
that<00:05:38.889> the<00:05:39.010> rangefinder<00:05:39.280> is<00:05:39.639> on<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:42.120> then<00:05:43.120> look

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
that the rangefinder is on and then look

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.610 
that the rangefinder is on and then look
around<00:05:43.570> do<00:05:43.750> all<00:05:43.840> sorts<00:05:44.080> of<00:05:44.139> stuff<00:05:44.320> like<00:05:44.380> that

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
around do all sorts of stuff like that

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.279 
around do all sorts of stuff like that
the<00:05:45.310> range<00:05:45.490> finding<00:05:45.820> now<00:05:46.330> if<00:05:46.599> I<00:05:46.690> weren't<00:05:46.960> using

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
the range finding now if I weren't using

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.580 
the range finding now if I weren't using
my<00:05:47.409> phone<00:05:47.770> to<00:05:48.220> film<00:05:48.250> this<00:05:48.639> video<00:05:48.820> I<00:05:49.349> could<00:05:50.349> use

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
my phone to film this video I could use

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.250 
my phone to film this video I could use
a<00:05:50.919> Bluetooth<00:05:51.909> terminal<00:05:52.419> application<00:05:52.570> to

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
a Bluetooth terminal application to

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.279 
a Bluetooth terminal application to
retrieve<00:05:53.800> all<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:55.150> telemetry<00:05:55.419> data<00:05:55.690> from<00:05:56.169> the

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
retrieve all the telemetry data from the

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.469 
retrieve all the telemetry data from the
robot<00:05:56.590> so<00:05:57.190> that<00:05:57.340> would<00:05:57.490> be<00:05:57.610> like<00:05:57.970> the<00:05:58.210> stick

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
robot so that would be like the stick

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.159 
robot so that would be like the stick
positions<00:05:59.070> the<00:06:00.070> controller<00:06:00.690> status<00:06:01.690> as<00:06:01.960> in

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
positions the controller status as in

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.999 
positions the controller status as in
battery<00:06:03.099> voltage<00:06:03.580> Rumble<00:06:04.509> status<00:06:04.930> I<00:06:05.169> can<00:06:05.860> also

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
battery voltage Rumble status I can also

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.189 
battery voltage Rumble status I can also
retrieve<00:06:06.460> the<00:06:06.789> angle<00:06:07.180> of<00:06:07.389> the<00:06:07.599> tilt<00:06:07.960> and<00:06:08.139> pan

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
retrieve the angle of the tilt and pan

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.570 
retrieve the angle of the tilt and pan
servos<00:06:08.860> on<00:06:09.099> the<00:06:10.199> gimbal<00:06:11.199> and<00:06:11.409> obviously<00:06:12.310> the

the<00:06:16.060> range<00:06:16.270> it<00:06:16.510> is<00:06:16.540> calculated<00:06:17.140> you<00:06:18.130> could

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
the range it is calculated you could

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.770 
the range it is calculated you could
also<00:06:18.400> access<00:06:18.730> this<00:06:19.030> information<00:06:19.540> from<00:06:19.630> a

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
port on the robot and that's about it I

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.300 
port on the robot and that's about it I
will<00:06:32.530> have<00:06:33.450> this<00:06:34.450> video<00:06:34.750> will<00:06:35.020> be<00:06:35.250> posted<00:06:36.250> on

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
will have this video will be posted on

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.070 
will have this video will be posted on
my<00:06:36.460> website<00:06:36.670> obviously<00:06:37.510> hosted<00:06:38.320> on<00:06:38.410> YouTube

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.230 
my website obviously hosted on YouTube
so<00:06:41.080> I'll<00:06:41.680> have<00:06:41.860> a<00:06:41.920> link<00:06:42.610> in<00:06:42.820> the<00:06:43.120> description

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
so I'll have a link in the description

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.040 
so I'll have a link in the description
to<00:06:44.110> the<00:06:44.560> website<00:06:44.950> post<00:06:45.250> with<00:06:46.150> a<00:06:46.360> list<00:06:46.780> of

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
to the website post with a list of

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.310 
to the website post with a list of
components<00:06:47.410> and<00:06:47.920> the<00:06:48.820> code<00:06:49.090> if<00:06:49.810> anyone<00:06:50.200> would

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
components and the code if anyone would

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.160 
components and the code if anyone would
like<00:06:50.410> to<00:06:50.560> look<00:06:50.680> at<00:06:50.860> it<00:06:50.980> if<00:06:51.910> you<00:06:51.970> would<00:06:52.360> it's

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
like to look at it if you would it's

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.590 
like to look at it if you would it's
very<00:06:53.230> common<00:06:53.830> for<00:06:54.040> beginning<00:06:54.640> robots<00:06:55.500> to<00:06:56.500> use

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
very common for beginning robots to use

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.210 
very common for beginning robots to use
servos<00:06:58.600> rather<00:06:58.990> than<00:06:59.200> motors<00:06:59.590> because<00:06:59.740> motors

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:00.220 
servos rather than motors because motors

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.830 
servos rather than motors because motors
are<00:07:00.340> a<00:07:00.370> lot<00:07:00.580> more<00:07:00.760> complex<00:07:01.120> because<00:07:01.480> you<00:07:01.690> need

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 
are a lot more complex because you need

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.560 
are a lot more complex because you need
a<00:07:01.870> driver<00:07:02.230> and<00:07:02.820> gearboxes<00:07:03.820> and<00:07:04.000> all<00:07:04.090> that<00:07:04.300> sort

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
a driver and gearboxes and all that sort

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.060 
a driver and gearboxes and all that sort
of<00:07:04.630> stuff<00:07:04.690> so<00:07:06.000> this<00:07:07.000> is<00:07:07.120> a<00:07:07.150> relatively<00:07:07.660> common

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070 
of stuff so this is a relatively common

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.890 
of stuff so this is a relatively common
project<00:07:09.070> so<00:07:09.490> you<00:07:09.550> may<00:07:09.910> be<00:07:09.970> able<00:07:10.210> to<00:07:10.360> adapt<00:07:10.690> the

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:10.900 
project so you may be able to adapt the

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.790 
project so you may be able to adapt the
code<00:07:11.170> if<00:07:11.470> you've<00:07:11.800> built<00:07:12.010> something<00:07:12.340> similar

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
code if you've built something similar

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.050 
code if you've built something similar
and<00:07:14.800> this<00:07:14.980> isn't<00:07:15.220> a<00:07:15.340> very<00:07:15.550> very<00:07:15.790> common

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060 
and this isn't a very very common

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.180 
and this isn't a very very common
rangefinder<00:07:16.840> and<00:07:18.630> I<00:07:19.630> have<00:07:20.470> another<00:07:20.830> video

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190

Bluetooth<00:07:23.830> with<00:07:24.130> the<00:07:24.220> ps3<00:07:24.490> controller<00:07:24.970> so

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.180 
Bluetooth with the ps3 controller so

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.120 
Bluetooth with the ps3 controller so
this<00:07:25.390> is<00:07:26.110> a<00:07:26.140> relatively<00:07:27.100> cheap<00:07:28.710> pretty<00:07:29.710> common

setup<00:07:30.400> so<00:07:30.700> I<00:07:30.730> hope<00:07:31.000> that<00:07:31.210> some<00:07:31.810> people<00:07:32.140> will<00:07:32.500> be
