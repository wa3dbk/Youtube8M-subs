00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.410
 big title your car san andreas 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.019
 remasterizado in hd machinima incredible 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.790
 ok large 5 car was something that would 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.800
 which I wanted to talk to you today 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.050
 since recently a channel 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.270
 pretty good at creating machine 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.430
 and more has created a machinima 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.529
 practically of the so mythical game of the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.250
 saga of rockstar games known as 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.310
 big 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.840
 auto san andreas ok and how brutal this 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.489
 video that I will leave them in the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.130
 description there in the front line may 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.649
 to be watching this video has created a 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.360
 incredible machinima not here I just 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.610
 I'm going to pass some pics for you 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.309
 they may be appreciating and as they see it is 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.140
 a totally recreation of the intro of 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.270
 great auto san andreas and here as what 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.950
 see we see the photo so mythical when 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.289
 we are in the first mission that we have 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.059
 to steal a bicycle and I do not know 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.829
 honestly to me that's going to be very 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.780
 incredible since it has been super 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.579
 well and I'm telling you to put the video 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.469
 I leave you on the first line of the list 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.359
 of the description and I do not usually do 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.070
 this type of videos recommending a 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.870
 video class but this one 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.210
 the truth that impressed me since 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.650
 I do not know is the best video a montage that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.350
 I've seen big cars and what I've 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.790
 seen several and I do not know it's simply the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.500
 best of all since also my 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.570
 favorite game is the grand theft auto 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.960
 san andreas and that's why I have a lot 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.760
 appreciation 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.550
 another thing that should be highlighted a lot of 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.830
 this video is that the characters 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.619
 managed to recreate perfectly as 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.960
 come the cei is recreated to perfection 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.940
 if it looks easily like bee 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.680
 gees mou we can appreciate it 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.540
 this image is not as if you get to 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.149
 your mother's house here we are seeing 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.850
 more or less how would the scene be which 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.800
 the character goes to the pantheon 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.649
 to visit what the grave is doing 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.080
 from his mother but untimely or by 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.570
 some situation come the bullets not that 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.490
 is the enemy band of what was the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.899
 big car game san andreas something 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.670
 that I really like in this character 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.710
 is that we realized that it is a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.350
 character that came from below and arrived 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.570
 to the top of the city of saints 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.030
 and I think it 's something that is taken 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.880
 much in mind also seeing that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.340
 trailer I realized that more than anything the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.970
 rock star game franchise could 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.510
 do 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.580
 an episode from the saints not that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.620
 it would be pretty good and they would say that 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.990
 happened it really gets that the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.000
 represent in the current age since the 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.260
 game was based at another time on the 11th and 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.090
 we realized that it could be done 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.670
 this, but also what it would take 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.010
 if you would like to do this type 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.990
 of history would require the city of 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.820
 saints and sanz iron but as they see it 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.160
 this is when the shooting with the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.070
 fences and here we can be appreciating 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.900
 the picture in if it is already escaping 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.000
 of the bullets that deliver it so 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.310
 run over not the truth was left 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.780
 pretty good genius I had a great time 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.610
 looking to the right I saw it as three 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.890
 times because it brought subtitles and it's 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.930
 much easier to understand that yes 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.000
 that the subtitles are in English but 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.070
 Well, it's still pretty good if you 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.260
 you know the game you will notice everything 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.050
 what develops in this city another 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.600
 another good thing that has this 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.090
 machinima is that the voices are the voices 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.340
 real that occurred in the gameplay of 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.380
 the great auto san andreas original something 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.420
 which is worth noting and is pretty good 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.340
 so guys like they see one of the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.900
 best machine and more than big cars 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.360
 indicated the truth 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.069
 if they are good but this one I think it was 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.319
 the theme and the history that it has 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.159
 because it was made that this was my 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.079
 favorite 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.099
 so guys if they like to go to 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.989

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.700
