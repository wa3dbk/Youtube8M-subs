all<00:01:59.969> sorts<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.299> gimmicks<00:02:00.539> kind<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.780> hard<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.960> do

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
all sorts of gimmicks kind of hard to do

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.239 
all sorts of gimmicks kind of hard to do
this<00:02:01.139> from<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.350> backwards<00:02:01.969> like<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:04.249> yes

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
this from the backwards like this yes

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:08.169 
this from the backwards like this yes
you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.549> see<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.210> pushes<00:02:06.479> that

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
you can see just it just pushes that

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.219 
you can see just it just pushes that
everybody<00:02:09.179> go<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.479> pushes<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.899> past<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
everybody go just pushes it past the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.030 
everybody go just pushes it past the
bowl<00:02:10.410> that's<00:02:11.370> how<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.580> game<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.850> course

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
bowl that's how that game of course

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.210 
bowl that's how that game of course
we'll<00:02:14.040> go<00:02:14.160> ahead<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.020> transform<00:02:16.020> him<00:02:16.260> up

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
we'll go ahead and transform him up

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.790 
we'll go ahead and transform him up
so<00:02:17.790> yeah<00:02:17.910> pretty<00:02:18.150> cool<00:02:18.390> nice<00:02:18.990> little<00:02:19.290> nice

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
so yeah pretty cool nice little nice

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.400 
so yeah pretty cool nice little nice
little<00:02:19.830> robot<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:21.270> transformation<00:02:21.960> again<00:02:22.200> is

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
little robot and transformation again is

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.740 
little robot and transformation again is
very<00:02:22.590> similar<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.430> bigger<00:02:23.610> robot<00:02:24.090> you

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
very similar to the bigger robot you

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.680 
very similar to the bigger robot you
take<00:02:24.930> these<00:02:25.050> fins<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.680> fold<00:02:25.920> them<00:02:26.040> down

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
take these fins and you fold them down

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.360 
take these fins and you fold them down
against<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.750> treads<00:02:28.080> like<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.470> put<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
against the treads like that put the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.920 
against the treads like that put the
treads<00:02:29.640> up<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:30.300> want<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.480> flip<00:02:30.600> them<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> little

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
treads up you want to flip them a little

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.170 
treads up you want to flip them a little
bit<00:02:31.050> further<00:02:31.200> past<00:02:31.530> his<00:02:31.740> head<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.790> arm<00:02:33.060> you

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
bit further past his head this arm you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.360 
bit further past his head this arm you
take<00:02:33.360> back<00:02:33.710> right<00:02:34.710> here<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.280> actually

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
take back right here and you actually

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.920 
take back right here and you actually
angle<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:35.910> down<00:02:36.090> there's<00:02:36.360> like<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.630> kind<00:02:36.870> of

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
angle it down there's like it kind of

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.570 
angle it down there's like it kind of
wraps<00:02:37.110> around<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.770> post<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.220> his<00:02:38.370> back

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
wraps around of this post on his back

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.120 
wraps around of this post on his back
it's<00:02:38.820> well<00:02:38.940> angled<00:02:39.240> post<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.720> well<00:02:40.320> as<00:02:40.530> he's

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
it's well angled post as well as he's

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.740 
it's well angled post as well as he's
got<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.730> can<00:02:41.820> see<00:02:41.850> it's<00:02:42.120> kind<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.330> an<00:02:42.420> angled

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
got you can see it's kind of an angled

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.770 
got you can see it's kind of an angled
tab<00:02:43.520> it's<00:02:44.520> actually<00:02:44.820> rectangular<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.630> it's

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
tab it's actually rectangular and it's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.270 
tab it's actually rectangular and it's
angled<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.350> little<00:02:46.560> bit<00:02:46.710> so<00:02:48.020> you<00:02:49.020> plug<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:49.980> in

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
angled a little bit so you plug that in

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.340 
angled a little bit so you plug that in
right<00:02:50.310> there<00:02:50.580> on<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.730> back<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.090> his<00:02:51.500> hips<00:02:52.500> here

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
right there on the back of his hips here

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.420 
right there on the back of his hips here
just<00:02:55.350> plug<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.650> in<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.010> his<00:02:56.280> arm

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
just plug it in like that so his arm

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.560 
just plug it in like that so his arm
should<00:02:56.580> look<00:02:56.760> kind<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.270> on<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
should look kind of like that on the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.500 
should look kind of like that on the
back<00:02:58.070> as<00:02:59.070> if<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.340> been<00:02:59.550> then<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.330> can<00:03:00.420> go

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
back as if it's been then you can go

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.930 
back as if it's been then you can go
ahead<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.870> take<00:03:00.990> these<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.560> fold<00:03:02.310> these<00:03:02.520> up

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
ahead and take these and fold these up

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.040 
ahead and take these and fold these up
and<00:03:03.420> all<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> way<00:03:04.020> down<00:03:04.550> okay<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:05.700> they're

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
and all the way down okay so they're

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.150 
and all the way down okay so they're
parallel<00:03:07.050> flat<00:03:07.290> up<00:03:07.470> against<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.860> shoulder

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
parallel flat up against the shoulder

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.800 
parallel flat up against the shoulder
joints<00:03:08.490> or<00:03:08.880> case<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.210> shoulder<00:03:09.480> joint<00:03:09.690> on

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
joints or case the shoulder joint on

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.030 
joints or case the shoulder joint on
this<00:03:09.960> side<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.260> shoulders<00:03:10.740> gonna<00:03:10.920> go

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
this side the shoulders gonna go

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.710 
this side the shoulders gonna go
someplace<00:03:11.220> else<00:03:11.490> but<00:03:11.760> pull<00:03:12.360> them<00:03:12.480> down<00:03:12.600> like

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
someplace else but pull them down like

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.800 
someplace else but pull them down like
that<00:03:13.640> then<00:03:14.640> up<00:03:14.790> here<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.600> where<00:03:15.750> it

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
that then up here and this is where it

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.720 
that then up here and this is where it
gets<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.960> little<00:03:16.050> tricky<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.620> want<00:03:16.800> he's<00:03:17.520> got

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
gets a little tricky you want he's got

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.370 
gets a little tricky you want he's got
these<00:03:17.850> little<00:03:17.970> tabs<00:03:18.330> kind<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:18.990> his<00:03:19.140> upper

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
these little tabs kind of on his upper

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.850 
these little tabs kind of on his upper
legs<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.520> you<00:03:20.610> want<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.820> move<00:03:20.970> these<00:03:21.860> it's

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
legs and so you want to move these it's

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.110 
legs and so you want to move these it's
kind<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.070> some<00:03:23.220> slots<00:03:23.520> up<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:23.730> his<00:03:23.820> hips<00:03:24.030> you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
kind of some slots up in his hips you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.510 
kind of some slots up in his hips you
want<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.300> rotate<00:03:24.600> these<00:03:24.890> so<00:03:25.890> they<00:03:26.010> they<00:03:26.280> kind

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
want to rotate these so they they kind

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.729 
want to rotate these so they they kind
of<00:03:26.640> slot<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:27.570> like<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.930> they<00:03:28.080> don't<00:03:28.170> peg<00:03:28.500> all

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
of slot in like that they don't peg all

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.100 
of slot in like that they don't peg all
the<00:03:28.830> way<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:29.160> but<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.030> corner<00:03:30.630> does<00:03:30.780> kind<00:03:31.020> of

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
the way in but that corner does kind of

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.020 
the way in but that corner does kind of
slot<00:03:31.470> there<00:03:31.980> behind<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:33.200> gap<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.380> his<00:03:34.500> hip<00:03:34.709> and

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
slot there behind the gap in his hip and

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.940 
slot there behind the gap in his hip and
same<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:36.270> side<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:37.020> then<00:03:37.650> once<00:03:37.770> you<00:03:37.860> do

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
same on this side and then once you do

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.800 
same on this side and then once you do
that<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.310> wrote<00:03:38.610> bend<00:03:39.150> this<00:03:39.270> forward<00:03:39.510> and

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
that you wrote bend this forward and

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.590 
that you wrote bend this forward and
then<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:41.100> swivel<00:03:41.550> joint<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.850> rotate<00:03:42.270> so<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
then that swivel joint you rotate so the

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.940 
then that swivel joint you rotate so the
wheels<00:03:42.750> are<00:03:42.900> down<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.320> of<00:03:43.410> course<00:03:43.620> flip<00:03:43.830> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
wheels are down and of course flip the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.710 
wheels are down and of course flip the
feet<00:03:44.130> down<00:03:44.310> which<00:03:44.640> exposes<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.390> wheels<00:03:45.570> in

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
feet down which exposes the wheels in

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.830 
feet down which exposes the wheels in
this<00:03:45.810> feat<00:03:46.820> again<00:03:47.820> very<00:03:48.090> similar<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.690> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
this feat again very similar to the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.690 
this feat again very similar to the
Voyager<00:03:49.170> here<00:03:49.380> except<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.400> don't<00:03:50.459> have<00:03:50.550> to

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
Voyager here except you don't have to

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.600 
Voyager here except you don't have to
slide<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.840> feet<00:03:52.110> up<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:53.010> down<00:03:53.100> like<00:03:53.400> on<00:03:53.550> the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
slide the feet up and down like on the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.009 
slide the feet up and down like on the
Voyager<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.510> just<00:03:54.540> rotate<00:03:54.870> that

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
Voyager you just you just rotate that

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.030 
Voyager you just you just rotate that
forward<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.620> reveals<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.040> wheel<00:03:58.040> then

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
forward and that reveals the wheel then

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.890 
forward and that reveals the wheel then
once<00:03:59.190> that's<00:03:59.370> done<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.670> take<00:03:59.880> this<00:04:00.120> chest

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
once that's done you take this chest

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.160 
once that's done you take this chest
piece

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
piece

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.590 
piece
lift<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:01.800> up<00:04:02.150> flip<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.269> up<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.900> over<00:04:05.480> plug<00:04:06.480> it

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
lift it up flip it up and over plug it

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.040 
lift it up flip it up and over plug it
into<00:04:06.780> there<00:04:07.550> bring<00:04:08.550> it<00:04:08.610> up<00:04:08.670> like<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:09.050> flip

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
into there bring it up like that flip

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.350 
into there bring it up like that flip
his<00:04:10.170> head<00:04:10.320> down<00:04:10.440> like<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:11.150> open<00:04:12.150> up<00:04:12.180> these

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
his head down like this open up these

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.949 
his head down like this open up these
panels<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.680> bring<00:04:14.310> his<00:04:14.459> arm<00:04:14.670> up<00:04:16.400> like<00:04:17.400> that

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
panels and bring his arm up like that

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.150 
panels and bring his arm up like that
pull<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.080> around<00:04:19.140> like<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.530> then<00:04:20.040> this

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
pull it around like that and then this

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.090 
pull it around like that and then this
tab<00:04:20.519> right<00:04:20.549> here<00:04:20.850> pegs<00:04:21.330> in<00:04:21.510> right<00:04:21.690> here<00:04:22.019> so<00:04:22.169> you

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
tab right here pegs in right here so you

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.200 
tab right here pegs in right here so you
just<00:04:23.250> take<00:04:23.730> the<00:04:23.940> cannon<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:25.160> like<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.640> then

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
just take the cannon in like so and then

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.840 
just take the cannon in like so and then
just<00:04:27.240> bring<00:04:27.810> these<00:04:27.930> up<00:04:28.169> back<00:04:28.350> up<00:04:28.560> is<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.640> wolf

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
just bring these up back up is the wolf

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.439 
just bring these up back up is the wolf
it<00:04:29.970> back<00:04:30.090> over<00:04:30.240> the

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
it back over the

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.929 
it back over the
join<00:04:30.599> just<00:04:30.749> up<00:04:30.900> against<00:04:31.259> the<00:04:31.759> shoulder<00:04:32.759> piece

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:32.939 
join just up against the shoulder piece

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.510 
join just up against the shoulder piece
up<00:04:33.120> here<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.590> that's<00:04:34.590> pretty<00:04:34.889> much<00:04:35.009> shockwave

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
up here and that's pretty much shockwave

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.799 
up here and that's pretty much shockwave
in<00:04:35.819> tank<00:04:36.270> mode<00:04:37.249> any<00:04:38.249> rolls<00:04:38.460> okay<00:04:38.819> and<00:04:39.389> it<00:04:39.569> looks

00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:39.809 
in tank mode any rolls okay and it looks

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:41.329 
in tank mode any rolls okay and it looks
like<00:04:39.870> from<00:04:40.259> certain<00:04:40.559> angles<00:04:40.860> like<00:04:40.979> here<00:04:41.219> he

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:41.339 
like from certain angles like here he

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:43.399 
like from certain angles like here he
looks<00:04:41.550> pretty<00:04:42.539> decent<00:04:42.719> he<00:04:42.960> looks<00:04:43.139> like<00:04:43.259> his

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
looks pretty decent he looks like his

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.350 
looks pretty decent he looks like his
tank<00:04:43.620> on<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.830> show<00:04:44.039> a<00:04:44.279> little<00:04:44.759> off<00:04:44.909> for<00:04:45.180> being

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
tank on the show a little off for being

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.420 
tank on the show a little off for being
a<00:04:45.419> cyberverse<00:04:45.870> but<00:04:46.139> not<00:04:46.289> bad<00:04:46.499> you<00:04:47.069> will<00:04:47.159> notice

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
a cyberverse but not bad you will notice

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.499 
a cyberverse but not bad you will notice
they<00:04:47.520> like<00:04:47.729> if<00:04:47.819> you<00:04:47.909> look<00:04:48.059> at<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:48.270> from<00:04:48.360> like

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
they like if you look at it from like

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.869 
they like if you look at it from like
the<00:04:48.629> top<00:04:48.870> he<00:04:49.680> does<00:04:49.860> get<00:04:50.009> skinnier<00:04:50.460> at<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.699> back

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
the top he does get skinnier at the back

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.869 
the top he does get skinnier at the back
there's<00:04:51.659> no<00:04:51.870> unlike<00:04:52.259> the<00:04:52.469> Voyager<00:04:53.009> toy<00:04:53.219> these

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
there's no unlike the Voyager toy these

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:57.260 
there's no unlike the Voyager toy these
don't<00:04:54.210> extend<00:04:54.539> out<00:04:54.749> to<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.020> side<00:04:55.969> so<00:04:56.969> you've

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
don't extend out to the side so you've

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.540 
don't extend out to the side so you've
got<00:04:57.479> a<00:04:57.509> skinnier<00:04:58.110> back<00:04:58.289> in<00:04:58.529> front<00:04:58.800> but<00:04:59.400> from

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
got a skinnier back in front but from

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.920 
got a skinnier back in front but from
certain<00:04:59.789> angles<00:04:59.879> that<00:05:00.120> didn't<00:05:00.569> look<00:05:00.629> that<00:05:00.779> bad

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
certain angles that didn't look that bad

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.709 
certain angles that didn't look that bad
it's<00:05:01.169> actually<00:05:01.379> a<00:05:01.409> neat<00:05:01.529> little<00:05:01.650> tank<00:05:02.719> and

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
it's actually a neat little tank and

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:07.070 
it's actually a neat little tank and
again<00:05:04.020> it<00:05:05.270> fairly<00:05:06.270> accurate<00:05:06.569> to<00:05:06.689> show<00:05:06.900> the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
again it fairly accurate to show the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.600 
again it fairly accurate to show the
back<00:05:07.499> tread<00:05:07.770> should<00:05:07.949> be<00:05:08.039> a<00:05:08.069> little<00:05:08.249> bigger<00:05:08.400> and

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
back tread should be a little bigger and

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.529 
back tread should be a little bigger and
sit<00:05:08.819> out<00:05:08.939> a<00:05:08.969> little<00:05:09.089> further

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
sit out a little further

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.170 
sit out a little further
but<00:05:10.349> first<00:05:11.159> cyberverse<00:05:11.580> it's<00:05:11.819> really<00:05:11.999> more

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
but first cyberverse it's really more

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.879 
but first cyberverse it's really more
like<00:05:12.330> that<00:05:12.509> you<00:05:12.900> can<00:05:13.020> fire<00:05:13.199> the<00:05:13.349> cannon<00:05:13.740> in

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
like that you can fire the cannon in

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.829 
like that you can fire the cannon in
this<00:05:14.009> mode<00:05:14.219> as<00:05:14.339> well<00:05:14.460> very<00:05:14.699> easily<00:05:17.839> blocking

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:18.839 
this mode as well very easily blocking

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:21.230 
this mode as well very easily blocking
it<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.680> more<00:05:19.889> the<00:05:20.370> fast<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.849> more<00:05:20.969> pressure

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
it the more the fast the more pressure

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.139 
it the more the fast the more pressure
and<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.629> faster<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.050> fire<00:05:22.649> it<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:23.149> more

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:24.149 
and the faster you fire it the more

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:27.079 
and the faster you fire it the more
distance<00:05:24.509> you<00:05:24.629> can<00:05:24.719> get<00:05:25.699> but<00:05:26.699> it<00:05:26.759> is<00:05:26.849> a<00:05:26.879> little

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.089 
distance you can get but it is a little

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.079 
distance you can get but it is a little
awkward<00:05:27.360> for<00:05:27.389> speed<00:05:28.669> these<00:05:29.669> quick<00:05:29.879> size

some<00:05:46.589> time<00:05:46.770> we'll<00:05:46.889> go<00:05:47.009> back<00:05:47.219> to<00:05:47.639> robot<00:05:48.149> mode

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
some time we'll go back to robot mode

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.550 
some time we'll go back to robot mode
and<00:05:48.449> again<00:05:48.629> it's<00:05:48.779> just<00:05:48.839> reversed<00:05:49.259> everything

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
and again it's just reversed everything

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.350 
and again it's just reversed everything
I<00:05:49.949> just<00:05:50.909> pop<00:05:51.089> this<00:05:51.240> up<00:05:51.419> open<00:05:52.199> up<00:05:52.259> these<00:05:52.379> panels

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
I just pop this up open up these panels

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:12.779 
flip up the feet up flip the arm forward

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.459 
flip up the feet up flip the arm forward
and<00:06:14.389> then<00:06:15.389> flip<00:06:15.599> the<00:06:15.719> treads<00:06:15.959> back<00:06:16.139> now<00:06:16.409> the

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
and then flip the treads back now the

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:18.469 
and then flip the treads back now the
the<00:06:17.189> fins<00:06:17.399> will<00:06:17.610> automatically<00:06:18.089> kind<00:06:18.270> of<00:06:18.330> pop

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
the fins will automatically kind of pop

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.959 
the fins will automatically kind of pop
up<00:06:18.689> there<00:06:19.199> is<00:06:19.379> not<00:06:20.249> so<00:06:20.399> much<00:06:20.550> on<00:06:20.669> this<00:06:20.819> side

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
up there is not so much on this side

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:22.189 
up there is not so much on this side
this<00:06:21.060> is<00:06:21.120> it's<00:06:21.360> kind<00:06:21.659> of<00:06:21.719> fits<00:06:21.899> over<00:06:22.110> this

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
this is it's kind of fits over this

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.929 
this is it's kind of fits over this
hinge<00:06:22.469> but<00:06:23.099> there<00:06:23.249> is<00:06:23.370> actually<00:06:23.550> a<00:06:23.759> specific

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:23.939 
hinge but there is actually a specific

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.779 
hinge but there is actually a specific
tab<00:06:24.419> back<00:06:24.689> here<00:06:25.110> that<00:06:25.949> you<00:06:26.219> have<00:06:26.370> pop<00:06:26.610> this

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
tab back here that you have pop this

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.239 
tab back here that you have pop this
tread<00:06:27.089> over<00:06:27.330> to<00:06:27.629> lock<00:06:27.810> it<00:06:27.959> in<00:06:28.020> place<00:06:28.139> and<00:06:28.469> then

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:29.249 
tread over to lock it in place and then

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:31.369 
tread over to lock it in place and then
just<00:06:29.639> angle<00:06:30.360> these<00:06:30.479> are<00:06:30.689> thoughts<00:06:30.899> at<00:06:31.199> the

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:31.379 
just angle these are thoughts at the

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:32.779 
just angle these are thoughts at the
same<00:06:31.560> angle<00:06:31.680> because<00:06:32.310> of<00:06:32.459> this<00:06:32.550> shoulder

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
same angle because of this shoulder

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:33.980 
same angle because of this shoulder
hinge<00:06:33.060> over<00:06:33.270> here<00:06:33.389> this<00:06:33.479> one<00:06:33.659> has<00:06:33.779> it<00:06:33.899> you

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
hinge over here this one has it you

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.570 
hinge over here this one has it you
can't<00:06:34.439> flip<00:06:34.770> this<00:06:34.889> up<00:06:35.069> a<00:06:35.129> little<00:06:35.249> bit<00:06:35.370> more

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
can't flip this up a little bit more

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.939 
can't flip this up a little bit more
than<00:06:35.729> this<00:06:35.879> one<00:06:36.089> it<00:06:36.659> has<00:06:36.810> a<00:06:36.839> cutaway<00:06:37.229> to<00:06:37.349> allow

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
than this one it has a cutaway to allow

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.920 
than this one it has a cutaway to allow
for<00:06:38.129> that<00:06:38.189> shoulder<00:06:38.459> hinge<00:06:38.759> but<00:06:39.479> just<00:06:39.659> angle

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
for that shoulder hinge but just angle

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.209 
for that shoulder hinge but just angle
but<00:06:40.050> this<00:06:40.169> one<00:06:40.349> can<00:06:40.500> only<00:06:40.560> go<00:06:40.769> for<00:06:40.889> this<00:06:40.949> for

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 
but this one can only go for this for

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:42.910 
but this one can only go for this for
far<00:06:41.430> forward<00:06:41.819> so<00:06:41.969> you<00:06:42.060> want<00:06:42.180> to<00:06:42.240> angle<00:06:42.360> them<00:06:42.569> so

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920 
far forward so you want to angle them so

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.300 
far forward so you want to angle them so
about<00:06:43.040> the<00:06:43.130> same<00:06:43.280> angle<00:06:43.610> and<00:06:43.820> there<00:06:44.750> you<00:06:44.870> have

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
about the same angle and there you have

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.390 
about the same angle and there you have
shockwave<00:06:46.310> in<00:06:46.720> robot<00:06:47.720> mode<00:06:47.750> again<00:06:48.400> simple

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
shockwave in robot mode again simple

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.160 
shockwave in robot mode again simple
easy<00:06:49.670> but<00:06:50.090> he's<00:06:50.300> actually<00:06:50.630> quite<00:06:50.930> a<00:06:50.960> bit<00:06:51.110> of

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.170 
easy but he's actually quite a bit of

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.740 
easy but he's actually quite a bit of
fun<00:06:51.550> and<00:06:52.550> just<00:06:52.700> some<00:06:52.820> size<00:06:53.000> comparisons<00:06:53.570> with

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
fun and just some size comparisons with

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.750 
fun and just some size comparisons with
some<00:06:54.320> of<00:06:54.380> the<00:06:54.440> other<00:06:54.590> robots<00:06:54.950> I<00:06:55.070> have<00:06:55.310> here<00:06:55.610> I

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
some of the other robots I have here I

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.760 
some of the other robots I have here I
was<00:06:56.360> gonna<00:06:56.480> grab<00:06:56.690> some<00:06:56.900> other<00:06:57.050> cyberverse<00:06:57.500> and

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
was gonna grab some other cyberverse and

he is with steel core you want to get
the<00:07:07.040> size<00:07:07.460> comparison<00:07:07.910> there<00:07:08.270> I<00:07:09.010> know<00:07:10.010> it's

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
the size comparison there I know it's

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.190 
the size comparison there I know it's
not<00:07:10.310> really<00:07:10.550> super<00:07:10.730> accurate<00:07:11.180> but<00:07:11.390> or<00:07:12.110> at
