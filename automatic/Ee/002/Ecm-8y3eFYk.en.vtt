surface and what I mean by a passageway

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.039 
surface and what I mean by a passageway
we<00:01:17.740> go<00:01:17.920> through<00:01:18.159> a<00:01:18.189> dark<00:01:18.609> area<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.420> my<00:01:19.600> right

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
we go through a dark area to my right

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.120 
we go through a dark area to my right
there's<00:01:20.740> also<00:01:21.039> a<00:01:21.249> kelp<00:01:21.670> island<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.950> when<00:01:24.100> I

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
there's also a kelp island so when I

got a perfect bait passageway where it

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.399 
got a perfect bait passageway where it
will<00:01:32.319> hold<00:01:32.560> bait<00:01:32.889> and<00:01:33.159> also<00:01:34.029> where<00:01:34.329> coho<00:01:34.779> can

choice<00:02:07.659> today<00:02:07.899> because<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.470> wind<00:02:08.709> isn't<00:02:09.009> too

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
choice today because the wind isn't too

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.190 
choice today because the wind isn't too
bad<00:02:09.340> I'm<00:02:09.729> gonna<00:02:09.849> actually<00:02:10.119> just<00:02:10.599> wind<00:02:10.929> rip

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
bad I'm gonna actually just wind rip

through<00:02:11.620> these<00:02:11.770> bait<00:02:12.069> passageways<00:02:13.049> trying<00:02:14.049> to

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
through these bait passageways trying to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.620 
through these bait passageways trying to
locate<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:15.159> first<00:02:15.430> salmon<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.939> the<00:02:16.060> day

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
and I can see the bait busting on the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.670 
and I can see the bait busting on the
surface<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.330> know<00:02:19.510> there<00:02:20.080> are<00:02:20.230> some<00:02:20.440> fish
