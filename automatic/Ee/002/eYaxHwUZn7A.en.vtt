so<00:00:10.460> for<00:00:10.700> this<00:00:10.789> pattern<00:00:11.090> you<00:00:11.299> want<00:00:11.539> to<00:00:11.719> cast<00:00:12.170> on

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
so for this pattern you want to cast on

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.620 
so for this pattern you want to cast on
multiples<00:00:12.920> of<00:00:13.039> six<00:00:13.610> stitches<00:00:14.000> plus<00:00:14.900> two<00:00:16.630> so

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
multiples of six stitches plus two so

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.800

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
the way across so once you've completed

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.990 
the way across so once you've completed
those<00:03:47.750> 12<00:03:48.200> rows<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:49.130> should<00:03:49.340> now<00:03:49.520> have<00:03:49.550> your

those 12 rows you should now have your

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.920 
those 12 rows you should now have your
basket<00:03:50.510> weave<00:03:50.660> design<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:56.540> think<00:03:56.630> this

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
basket weave design so I think this

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.050 
basket weave design so I think this
pattern<00:03:57.380> is<00:03:57.620> really<00:03:58.040> easy<00:03:58.310> but<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:58.820> looks

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
pattern is really easy but it looks

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.120 
pattern is really easy but it looks
really<00:03:59.300> nice<00:03:59.600> so<00:04:00.560> let<00:04:00.680> me<00:04:00.770> know<00:04:00.890> what<00:04:00.980> you

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
really nice so let me know what you

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.830 
really nice so let me know what you
think<00:04:01.280> of<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.610> pattern<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.330> if<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:02.660> was

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
think of this pattern and if this was

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.020 
think of this pattern and if this was
helpful<00:04:03.050> thank<00:04:03.980> you<00:04:04.040> for<00:04:04.130> watching<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.970> I'll

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
helpful thank you for watching and I'll
