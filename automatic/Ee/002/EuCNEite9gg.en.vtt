juggernaut pick up in took a little

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.940 
juggernaut pick up in took a little
while<00:00:10.110> longer<00:00:10.410> than<00:00:10.650> usual<00:00:10.830> um<00:00:11.660> but<00:00:12.660> just<00:00:12.950> just

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
while longer than usual um but just just

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.169 
while longer than usual um but just just
to<00:00:14.070> throw<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.340> out<00:00:14.400> there<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.639> did<00:00:15.000> buy<00:00:15.150> it

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
to throw it out there I did buy it

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.540 
to throw it out there I did buy it
originally<00:00:15.750> for<00:00:15.780> my<00:00:16.500> orange<00:00:16.859> strat<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
originally for my orange strat in the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.550 
originally for my orange strat in the
back<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.480> still<00:00:18.779> plan<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.170> trying<00:00:19.470> it

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
back and I do still plan on trying it

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.900 
back and I do still plan on trying it
out<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.890> there<00:00:20.010> because<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.550> does<00:00:20.730> need

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
out in there because it does need

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.540 
out in there because it does need
something<00:00:21.359> but<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.109> figured<00:00:22.439> I'd<00:00:22.560> try<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.400> out

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
something but I figured I'd try it out

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.320 
something but I figured I'd try it out
in<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.710> new<00:00:25.830> Les<00:00:26.010> Paul<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:27.180> for

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
in this the new Les Paul I have just for

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.110 
in this the new Les Paul I have just for
the<00:00:27.390> hell<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:31.040> so<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> spacing<00:00:32.550> if

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the hell of it so so like the spacing if

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.000 
the hell of it so so like the spacing if
the<00:00:33.510> spacing<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> wider<00:00:34.590> space<00:00:34.860> and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the spacing is like the wider space and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.170 
the spacing is like the wider space and
that's<00:00:35.130> meant<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.340> fenders<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:37.460> if<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:38.820> want

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
that's meant for fenders so if I do want

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180 
that's meant for fenders so if I do want
to<00:00:39.300> put<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> juggernaut<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.379> I'll

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
to put a juggernaut in this I'll

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.280 
to put a juggernaut in this I'll
probably<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.820> go<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.540> order

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
probably just go with like the order

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.650 
probably just go with like the order
another<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.300> get<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> regular

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
another one and get like the regular

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.180 
another one and get like the regular
spacing<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.500> whatever<00:00:48.379> anyway<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.770> did

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
spacing in it but whatever anyway I did

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.580 
spacing in it but whatever anyway I did
get<00:00:50.280> some<00:00:50.489> suggestions<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:52.170> rifts<00:00:52.469> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
get some suggestions of just rifts to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.310 
get some suggestions of just rifts to
play<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.160> try<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:53.699> an<00:00:53.820> idea<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.320> how

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
play to try and get like an idea of how

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.369 
play to try and get like an idea of how
it<00:00:55.469> does<00:00:55.620> sound<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.300> bare<00:00:57.480> knuckle<00:00:57.780> forum

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
it does sound on the bare knuckle forum

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.450 
it does sound on the bare knuckle forum
so<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.829> going<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.370> around

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
so I'm just going to be around

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
so I'm just going to be around
with<00:00:59.579> some<00:00:59.789> stuff<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:01.820> well<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.300> what<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
with some stuff and well see what you

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.119 
with some stuff and well see what you
think<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.870> think<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.470> pretty<00:01:04.769> freakin

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
think I think it's a pretty freakin

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:17.230 
think I think it's a pretty freakin
awesome<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.630> go

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:02:49.270 

you

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.620 

it<00:02:50.280> isn't<00:02:50.550> standard<00:02:50.880> tuning<00:02:51.090> right<00:02:51.239> now<00:02:51.390> I

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
it isn't standard tuning right now I

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.760 
it isn't standard tuning right now I
definitely<00:02:51.930> do<00:02:52.200> think<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.440> sounds<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.709> little

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
definitely do think it sounds a little

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.470 
definitely do think it sounds a little
bit<00:02:52.890> better<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.760> lower<00:02:53.940> tunings<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.420> know

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
bit better and the lower tunings I know

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.130 
bit better and the lower tunings I know
it's<00:02:54.780> pretty<00:02:54.989> much<00:02:55.170> what<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.739> was<00:02:55.830> meant<00:02:55.980> for

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
it's pretty much what it was meant for

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.990 
it's pretty much what it was meant for
but<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.380> mean<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.069> still<00:02:59.400> think<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.640> does<00:02:59.760> sound

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
but I mean I still think it does sound

00:03:00.000 --> 00:04:15.770 
but I mean I still think it does sound
good<00:03:00.180> in<00:03:00.620> standard<00:03:01.620> tuning<00:03:01.739> too

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.530 

so<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:16.870> kind<00:04:17.019> of<00:04:17.080> get<00:04:17.230> an<00:04:17.320> idea<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:18.390> how<00:04:19.390> it

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
so you kind of get an idea of how it

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.270 
so you kind of get an idea of how it
does<00:04:19.720> sound<00:04:20.019> with<00:04:20.560> like<00:04:20.709> a<00:04:20.830> really<00:04:21.100> heavy

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
does sound with like a really heavy

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.520 
does sound with like a really heavy
sound<00:04:21.760> I'll<00:04:22.510> drop<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.110> down<00:04:23.230> just<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.500> little

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
sound I'll drop it down just a little

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:51.909 
sound I'll drop it down just a little
bit

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:05:02.290 

drop<00:04:52.919> it<00:04:53.009> down<00:04:53.099> a<00:04:53.159> little<00:04:53.399> lower

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:35.890 

you

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.490 

and<00:05:37.580> just<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.729> normal<00:05:39.629> clean<00:05:39.870> setting<00:05:40.289> so

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
and just the normal clean setting so

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.820 
and just the normal clean setting so
here<00:05:41.340> we<00:05:41.430> go

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:06:28.420 

you

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.220 

so<00:06:29.430> that's<00:06:29.880> pretty<00:06:30.120> much<00:06:30.210> there<00:06:30.420> all<00:06:30.480> I<00:06:30.510> really

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
so that's pretty much there all I really

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.550 
so that's pretty much there all I really
got<00:06:31.320> to<00:06:31.440> show<00:06:31.560> for<00:06:31.740> this<00:06:32.070> one<00:06:32.310> um<00:06:33.290> like<00:06:34.290> I<00:06:34.380> said

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
got to show for this one um like I said

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.640 
got to show for this one um like I said
I<00:06:34.590> do<00:06:34.680> plan<00:06:35.070> on<00:06:35.370> putting<00:06:36.110> this<00:06:37.110> pickup<00:06:37.470> into

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
I do plan on putting this pickup into

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:47.960 
I do plan on putting this pickup into
the<00:06:38.340> stratosphere<00:06:42.770> know<00:06:43.770> in<00:06:43.980> here<00:06:46.580> in<00:06:47.580> the<00:06:47.820> end

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
the stratosphere know in here in the end

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.280 
the stratosphere know in here in the end
I<00:06:48.150> really<00:06:48.480> don't<00:06:48.660> know<00:06:48.750> what<00:06:48.930> I'm<00:06:49.020> gonna<00:06:49.110> do

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
I really don't know what I'm gonna do

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.800 
I really don't know what I'm gonna do
yet<00:06:49.470> but<00:06:50.160> like<00:06:50.910> I<00:06:51.000> said<00:06:51.060> I<00:06:51.210> do<00:06:51.330> really<00:06:51.570> like<00:06:51.750> the

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
yet but like I said I do really like the

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.490 
yet but like I said I do really like the
way<00:06:51.960> it<00:06:51.990> sounds<00:06:52.260> and<00:06:54.230> hopefully<00:06:55.230> I<00:06:55.260> like<00:06:55.410> the

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
way it sounds and hopefully I like the

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.570
