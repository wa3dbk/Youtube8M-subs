water
this<00:00:50.940> guy's<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.300> six<00:00:51.600> foot<00:00:51.809> five<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.680> he

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
this guy's like six foot five and he

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.229 
this guy's like six foot five and he
realized<00:00:53.219> when<00:00:53.370> he<00:00:53.430> was<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> water<00:00:53.910> that

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
realized when he was in the water that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.360 
realized when he was in the water that
that<00:00:54.480> chimp<00:00:54.989> did<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.590> save<00:00:55.800> his<00:00:56.100> life

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
that chimp did that to save his life

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.860 
that chimp did that to save his life
because<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.090> other<00:00:57.300> ones<00:00:57.510> were<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.629> going

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
because the other ones were just going

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.540 
because the other ones were just going
to<00:00:57.930> come<00:00:58.079> up<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.379> he'd<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.949> covered<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.370> food

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
to come up and he'd be covered in food

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.340 
to come up and he'd be covered in food
and<00:00:59.760> they<00:00:59.820> would<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.090> climb<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:01.020> word<00:01:01.199> is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and they would just climb the word is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.200 
and they would just climb the word is
that<00:01:01.500> they<00:01:01.620> they<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:01.920> rip<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:02.730> face<00:01:02.969> off

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that they they can rip your face off

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.170 
that they they can rip your face off
they<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.600> carry<00:01:03.840> 500<00:01:04.500> pounds<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:05.970> on

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
they can carry 500 pounds with one on

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.570 
they can carry 500 pounds with one on
and<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.320> now<00:01:07.439> anyway<00:01:07.770> we're<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> we're

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and so now anyway we're going to we're

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.310 
and so now anyway we're going to we're
going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> rotate<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.360> bridge<00:01:09.659> behind<00:01:09.960> me

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
going to rotate this bridge behind me

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.820 
going to rotate this bridge behind me
and<00:01:10.820> let<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.850> chimpanzees<00:01:12.570> go<00:01:12.780> from<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.320> area

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and let the chimpanzees go from one area

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.460 
and let the chimpanzees go from one area
one<00:01:14.460> island<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> next<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.659> we're<00:01:16.350> going

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
one island to the next and we're going

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.730 
one island to the next and we're going
to<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.710> touching<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> cables<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:19.049> rotate

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
to be touching the cables that rotate

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.789 
to be touching the cables that rotate
the<00:01:19.920> bridge<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.990> they<00:01:21.990> said<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.470> shimmy

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the bridge and they said they can shimmy

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.710 
the bridge and they said they can shimmy
down<00:01:22.950> those<00:01:23.159> things<00:01:23.400> real<00:01:23.610> quick<00:01:23.850> he<00:01:24.330> leaned

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
down those things real quick he leaned

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.969 
down those things real quick he leaned
up<00:01:24.950> hey<00:01:26.180> hey<00:01:28.939> things<00:01:29.939> gon<00:01:30.240> need<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.500> Jim

right<00:01:49.079> now<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.909> other<00:01:51.060> thing<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:51.420> told<00:01:51.630> me

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.139 
right now the other thing they told me
about<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.079> chimpanzees<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.460> can't<00:01:53.790> swim

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
about the chimpanzees is they can't swim

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.609 
about the chimpanzees is they can't swim
there's<00:01:54.390> not<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.630> an<00:01:54.750> ounce<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.170> fat<00:01:55.380> on
