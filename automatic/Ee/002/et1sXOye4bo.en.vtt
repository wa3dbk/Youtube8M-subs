00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:05.390
 Hello everyone here was and today I propose a video in which you 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.769
 I will explain as briefly as possible why I prefer the classic 98 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.769
 compared to all other bolt action sniper rifles 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.070
 temple experiments that I propose to you today is a fixed-term game on 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.800
 innocent page 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.180
 nothing is a perfect finished label builder. very often like 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.989
 we know how to train 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.349
 but back to heart it has the main purpose of this overall video because i 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.710
 prefer all sv 98 compared to the other three sniper bolt action chicks that 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
 they are the m24 taken off me 95 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.540
 the first thing we can talk about while we compare 14- the damage that is 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.190
 they do benetton and know that in all 4 rifles they do a maximum of 100 damage 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.990
 is a minimum 50 except the 95 me at least pac 55 years 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.270
 obviously I speak of variable tanno based on the distance therefore in total of 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.989
 know if he loves you and 24 class v 98 of goals 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.320
 the 13 meters will be 100 dance 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.260
 if you put us a little pregnant it won't come down until you reach your own 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.350
 minimum 35 meters 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.600
 from 35 meters then you will always need two shots to get 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.450
 this applies to the rifle quarters while for the 95 mb in the tinier range 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.480
 different 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.340
 you should know that this rifle can do 100 damage up to 19 meters 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.330
 distance 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.800
 in addition to these 19 meters of sodano it will fall as for the others among rifles for 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.510
 add to its minimum of 55 damage from 35 meters outside 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.619
 well I would say that at this point we should all - 95 lm surely 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.650
 better kitchens but no hay what I think keeps him away from competing 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.580
 against the other three foci of soft focaccia linked first are the times of 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.749
 refill and then look 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:58.279
 consequently in one stroke the other you see with an m95 rifle will pass to the 

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:00.310
 beauty of the two. 6 seconds 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.010
 there really are really so many not to mention the seven seconds that i 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.590
 secrets to change a fisherman 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.740
 so now let's also take this n95 let's put aside we cultivate i 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.240
 spotlights on r24 the goals of the follow. 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.859
 always talking about charging times with we notice that you paste one. 80 seconds of 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:27.160
 charging the volt while ll 24v now. 65 sv98 ass. 60 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.540
 so this is definitely a favor card for my n78 * see before 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.159
 favorite special edition 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.599
 but it is not only this that makes me prefix the sv 98 with respect to the other two 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.720
 sniper rifles 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.460
 because after all we are talking only fraction of a second here we should 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.810
 taking into account other factors is one of these factors could for example 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.129
 be the spectator size 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.379
 deneuve you must know that no one how long to hold up to 10 shots against the 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.329
 five shots of my 24th goal I felt entirely the other bed + the only one 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.329
 what we can complain about bed bank 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:07.049
 ok idea that I was closed to traffic but above all I hope 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.719
 to have made you understand why I prefer the 68% that you see it in 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.559
 video family practically 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:17.159
 however yesterday, always talking about porosity, they remembered a bed in a 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.739
 what's forum 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.630
 a discussion here was about the speed of the rifle bullet 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.150
 you need to know that the prima facie alert 95 sells when it is 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.439
 resting for a shotgun you will have too little weight and when you are part of it 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.529
 too nintendo of what final should aim so fired by remarkable 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.269
 target within a few days 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.730
 here you have to know that in second place there is nothing less than that in the classroom 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.910
 a little 98 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.540
 so it is certainly another positive note we came down from our per 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.609
 pc 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:56.700
 ok we are also to say that this is all for the structure 98 obviously copenhagen 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:00.540
 video I invite you to leave a comment you need to know what you think 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.160
 especially in this case if it reflects you 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.400
 what is your opinion the fb rifle with cto firenze paid holidays 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.189
 used during breaks 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.189
 ok no because really examples of one-eyed 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.910
 however returning to the speech of before here do not make them holy problems 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.789
 leave me comments because you know that I appreciate it so much. there is one thing 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.389
 which I like to see how you felt then 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.830
 let me know let me know what you think if you prefer a m24 google-it 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.139
 for the shape of the viewfinder suffered.it is true many of the class 98 complain 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.860
 shape of the optical viewfinder the uncomfortable is not suitable for certain situations 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.409
 so lg tim or unfortunately it is always a question of troponin tastes in the evening 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.490
 p8 you love it waters 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.660
 here we are now at the end of the last spot here I wanted to talk to you and 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.819
 Arabs are fomented denoting the beta still absolutely not known 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.509
 nothing if people on the ticket forum are really freaking out good morning 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.870
 there is a topic place where they are also used for dates for this 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.970
 santissima bank 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.870
 the truth is that unfortunately no one knows anything, nothing will be left either 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.670
 community managers themselves of the tyssen type s information should 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.159
 unforgettable fire 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.599
 however you can give me a tip here as it seems on the forums the most date 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:22.270
 accredited is that of September 27th so if I can give you an advice lol 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.270
 but don't expect anything first checks it's not the sea text 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.460
