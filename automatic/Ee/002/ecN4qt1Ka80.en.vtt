Fentress<00:00:28.140> do<00:00:28.550> basically<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.420> means<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
Fentress do basically it just means the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.620 
Fentress do basically it just means the
guitars<00:00:31.380> neck<00:00:32.160> grown-up<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.149> neck<00:00:33.270> but<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
guitars neck grown-up and neck but the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.970 
guitars neck grown-up and neck but the
scaling<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.140> shorter<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> top<00:00:34.770> and

longer<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.370> bottom<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.899> holds<00:00:37.230> your

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
longer on the bottom so it holds your

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.290 
longer on the bottom so it holds your
tuning<00:00:37.680> better<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.430> more<00:00:38.730> are<00:00:39.090> going<00:00:39.239> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
tuning better and it's more are going to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.470 
tuning better and it's more are going to
have<00:00:39.390> an<00:00:39.510> ergonomic<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.530> play<00:00:41.090> what<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> mean<00:00:42.329> by

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
have an ergonomic to play what I mean by

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.040 
have an ergonomic to play what I mean by
that<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:43.820> on<00:00:44.820> normal<00:00:45.120> guitars<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> frets<00:00:45.930> are

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
that is on normal guitars the frets are

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.779 
that is on normal guitars the frets are
straight<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.770> doesn't<00:00:47.219> really<00:00:47.370> match

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
straight and that doesn't really match

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.790 
straight and that doesn't really match
how<00:00:48.329> your<00:00:48.539> has<00:00:48.690> mute<00:00:49.110> when<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:49.469> when<00:00:49.770> you

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
how your has mute when they when you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.220 
how your has mute when they when you
play<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.219> guitar<00:00:50.600> because<00:00:51.600> your<00:00:51.870> hand<00:00:52.020> kind

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
play the guitar because your hand kind

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.100 
play the guitar because your hand kind
of<00:00:52.289> naturally<00:00:52.739> cribs

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
of naturally cribs

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.229 
of naturally cribs
on<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> neck<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.250> idea<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> fabric

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
on the neck so the idea of the fabric

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.979 
on the neck so the idea of the fabric
guitars<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:59.370> frets<00:00:59.670> match<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
guitars is so that the frets match the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.779 
guitars is so that the frets match the
way<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.559> hand<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.829> facing<00:01:02.250> depending<00:01:02.670> where

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
way your hand is facing depending where

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.399 
way your hand is facing depending where
it<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> neck<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> first<00:01:04.320> question

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
it is on the neck so the first question

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.670 
it is on the neck so the first question
I<00:01:04.680> got<00:01:04.860> asked<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> lot<00:01:05.549> was<00:01:06.049> how<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.110> learning

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
I got asked a lot was how the learning

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.120 
I got asked a lot was how the learning
curve<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> fanfare<00:01:09.720> guitar<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:11.010> is

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
curve was for a fanfare guitar this is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.550 
curve was for a fanfare guitar this is
the<00:01:11.250> first<00:01:11.430> time<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.880> had

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
the first time I had

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.160 
the first time I had
before<00:01:13.310> I<00:01:13.700> know<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.689> lot<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:14.899> people<00:01:15.079> are

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
before I know a lot of people are

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.080 
before I know a lot of people are
interested<00:01:15.409> by<00:01:15.920> one<00:01:16.220> but<00:01:16.399> our<00:01:16.549> picture<00:01:16.880> is

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
interested by one but our picture is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.690 
interested by one but our picture is
that<00:01:17.119> never<00:01:17.329> try<00:01:17.570> one<00:01:18.040> well<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.100> took<00:01:19.189> me<00:01:19.280> about

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
that never try one well it took me about

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.800 
that never try one well it took me about
half<00:01:20.030> an<00:01:20.450> hour<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:20.840> get<00:01:20.960> used<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.320> using<00:01:21.710> it<00:01:22.810> for

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
half an hour to get used to using it for

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.359 
half an hour to get used to using it for
the<00:01:23.869> first<00:01:24.079> half<00:01:24.229> an<00:01:24.350> hour<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:24.680> a<00:01:24.710> little<00:01:24.950> weird

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
the first half an hour is a little weird

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.649 
the first half an hour is a little weird
because<00:01:25.640> when<00:01:25.880> you're<00:01:26.000> looking<00:01:26.270> down<00:01:26.420> at<00:01:26.570> the

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
because when you're looking down at the

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.440 
because when you're looking down at the
neck<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:28.159> frets<00:01:28.430> aren't<00:01:28.850> exactly<00:01:29.240> where

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
neck the frets aren't exactly where

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.749 
neck the frets aren't exactly where
you'd<00:01:29.659> expect<00:01:29.720> them<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.200> be<00:01:30.369> based<00:01:31.369> on<00:01:31.580> you

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
you'd expect them to be based on you

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.010 
you'd expect them to be based on you
know<00:01:31.789> any<00:01:32.119> other<00:01:32.210> guitar<00:01:32.600> you've<00:01:32.780> played

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
know any other guitar you've played

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.389 
know any other guitar you've played
before<00:01:33.049> but<00:01:33.619> like<00:01:33.799> I<00:01:33.920> said<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.159> only<00:01:34.250> took

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
before but like I said it only took

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.340 
before but like I said it only took
about<00:01:34.460> half<00:01:34.789> an<00:01:34.939> hour<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.270> then<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.689> was<00:01:36.140> fine

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
about half an hour and then I was fine

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.990 
about half an hour and then I was fine
and<00:01:36.710> not<00:01:36.829> completed<00:01:37.280> it's<00:01:37.399> just<00:01:37.579> like<00:01:37.789> any

agile guitars I usually buy Ivanych

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.630 
agile guitars I usually buy Ivanych
guitars<00:01:56.659> because<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.289> like<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:58.189> thin<00:01:58.369> necks

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
guitars because I like the thin necks

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.669 
guitars because I like the thin necks
with<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.909> hack<00:01:59.090> but<00:02:00.049> one<00:02:00.259> this<00:02:00.439> one<00:02:00.649> is

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
with the hack but one this one is

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.149 
with the hack but one this one is
actually<00:02:01.009> pretty<00:02:01.189> good<00:02:01.459> as<00:02:01.939> well<00:02:02.860> it's<00:02:03.860> not<00:02:03.979> a

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
actually pretty good as well it's not a

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.350 
actually pretty good as well it's not a
much<00:02:04.700> thicker<00:02:05.149> than<00:02:05.659> like<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:07.009> Inez<00:02:07.459> was<00:02:08.179> your

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
much thicker than like and Inez was your

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.570 
much thicker than like and Inez was your
tunic<00:02:08.810> maybe<00:02:09.410> just<00:02:09.649> like<00:02:09.739> a<00:02:09.769> tiny<00:02:10.099> bit<00:02:10.369> thicker

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
tunic maybe just like a tiny bit thicker

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.420 
tunic maybe just like a tiny bit thicker
than<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:11.470> but<00:02:12.470> it's<00:02:12.590> very<00:02:12.680> smooth<00:02:13.400> very

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
than that but it's very smooth very

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.900 
than that but it's very smooth very
playable<00:02:14.060> very<00:02:14.450> fast<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:16.160> really<00:02:16.519> like<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.820> I

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
playable very fast I really like it I

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.090 
playable very fast I really like it I
have<00:02:16.970> no<00:02:17.180> problems<00:02:17.600> with<00:02:17.720> it

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
have no problems with it

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.860

this<00:02:19.100> guitar<00:02:19.400> also<00:02:19.549> has<00:02:19.940> an<00:02:20.090> actor<00:02:20.510> which<00:02:20.750> is

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
this guitar also has an actor which is

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.580 
this guitar also has an actor which is
really<00:02:21.109> nice

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
really nice

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.319 
really nice
the<00:02:21.950> third<00:02:22.130> question<00:02:22.310> was<00:02:22.670> just<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.940> general

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
the third question was just a general

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.979 
the third question was just a general
credibility<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.410> guitar<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:26.180> only<00:02:26.209> two

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
credibility of the guitar the only two

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.199 
credibility of the guitar the only two
things<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.620> don't<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.160> about<00:02:28.459> this

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
things that I don't like about this

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.830 
things that I don't like about this
guitar<00:02:29.390> right<00:02:29.959> now<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:31.030> because<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.269> pickups

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
guitar right now is because the pickups

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.280 
guitar right now is because the pickups
are<00:02:33.019> angled<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.739> find<00:02:34.549> it<00:02:34.810> kind<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.900> gets<00:02:36.109> in<00:02:36.260> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
are angled I find it kind of gets in the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.229 
are angled I find it kind of gets in the
way<00:02:36.500> sometimes<00:02:36.760> because<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.850> usually<00:02:38.120> pick

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
way sometimes because I usually pick

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.660 
way sometimes because I usually pick
around<00:02:38.420> here<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.620> from<00:02:39.950> first<00:02:40.100> like<00:02:40.340> David's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
around here so from first like David's

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.370 
around here so from first like David's
you<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.850> found<00:02:41.060> myself<00:02:41.239> hitting<00:02:41.600> this<00:02:41.870> pickup<00:02:42.260> a

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
you I found myself hitting this pickup a

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.770 
you I found myself hitting this pickup a
lot<00:02:42.590> what<00:02:43.549> kind<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.819> adjusted<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.389> way<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.510> play

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
lot what kind of adjusted the way I play

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.460 
lot what kind of adjusted the way I play
accordingly<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:46.370> avoid<00:02:46.609> that<00:02:46.730> now<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.780> again

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
accordingly to avoid that now so again

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.430 
accordingly to avoid that now so again
it<00:02:48.560> just<00:02:48.590> takes<00:02:48.829> a<00:02:48.889> little<00:02:49.010> getting<00:02:49.130> used<00:02:49.519> to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
it just takes a little getting used to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.809 
it just takes a little getting used to
the<00:02:51.440> only<00:02:51.560> other<00:02:51.650> thing<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.040> don't<00:02:52.100> like<00:02:52.310> is

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
the only other thing I don't like is

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.690 
the only other thing I don't like is
yeah<00:02:53.470> injury

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
yeah injury

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.619 
yeah injury
here's<00:02:54.849> very<00:02:55.440> harsh<00:02:56.440> on<00:02:57.120> efficiency<00:02:58.120> when<00:02:58.599> I

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
here's very harsh on efficiency when I

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.890 
here's very harsh on efficiency when I
play<00:02:58.900> my<00:02:59.140> armrest<00:02:59.709> right<00:03:00.220> on<00:03:00.340> this<00:03:00.550> right<00:03:01.540> here

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
play my armrest right on this right here

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.320 
play my armrest right on this right here
and<00:03:02.500> normally<00:03:02.920> on<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.519> Ibanez<00:03:03.849> in<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.150> lot<00:03:04.300> of

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
and normally on the Ibanez in a lot of

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.180 
and normally on the Ibanez in a lot of
other<00:03:04.510> photography<00:03:05.019> kind<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.290> smooth<00:03:05.530> out<00:03:05.680> on

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
other photography kind of smooth out on

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.220 
other photography kind of smooth out on
this<00:03:06.280> one<00:03:06.430> it's<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.610> very<00:03:06.819> rough<00:03:07.090> edge<00:03:07.239> so

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
this one it's a very rough edge so

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.920 
this one it's a very rough edge so
that's<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.980> minor<00:03:09.190> complaint<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.690> next

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
that's a minor complaint the next

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.309 
that's a minor complaint the next
question<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.230> had<00:03:11.410> was<00:03:11.620> about<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.630> air<00:03:13.630> the

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
question I had was about the air the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.100 
question I had was about the air the
intonation<00:03:14.709> how<00:03:15.190> well<00:03:15.400> stays<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:15.849> tune<00:03:16.000> when<00:03:16.989> I

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
intonation how well stays in tune when I

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.000 
intonation how well stays in tune when I
play<00:03:17.290> guitar<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:17.620> pick<00:03:17.950> really<00:03:18.550> hard<00:03:19.410> even<00:03:20.410> you

through recording and all that stuff I

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.789 
through recording and all that stuff I
find<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.310> station<00:03:27.519> team<00:03:27.849> really<00:03:28.720> well<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.590> next

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
find a station team really well the next

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.440 
find a station team really well the next
thing<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:29.980> talk<00:03:30.099> about<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.730> pickups<00:03:31.150> these

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
thing to talk about is the pickups these

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.470 
thing to talk about is the pickups these
are<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.019> stock<00:03:32.849> agile<00:03:33.849> grande

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
are the stock agile grande

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.890 
are the stock agile grande
CPS<00:03:34.959> pickups<00:03:35.470> which<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:36.190> had<00:03:36.489> heard<00:03:36.730> were<00:03:37.630> not

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
CPS pickups which I had heard were not

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.559 
CPS pickups which I had heard were not
that<00:03:38.110> good<00:03:38.640> but<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.700> actually<00:03:39.910> think<00:03:40.329> they're

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
that good but I actually think they're

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.589 
that good but I actually think they're
pretty<00:03:40.989> decent<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.829> usually<00:03:42.489> don't<00:03:42.700> use<00:03:42.910> active

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
pretty decent I usually don't use active

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.990 
pretty decent I usually don't use active
pickups<00:03:44.130> but<00:03:45.130> actually<00:03:45.459> like<00:03:45.579> these<00:03:45.700> ones<00:03:45.880> a

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
pickups but actually like these ones a

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.020 
pickups but actually like these ones a
lot<00:03:47.220> they're<00:03:48.220> much<00:03:48.519> better<00:03:48.700> than<00:03:48.849> I

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
lot they're much better than I

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.699 
lot they're much better than I
anticipated<00:03:49.150> than<00:03:49.810> being<00:03:50.049> because<00:03:50.380> I<00:03:50.470> heard

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
anticipated than being because I heard

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.319 
anticipated than being because I heard
so<00:03:50.920> much<00:03:51.040> negative<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.700> many<00:03:51.910> negative<00:03:52.120> things

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
so much negative so many negative things

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.509 
so much negative so many negative things
about<00:03:52.750> them<00:03:52.989> but<00:03:53.019> I<00:03:53.620> don't<00:03:54.040> know<00:03:54.099> I<00:03:54.130> think<00:03:54.250> that

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
about them but I don't know I think that

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.620 
about them but I don't know I think that
they're<00:03:54.700> pretty<00:03:55.150> good

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
they're pretty good

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.309 
they're pretty good
I<00:03:55.920> would<00:03:56.920> definitely<00:03:57.099> swap<00:03:57.700> them<00:03:57.880> out<00:03:58.319> later

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
I would definitely swap them out later

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.740 
I would definitely swap them out later
on<00:03:59.410> down<00:03:59.920> the<00:03:59.980> line<00:04:00.100> but<00:04:01.030> for<00:04:01.180> stock<00:04:01.420> I<00:04:01.569> guess

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
on down the line but for stock I guess

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.870 
on down the line but for stock I guess
they're<00:04:01.989> not<00:04:02.500> nearly<00:04:02.769> as<00:04:02.950> bad<00:04:03.069> as<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.489> lot<00:04:03.670> of

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
they're not nearly as bad as a lot of

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.170 
they're not nearly as bad as a lot of
