00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
systems i think i'm going to go back and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.720 
systems i think i'm going to go back and
try<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> use<00:00:36.300> my<00:00:36.719> older<00:00:37.170> LED<00:00:37.620> lights<00:00:37.860> versus

coming in though in a couple days so

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.700 
coming in though in a couple days so
hopefully<00:00:45.510> I'll<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.110> comparison<00:00:46.680> between

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
hopefully I'll have a comparison between

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.660 
hopefully I'll have a comparison between
those<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.760> these<00:00:49.340> g4s<00:00:50.840> also<00:00:51.840> soon<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:53.129> go<00:00:53.340> on

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
for on this side and four on this side

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.560 
for on this side and four on this side
will<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.280> these<00:01:00.079> 20<00:01:01.079> gallon<00:01:01.969> elongated<00:01:02.969> cubes

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
will be these 20 gallon elongated cubes

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.090 
will be these 20 gallon elongated cubes
and<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.870> call<00:01:04.049> them<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.619> obviously

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and I call them that because obviously

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.060
