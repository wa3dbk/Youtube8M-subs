from jackal called the bunny 85 and it's
the<00:01:57.890> series<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.399> guess<00:01:58.609> is<00:01:58.789> called<00:01:59.060> Lake<00:01:59.299> Police

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
the series I guess is called Lake Police

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.609 
the series I guess is called Lake Police
it's<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.579> smaller<00:02:02.119> profile<00:02:02.659> type<00:02:03.079> of<00:02:03.229> walking

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
it's a smaller profile type of walking

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.679 
it's a smaller profile type of walking
bait<00:02:03.829> and<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.789> reason<00:02:04.939> I<00:02:05.119> got<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:05.329> is

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
bait and the reason I got this is

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.139 
bait and the reason I got this is
because<00:02:05.899> one<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:06.079> my<00:02:06.229> spots<00:02:06.759> peacock<00:02:07.759> so<00:02:07.969> they

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
because one of my spots peacock so they

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.130 
because one of my spots peacock so they
are<00:02:08.239> like<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:09.110> smaller<00:02:09.619> profile<00:02:11.140> walking

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
are like the smaller profile walking

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.589 
are like the smaller profile walking
type<00:02:12.379> of<00:02:12.500> baits<00:02:12.709> so<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:13.970> cost<00:02:14.239> me<00:02:14.390> quite<00:02:14.540> a

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
type of baits so this cost me quite a

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.490 
type of baits so this cost me quite a
bit<00:02:14.950> but<00:02:16.599> hopefully<00:02:17.599> it'll<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:17.840> worth<00:02:18.019> it<00:02:18.230> I

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
bit but hopefully it'll be worth it I

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.259 
bit but hopefully it'll be worth it I

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
and blue emerald sort of and as the has

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.080 
and blue emerald sort of and as the has
a<00:03:23.569> weight<00:03:23.840> at<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.079> bottom<00:03:24.250> at<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.310> tail<00:03:25.790> so

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
a weight at the bottom at the tail so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.120 
a weight at the bottom at the tail so
it'll<00:03:26.359> sit<00:03:26.599> tail<00:03:26.870> down<00:03:27.139> when<00:03:27.560> resting<00:03:27.980> the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
it'll sit tail down when resting the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.300 
it'll sit tail down when resting the
water<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.959> head<00:03:30.200> really<00:03:30.620> looks<00:03:30.829> cool<00:03:31.160> to

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
water the head really looks cool to

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.259 
water the head really looks cool to
color<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.730> head<00:03:32.049> but<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:34.040> reflects<00:03:34.970> light

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
color the head but it reflects light

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.830 
color the head but it reflects light
will<00:03:35.569> flash<00:03:35.599> in<00:03:36.139> the<00:03:36.230> water<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:37.840> hopefully

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
will flash in the water and hopefully

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.449 
will flash in the water and hopefully
the<00:03:39.079> walk<00:03:39.260> in<00:03:39.380> action<00:03:39.680> will<00:03:39.829> be<00:03:39.859> cool<00:03:40.130> on<00:03:40.160> this

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
the walk in action will be cool on this

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.210 
the walk in action will be cool on this
but<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.760> looks<00:03:40.910> like<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.090> great<00:03:41.389> bait<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:42.220> I

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
but it looks like a great bait and I

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.309 
but it looks like a great bait and I
never<00:03:43.639> tried<00:03:43.880> this<00:03:44.030> color<00:03:44.269> out<00:03:44.359> partially

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
never tried this color out partially

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.289 
never tried this color out partially
clear<00:03:45.709> but<00:03:46.010> reflective<00:03:46.609> never<00:03:46.880> really<00:03:47.120> tried

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
clear but reflective never really tried

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.170 
clear but reflective never really tried
that<00:03:47.480> out<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.530> I'll<00:03:49.099> see<00:03:49.130> how<00:03:49.519> that<00:03:49.730> works<00:03:49.880> out

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
that out so I'll see how that works out

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.790 
that out so I'll see how that works out
for<00:03:50.480> some<00:03:50.840> peacock<00:03:51.200> bass

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
jig heads from TT lawyers never tried

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.640 
jig heads from TT lawyers never tried
them<00:04:07.209> out<00:04:07.390> but<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.810> looks<00:04:07.989> pretty<00:04:08.140> cool<00:04:08.290> they

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
know how you sighs one hook I guess and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.050 
know how you sighs one hook I guess and
they<00:04:30.729> they<00:04:31.479> look<00:04:31.660> pretty<00:04:31.810> cool<00:04:32.200> they<00:04:32.740> uh<00:04:33.070> they

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
they they look pretty cool they uh they

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.500 
they they look pretty cool they uh they
kind<00:04:34.270> of<00:04:34.300> look<00:04:34.419> like<00:04:34.450> a<00:04:34.570> torpedo<00:04:35.910> it's<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:37.270> never

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
kind of look like a torpedo it's I never

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.150 
kind of look like a torpedo it's I never
tried<00:04:37.780> this<00:04:37.930> profile<00:04:38.380> of<00:04:38.560> jig<00:04:38.770> heads<00:04:38.979> before

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
tried this profile of jig heads before

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.100 
tried this profile of jig heads before
I'm<00:04:39.970> guessing<00:04:40.419> these<00:04:40.540> are<00:04:40.690> going<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.870> dive

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
I'm guessing these are going to dive

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.330 
I'm guessing these are going to dive
down<00:04:41.440> they're<00:04:41.710> not<00:04:41.860> going<00:04:41.979> to<00:04:42.070> do<00:04:42.130> anything

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
down they're not going to do anything

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.980 
down they're not going to do anything
else<00:04:42.639> they're<00:04:42.729> going<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:42.940> dive<00:04:43.120> down<00:04:43.389> and<00:04:43.450> dig

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
else they're going to dive down and dig

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.530 
else they're going to dive down and dig
into<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.290> mud<00:04:44.590> because<00:04:45.250> their<00:04:45.610> head<00:04:46.210> is<00:04:46.330> more

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
into the mud because their head is more

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.710 
into the mud because their head is more
pointy<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.820> also<00:04:48.820> your<00:04:48.940> line<00:04:49.120> attaches<00:04:49.600> on

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
pointy and also your line attaches on

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.969 
pointy and also your line attaches on
the<00:04:49.840> top<00:04:50.139> of<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.070> jig<00:04:51.310> head<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:53.470> i<00:04:53.500> guess<00:04:53.770> i'll

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
the top of the jig head so i guess i'll

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.370 
the top of the jig head so i guess i'll
make<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.820> soft<00:04:55.389> plastic<00:04:55.750> sit<00:04:55.930> up<00:04:56.050> straight<00:04:56.350> in

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
make the soft plastic sit up straight in

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.409 
make the soft plastic sit up straight in
