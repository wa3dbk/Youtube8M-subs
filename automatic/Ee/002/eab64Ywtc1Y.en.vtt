00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
friend you just slide just like that now

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.170 
friend you just slide just like that now
as<00:02:40.960> we<00:02:41.080> tie<00:02:41.260> they<00:02:41.550> one<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.580> little<00:02:42.760> bit<00:02:42.940> farther

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
as we tie they one a little bit farther

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.850 
as we tie they one a little bit farther
apart<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.660> now<00:02:43.690> we<00:02:43.840> have<00:02:44.050> them<00:02:44.140> about<00:02:44.590> six

apart so now we have them about six

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.230 
apart so now we have them about six
inches<00:02:45.070> apart<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:46.690> attach<00:02:46.930> our<00:02:47.320> third<00:02:47.950> hook<00:02:48.240> in
