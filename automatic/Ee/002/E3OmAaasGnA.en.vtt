00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
ways it's a completely different subject

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.350 
ways it's a completely different subject
it's<00:02:25.080> not<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> backroom<00:02:26.010> fight<00:02:26.310> before<00:02:27.120> a

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
it's not a backroom fight before a

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.990 
it's not a backroom fight before a
fairly<00:02:27.840> modest<00:02:28.620> audience<00:02:29.069> it's<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.550> huge

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
fairly modest audience it's a huge

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.180 
fairly modest audience it's a huge
public<00:02:30.569> spectacle<00:02:31.110> at<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.319> Polo<00:02:31.680> Grounds<00:02:31.920> in

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
Brooklyn before 80,000 people when you

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.290 
Brooklyn before 80,000 people when you
look<00:02:35.340> at<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.550> picture<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.880> think<00:02:36.150> well

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
look at the picture you think well

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.140 
look at the picture you think well
Dempsey's<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> loser<00:02:37.500> but<00:02:38.010> actually<00:02:38.580> as<00:02:38.790> many

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
Dempsey's the loser but actually as many

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.730 
Dempsey's the loser but actually as many
people<00:02:39.510> knew<00:02:39.660> he<00:02:39.840> got<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.350> second

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
people knew he got up in the second

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.980 
people knew he got up in the second
round<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.220> subsequently<00:02:41.760> knocked<00:02:42.030> her<00:02:42.300> out

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
round and subsequently knocked her out

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.570 
round and subsequently knocked her out
so<00:02:43.230> it's<00:02:43.350> one<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> most<00:02:43.770> dramatic<00:02:43.980> plates

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
so it's one of the most dramatic plates

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.620 
so it's one of the most dramatic plates
taking<00:02:45.150> place<00:02:45.330> over<00:02:45.540> two<00:02:45.810> rounds<00:02:46.260> where
