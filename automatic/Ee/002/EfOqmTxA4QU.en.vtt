up<00:03:36.629> Tebow<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.519> something<00:03:39.090> that's<00:03:39.599> going

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
up Tebow that is something that's going

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.259 
up Tebow that is something that's going
on<00:03:40.140> in<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.739> back<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:41.040> my<00:03:41.069> mind<00:03:41.340> right<00:03:41.610> now<00:03:41.640> that

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
on in the back of my mind right now that

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.509 
on in the back of my mind right now that
we<00:03:42.690> could<00:03:42.900> get<00:03:43.049> Tebow<00:03:43.440> guys<00:03:43.650> because<00:03:44.280> that

we could get Tebow guys because that

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.059 
we could get Tebow guys because that
