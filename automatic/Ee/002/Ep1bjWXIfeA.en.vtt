00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.110
 a new rum that I found is called 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.700
 Closed version 5 well, first thing 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.190
 what we have to do is make the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.100
 whites we go to a says white and 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.000
 we slide to the right which is the 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 factory reset 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.520
 well then let's go back here and let's go 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.010
 a advanced wipe and we mark darwin cache 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.290
 good cache I'm going to mark all this is 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.640
 because as long as this was a rom 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.640
 frame all of them 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.850
 Well, once they are finished 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.340
 all the eggs 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.060
 let's proceed to install it let's go 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.680
 install and then we go where 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.490
 where you saved the rice 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.490
 and they install it 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.220
 Well, I take this opportunity to tell you that 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.330
 write to my channel and to a channel that 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.330
 skinny flame of the cross 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.650
 good as we see already installed the rom and 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.670
 now we are going to proceed to install the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.670
 more gaps 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.900
 well you install them 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.360
 well then once they have 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.349
 installed the gaps we go to where it says 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.349
 rebound system 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.280
 and as we see already started the bot animation 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.230
 well I 'm going to use this video so that 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.000
 do not get too long, well, as 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.510
 we see the rom and I already started 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.819
 I configured 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.069
 and then apparently 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.950
 in this very fluid 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.950
 well then if we go to the settings 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.419
 we're going to close information from 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.419
