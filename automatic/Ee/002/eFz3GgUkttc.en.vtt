I<00:03:04.920> went<00:03:04.950> out<00:03:05.430> straightaway<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.239> pick<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.540> up

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
I went out straightaway and pick this up

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.890 
I went out straightaway and pick this up
I've<00:03:07.470> got<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.769> shade<00:03:08.010> beige<00:03:08.670> 10<00:03:09.329> or<00:03:09.510> 10<00:03:09.720> beige

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
I've got the shade beige 10 or 10 beige

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.870 
I've got the shade beige 10 or 10 beige
which<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.709> same<00:03:10.859> as<00:03:10.920> my<00:03:11.190> vital<00:03:11.579> email<00:03:11.670> a

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
which is the same as my vital email a

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.520 
which is the same as my vital email a
crocheted<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.599> they're<00:03:12.690> pretty<00:03:12.930> much<00:03:13.019> kind

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
crocheted and they're pretty much kind

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.699 
crocheted and they're pretty much kind
of<00:03:13.620> exactly<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.220> same<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.730> terms<00:03:15.419> of<00:03:16.019> shade<00:03:16.290> so

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
of exactly the same in terms of shade so

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.879 
of exactly the same in terms of shade so
in<00:03:17.010> terms<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.609> color<00:03:18.599> you<00:03:19.079> know<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.680> stuff

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
in terms of color you know that stuff

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.129 
in terms of color you know that stuff
and<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.819> it's<00:03:20.970> kind<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.209> quite<00:03:21.569> easy<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.840> match

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
and so it's kind of quite easy to match

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.960 
and so it's kind of quite easy to match
yourself<00:03:22.530> if<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.919> already<00:03:23.099> have<00:03:23.459> one<00:03:23.849> of

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
yourself if you already have one of

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.819 
yourself if you already have one of
those<00:03:24.120> foundation<00:03:24.750> I've<00:03:24.900> used<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.290> today<00:03:25.410> and

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
those foundation I've used it today and

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.069 
those foundation I've used it today and
it's<00:03:25.919> definitely<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.760> little<00:03:27.239> bit<00:03:27.569> more<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.989> a

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
it's definitely a little bit more of a

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.860 
it's definitely a little bit more of a
kind<00:03:28.319> of<00:03:28.410> matte<00:03:28.859> velvet<00:03:29.310> literally<00:03:30.060> kind<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.720> a

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
kind of matte velvet literally kind of a

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.930 
kind of matte velvet literally kind of a
velvet<00:03:31.200> finish<00:03:31.500> in<00:03:31.799> comparison<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.790> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
velvet finish in comparison to the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.940 
velvet finish in comparison to the
versioning<00:03:33.359> that<00:03:33.510> aqua<00:03:33.870> which<00:03:33.989> has<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.470> bit

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
versioning that aqua which has a bit

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.300 
versioning that aqua which has a bit
more<00:03:35.090> kind<00:03:36.090> of

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
more kind of

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.309 
more kind of
Jean<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.819> bit<00:03:36.970> more<00:03:37.060> doing<00:03:37.450> us<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.900> but<00:03:38.140> only

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
Jean a bit more doing us to it but only

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.290 
Jean a bit more doing us to it but only
ever<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:38.980> slightly<00:03:39.220> they<00:03:39.489> are<00:03:39.700> very<00:03:40.090> very

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
ever so slightly they are very very

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.870 
ever so slightly they are very very
similar<00:03:40.510> but<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.440> really<00:03:42.430> like<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.670> packaging

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
similar but I really like the packaging

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.940 
similar but I really like the packaging
of<00:03:43.239> this<00:03:43.360> one<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.720> just<00:03:43.900> lots<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.560> people<00:03:44.770> said

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
of this one I just lots of people said

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.170 
of this one I just lots of people said
that<00:03:45.130> this<00:03:45.280> packaging<00:03:45.730> it's<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:46.030> lot<00:03:46.150> cheaper

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
that this packaging it's a lot cheaper

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.300 
that this packaging it's a lot cheaper
but<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.930> think<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.500> back<00:03:47.620> packaging<00:03:48.099> just

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
but I think the back packaging just

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.059 
but I think the back packaging just
looks<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.239> sweet<00:03:49.300> and<00:03:49.840> pretty<00:03:50.020> and<00:03:50.200> I'm

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
looks so so sweet and pretty and I'm

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.170 
looks so so sweet and pretty and I'm
going<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.280> test<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.580> out<00:03:51.640> for<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.910> bit<00:03:52.030> longer

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
going to test it out for a bit longer

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.880 
going to test it out for a bit longer
the<00:03:52.720> only<00:03:52.870> thing<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.080> will<00:03:53.200> say<00:03:53.230> is<00:03:53.410> that<00:03:53.590> it's

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
the only thing I will say is that it's

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.640 
the only thing I will say is that it's
incredibly<00:03:54.550> heavy<00:03:55.209> fragrance<00:03:55.660> like<00:03:56.530> the

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
incredibly heavy fragrance like the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.990 
incredibly heavy fragrance like the
second<00:03:56.980> I<00:03:57.040> put<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.280> on<00:03:57.340> my<00:03:57.400> face<00:03:57.640> I<00:03:57.790> kind<00:03:57.970> of

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
second I put it on my face I kind of

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.970 
second I put it on my face I kind of
took<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.599> off<00:03:58.720> with<00:03:59.080> bioderma<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.800> put<00:03:59.950> a

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
took it off with bioderma and put a

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.070 
took it off with bioderma and put a
primer<00:04:00.250> underneath<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.940> kind<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.209> stop<00:04:01.840> and

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
primer underneath to kind of stop and

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.860 
primer underneath to kind of stop and
kind<00:04:03.069> of<00:04:03.160> my<00:04:03.580> skin<00:04:03.880> coming<00:04:04.120> into<00:04:04.390> contact<00:04:04.599> with

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
kind of my skin coming into contact with

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.449 
kind of my skin coming into contact with
the<00:04:05.110> fragrance<00:04:05.319> too<00:04:05.709> much<00:04:05.950> because<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.340> know

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
the fragrance too much because I know

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.400 
the fragrance too much because I know
that<00:04:06.730> that<00:04:06.849> will<00:04:07.000> break<00:04:07.180> me<00:04:07.420> out<00:04:07.450> so<00:04:07.810> if<00:04:08.080> you

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
that that will break me out so if you

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.170 
that that will break me out so if you
are<00:04:08.560> very<00:04:08.739> sensitive<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.280> fragrance<00:04:09.730> then<00:04:10.000> I

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
are very sensitive to fragrance then I

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.570 
are very sensitive to fragrance then I
would<00:04:10.750> kind<00:04:11.110> of<00:04:11.230> steer<00:04:11.500> clear<00:04:11.920> of<00:04:12.100> this<00:04:12.280> one<00:04:12.459> or

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
would kind of steer clear of this one or

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.430 
would kind of steer clear of this one or
just<00:04:12.610> try<00:04:13.150> very<00:04:13.360> carefully<00:04:13.810> use<00:04:13.989> a<00:04:14.019> really

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
just try very carefully use a really

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.229 
just try very carefully use a really
really<00:04:14.590> good<00:04:14.769> primer<00:04:15.040> that's<00:04:15.370> kind<00:04:15.580> of<00:04:15.640> going

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
really good primer that's kind of going

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.090 
really good primer that's kind of going
to<00:04:16.299> protect<00:04:16.570> your<00:04:16.690> skin<00:04:16.810> there's<00:04:17.500> 33<00:04:17.889> pounds

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
which i think is the same as wisely in

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.840 
which i think is the same as wisely in
here<00:04:20.049> aqua<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:20.979> really<00:04:21.370> like<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.669> so<00:04:21.820> far

use<00:04:24.760> a<00:04:24.790> really<00:04:25.210> good<00:04:25.330> moisturizer<00:04:25.750> if<00:04:25.960> you've

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080
