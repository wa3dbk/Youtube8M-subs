type of symbol or like the world or

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.450 
type of symbol or like the world or
something<00:01:09.579> to<00:01:10.579> some<00:01:10.759> detailing<00:01:11.149> there<00:01:11.539> and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
something to some detailing there and

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.349 
something to some detailing there and
you<00:01:13.460> could<00:01:13.609> actually<00:01:13.850> put<00:01:14.240> this<00:01:14.270> weapon<00:01:16.359> one

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
you could actually put this weapon one

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.319 
you could actually put this weapon one
the<00:01:17.479> holster<00:01:17.869> here<00:01:18.170> but<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:18.619> would<00:01:18.740> stand<00:01:19.039> out

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
the holster here but it would stand out

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:27.520 
the holster here but it would stand out
or<00:01:20.329> I<00:01:20.719> just<00:01:21.049> prefer<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.439> put<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:26.109> right<00:01:27.109> here<00:01:27.170> on

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
or I just prefer to put it right here on

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.239 
or I just prefer to put it right here on
the<00:01:27.649> side<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:30.649> funny<00:01:30.829> thing<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.070> that

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.249 
the side and the funny thing is that

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:34.060 
the side and the funny thing is that
this<00:01:31.969> weapon<00:01:32.420> does<00:01:32.899> not<00:01:33.079> fit<00:01:33.380> fit<00:01:33.829> in<00:01:33.979> the

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
this weapon does not fit fit in the

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.770 
this weapon does not fit fit in the
holster<00:01:34.340> here<00:01:34.759> or<00:01:35.359> here<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:36.609> this<00:01:37.609> one<00:01:37.909> doesn't

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
holster here or here so this one doesn't

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.149 
holster here or here so this one doesn't
fit<00:01:38.899> anywhere<00:01:39.109> so<00:01:39.679> if<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:39.829> get<00:01:39.950> an<00:01:40.039> extra

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
fit anywhere so if you get an extra

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.919 
fit anywhere so if you get an extra
weapon<00:01:40.460> like<00:01:40.759> this<00:01:40.909> from<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.299> punisher<00:01:41.719> or

while<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:24.500> could<00:02:24.620> hold<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:25.010> weapon<00:02:25.430> well

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.630 
while and it could hold this weapon well
I<00:02:25.870> don't<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:27.020> this<00:02:27.170> one<00:02:27.410> at<00:02:27.530> all<00:02:27.590> and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.310 

honestly<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.760> don't<00:02:31.850> like<00:02:32.120> this<00:02:32.270> one<00:02:32.480> either<00:02:32.660> so

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
honestly I don't like this one either so

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.780 
honestly I don't like this one either so
what<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.470> did<00:02:33.560> was<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:34.010> got<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.190> weapon<00:02:34.400> from<00:02:34.640> The

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
what I did was I got a weapon from The

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.180 
what I did was I got a weapon from The
Punisher<00:02:34.940> for<00:02:35.390> example<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:39.800> think<00:02:40.070> it

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
Punisher for example and I think it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.000 
Punisher for example and I think it
looks<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.640> much<00:02:40.820> better<00:02:41.320> if<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.560> give<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.860> Red

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
looks so much better if you give the Red

know<00:06:07.639> what<00:06:07.880> we<00:06:08.030> use<00:06:08.300> is<00:06:08.539> a<00:06:08.570> lot<00:06:08.900> of<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:09.199> same

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
know what we use is a lot of the same

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.070 
know what we use is a lot of the same
body<00:06:09.919> as<00:06:10.370> other<00:06:10.639> figures<00:06:11.120> and<00:06:11.509> up<00:06:11.659> the<00:06:11.870> same
