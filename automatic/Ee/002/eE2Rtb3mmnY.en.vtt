exploring<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.410> brand<00:00:07.770> new<00:00:07.919> system<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.519> the

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
exploring a brand new system in the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.120 
exploring a brand new system in the
multiplayer<00:00:09.090> called<00:00:09.480> modules<00:00:09.809> which<00:00:10.710> offers

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
multiplayer called modules which offers

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.249 
multiplayer called modules which offers
several<00:00:11.460> different<00:00:12.059> customization<00:00:12.870> options

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
several different customization options

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.400 
several different customization options
that<00:00:13.530> enhance<00:00:14.160> each<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.360> 12<00:00:15.719> scorestreaks

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
that enhance each of the 12 scorestreaks

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.439 
that enhance each of the 12 scorestreaks
within<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> game<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.789> let's<00:00:17.880> hop<00:00:18.119> into<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
within the game so let's hop into the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.720 
within the game so let's hop into the
creative<00:00:18.869> class<00:00:19.080> menu<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.770> check<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.340> out<00:00:20.430> so

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
creative class menu and check it out so

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.779 
creative class menu and check it out so
within<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.210> pic<00:00:21.600> 13<00:00:21.900> system<00:00:22.830> here<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.519> score

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
within the pic 13 system here the score

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.089 
within the pic 13 system here the score
streaks<00:00:24.090> are<00:00:24.269> along<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.630> right<00:00:25.320> side<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:25.920> if<00:00:26.010> I

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
streaks are along the right side so if I

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.099 
streaks are along the right side so if I
go<00:00:26.130> ahead<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.640> hop<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:27.000> here<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.840> pick<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
go ahead and hop in here I can pick the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.359 
go ahead and hop in here I can pick the
UAV<00:00:28.560> which<00:00:28.859> has<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.400> base<00:00:29.910> street<00:00:30.510> cost<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:31.369> 400

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
UAV which has a base street cost of 400

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.940 
UAV which has a base street cost of 400
so<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.120> pick<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:34.110> pushed<00:00:34.469> back<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
so if I pick that I get pushed back to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.880 
so if I pick that I get pushed back to
this<00:00:35.070> menu<00:00:35.340> or<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.910> click<00:00:36.030> Y<00:00:36.390> or<00:00:36.890> triangle

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
this menu or I can click Y or triangle

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.190 
this menu or I can click Y or triangle
on<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> PlayStation<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.879> access<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.570> modules

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
on the PlayStation to access the modules

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.440 
on the PlayStation to access the modules
so<00:00:41.010> modules<00:00:41.579> again<00:00:41.969> are<00:00:42.120> different

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
so modules again are different

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.420 
so modules again are different
customization<00:00:43.200> options<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.980> allow<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.250> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
customization options that allow you to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.150 
customization options that allow you to
tailor<00:00:45.120> these<00:00:45.329> streaks<00:00:45.829> basically<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.010> your

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
tailor these streaks basically to your

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.080 
tailor these streaks basically to your
liking<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.760> sometimes<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:49.050> even<00:00:49.079> provide

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
liking and sometimes they even provide

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.459 
liking and sometimes they even provide
completely<00:00:51.090> different<00:00:51.420> functions<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.289> this

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
completely different functions for this

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.650 
completely different functions for this
streak<00:00:52.680> which<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.250> cool<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.760> some<00:00:54.510> of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
streak which is really cool and some of

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.330 
streak which is really cool and some of
them<00:00:54.780> actually<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.559> functions<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.190> were

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
them actually have functions that were

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.069 
them actually have functions that were
in<00:00:56.460> previous<00:00:56.879> games<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.390> were<00:00:57.510> perks<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
in previous games that were perks and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.740 
in previous games that were perks and
equipment<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.829> example<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.640> scrambler<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
equipment so example is scrambler on the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.950 
equipment so example is scrambler on the
UAV<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.520> previously<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.059> perk<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.809> think

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
UAV this was previously a perk I think

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.410 
UAV this was previously a perk I think
in<00:01:04.049> mono<00:01:04.199> 42<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.979> an<00:01:05.309> equipment<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.909> black<00:01:06.180> ops

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
in mono 42 and an equipment in black ops

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.600 
in mono 42 and an equipment in black ops
and<00:01:06.720> now<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.650> module<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> game

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and now it's a module was in the game

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.670 
and now it's a module was in the game
and<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:08.909> pretty<00:01:09.180> cool<00:01:09.450> another<00:01:10.140> thing<00:01:10.439> is

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and that's pretty cool another thing is

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.590 
and that's pretty cool another thing is
some<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> non-lethal<00:01:11.880> streaks<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
some of the non-lethal streaks have the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.960 
some of the non-lethal streaks have the
support<00:01:13.200> module<00:01:13.439> which<00:01:14.220> allows<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.790> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
support module which allows you to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.600 
support module which allows you to
retain<00:01:15.450> points<00:01:16.259> only<00:01:16.439> towards<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> certain

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
retain points only towards the certain

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
retain points only towards the certain
streak<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.659> module<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.229> through

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
streak if you have the module on through

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.370 
streak if you have the module on through
death<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.420> an<00:01:21.509> entirely<00:01:21.869> different

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
death so that was an entirely different

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.749 
death so that was an entirely different
system<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> previous<00:01:23.070> game<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.670> was

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
system in a previous game it was

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.240 
system in a previous game it was
actually<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.540> support<00:01:25.259> strike<00:01:25.530> package<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.159> it

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
actually a support strike package and it

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.130 
actually a support strike package and it
offered<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.060> know<00:01:27.180> completely<00:01:27.720> different

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
offered you know completely different

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.810 
offered you know completely different
streaks<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.650> was<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.009> know<00:01:29.040> weird<00:01:29.460> back<00:01:29.790> then

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
streaks it was you know weird back then

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.030 
streaks it was you know weird back then
but<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.020> really<00:01:31.350> cool<00:01:31.619> system

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
but I think this is a really cool system

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.460 
but I think this is a really cool system
and<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.390> said<00:01:33.450> add<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.140> some

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and you can like I said add this to some

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.130 
and you can like I said add this to some
of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> non-lethal<00:01:35.100> streaks<00:01:35.670> however<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
of the non-lethal streaks however the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.020 
of the non-lethal streaks however the
thing<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:37.560> modules<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.579> increase

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
thing with modules is that they increase

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.800 
thing with modules is that they increase
the<00:01:39.360> streak<00:01:39.780> cost<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.220> UAV<00:01:41.700> base<00:01:42.329> costs

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the streak cost so the UAV base costs

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.530 
the streak cost so the UAV base costs
like<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.049> said<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.350> 400<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.310> now<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.270> throw<00:01:45.509> on

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
like I said is 400 so now if I throw on

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.410 
like I said is 400 so now if I throw on
the<00:01:45.780> speed<00:01:46.259> module<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.130> will<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:47.490> cost<00:01:47.790> 450

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the speed module it will now cost 450

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.020 
the speed module it will now cost 450
and<00:01:48.840> that's<00:01:49.320> kind<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:50.009> give<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.460> take<00:01:50.640> that

is this worth it you know am I going to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
is this worth it you know am I going to
be<00:01:56.430> able<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.729> attain<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.390> streak<00:01:57.960> with<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
be able to attain this streak with the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.620 
be able to attain this streak with the
modules<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.159> something<00:01:59.969> else<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.299> note<00:02:00.479> is

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
modules on it something else to note is

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.660 
modules on it something else to note is
that<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.110> throw<00:02:01.320> three<00:02:01.740> modules<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
that you can throw three modules on at a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.749 
that you can throw three modules on at a
time<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.240> kind<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.509> crazy<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.759> sometimes

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
time it's kind of crazy and sometimes

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.219 
time it's kind of crazy and sometimes
you<00:02:05.939> may<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.360> want<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.869> because

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
you may not want to do that because

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.080 
you may not want to do that because
again<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.829> just<00:02:07.860> makes<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> more<00:02:08.520> difficult<00:02:08.729> to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
again it just makes it more difficult to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.770 
again it just makes it more difficult to
get<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.810> get<00:02:09.959> some<00:02:10.140> really<00:02:10.649> crazy

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
get but you can get some really crazy

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.500 
get but you can get some really crazy
options<00:02:12.780> going<00:02:12.989> on

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
options going on

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.710 
options going on
you<00:02:13.659> mix<00:02:14.049> and<00:02:14.260> match<00:02:14.409> your<00:02:15.010> modules<00:02:15.879> and<00:02:16.120> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
you mix and match your modules and the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.690 
you mix and match your modules and the
last<00:02:16.930> thing<00:02:17.110> note<00:02:17.409> is<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.620> modules<00:02:18.340> do<00:02:18.489> not

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
last thing note is that modules do not

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.839 
last thing note is that modules do not
cost<00:02:19.060> any<00:02:19.480> points<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.860> within<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.459> pic<00:02:21.640> 13

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
cost any points so within the pic 13

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.569 
cost any points so within the pic 13
system<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:23.470> know<00:02:23.590> when<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.950> pick<00:02:24.129> a<00:02:24.159> streak

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
system you know when you pick a streak

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.210 
system you know when you pick a streak
you<00:02:24.849> cost<00:02:25.629> a<00:02:25.870> point<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.349> costs<00:02:26.680> one<00:02:26.890> point

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
you cost a point it costs one point

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.300 
you cost a point it costs one point
however<00:02:27.909> modules<00:02:28.870> do<00:02:29.079> not<00:02:29.319> penalize<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:30.129> and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
however modules do not penalize you and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.149 
however modules do not penalize you and
will<00:02:30.430> not<00:02:30.579> add<00:02:30.879> any<00:02:31.180> extra<00:02:31.269> points<00:02:32.170> anyways

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
will not add any extra points anyways

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.520 
will not add any extra points anyways
