00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:15.000
 what a crazy fart how curly they are here 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.000
 what more grace 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.869
 I leave you a tutorial that this is 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.180
 that of nothing more and nothing less than how 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.240
 make one and I fall for emptiness I say 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.290
 a this a watch see this is the most 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.910
 compact and the more of it more as they say 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:38.220
 the more that madrid the slowest can be 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.930
 normal and good is with you as you can 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.900
 see here I am with my friends with the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.739
 assholes game that is the red gave the little 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.739
 hello and with the ok here and what did you do 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.340
 as you can see here is the repeater 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.310
 that is very slow his time is set aside in 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.409
 the pass and can serve this I do not know how 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.090
 to throw potions slowly what can 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.710
 make it much slower by putting more 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:15.220
 cobwebs here next 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:17.170
 and experience and how this works and 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.950
 how it becomes very easy we are going to start it 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.880
 From the beginning 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.880
 per day 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.969
 but he's already saying from the beginning 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.570
 what we need is any block 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:35.329
 a redstone repeater a dish 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.939
 pressure a little boat a piston and a 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.819
 cobweb we are going to put you first a 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.799
 piston turn action of you want 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.590
 this one we put a block I'm going to put it 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.310
 of this doing I have another let's 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.320
 put a pressure plate 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.450
 and what we will do is perhaps that 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.640
 what we are going to do is that at the moment 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.799
 that is here next we're going to 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:05.039
 do 1 2 3 and 1 thus forming as a 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.039
 headquarters here and we removed this 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.849
 and so what we're going to do is we're going 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.459
 to put rest here and a repeater here 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.810
 which is going to be the output or output of the 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:23.140
 sign and nothing we put to the boat here and already 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.950
 we have our finished our our 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.950
 repeater and he 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.450
 and then you are very easy to 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.549
 do the truth teach the most compact 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.550
 of all and can be slow or fast if 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:43.540
 I remove the cobweb 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.540
 it's normal it's like I do not know every second 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.650
 and I found an owl that if we put it 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.799
 well and we put a cobweb 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.909
 we wait for it to go down we wait for 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.180
 go down we wait for it to come down what there is 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.180
 wait 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.689
 you have to wait for almost low 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.689
 almost already almost almost low 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.540
 there we have a dotted repeater more more 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.520
 fast that apparently this file 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.250
 it works like a fiery and then already 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.600
 begins to lose the slowness and are 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.370
 friends 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.470
