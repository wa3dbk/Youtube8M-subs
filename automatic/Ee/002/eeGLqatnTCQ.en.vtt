guys too so looks just like that very
easy<00:01:49.340> hold<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.539> down<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.079> actually<00:01:51.200> want<00:01:51.470> it

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
easy hold it down you actually want it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.800 
easy hold it down you actually want it
to<00:01:51.680> be<00:01:51.799> close<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.070> your<00:01:52.369> head<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:52.820> then<00:01:52.880> tie

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
to be close to your head and then tie

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.109 
to be close to your head and then tie
your<00:01:54.350> hair<00:01:54.590> tie<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:55.220> can<00:01:55.490> only<00:01:55.549> get<00:01:55.789> my<00:01:55.909> thick

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
your hair tie I can only get my thick

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.969 
your hair tie I can only get my thick
hair<00:01:56.299> tie<00:01:56.509> around<00:01:56.689> this<00:01:56.960> bun<00:01:57.200> twice<00:01:57.560> but<00:01:57.890> if

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
hair tie around this bun twice but if

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.190 
hair tie around this bun twice but if
you<00:01:58.070> can<00:01:58.189> do<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.340> more<00:01:58.520> times<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:59.600> tighter<00:01:59.899> the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
you can do it more times the tighter the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.789 
you can do it more times the tighter the
better<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.780> there<00:02:03.079> you<00:02:03.110> have<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.649> have<00:02:03.740> a

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
better so there you have it you have a

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.600 
better so there you have it you have a
very<00:02:04.009> tight<00:02:04.929> spiral<00:02:05.929> bun<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:06.829> this<00:02:06.979> still<00:02:07.340> just

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
very tight spiral bun so this still just

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.789 
very tight spiral bun so this still just
doesn't<00:02:07.939> look<00:02:08.119> quite<00:02:08.420> polished<00:02:08.840> yet<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:09.560> the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
doesn't look quite polished yet so the

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.770 
doesn't look quite polished yet so the
trick<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.940> toothbrush<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.660> the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
trick is the toothbrush and the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.289 
trick is the toothbrush and the
hairspray<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:12.350> what<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.680> do<00:02:12.799> is<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.340> shake<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
hairspray so what I do is I shake the

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.320 
hairspray so what I do is I shake the
hairspray<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.049> I<00:02:15.440> go<00:02:15.680> on<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.700> sides<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.269> my

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
hairspray and I go on the sides of my

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.789 
hairspray and I go on the sides of my
head<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.950> then<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.010> actually<00:02:19.250> like<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.880> spray

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
head and then I actually like to spray

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.740 
head and then I actually like to spray
this<00:02:21.799> toothbrush<00:02:22.489> what<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.030> want<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.239> do<00:02:23.510> is

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
this toothbrush what you want to do is

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.320 
this toothbrush what you want to do is
focus<00:02:23.989> on<00:02:24.349> those<00:02:24.769> flyaway<00:02:25.519> hairs<00:02:25.849> this<00:02:26.209> is

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
focus on those flyaway hairs this is

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.839 
focus on those flyaway hairs this is
what's<00:02:26.510> gonna<00:02:26.630> make<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.680> difference<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.459> this

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
what's gonna make the difference in this

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.910 
what's gonna make the difference in this
look<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.390> make<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.780> look<00:02:30.019> like<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.739> took

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
look and make you look like you took

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.650 
look and make you look like you took
more<00:02:31.220> time<00:02:31.519> to<00:02:31.670> do<00:02:31.790> your<00:02:31.940> hair<00:02:32.120> than<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.360> did

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
more time to do your hair than you did
