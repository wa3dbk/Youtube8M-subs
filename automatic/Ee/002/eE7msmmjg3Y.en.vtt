00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
different if you look at the two

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.609 
different if you look at the two
comparisons<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.780> it's<00:01:36.780> still<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> very<00:01:37.350> fun

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619

it's<00:02:05.760> completely<00:02:06.330> completely<00:02:07.200> new<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
it's completely completely new to the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.949 
it's completely completely new to the
card<00:02:08.130> series<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.550> mostly<00:02:08.789> note<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.660> came

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
card series as mostly note but it came

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.840 
card series as mostly note but it came
from<00:02:10.200> crisis<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.740> I<00:02:10.950> think<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:11.430> think<00:02:11.730> that's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
from crisis to I think I think that's

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.190 
from crisis to I think I think that's
where<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.000> came<00:02:12.090> from<00:02:12.150> never<00:02:12.510> played<00:02:12.690> crysis<00:02:13.050> 2

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
where it came from never played crysis 2

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.840 
where it came from never played crysis 2
but<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.950> still<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.220> very<00:02:14.400> good<00:02:14.670> thing<00:02:14.790> that

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
but it's still a very good thing that

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.550 
but it's still a very good thing that
infinity<00:02:15.390> ward<00:02:15.570> implemented<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.230> into<00:02:16.470> the

infinity ward implemented that into the

infinity ward implemented that into the
game<00:02:16.850> now<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.780> negativities<00:02:20.239> there's<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.270> few

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
game now the negativities there's a few

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.330 
game now the negativities there's a few
things<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:22.020> kind<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.470> ruin<00:02:22.739> this<00:02:22.860> game<00:02:23.070> for

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
things that kind of ruin this game for

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.990 
things that kind of ruin this game for
me<00:02:23.520> first<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.360> all<00:02:24.480> being<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.350> spawns<00:02:26.000> they're

did<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.280> really<00:02:29.550> good<00:02:29.760> job<00:02:29.820> now<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.600> look<00:02:30.780> at

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
did a really good job now that I look at

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.290 
did a really good job now that I look at
the<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.620> games<00:02:31.950> Treyarch<00:02:32.730> did<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> very<00:02:33.180> good

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
the the games Treyarch did a very good

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.910 
the the games Treyarch did a very good
job<00:02:33.450> with<00:02:33.690> black<00:02:33.900> ops<00:02:34.140> from<00:02:34.290> improving<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
job with black ops from improving the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.380 
job with black ops from improving the
spawns<00:02:35.190> at<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.459> beginning<00:02:35.880> they<00:02:36.000> were<00:02:36.030> they

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
spawns at the beginning they were they

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.790

weren't<00:02:36.600> great<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:37.020> especially<00:02:37.320> on<00:02:37.530> launch

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
weren't great like especially on launch

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.890 
weren't great like especially on launch
launch<00:02:38.640> had<00:02:38.820> really<00:02:39.060> bad<00:02:39.180> spawns<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.660> think<00:02:39.810> I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
launch had really bad spawns I think I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.449 
launch had really bad spawns I think I
uploaded<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.350> video<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.769> linked<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.160> chair

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
uploaded a video and linked it to chair

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.880 
uploaded a video and linked it to chair
but<00:02:42.180> they<00:02:42.330> eventually<00:02:42.630> think<00:02:43.140> fixed<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.769> and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
but they eventually think fixed that and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.680 
but they eventually think fixed that and
the<00:02:44.550> spawns<00:02:44.790> ended<00:02:45.060> up<00:02:45.120> being<00:02:45.300> really<00:02:45.420> good

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
the spawns ended up being really good

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.750 
the spawns ended up being really good
especially<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:46.200> domination<00:02:46.739> modern<00:02:47.670> warfare

second problem is maps the maps are not
good<00:03:35.569> they're<00:03:35.930> probably<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.650> worst<00:03:36.800> maps<00:03:37.040> in

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
see five feet in front of you then you

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.050 
see five feet in front of you then you
turn<00:04:12.739> another<00:04:12.920> corner<00:04:13.340> you<00:04:13.519> see<00:04:13.670> five<00:04:13.849> feet<00:04:14.030> in

front of you turn another card or more
than<00:04:15.920> five<00:04:16.100> feet<00:04:16.280> but<00:04:16.489> still<00:04:16.729> there<00:04:16.910> aren't

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
than five feet but still there aren't

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.610 
than five feet but still there aren't
there<00:04:17.630> aren't<00:04:17.780> many<00:04:17.840> lines<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.229> sight<00:04:18.320> at<00:04:18.440> all

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
there aren't many lines of sight at all

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.650 
there aren't many lines of sight at all
like<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:19.579> places<00:04:20.090> where<00:04:20.239> there<00:04:20.359> should<00:04:20.570> be

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
like the places where there should be

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.120 
like the places where there should be
lines<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:20.989> sight<00:04:21.109> there's<00:04:21.350> like<00:04:21.500> trucks<00:04:21.859> in

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
lines of sight there's like trucks in

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.050 
lines of sight there's like trucks in
the<00:04:22.400> way<00:04:22.520> like<00:04:22.850> they<00:04:23.240> stick<00:04:23.500> trees<00:04:24.500> and

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
the way like they stick trees and

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.100 
the way like they stick trees and
construction<00:04:26.060> in<00:04:26.150> front<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.449> it<00:04:26.570> so<00:04:26.720> you<00:04:26.750> can't

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
construction in front of it so you can't

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.040 
construction in front of it so you can't
see<00:04:27.440> very<00:04:27.470> far<00:04:27.940> which<00:04:28.940> isn't<00:04:29.690> great<00:04:29.960> for

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
see very far which isn't great for

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.090 
see very far which isn't great for
snipers<00:04:30.560> it's<00:04:30.950> not<00:04:31.160> not<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:31.940> best<00:04:32.240> but<00:04:32.389> it's

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
snipers it's not not the best but it's

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.650 
snipers it's not not the best but it's
yeah<00:04:34.100> it's<00:04:34.580> still<00:04:34.850> not<00:04:34.970> good<00:04:35.120> for<00:04:35.300> submachine

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
yeah it's still not good for submachine

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.210 
yeah it's still not good for submachine
