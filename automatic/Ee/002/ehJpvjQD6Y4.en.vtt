00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Hello, cheater in this video tutorial I 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.390
 I will teach you 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.540
 remember cars strung on the roof 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.120
 car with driver and 4k on the ground 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.410
 level 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.330
 I advise you to use the foot pelvis right 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.960
 because it consumes less fps and 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.250
 more convenient than other events 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.320
 so to force 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.250
 Automobile start need to lead a team 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.980
 wand dl need tea where car 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:35.059
 after that enter the team with paul and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.610
 drive idi car as you see 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.020
 car spawn right away I will say that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.719
 car can spawn 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.550
 only empty ie without driver and without 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.399
 passengers 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.950
 It happens that some car does not 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.730
 spawn and try just a few 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.300
 If possible, Iâ€™ll give it 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.899
 a couple of examples we enter inserted go 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.899
 car 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.729
 you can now absolutely remember 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.420
 any transport cars and motorcycles 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.420

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:18.409

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.149

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:26.420

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.250
 the driver 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:34.939
 for this we need to turn on sometimes 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.549
 sound the whole post and just now 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.799

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.159
