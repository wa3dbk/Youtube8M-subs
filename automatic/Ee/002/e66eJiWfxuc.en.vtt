this<00:05:03.539> picture<00:05:04.020> in<00:05:04.169> color<00:05:04.560> like<00:05:05.340> really<00:05:05.580> nice

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
this picture in color like really nice

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.719 
this picture in color like really nice
bright<00:05:06.300> beachy<00:05:07.050> colors<00:05:07.259> and<00:05:08.009> you<00:05:08.520> know<00:05:08.639> she

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
bright beachy colors and you know she

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.029 
bright beachy colors and you know she
has<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.030> wavy<00:05:09.270> hair<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:10.050> Sun<00:05:10.410> behind<00:05:10.650> her

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
I think it would actually make a lot

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.129 
I think it would actually make a lot
more<00:05:13.259> sense<00:05:13.710> as<00:05:13.979> it<00:05:14.190> is<00:05:14.340> is<00:05:14.580> quite<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.139> light

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
more sense as it is is quite a light

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.339 
more sense as it is is quite a light
read<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.250> it<00:05:17.340> is<00:05:17.460> quite<00:05:17.699> an<00:05:18.080> uplifting<00:05:19.080> read

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.710 
read and it is quite an uplifting read
in<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.919> end<00:05:20.070> really<00:05:20.789> although<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.270> has<00:05:21.389> a<00:05:21.419> side

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
in the end really although it has a side

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.710 
in the end really although it has a side
points<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.259> can<00:05:22.289> be<00:05:22.740> quite<00:05:23.009> uplifting<00:05:23.659> okay<00:05:24.659> so

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
out of 10 I think that obviously there

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.020 
out of 10 I think that obviously there
are<00:05:30.630> things<00:05:30.930> that<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.169> found<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:32.039> couldn't<00:05:32.550> look

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
are things that I found I couldn't look

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.659 
are things that I found I couldn't look
past<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:34.050> I<00:05:34.289> felt<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.770> had<00:05:35.009> to<00:05:35.039> tell<00:05:35.340> you<00:05:35.370> about

past and I felt I had to tell you about

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.300 
past and I felt I had to tell you about
in<00:05:35.880> this<00:05:36.060> review<00:05:36.330> but<00:05:36.810> overall<00:05:37.289> I<00:05:37.590> did<00:05:38.099> think

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
in this review but overall I did think

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.029 
in this review but overall I did think
it's<00:05:38.460> a<00:05:38.550> really<00:05:38.789> good<00:05:38.940> debut<00:05:39.300> novel<00:05:39.870> and<00:05:40.110> that

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
it's a really good debut novel and that

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.120 
it's a really good debut novel and that
this<00:05:41.250> author<00:05:41.550> could<00:05:42.210> go<00:05:42.389> really<00:05:42.690> far<00:05:43.139> and<00:05:43.590> that

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
this author could go really far and that

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.969 
this author could go really far and that
