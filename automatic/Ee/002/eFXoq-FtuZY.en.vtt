00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
talk a little bit about the proportion

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.939 
talk a little bit about the proportion
and<00:00:53.930> perspective<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.550> I<00:00:57.410> had<00:00:58.410> can't<00:00:58.680> talk<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and perspective and I had can't talk to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.229 
and perspective and I had can't talk to
you<00:00:59.010> personally<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.520> i'll<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.879> make<00:01:00.059> some

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
you personally but i'll just make some

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
you personally but i'll just make some
guesses<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.829> things<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.070> we

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
guesses here one of the things that we

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.439 
guesses here one of the things that we
want<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.550> able<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.090> i've<00:01:03.210> talked

want to be able to do that i've talked
about<00:01:03.539> before<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.140> take<00:01:04.589> advantage<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
about before is take advantage of the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.370 
about before is take advantage of the
same<00:01:05.460> angles<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.270> i<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.869> able<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.170> have

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
same angles so i want to be able to have

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.600 
same angles so i want to be able to have
this<00:01:07.680> source<00:01:08.460> my<00:01:09.119> my<00:01:09.830> photo<00:01:10.830> source<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
if I want to do freehand drawing later I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.490 
if I want to do freehand drawing later I
have<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> chance<00:01:27.420> now<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.659> see<00:01:27.960> how<00:01:28.049> important

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
have a chance now to see how important

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.830 
have a chance now to see how important
some<00:01:28.680> angles<00:01:29.070> are<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.759> helping<00:01:30.119> me<00:01:30.240> create<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
some angles are to helping me create the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.260 
some angles are to helping me create the
proper<00:01:31.350> proportion<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.220> also<00:01:32.939> again

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
proper proportion and also again

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.380 
proper proportion and also again
perspective<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.189> some<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.119> these

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
perspective so as we see some of these

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.880 
perspective so as we see some of these
I'm<00:01:36.659> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> try<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.320> position<00:01:37.740> so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
I'm going to try and get in position so

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.429 
I'm going to try and get in position so
that<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.689> I'm<00:01:39.689> doing<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.229> on

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.999 
some of these major angles oh I hope I
can<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.939> then<00:01:51.950> these<00:01:52.950> are

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
can do this right and then these are

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.600 
can do this right and then these are
these<00:01:53.520> are<00:01:53.579> basically<00:01:54.299> bearing<00:01:54.990> lines<00:01:55.399> but<00:01:56.399> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
these are basically bearing lines but a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.149 
these are basically bearing lines but a
lot<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> things<00:01:57.630> are<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.619> fall<00:01:58.649> into

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
lot of things are going to fall into

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.850 
lot of things are going to fall into
place<00:01:59.369> if<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.240> count<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.840> these<00:02:01.110> you're<00:02:01.710> going

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
place if you count on these you're going

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.770 
place if you count on these you're going
to<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.219> same<00:02:02.430> attitude<00:02:03.090> again<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
to get the same attitude again the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.899 
to get the same attitude again the
perspective<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.979> able<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.250> help<00:02:05.399> build<00:02:05.700> on

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
perspective and be able to help build on

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.639 
perspective and be able to help build on
it<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> proper<00:02:07.140> proportion

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
it so that you have a proper proportion

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.889 
it so that you have a proper proportion
there's<00:02:08.250> always<00:02:08.789> something<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.360> lines<00:02:09.690> up

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
there's always something that lines up

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.970 
there's always something that lines up
with<00:02:10.080> something<00:02:10.410> else<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.220> as<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.640> carry<00:02:11.970> this

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
with something else so as we carry this

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.059 
with something else so as we carry this
through<00:02:13.610> I'm<00:02:13.940> going<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.239> raise<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.019> up<00:02:15.319> when

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
through I'm going to raise this up when

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.039 
through I'm going to raise this up when
we<00:02:16.280> are<00:02:16.430> using<00:02:16.730> our<00:02:17.000> straight<00:02:17.330> edge<00:02:17.540> we<00:02:17.810> want

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
we are using our straight edge we want

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.940 
we are using our straight edge we want
to<00:02:18.140> be<00:02:18.230> able<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.530> make<00:02:18.680> sure<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.519> our<00:02:19.900> our

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
to be able to make sure that our our

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.589 
to be able to make sure that our our
photo<00:02:21.950> source<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.879> same<00:02:23.180> orientation

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
photo source is it the same orientation

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.449 
photo source is it the same orientation
and<00:02:24.700> parallel<00:02:25.700> with<00:02:25.970> our<00:02:26.180> other<00:02:26.650> picture<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.129> I

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
and parallel with our other picture so I

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.850 
and parallel with our other picture so I
want<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.090> make<00:02:29.150> sure<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.870> everything<00:02:30.620> is

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
want to make sure that everything is

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.460 
want to make sure that everything is
again<00:02:31.730> very<00:02:31.970> parallel<00:02:32.780> with<00:02:32.930> each<00:02:32.959> other<00:02:33.290> and

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
again very parallel with each other and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.650 
again very parallel with each other and
now<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.069> have<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.459> chance<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:35.060> carry<00:02:35.360> this

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
now I have a chance to carry this

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.059 
now I have a chance to carry this
through<00:02:35.930> Oh<00:02:36.290> on<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:38.330> wrong<00:02:38.480> picture<00:02:39.069> it's

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
through Oh on the wrong picture it's

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.490 
through Oh on the wrong picture it's
easy<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.400> get<00:02:40.519> distracted<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:41.989> want<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.409> be

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
easy to get distracted so I want to be

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.289 
easy to get distracted so I want to be
able<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.829> carry<00:02:43.099> this<00:02:43.340> through<00:02:43.549> now<00:02:43.909> I<00:02:43.940> have<00:02:44.269> a

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
able to carry this through now I have a

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.009 
able to carry this through now I have a
bearing<00:02:44.659> line<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:46.269> you'll<00:02:47.269> see<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
bearing line and you'll see that the

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.160 
bearing line and you'll see that the
mouth<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:48.590> quite<00:02:49.129> a<00:02:49.160> bit<00:02:49.370> different<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:50.090> if<00:02:50.989> I

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
mouth is quite a bit different and if I

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.240 
mouth is quite a bit different and if I
carry<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.799> down<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:56.650> want<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.769> be<00:02:57.859> able<00:02:57.980> to

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
carry this down I want to be able to

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.979 
carry this down I want to be able to
take<00:02:58.459> advantage<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:59.120> same<00:02:59.390> angle<00:02:59.810> and

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
take advantage of that same angle and

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.500 
take advantage of that same angle and
I'll<00:03:00.079> realize<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.459> have<00:03:01.910> maybe<00:03:02.090> too<00:03:02.359> much

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
I'll realize that I have maybe too much

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
I'll realize that I have maybe too much
mouth<00:03:02.780> up<00:03:03.049> here<00:03:03.349> it's<00:03:03.920> really<00:03:04.310> at<00:03:04.519> that<00:03:04.549> severe

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
mouth up here it's really at that severe

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.640 
mouth up here it's really at that severe
angle<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.739> we<00:03:06.799> have<00:03:07.069> here<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.609> so<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.720> want<00:03:09.560> to

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
angle that we have here and so I want to

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.530 
angle that we have here and so I want to
make<00:03:09.739> sure<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.400> corner<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.790> my<00:03:10.849> mouth<00:03:11.150> is

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
make sure that the corner of my mouth is

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.530 
make sure that the corner of my mouth is
moved<00:03:11.989> down<00:03:12.319> I<00:03:12.790> want<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:13.879> make<00:03:14.030> sure<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.390> my

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
moved down I want to make sure that my

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.170 
moved down I want to make sure that my
my<00:03:15.319> nose<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.859> lined<00:03:16.099> up<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.489> I<00:03:16.519> can<00:03:16.700> always

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
my nose is lined up and I can always

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.390 
my nose is lined up and I can always
have<00:03:17.389> something<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:18.169> I<00:03:18.200> can<00:03:18.530> line<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.190> up

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
have something that I can line it up

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.849 
have something that I can line it up
with<00:03:19.459> maybe<00:03:19.819> it's<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.150> tooth<00:03:20.419> maybe<00:03:21.139> it's<00:03:21.410> how

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
with maybe it's a tooth maybe it's how

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.800 
with maybe it's a tooth maybe it's how
it<00:03:22.099> is<00:03:22.310> in<00:03:22.489> relationship<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.180> eye<00:03:23.239> or<00:03:23.389> a

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
it is in relationship to the eye or a

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.289 
it is in relationship to the eye or a
corner<00:03:24.290> of<00:03:24.380> an<00:03:24.440> eye<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.980> can<00:03:25.639> go<00:03:25.790> ahead<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.060> make

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
corner of an eye I can go ahead and make

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.559 
corner of an eye I can go ahead and make
sure<00:03:26.329> that<00:03:27.260> maybe<00:03:27.560> i<00:03:27.859> will<00:03:28.849> recognize<00:03:29.389> that

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
sure that maybe i will recognize that

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.780 
sure that maybe i will recognize that
the<00:03:29.720> center<00:03:30.049> is<00:03:30.079> possibly<00:03:30.620> here<00:03:31.160> i'm<00:03:31.310> just

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
the center is possibly here i'm just

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.240 
the center is possibly here i'm just
using<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.120> for<00:03:32.359> an<00:03:32.450> example<00:03:32.840> if<00:03:33.139> you<00:03:33.799> look<00:03:33.829> at

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
using that for an example if you look at

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.420 
using that for an example if you look at
a<00:03:34.280> couple<00:03:34.549> major<00:03:34.970> things<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:36.169> ear<00:03:36.410> is<00:03:36.680> quite<00:03:37.400> a

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
a couple major things the ear is quite a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.210 
a couple major things the ear is quite a
ways<00:03:37.669> up<00:03:37.880> here<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.329> now<00:03:39.169> you<00:03:39.230> realize<00:03:39.799> how

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
ways up here and now you realize how

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.849 
ways up here and now you realize how
easy<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.880> is<00:03:40.940> for<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.930> be<00:03:42.169> able<00:03:42.319> to<00:03:42.620> come

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
easy it is for you to be able to come

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:49.020 
easy it is for you to be able to come
through<00:03:42.889> on<00:03:43.549> this<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.709> make<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:47.630> ear<00:03:48.230> a

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
through on this and and make that ear a

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.670 
through on this and and make that ear a
great<00:03:50.030> understanding<00:03:50.269> of<00:03:50.989> how<00:03:51.200> you're<00:03:51.470> going

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
great understanding of how you're going

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.479 
great understanding of how you're going
to<00:03:51.859> be<00:03:51.980> able<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.930> know<00:03:53.930> where<00:03:54.169> it<00:03:54.290> ends<00:03:54.889> up<00:03:55.010> it

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
to be able to know where it ends up it

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.089 
to be able to know where it ends up it
ends<00:03:55.849> up<00:03:55.940> down<00:03:56.090> here<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:57.680> instead<00:03:58.040> of

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
ends up down here and so instead of

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.490 
ends up down here and so instead of
having<00:03:58.190> this<00:03:58.579> little<00:03:58.959> one<00:03:59.959> that's<00:04:00.169> maybe<00:04:00.379> a

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
having this little one that's maybe a

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.430 
having this little one that's maybe a
little<00:04:00.650> too<00:04:00.769> high<00:04:01.129> or<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.430> little<00:04:01.700> smaller<00:04:02.660> now

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
little too high or a little smaller now

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.869 
little too high or a little smaller now
you<00:04:03.500> have<00:04:03.859> a<00:04:03.919> chance<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.669> have<00:04:04.819> some

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
you have a chance to have some

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.659 
you have a chance to have some
confidence<00:04:05.450> that<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.470> can<00:04:06.500> capture<00:04:06.859> this<00:04:07.250> you

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
confidence that you can capture this you

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.030 
confidence that you can capture this you
can<00:04:07.879> tell<00:04:08.090> how<00:04:08.269> high<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.540> goes<00:04:08.720> too<00:04:09.139> by<00:04:09.620> seeing

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
can tell how high it goes too by seeing

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.400 
can tell how high it goes too by seeing
what<00:04:10.099> it<00:04:10.280> lines<00:04:10.489> up<00:04:10.669> with<00:04:10.940> but<00:04:11.569> as<00:04:11.750> we<00:04:11.959> get<00:04:12.199> some

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
what it lines up with but as we get some

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.140 
what it lines up with but as we get some
of<00:04:12.530> these<00:04:12.590> things<00:04:12.889> into<00:04:13.099> perspective<00:04:13.310> we're

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
of these things into perspective we're

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.330 
of these things into perspective we're
going<00:04:14.269> to<00:04:14.329> be<00:04:14.480> able<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:15.099> you<00:04:16.099> know<00:04:16.190> in<00:04:16.310> the

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
going to be able to you know in the

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.620 
going to be able to you know in the
proper<00:04:16.669> proportion<00:04:17.120> we're<00:04:17.239> going<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:17.419> be<00:04:17.510> able

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
proper proportion we're going to be able

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.900 
proper proportion we're going to be able
to<00:04:17.810> change<00:04:18.049> this<00:04:18.289> dramatically<00:04:18.829> now<00:04:19.489> you<00:04:19.549> want

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
to change this dramatically now you want

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.099 
to change this dramatically now you want
to<00:04:20.000> be<00:04:20.060> able<00:04:20.150> to<00:04:20.299> also<00:04:20.479> make<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:20.840> few

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
to be able to also make a few

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.260 
to be able to also make a few
measurements<00:04:21.380> if<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:22.400> want<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:22.820> know<00:04:22.849> about

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
measurements if you want to know about

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.600 
measurements if you want to know about
the<00:04:23.690> height<00:04:23.900> of<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.289> hair<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:25.159> can<00:04:25.310> go<00:04:25.460> ahead

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
the height of the hair you can go ahead

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.430 
the height of the hair you can go ahead
and<00:04:25.760> take

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
and take

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.320 
and take
you<00:04:27.440> know<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.710> distance<00:04:28.129> in<00:04:28.400> your<00:04:28.430> photo

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
you know the distance in your photo

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.350 
you know the distance in your photo
source<00:04:29.629> here<00:04:29.960> from<00:04:30.319> here<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.800> here<00:04:31.039> let's<00:04:31.340> say

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.839 

and/or<00:04:35.360> from<00:04:35.599> here<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.990> here<00:04:36.409> and<00:04:36.819> take<00:04:37.819> a

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
and/or from here to here and take a

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.939 
and/or from here to here and take a
measurement<00:04:38.270> on<00:04:38.479> this<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:38.990> see<00:04:39.259> how<00:04:39.740> it

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
measurement on this and see how it

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.290 
measurement on this and see how it
relates<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.370> something<00:04:40.639> else<00:04:40.879> that<00:04:41.120> looks

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
relates to something else that looks

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.529 
relates to something else that looks
like<00:04:41.509> it's<00:04:41.750> probably<00:04:42.139> from<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.860> chin<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.580> here

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
like it's probably from the chin to here

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.610 
like it's probably from the chin to here
is<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:45.169> same<00:04:45.409> as<00:04:45.680> from<00:04:45.919> here<00:04:45.949> to<00:04:46.340> there<00:04:46.909> so<00:04:47.620> it

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
is the same as from here to there so it

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.180 
is the same as from here to there so it
there<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.400> have<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:49.819> way<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.060> verify<00:04:50.389> it<00:04:50.720> and

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
there you have a way to verify it and

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.399 
there you have a way to verify it and
and<00:04:52.190> have<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:52.970> chance<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.569> get<00:04:53.780> everything<00:04:54.289> else

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
and have a chance to get everything else

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:55.749 
and have a chance to get everything else
in<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.650> perspective<00:04:55.069> now<00:04:55.190> I<00:04:55.220> didn't<00:04:55.460> turn<00:04:55.610> out

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
in a perspective now I didn't turn out

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.939 
in a perspective now I didn't turn out
right<00:04:55.819> something<00:04:56.479> happened<00:04:56.810> here<00:04:56.990> but<00:04:57.530> anyway

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
right something happened here but anyway

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.800 
right something happened here but anyway
make<00:04:58.580> sure<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.909> take<00:04:59.330> advantage<00:04:59.360> of<00:04:59.690> your

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
make sure you take advantage of your

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.469 
make sure you take advantage of your
divider<00:05:00.110> when<00:05:00.349> you<00:05:00.440> get<00:05:00.590> it<00:05:00.710> or<00:05:00.949> else<00:05:01.479> compare

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
divider when you get it or else compare

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.719 
divider when you get it or else compare
measurements<00:05:03.289> one<00:05:03.650> thing<00:05:03.949> compared<00:05:04.580> to

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
measurements one thing compared to

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.430 
measurements one thing compared to
something<00:05:04.909> else<00:05:05.150> and<00:05:05.419> then<00:05:06.020> you'll<00:05:06.199> have<00:05:06.380> a

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
something else and then you'll have a

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.129 
something else and then you'll have a
chance<00:05:06.530> again<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:07.639> have<00:05:08.539> the<00:05:08.750> head<00:05:08.900> high

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
chance again to have the head high

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.290 
chance again to have the head high
enough<00:05:09.470> she<00:05:10.370> looks<00:05:10.550> like<00:05:10.669> your<00:05:10.849> hairline

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
enough she looks like your hairline

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.240 
enough she looks like your hairline
might<00:05:11.539> be<00:05:11.659> higher<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.770> ear<00:05:12.979> in<00:05:13.159> the

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
might be higher and the ear in the

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.149 
might be higher and the ear in the
proper<00:05:13.580> place<00:05:13.729> and<00:05:14.229> now<00:05:15.229> you<00:05:15.289> have<00:05:15.800> a<00:05:15.860> chance

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
proper place and now you have a chance

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.749 
proper place and now you have a chance
to<00:05:16.460> start<00:05:17.000> adding<00:05:17.240> edges<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.349> value<00:05:19.340> with

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
to start adding edges and value with

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.279 
to start adding edges and value with
some<00:05:19.969> confidence<00:05:20.210> because<00:05:20.750> you<00:05:20.990> have<00:05:21.169> it

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
some confidence because you have it

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.189 
some confidence because you have it
constructed<00:05:21.830> in<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.580> way<00:05:22.759> you<00:05:22.819> want<00:05:23.120> so<00:05:23.479> I

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
constructed in the way you want so I

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.459 
constructed in the way you want so I
hope<00:05:24.830> that<00:05:25.039> helps<00:05:25.280> you<00:05:25.310> and<00:05:26.139> talk<00:05:27.139> to<00:05:27.169> you<00:05:27.289> next
