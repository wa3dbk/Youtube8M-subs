00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 and friends of youtube as we were 545 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.330
 located another black whistle 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.550
 its beauty is not video 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.940
 I am 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.730
 peratta 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.070
 and the renewal of tutorials that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.530
 I'm doing I had already done 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.630
 beginning of my youtube channel 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.750
 the tutorials I had done had 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.450
 remained a resolution a little low already 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.160
 that he did not have a camera like the one 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.079
 I have now 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.190
 and therefore there was much less what 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.000
 criticized that I have heard wrong that 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.380
 listened badly and should be regulated 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.670
 but what the intention carries 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.820
 equally totally free 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.910
 free pay for doing this 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.660
 so that you can 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:04.330
 you give them tutorials in order 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.330
 let's follow today's video is like starting 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.400
 on a slope on a mountain a hill 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.230
 how to start as how to start in a 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.230
 pending 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.020
 very well recently it rained 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.100
 and obviously you can notice it, let's 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.320
 see our slope 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.270
 the fact that it has rained will be more 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.810
 complicated yet 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.240
 the slope does not have 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.880
 in the slab of faults do not have the 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.280
 the bars go like some holes 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.250
 small holes the sockets by the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.590
 which water is filtered and its generates a 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.049
 little more grip for 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.540
 for those who went up but in this case 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.470
 it's not like that so I'm going to teach you 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.540
 I'm going to upload 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.520
 I will explain before climbing the mountain 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.850
 very easy 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.560
 at the moment we say by X 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.590
 reason'll wrest the mountain and 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.689
 either because you were paid for the motorcycle because 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.599
 for is in the middle of the mountain in 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.090
 end for several reasons the first thing is that 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.150
 you are going to insure the motorcycle is going to nail 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.230
 the two brakes obviously because you're 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.030
 stopped you're going to clear up the two brakes 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.010
 and you're going to put in first gear if you're in 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.260
 neutral in the first gear because 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.690
 you have to put my first gear and 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.300
 after putting the first gear 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.910
 and about a hundred the slope 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.510
 again after putting the first 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.800
 March 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.030
 you are going to 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.420
 where the club knowing that there is an actor 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.819
 what to accelerate 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.660
 in such a way a bit strong to be able 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.410
 that the motorcycle is the example I'm going to upload 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.410
 up to a point 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.319
 we cried the two brakes in such a way 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.490
 that the two brakes are left 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.380
 at the time of the two brakes 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.900
 gear first gear as already 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.120
 we have here I recommend you to be 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.880
 the two brakes obviously as it happens 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.790
 here the first march and then the 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.840
 first gear we release the clutch 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.980
 with touches on the rear tire 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:21.000
 to be able to upload simple simple 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.460
 clutch control subtlety punctuality 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.530
 in the clutch 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.790
 you have to learn to control 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.920
 very well the car of your motorcycle 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.330
 they have to learn to know what the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.290
 torque torque limit maintain that 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.930
 know your motorcycle so it 's simple 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.930
 you want to be good bikers 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.280
 they have to know the limits of a 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.150
 engine and knowing the limits we have to 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.579
 know 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.220
 the torque is a motor as is the 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.780
 inheritance of your tires in this case I 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.090
 do not key so strong accelerator because 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.200
 I was a little wet and that would generate 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.270
 what to have and then they have to 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.040
 feel 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.450
 when the tire has the point of 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.130
 torque not 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.160
 let's do it again 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.040
 we are going to repeat it again and we are going to 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.700
 apply remembering and the same thing we call 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.980
 brakes and we have to go back let's say a 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.120
 march be 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.070
 first we always start in 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.300
 first but let's say we are another march 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.340
 we are in a march as second 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.170
 neutral third quarter what are they going to 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.250
 put first as they saw hotel is a 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.910
 little complicated because I have to be a 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.690
 little balance to be able to engage 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.780
 the march but what we are going to do is 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.160
 secure with the front brake though 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.680
 front of mind tends to slip 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.810
 so for those two this is important 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.129
 but if they are able to insure with the 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.749
 back brake 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.660
 and lifting a little is a little 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:50.750
 balance to put first gear 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.000
 only if they are capable but forward brake 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.810
 so they do not lose their balance 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.440
 let's do it again 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.250
 ready to return to the fin lacuesta 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.250
 we climb 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.360
 we are here front brake if you see as 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.220
 be the front brake then we have 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.770
 that clear the rear brake because the 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.500
 weight on the slope goes back 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.780
 we are in first gear we accelerate 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.690
 we feel the eminence torque in the car 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.690
 the two sacred club to be able 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.210
 that the motorcycle has its proper traction 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.750
 that's all 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.090
 it is not more complicated and simple than much 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.650
 attention from you are very 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.320
 concentrates 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.040
 who feel the motorcycle 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.740
 I repeat it I repeat it is more I'm going to do 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.070
 a special block of this feel the 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.570
 motorcycle the essence of good driving 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.760
 friends of youtube was a pleasure as 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.430
 always speak to you today Munich or 545 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.990
 on motorcycle blogger remember to subscribe to 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.420
 my channel, I like this video if 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.580
 They liked sharing it for their 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.330
 companions 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.150
 so that I can see that my work 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:14.669
 back that free is not in vain friend 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.669
 I called you from the next plan
