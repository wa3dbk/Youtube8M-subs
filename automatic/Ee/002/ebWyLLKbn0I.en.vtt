00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.869
 hello me nothing is the pleasure of 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.640
 have you announced by if you grant 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.500
 a little bit of time how do you 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.539
 feel in this Parisian bat 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.279
 rather well I am young but there is 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.660
 also a place for young people so I 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.820
 I feel good in this group how that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.080
 happens with the coach france we are 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.150
 young is what there is a treatment 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.470
 especially me it's true that the coach 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.769
 there is a lot of talk with young people 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 players 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.760
 what do you say for example there 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.900
 gives advice whether outside 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.270
 from the field or on the ground not in the 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.750
 game we need to know what's what 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.210
 can help me 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.079
 compared to my game to me and after in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.199
 outside here he is attentive to well 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.489
 eat a lot of rest be careful 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.410
 that we do not feel too good 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.239
 it's a bit complicated sometimes but 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.860
 make sense of things not see too 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.110
 of outputs then not a little bit but 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.640
 you have to know how to dose because there are 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.820
 players who are models in not 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.539
 like a thiago motta yeah I already 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.310
 says thiago c1 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.479
 it's an example of a chance to have it 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.179
 in my team so it's easier 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.399
 to learn but after there's no 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.860
 there is not only himself marco at st 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.599
 he's a great player so he can see 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.970
 everyday people of this level 

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:28.110
 it's its profits in the meantime it's up to 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.239
 to say when you are young, you do not have to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.170
 ignite but when we are 18 years old we 

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:32.700
 play at paris saint germain 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.950
 my desire to play every game 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.330
 yeah that's clear when we had like 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 we tasted once twice after 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.239
 hard enough to stay on the bench 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.630
 or true it's like that you have to try to 

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:46.380
 to make a place and during that time 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.509
 take what we are given 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.360
 how the ancients he entails with the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.970
 new generation there for them 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.379
 it's complicated because yes they 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.509
 feel that they are not far from the end 

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:59.550
 when they told me you could be 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.890
 my son or expenses things like 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:08.550
 this for example for example no more to 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.489
 players like Alex this is the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.140
 new generation arrived but well 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.390
 a good relationship between we will say the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.530
 older and younger you 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.940
 are one of the Parisians of the team 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.110
 is it important me I think 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.730
 that it is important 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.970
 not for me, it's important 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.330
 but to evolve where I have where I have 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.100
 grown up 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.800
 nasty it's also important for 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.110
 supporters to identify to players 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.550
 of the club feel good about it from 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.680
 supporters me I think when when 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.900
 I'm on the ground or even I 'm getting 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.030
 messages on twitter or things 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.510
 like that I feel it and it's true 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.900
 pleases 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.220
 your mother played an important role in 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.380
 your career takes care of fashion 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.910
 just here since the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.230
 early she and she is near me so 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.390
 Well, that's a person I have 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.620
 totally confident 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.239
 I do not think he has anyone in 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.160
 I can have more confidence than my mother 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.380
 so not that someone a significant role 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.570
 this year what are your goals 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.090
 with bets the champion the championship 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.489
 the cup and champions league all 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.380
 won must carry small collective 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.780
 time it's all won we hired 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.950
 in all competitions so 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.540
 try to go further to 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.470
 to gain the maximum 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.560
 and then 1 in 2014 try to play 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.330
 even more so explained you are 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.130
 considered one of the biggest 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.360
 hopes of French football or their health 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.700
 does that put pressure on you 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.040
 I often hear either a precept is 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.860
 gone because playing psg so I 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.400
 am much more publicized yeah but 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.610
 in light but no it's not a 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.230
 pressure think that and the team from France 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.120
 you think so a lot of people who 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.560
 tell me about the 2014 World Cup 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.950
 me personally I think it's 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.250
 a little early but 18-year-old players 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.640
 which was good it's true but I was 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:00.739
 called in hopes at the tomatoes of the month 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.209
 of August so arrived in France team to 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.920
 less than a year later I think 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.560
 that it is a fast a little fast but 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.400
 norman two years it would be nice so the 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.030
 next world cup 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.750
 after 2014 it's yours, I hope 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.820
 by then 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.359
 already thank you in any case begs you 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.359
 thank you
