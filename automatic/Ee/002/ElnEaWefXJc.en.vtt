00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
volume down and the power and then just

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.740 
volume down and the power and then just
plug<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.040> back<00:02:32.069> in<00:02:32.310> again<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:33.269> go<00:02:33.450> ahead

plug it back in again and then go ahead

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.199 
plug it back in again and then go ahead
and<00:02:33.959> hit<00:02:34.140> try<00:02:34.409> again<00:02:34.769> now<00:02:35.400> once<00:02:35.640> we<00:02:35.819> plugged<00:02:36.060> it

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
and hit try again now once we plugged it

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.240 
and hit try again now once we plugged it
back<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.750> hit<00:02:36.900> retry<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.739> computer<00:02:38.099> will
