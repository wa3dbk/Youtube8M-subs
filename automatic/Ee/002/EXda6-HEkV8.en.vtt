00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.009
 absolute today we will parse the song 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.009
 green day called twente van gans 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.740
 the song is pretty easy so you her 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.500
 master and it starts very quickly with 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.680
 a small tune is squeezed on the third 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.390
 string on the seventh note and pinch 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.439
 on the second string on the sixth fret note 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.789
 games then just put barre on two 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.789
 strings on the bottom on the fifth fret 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.640
 knitted and play our first combination 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.640
 that is, it will 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.550
 then a short pause and already begins 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.219
 own song 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.229
 first chord d em in d minor he 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.289
 put like this the first string 1 lat 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:52.260
 second string 3 third string 2 fret and 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.140
 fourth string open 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.110
 to play it like this 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.000
 then we put in F major chord he 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.950
 put so we put 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.070
 forefinger barre on the ground 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.130
 fret we put on the 3rd string the second fret on 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.220
 fourth string 3 on and on 5 string 3 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.619
 fret barrett must be clamped fairly 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.160
 hard to sound all the notes 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:21.550
 because that's how it shouldn't be low 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:27.580
 It sounds loud and so we 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:31.840
 it turned out then in C major in C major this 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:36.810
 fifth string 3 fret 4 string 2 fret third 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.810
 open and second string 1 lat 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.140
 and so now let's play all together 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.909
 if you notice the last chord 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.429
 we play 2 times longer than the first 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.649
 cards than 2 chickens that is one by one 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.450
 each chord and the last 2 beat play 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.229
 watch carefully and watch for 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.229
 duration 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.360
 Now I will tell you a little about the fight that 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.670
 we'll all play well we put any 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.770
 jacket of the song well, let's yard 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.530
 I set and as we play slowly 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:30.210
 now showing down 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.210
 hair dryer and re 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:41.409
 understand yes and then move on 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.409
 the next court in the same way that is 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.290
 Well, you understand, learn how to fight 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.330
 disassemble first slowly and then 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.340
 raise the tempo now chorus first 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.880
 We play an introductory small such 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.760
 chord 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.340
 he put it really yes but he 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.680
 it remains a little differently put on 5 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.570
 string 3 fret and 4 and 3 5 water and pull 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.330
 respectively, the three strings are 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.520
 introductory chord he is only one 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.330
 then we put the fa, that is, we put the sixth 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.170
 string 1 lat 5 string 3 fret 4 string 3 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.800
 fret all only three top strings are playing 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.080
 we play like this 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.330
 exactly 1 and here for the same period 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.140
 you must play two times all play 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.360
 on top because it's more convenient next 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.030
 chord we will have almost the same you 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.960
 let go of the sixth string and on the fourth 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.430
 string instead of 3 frets pinch 2 play 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:58.820
 exactly what we do 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:01.970
 the next court we get is the same and 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:05.090
 we pinch it on the fifth fret the fifth fret 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.170
 5 string fourth string seventh fret and 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.960
 third string 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.820
 seventh mode 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:17.290
 same we play two times now 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:21.220
 start then go on chord with 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:25.990
 which our chorus began and we play 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.060
 its four times i.e. four lobes 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.180
 see how it's all in proportion should 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.180
 sound 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.600
 noticed some chords sound 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.440
 longer is the chord we started 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.690
 in which and sounds second time then 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.300
 we are going the same exact take 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:09.060
 this chord and move exactly two frets 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:12.210
 closer to the end of the fingerboard and play the same way 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.759
 i.e. four times 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.710
 then we swap the same position 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:21.900
 each finger on the string goes up 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:31.919
 play four times and then 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:46.349
 We put it already play 8 times and since 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:48.419
 it should sound ideally well and then 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.849
 can repeat the second time on your 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:54.440
 the discretion itself is all our whole song 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.440
 couplet you remember 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.230
 well, then the refrain after a short pause 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.170
 learn a song if you want it 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.610
