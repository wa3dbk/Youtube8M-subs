00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
national team after I evaluated the the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.029 
national team after I evaluated the the
system<00:00:47.280> last<00:00:47.460> year<00:00:47.899> at<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.110> spring<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
system last year at this spring so I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.389 
system last year at this spring so I
wanted<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> change<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.809> few<00:00:52.110> things<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
wanted to change a few things and I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.180 
wanted to change a few things and I
don't<00:00:53.760> think<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.390> really<00:00:55.110> popular

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
don't think that was really popular

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.240 
don't think that was really popular
I<00:00:57.289> don't<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:01.050> Peter<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
I don't I like I like Peter and all the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.620 
I don't I like I like Peter and all the
skaters<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.110> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.769> Norway<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.400> not<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
skaters but I think in Norway was not it

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.679 
skaters but I think in Norway was not it
was<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:07.200> time<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:09.030> continue<00:01:09.390> with

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
was not a good time to to continue with

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.230 
was not a good time to to continue with
the<00:01:09.810> professional<00:01:10.350> team<00:01:10.700> too<00:01:11.700> much

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the professional team too much

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.960 
the professional team too much
people<00:01:12.750> talking<00:01:13.409> negative<00:01:13.950> stuff<00:01:14.280> all<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
people talking negative stuff all the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.710 
people talking negative stuff all the
time

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
time

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.550 
time
I<00:01:15.750> think<00:01:16.200> national<00:01:16.619> team<00:01:17.180> is<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.810> best<00:01:19.020> for<00:01:19.530> me

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
I think national team is the best for me

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.609 
I think national team is the best for me
in<00:01:19.770> right<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:22.560> will<00:01:23.189> say<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:24.409> on<00:01:25.409> the
