00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.200 
plate will trigger the door mechanism if
you<00:03:49.350> put<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.500> put<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.800> levers

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
you put the if you put the levers

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.630 
you put the if you put the levers
completely<00:03:55.210> perpendicular<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:55.960> each<00:03:56.290> other

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
completely perpendicular to each other

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.480 
completely perpendicular to each other
then<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:58.090> takes<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.600> most<00:03:58.720> weights<00:03:59.370> but<00:04:00.370> if

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
then it takes the most weights but if

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.890 
then it takes the most weights but if
you<00:04:00.580> put<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.300> it's<00:04:01.450> just<00:04:01.630> barely

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
you put it so that it's just barely

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.410 
you put it so that it's just barely
hanging<00:04:02.740> on<00:04:03.070> then<00:04:03.610> it<00:04:03.760> would<00:04:03.880> take<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.180> least

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
hanging on then it would take the least

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.100 
hanging on then it would take the least
weight<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.870> trip<00:04:05.080> it<00:04:06.120> so<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:07.240> put<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.600> up<00:04:07.720> like

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
weight to trip it so you put it up like

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.180 
weight to trip it so you put it up like
that<00:04:08.170> for<00:04:08.710> a<00:04:08.740> heavier<00:04:09.640> dog<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:11.800> place<00:04:12.010> it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
that for a heavier dog and you place it

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.760 
that for a heavier dog and you place it
like<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:13.450> it's<00:04:13.540> just<00:04:13.690> hanging<00:04:13.930> on<00:04:14.230> for<00:04:14.740> a

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
like that so it's just hanging on for a

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.900 
like that so it's just hanging on for a
smaller<00:04:15.100> dog<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:16.720> then<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.910> slightest

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
smaller dog and then the slightest

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.500 
smaller dog and then the slightest
pressure<00:04:21.270> causes<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.570> door<00:04:23.200> to<00:04:23.350> close
