00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
a cold winter in the Northeast us so

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.140 
a cold winter in the Northeast us so
clearly<00:02:27.140> there's<00:02:27.440> no<00:02:27.650> global<00:02:28.010> warming<00:02:28.730> but

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
clearly there's no global warming but

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.930 
clearly there's no global warming but
even<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.630> would<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:29.870> factually<00:02:30.410> false<00:02:30.940> you

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
even that would be factually false you

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.970 
even that would be factually false you
would<00:02:32.120> think<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.480> after<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.440> Hurricanes

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
would think that after the Hurricanes

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.980 
would think that after the Hurricanes
the<00:02:34.220> blizzards<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.970> bizarre<00:02:35.390> events<00:02:35.840> like

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
the blizzards the bizarre events like

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.800 
the blizzards the bizarre events like
this<00:02:36.140> one<00:02:36.410> uh<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.490> people<00:02:37.850> might<00:02:38.000> think<00:02:38.060> hmm

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
this one uh that people might think hmm

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.140 
this one uh that people might think hmm
things<00:02:39.380> are<00:02:39.560> kind<00:02:39.740> of<00:02:39.800> crazy<00:02:40.100> maybe<00:02:40.820> there<00:02:41.030> is

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
things are kind of crazy maybe there is

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.940 
things are kind of crazy maybe there is
something<00:02:41.360> going<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.810> here<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.410> uh<00:02:42.440> that

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
something going on here that is uh that

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.400 
something going on here that is uh that
that<00:02:42.980> we<00:02:43.220> should<00:02:43.370> be<00:02:43.490> worried<00:02:43.790> about<00:02:43.880> but<00:02:44.870> now

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
that we should be worried about but now

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.830 
that we should be worried about but now
I<00:02:45.440> guess<00:02:45.740> if<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:45.980> snows<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.280> its<00:02:46.580> cold<00:02:46.790> uh<00:02:47.270> that

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
I guess if it snows in its cold uh that

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.300 
I guess if it snows in its cold uh that
there's<00:02:48.080> no<00:02:48.230> such<00:02:48.380> thing<00:02:48.440> as<00:02:48.650> global<00:02:49.010> warming

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
there's no such thing as global warming

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.280 
there's no such thing as global warming
and<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.520> last<00:02:49.910> part<00:02:50.240> of<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.450> analysis<00:02:51.050> which

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
and the last part of the analysis which

and the last part of the analysis which
of<00:02:51.440> course<00:02:51.470> is<00:02:51.980> in<00:02:52.490> spite<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.240> fact<00:02:53.270> that

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
of course is in spite of the fact that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.080 
of course is in spite of the fact that
worldwide<00:02:54.110> temperature<00:02:54.830> is<00:02:55.010> actually<00:02:55.730> much

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
worldwide temperature is actually much

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.700
