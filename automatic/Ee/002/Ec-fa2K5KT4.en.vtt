 videogames but there will always be those 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.910
 want to take everything to the extreme but if 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.230
 you had here is not any record or 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.200

 experienced could try to do what 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.590
 that you will see here are the most 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.260
 hardcore that ever in the industry of

 the video games have existed and all 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.199
 they are 55 reals and they have already been 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.199
 complicated nothing more to say I started 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.270
 the bling holder or by its translation the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.100
 blind egg this challenge is one of the 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.170
 most common that exist in the industry 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.930
 video games but no longer 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.850
 be less but fear this challenge 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.100
 consists of something very simple and complicated 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.470
 at the same time it is to pass a complete videogame 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.020
 such as games like the legend 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.070
 of zelda supermartes 4 crash bandicoot and 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.720
 other games totally like that is to say no 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.640
 you will see absolutely nothing of what 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.979
 passes in the game if you really finish 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.119
 game using the body's senses 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.830
 human 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.560
 there are many users but they have achieved 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.090
 but it's not as easy as it seems 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.780
 currently the record of the game blindly 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.799
 have ever invented the 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.480

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.080
 twists 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.860
 throughout the game and ending and not 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.140
 You can use a common command and 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.210

 the game absolutely the whole game 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.920
 using only one of your characters that 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.450
 means that the rest of the 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.520
 companions should be out of the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.600
 battle and you will not be able to use it to help you 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.690
 in the game 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.460

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.450
 group of a single integral 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:53.840

 first and most famous challenges that 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.260
 have employed and consists of something very 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.750
 basic to finish any game of 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.390
 pokÃ©mon only using the pokemon 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.730
 initial that there is not acquired clear 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.280
 that if you can accept the occasions that 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.409
 by obligation you should use another 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.739
 specific pokemon that during the 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:25.319

 hours 19 minutes and 13 seconds 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.019
 good hot sun fishing among the 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.719
 suburbs this is known as the challenge 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.440
 most ridiculous of all including even more 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:43.930
 that the end we are 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.480
 it is about the following and it is power 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.030
 play finish and complete in the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.700
 perfect all soul battles 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.090
 calibur part jumps but with a 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.710
 section you should only use the cane 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.710
 of fishing that had the console 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.000
 as it is heard although it is not a challenge 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.370
 very popular and too arrogant sole 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.130
 has had good results where 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.810
 currently supercor is 5 hours 12 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.810
 minutes and 34 seconds 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.250
 in 'super mario' of low points 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.829
 this is probably one of the most 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.170
 famous and not only that is the most 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.040
 times a record has been broken trying to 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.660
 overcome it with each other what it consists consists of 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.910
 in finishing the super mariobros game 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.180
 of the Danish with the least amount of 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.430
 possible points and that means that 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.920
 the flag can not be reached in the 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.050
 maximum height and there should be a time 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.690
 to have the lowest score that 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.430
 possible the record has broken several 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.500
 sometimes currently the one that has best 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:53.530
 achieved has been a score of so 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.530
 only 400 points spending the whole game 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.520
 the perfect mega man good this is 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.460
 considered by many as the most challenging 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.590
 difficult even impossible that it has 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.440
 ever put a player to perform 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.330
 as its name indicates it consists in 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.140
 end with a megaman game of 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.970
 Danish without receiving a single damage and 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.530
 only get to think that 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.690
 try a game of Megamall 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.780
 old school you will realize that 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.400
 It is not a challenge, just the people who 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.470
 have tried to achieve this feat are 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.820
 really very few and the current record 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.310
 it is 23 hours 12 minutes and 45 seconds 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.470
 the oil notice the person who succeeded 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.470
 he did not try thousands and thousands 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.000
 the master ninja when you think that the 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.650
 Dementia mental health or sanity 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.690
 of a person can not get beyond 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.720
 does not appear someone who comes up 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.060
 next challenge time day happens in a 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.590

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.200
 hurt 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.840

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.010
 you could make this possible or even more 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.830

 all the flight 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.470
 you imagine trying on the difficulty 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.400
 highest in the game 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.889

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.139
