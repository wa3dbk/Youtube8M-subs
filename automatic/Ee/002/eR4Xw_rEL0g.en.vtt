 hello friends of smart tips 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:39.300
 we have a new video featuring 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.260

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.540
 remote from the TV 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.550
 [Music] 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.390
 we are also here with a set of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.690
 wireless keyboard and mouse right 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.140
 where this adapter connects with 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.150
 the TV and communicates with the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.309
 keyboard or mouse you could also 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.799
 use a keyboard and a mouse I trust the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.500
 However, here the mouse is 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.380
 wireless keyboard is quite like you 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.049
 can stay further on your sofa and have 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.360
 a legal scope and it is the framework that you 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.640
 want to do this with the mouse and keyboard with 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.650
 wire you will need there has extension 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.750
 usb and end up longer to power 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.770

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:53.909
 moments in pro mouse and keyboard are 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.179
