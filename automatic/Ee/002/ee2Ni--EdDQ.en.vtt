this without the end I would actually

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.490 
this without the end I would actually
stay<00:01:22.149> on<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.570> shock<00:01:22.810> because<00:01:23.020> it's<00:01:23.170> threaded

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.810 
know from the original concept was
making<00:01:52.719> it<00:01:52.840> easy<00:01:53.020> for<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.409> air<00:01:53.590> seals<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.670> be

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
making it easy for the air seals to be

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.849 
making it easy for the air seals to be
rebuilt<00:01:55.210> without<00:01:55.479> getting<00:01:55.780> into<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.439> damping

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
rebuilt without getting into the damping

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.980 
rebuilt without getting into the damping
portion<00:01:57.280> of<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.490> shock<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:58.539> double<00:01:58.840> barrel

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
portion of the shock the double barrel

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.200 
portion of the shock the double barrel
doesn't<00:01:59.409> need<00:01:59.590> as<00:02:00.219> much<00:02:00.399> service<00:02:00.850> as<00:02:01.030> some

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
doesn't need as much service as some

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.730 
doesn't need as much service as some
other<00:02:01.329> shocks<00:02:01.630> in<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.840> industry<00:02:02.259> but

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
other shocks in the industry but

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.669 
other shocks in the industry but
obviously<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.280> air<00:02:03.399> seals<00:02:03.729> will<00:02:03.909> need<00:02:04.060> more

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
obviously the air seals will need more

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.020 
obviously the air seals will need more
service<00:02:05.679> and<00:02:05.829> attention<00:02:05.920> than<00:02:06.460> will<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.729> oil

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
service and attention than will the oil

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.359 
service and attention than will the oil
seals<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.509> so<00:02:07.960> we<00:02:08.050> made<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.259> possible<00:02:08.500> for<00:02:08.860> all

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
seals and so we made it possible for all

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.420 
seals and so we made it possible for all
of<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.759> air<00:02:09.910> seals<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.390> be<00:02:10.509> rebuilt<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:12.250> is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
of the air seals to be rebuilt this is

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.910 
of the air seals to be rebuilt this is
the<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.940> main<00:02:13.090> piston<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.690> it's<00:02:13.920> removable

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
the the main piston and it's removable

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.809 
the the main piston and it's removable
by<00:02:15.220> three<00:02:15.849> bolts

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
by three bolts

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.750 
by three bolts
so<00:02:17.209> as<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.840> gets<00:02:18.110> pulled<00:02:18.469> off<00:02:18.590> all<00:02:18.829> of<00:02:19.640> the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
so as that gets pulled off all of the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.220 
so as that gets pulled off all of the
air<00:02:19.879> seals<00:02:20.120> can<00:02:20.329> get<00:02:20.510> pulled<00:02:20.719> off<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.019> shock

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
air seals can get pulled off the shock

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.959 
air seals can get pulled off the shock
replaced<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:21.890> rebuilt<00:02:22.189> without<00:02:22.459> opening<00:02:22.879> up

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
replaced and rebuilt without opening up

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.309 
replaced and rebuilt without opening up
the<00:02:23.030> damper<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.780> that's<00:02:23.930> something<00:02:24.140> that

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
the damper and that's something that

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.380 
the damper and that's something that
will<00:02:24.500> be<00:02:24.590> very<00:02:24.849> straightforward<00:02:25.849> for<00:02:26.359> a

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
will be very straightforward for a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.929 
will be very straightforward for a
service<00:02:26.719> center<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.049> take<00:02:27.200> care<00:02:27.409> of<00:02:27.939> the

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939

double<00:02:29.329> barrel<00:02:29.480> air<00:02:29.750> shock<00:02:29.989> will<00:02:30.170> come<00:02:30.349> in

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:30.469 
double barrel air shock will come in

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.369 
double barrel air shock will come in
nine<00:02:30.650> different<00:02:30.980> sizes<00:02:31.400> from<00:02:31.959> two<00:02:32.959> inches<00:02:33.200> of

half inches of stroke in the various

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
eye-to-eye links to accommodate those

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.470 
eye-to-eye links to accommodate those
strokes<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:39.129> it<00:02:40.129> has<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:41.120> pretty<00:02:41.510> large<00:02:41.920> main

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
strokes and it has a pretty large main

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.660 
strokes and it has a pretty large main
main<00:02:44.480> air<00:02:44.750> piston<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:46.010> pretty<00:02:46.219> large<00:02:46.370> air

main air piston and a pretty large air
volume<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.269> so<00:02:47.420> we'll<00:02:47.599> operate<00:02:47.989> at<00:02:48.109> a<00:02:48.200> lower

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:48.469 
volume and so we'll operate at a lower

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.490 
volume and so we'll operate at a lower
air<00:02:48.950> pressure<00:02:48.980> than<00:02:49.670> most<00:02:49.819> other<00:02:50.090> shocks<00:02:50.500> that

barrel Aero or a DB air would be a
better<00:03:39.889> choice<00:03:40.129> in<00:03:40.400> those<00:03:40.819> circumstances<00:03:41.540> and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
better choice in those circumstances and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.089 
better choice in those circumstances and
some<00:03:42.139> people<00:03:42.349> are<00:03:42.440> just<00:03:42.590> going<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.769> always

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
some people are just going to always

prefer that linear feel that a coil

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.890

provides<00:03:45.799> so<00:03:46.220> we<00:03:46.849> really<00:03:47.120> didn't<00:03:47.479> want<00:03:47.510> to

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
provides so we really didn't want to

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.229 
provides so we really didn't want to
make<00:03:48.079> the<00:03:48.229> price<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:49.370> decision<00:03:49.760> factor<00:03:50.180> it

make the price the decision factor it
was<00:03:50.359> really<00:03:50.720> what<00:03:51.049> sort<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.319> feel<00:03:51.590> do<00:03:51.739> you<00:03:51.829> want

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
was really what sort of feel do you want

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.549
