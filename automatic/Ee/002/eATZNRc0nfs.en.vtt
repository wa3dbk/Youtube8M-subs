still<00:04:18.880> even<00:04:19.450> though<00:04:19.480> I<00:04:19.540> saw<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.430> it's<00:04:21.430> a

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
still even though I saw it and it's a

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.130 
still even though I saw it and it's a
lot<00:04:21.609> like<00:04:21.730> battlefield<00:04:22.240> but<00:04:22.390> of<00:04:22.540> call<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:22.780> duty

the<00:05:22.490> frame<00:05:23.030> rates<00:05:23.240> at<00:05:23.389> 30<00:05:23.750> frames<00:05:24.080> per<00:05:24.290> second

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
the frame rates at 30 frames per second

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.770 
the frame rates at 30 frames per second
like<00:05:24.710> battlefield<00:05:25.160> and<00:05:25.910> not<00:05:26.120> as<00:05:26.240> fast<00:05:26.450> as<00:05:26.630> the

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780
