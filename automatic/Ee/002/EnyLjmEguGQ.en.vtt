00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.949
 That 's it, people. 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.970
 will be vanquished come well in this video I will 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.800
 is talking 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.650
 some secrets I discovered for the 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.079
 people being able to work the burn 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.770
 of body fat without mass loss 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.850
 muscular 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:37.300
 right the first secret is the babies and the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.700
 down the amino acids for whom 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.800
 does not know that the amino acid addition of 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.089
 branched chain ne 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.449
 the leucine isoleucine and valine 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:52.809
 amino acids are the sound substances that the 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.249
 body can not manufacture, then the 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.320
 people need somehow this 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:58.629
 putting it in the body 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.819
 there we find a way too 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:05.830
 practice are the high supplements 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.990
 levels of bcaa or the more 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.790
 amount of babies and you can 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.760
 put in your body 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.090
 our body manages to conserve 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.680
 save the glutamine as it is also a 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.070
 amino acid which is the main nutrient 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.189
 for the growth of the musicians in this 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.509
 of muscle fibers and thus 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:31.960
 prevent our body from using the 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.060
 protein reserves that are right 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.820
 contained in our body that 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.710
 turn it into energy that okay 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.420
 happens when you get a long 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.430
 without without the basic consumption of 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.840
 carbohydrate and fat your body 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.630
 understand that you are living a moment 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.939
 of food shortages and ends up 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.799
 storing fat reserves in your 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.780
 body for an opportune time to 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.479
 when you need it most 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.539
 is using this fat energy as 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.759
 from this source of energy to 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.759
 that you stay alive 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:11.740
 sure the destination beyond that function 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:14.200
 of assisting in the in the in the conservation 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.290
 of the glutamine stock it serves as 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.420
 fuel also when our 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.670
 body goes through a good period price 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.400
 intensity of training than what the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.960
 people do it, it prevents catabolism 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.930
 when you 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.300
 in Jerry the babies and the level of 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.260
 serotonin which is a neurotransmitter that 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.260
 warns us when fatigue is muscular 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.230
 happens it is reduced and helps maintain 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.150
 so train when you take a 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.040
 commercial in the pre workout you end up having 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.730
 a longer workout more productive 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.060
 right 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.520
 the supplement it is well is not cheap that 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.920
 is a segment that is not cheap but that is 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.870
 fundamental for both who is 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.480
 wanting to gain muscle while 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.270
 for those who want to lose body fat 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.580
 without losing muscle mass 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.130
 understands this really is this supplement 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.470
 it is fundamental 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.570
 and so if you do not have money for mother 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.250
 to buy bca and you stop 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.620
 buy then just for training 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.430
 stop buying creatine but you have 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.610
 that having the basics is good to go pro has 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.560
 to obey and preferably 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.750
 glutamine to glutamine because the day of 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.940
 preferably you because not too 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.300
 in our body is capable of producing the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.150
 glutamine but not to sufficient levels 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.400
 For you have hypertrophy your time. 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.230
 muscle growth is that it is 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.380
 suitable for you so if you 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.190
 can is to buy the basics and is a 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.130
 protein bca and glutamine and I found it 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.100
 What are you going to do after training? 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.740
 hi protein glutamine and you have to 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.490
 consume at least 5 to 10 grams of bcaa 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.200
 in the morning 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.350
 This is the main secret you have to 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.810
 take in the morning because during the day 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.640
 you will prevent catabolism us 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.280
 has a very large energy expenditure 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.270
 during the day besides spending in training 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.300
 during training 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.820
 So you take the bca in the morning. 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.520
 to avoid that during the day your body 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.890
 uses the protein reserves of your 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.650
 of its muscle fibers as energy 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:27.010
 until half an hour before working out five more 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.320
 grams of bcaa and after the most 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.840
 five grams or bcaa depending on the 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.620
 weight can reach up to 10 or 15 grams of 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.660
 and if this is the main tip that 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.280
 I have beauty today and no more 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.290
 if you can include a thermogenic alone 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:48.080
 there may also include 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:51.140
 and another thing is studies show that the 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.600
 consumption accelerates the 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.780
 lack of fat in the tissue 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.430
 adipose so it's another secret that I 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.170
 I'm sharing with you and I have 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.320
 worked well for me when I started 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:06.230
 to consume bca in this way and when I 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.230
 also I started to put on my the the diet 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.580
 the calcium tablets and as I 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.920
 I put it here on the second or third 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.590
 video impressively I can 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.860
 have fat loss results very 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.630
 larger and with much more speed 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.080
 some other thing 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.240
 caffeine it eliminates gives the effect 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.850
 good part of the calcium effect does not 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.710
 it means you're going to stop 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.050
 take calcium when you consume 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.310
 caffeine is not it but it's good you know 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.580
 that this will happen 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.310
 the effects of calcium on slowness 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.560
 fat in adipose tissue he 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.600
 happens more quickly 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.120
 when you're not consuming caffeine 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.120
 beauty then this is it guys chicken 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.950
 united will never be defeated and then there 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.090
 doing more research and more videos to 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.060
 people can have the result that people 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.060
 I want to say the big hug of the chicken honey.
