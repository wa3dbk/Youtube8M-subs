00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.790
 that saw him today a video on the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.150
 loquat germany but this pilot 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.660
 Germanic to be so qualified as 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.670
 Germany 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.870
 not to be confused with the loquat 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.279
 japan the parade of japan is that one 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.570
 of trees so it's not the same 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.750
 foliage the foliage is much more 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.699
 big and the loquat of Japan in addition to 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.619
 beware of evergreen foliage 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.189
 unlike the German related challenges 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.420
 who loses his leaves in winter 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.850
 here to compare that is the sheet 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.899
 of the girl's nose is from Japan and hop 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.790
 and here we have the mistrust also 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.780
 right next so the unify sheet 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.329
 from Japan we can see that she is 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.059
 much bigger than the nest 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.670
 finally as his name indicated it the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.850
 medpi luce germanica comes from 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.500
 of Asia Minor actually this is actually this 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.710
 are the Romans who imported it in 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.710
 Europe 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.000
 Here is a great tree for 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.109
 natural gardens permaculture this 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.280
 that I like not to spend too much 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.899
 treatment in their garden since 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.309
 it is a tree that is hardly 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.170
 never sick actually it is very 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.880
 resistant 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.200
 he has very few problems with 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.000
 diseases or parasites 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.080
 so it's a very good tree for 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.700
 people who do not like to treat too much 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.380
 the gardens which is nice too with 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.610
 the loquat is that it does not need to 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.320
 size in fact there is no need to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.610
 size of all just now and then in 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.090
 the egg the dead branches and that's enough 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.400
 widely 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.860
 there is no need to cut it 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.020
 so it was not bad I like it 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.760
 so here is the enormously enormously 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.500
 more no need of that he did not 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.320
 need of treatment it produces 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.540
 leaves in winter he lives a hundred and fifty 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.550
 years so you have for a small 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.810
 moment there is another thing that it's not 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.150
 also said is that it is self-fertile 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.450
 so only one tree in the garden 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.220
 is largely enough it self polynesia itself 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.650
 jump to the fact that we are so suddenly 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.150
 no need to have a second 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.590
 so we finally have November we see that 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.660
 leaves start to yellow a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.910
 little bit runner actually he's going 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.369
 lose her leaves running the month of 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.910
 December at the same time as the fruits 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.320
 will be ready to be eaten and so here 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.720
 the presence still towards a little bit 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.330
 yellow after all will become young it's 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.470
 pretty pretty me I find the young aussie 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.480
 so the fruits of a girl and eats 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.709
 bhl is actually we have to wait until the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.810
 first jellies that are passed on 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.810
 so usually here it's December 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.900
 to describe a little bit the taste of 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.600
 fruit I would say it's a cross 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.070
 between the apple and the pear and then that's 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.610
 a little bit the consistency of a 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.500
 compote 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.239
 so we'll say we have the impression of 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.549
 eat a little bit of apple compote 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.290
 pears with any stones 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.000
 interior 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.980
 this tree also produces an excellent 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.500
 wood actually who is who is very very 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.730
 apparently appreciated by the carpenters 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.650
 for its quality 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.959
 he also makes excellent runs at 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.459
 tools so it's also interesting to 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.640
 know you can have an excellent 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.190
 wood with this tree the dance increased 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.570
 of unifoliates there are several seeds and 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.010
 so these seeds can be received 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.260
 on the other hand, they are sometimes quite 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.519
 slow sprouted they can never of the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.930
 first year but sometimes it takes 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.160
 wait two years for her to 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.140
 soften and it can germinate 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.420
 so it's sometimes a bit long 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.650
 so me what I would advise you to 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.350
 do it either we will put several 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.670
 in pots with a little potting soil and 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.870
 to leave out for two years and 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.580
 to wait to see a little what germinate 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.489
 either put it directly in full 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.989
 soil and cover them with mulching and 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.000
 to identify the areas for not the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.100
 trampling and even wait two years of 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.209
 see a little bit what will come out 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.680
 so that's the disadvantage so if we 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.930
 part from sowing this makes a 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.430
 disadvantage is that it pushes him in 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.070
 made on a sandy and rather dry soil 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.610
 me here I am a rather clay soil 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.130
 and wet 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.480
 suddenly 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.010
 In these cases, it is better to 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.320
 you favor me the transplant on 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.730
 hawthorns 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:46.190
 that's like for many trees in 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.540
 does more direct seeding that's 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.090
 we're going to have more roots 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.350
 deep tracers actually that are going 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.300
 go down much deeper into the ground they 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.530
 will be much more autonomous level of 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.730
 water when no need for watering that 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.650
 will be much more resistant who 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.240
 will live older by cons we are not 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.130
 not sure at all of the quality of the 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.410
 variety that we will have then that if we 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.500
 grafts we will have exactly the 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.600
 same variety as the graft 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.760
 so and we can also if we have a floor 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.230
 sandy and rather dry and that variety 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.670
 obtained from seedlings 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.880
 we do not agree we can also 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.920
 after grafting on the small 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.160
 kernel that had been summoned which allows 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.300
 to have the benefits of both I hope 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.820
 do not get too confused with 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.440
 the strike of history and seedlings 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.960
 anyway be careful i will make a video a 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.790
 day one of these 4 devoted precisely to the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.890
 multiplication reproduction of 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.510
 plants so talk a little about this mets 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.900
 a bit of transplant versus trees 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.730
 fruit 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.280
 this is really not the purpose of the 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.350
 video the goal of this mini video is 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.770
 to do a little pub for the loquat 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.990
 German to finish this video 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.280
 I'm trying to do a little recap 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.920
 so it's a tree from asia 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.390
 that at a very slow growth that can 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.490
 measure up to 6 meters and live 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.970
 up to one hundred and fifty years it produces 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.450
 fruits 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.400
 excellent in winter in December it is 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.320
 self fertile it also produces 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.610
 wood for the tools it does not need 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.890
 of treatment he does not need to 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.440
 size it can be sown also 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.390
 spoken by the seeds can be grafted 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.610
 and then here is an excellent little 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.640
 fruit tree I advise you to 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.070
 all ciao ah yes I will finish this 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.390
 video like that in fact i'm going to answer 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.920
 to a question that I am asked more 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.460
 more often actually I do not have any 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.350
 Facebook 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.640
 I do not have a twitter because I 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.040
 think these networks are a little bit 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.660
 too time- consuming among others so here we go 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.080
 I do not take care of facebook or 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.090
 twitter 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.950
 so that's reindeer me looking for you do not me 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.950
 will not find and then that's it
