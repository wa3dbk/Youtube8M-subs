00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:08.650
 hello good we are going to 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.610
 represent how energy circulates 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.500
 through electrical circuits 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.699
 in this opportunity we are going to represent 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.090
 a simple electrical circuit and in turn 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.380
 how it transforms from one energy to another 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.650
 and there we can expand the elements 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.640
 basic of a logic circuit that are 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.820
 the sources that are the piles the cables 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.540
 drivers the resistance that can be 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.260
 in this case the motor or a vial and 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.150
 the switch that interrupts the passage of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.320
 Energy 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.079
 this would be an ornament that we are going to 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.540
 use for you to see how 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.890
 this engine works 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.090
 well here we go as transformed into 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.570
 Energy 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.729
 that would be the energy stored in the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.540
 batteries 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:12.909
 to the electrical energy that is produced 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.909
 by the Countryside 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.460
 and well here we are going to unite the 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.460
 Drivers to the damn 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.130
 to ignite 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.320
 as you can see here we can see 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.780
 that the light has turned on since it has 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.409
 transformed into energy and it has 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.409
 pierced the energy of the batteries 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.190
 to the vial that is also a 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.720
 transformation 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:02:00.110
 of stored chemical energy 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 they are nothing more batteries and has been 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.570
 transformed into an electric power 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.840
 to turn on the light in the next 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.840
 experiment we can appreciate how 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.480
 transforms stored chemical energy 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.620
 in the piles so that it occurs 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.370
 mechanical energy 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.560
 As you can see you have to connect a 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.610
 cable to the positive side 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.310
 and to our other cable to the other pole that 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.090
 is the negative so this can 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.090
 work well 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.080
 As you can see our engine starts to 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.610
 work but if we put this on it 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.760
 can appreciate better 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.050
 here we see how the chemical energy of 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.069
 the piles occurs in the diameter 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.609
 mechanics 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.609
 what 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.470
 this is what is generally used 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.810
 in paris in several 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.100
 well here we can represent another 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:13.690
 way that is for the common to be attentive 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:17.650
 and still standing is a switch for 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.230
 that interrupts the electricity and here what 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.720
 we connect and as you see it went on but at 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.000
 turn and from the rods we can see that 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.470
 you can also turn it off 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.160
 then there we can control the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.160
 electricity 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.270
 these would be the experiments that 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.300
 we did show today and thanks for 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.380
 have visited us 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.840
 also good thanks all this was 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.790
 thanks to the suitcases that we have to 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.780
 be implemented to do this 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.480
 experiment and also the school we have 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.940
 six electric suitcases that come all 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.020
 the basic implements to make a 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.460
 simple electrical circuit 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.460
 Bye thanks
