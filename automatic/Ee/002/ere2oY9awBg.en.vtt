00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.700
 hello you have always let project 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.950
 found 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.470
 this consists of many and you 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.560
 you can click here in the credits 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.300
 or also within the videos at the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.009
 one or the other put a link 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.009
 find to background information 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:42.870
 Now we want to join us more 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.660
 derive from the new system of nazi 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.350
 We deal with sticks 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.880
 the one or the other motta video or 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.640
 tutorial already seen 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.140
 There are several machines here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.810
 this is not what is here for now 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.110
 a person and changed that has me 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.570
 just made 90 power supply to 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.640
 I also have this energy receptor 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.010
 already described I would you 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.790
 describe something that you certainly 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.790
 helps to configure the system better 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.160
 and handle and that is when 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.610
 her husband's inventory will be back 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.270
 imprints your network so network again 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.940
 do 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.040
 this network tool man that with the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.860
 right mouse button I here on such a 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.500
 Machine sounds then arise there 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.840
 information over the network, the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.600
 surely your food still knows where you are 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.250
 just clicked on the controller 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.850
 has and you've got this information 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.100
 seen 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.630
 nothing else makes this thing easy 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.400
 only that it is more expensive so I mean 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.200
 as I said with coal appears on 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.659
 to be more expensive on the trip 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.100
 want 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.380
 and so you do not have much here now 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.200
 Much more was the later though 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.370
 list gets longer and this system 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.750
 overall, it will not be possible to get bigger 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.680
 social slider that you can wander through 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:12.260
 can and will we have up here so 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.050
 stockbauer maximum power as well 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.440
 strong and and that you've had so the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.630
 consumption and energy energy generation 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.760
 is just here and that is not very 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.980
 a lot of 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.350
 that was only a part now is yet to come 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.950
 Another step you took with her 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.209
 this tool has and if so now 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.769
 not even such a machine developed 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.910
 you can just get out elsewhere 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.010
 that does not really matter 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.840
 then I can do the same thing she needs 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.209
 not good, though 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.099
 also the cpu should be where to go 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.610
 network and we can see that 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:50.900
 components of the network if one 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.200
 now taken right-click with nick 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.510
 then this is what will do then 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.879
 so to speak, as you said human, so that's it 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.349
 Again, this may be a pleasure 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:06.260
 right click then you need something from that 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.780
 Of course, things are going on here, too 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.720
 that is another function that is 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.540
 a kind of smart person always wants to 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.450
 and a little different if you see them 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.790
 now here almost on the open air 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.569
 click on it or so then sacrifice 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:27.069
 right way then comes here so a 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.629
 a gui graphical user interface 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.069
 conditions 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.849
 and there you can such upgrades 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.920
 cramming 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.860
 but that is not really 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.769
 there for this tool in this form 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.700
 but that is there for that 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:46.160
 she averted it in which parts 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.410
 for example export bass keyboard bass 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.389
 or something or the partie bass that you 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.910
 get faster or that with 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:58.220
 redstone controllable and what and will that be 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.660
 is now here as burn face control 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:08.630
 Visibility profinet for tui from youtube 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:12.049
 that is now proud of the art and 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.169
 wise, such upgrades could always be yours 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:18.349
 with you and would not now the 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:20.840
 things always have imola rest and so that 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:23.000
 but in the end it is like this 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.550
 that certain functions are simple 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.490
 finished and then the hand remain 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.180
 directs paid, that is, unchanged 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.220
 these 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.449
 Function is actually little or very 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.729
 be well used 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.110
 unless you are constantly building yours 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.380
 then around you can see the upgrades 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:43.490
 me too far 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.979
 that was it first of mini was short 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.940
 tutorial that went to this ad-hoc 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:52.880
 Great and if he has more to the system 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.940
 So you want to know about the new one 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.340
 This appliance energy sticks have 2 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.590
 I have a special playlist as well as us 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.870
 but always longer and for so long 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.680
 still information missing with you 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:10.190
 this is already one or 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.919
 other tutors and otherwise 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.979
 there looks important body of this video 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.650
 so I'll look at you 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.630
 interest meets and is above all 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.550
 the channel or best we do 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.080
 to when you bring that already has the 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.660
 I think it was really great 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.880
 like female like videos or something 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.979
 want to see more fluid then always 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.020
 if I he will then bring out large 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.389
 He was not informed automatically 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.050
 The main thing is that we have something 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.820
 New chamber flicker otherwise finds 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.539
 you always left here in mine 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.820
 tutorials denote that box 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.639
 can just jump to the one or 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:53.289
 other that would be okay so far 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.289
 first short and short until then
