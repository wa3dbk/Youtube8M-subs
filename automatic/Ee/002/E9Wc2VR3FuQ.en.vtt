 half to cellular internet video games 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.019
 a millenary tradition attempts to

 attract the attention of this new universe 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.170
 childlike 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.690
 the avant-garde news was to meet a circus 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.300
 which has its origins back there in the 80's 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.060
 artists from the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.050
 partnerships with famous characters through 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.050
 to renew 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.590
 forget the sand of the arena here 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.180
 center of attention is a stage with a 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.180
 well-known class 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.170
 the creations of Mauricio de Sousa are 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.300
 there but there are no circus artists and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.850
 until the time comes for the show is in 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.940
 scenes that art happens 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.260
 eyes careful not to miss the dash 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.570

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.380
 after all these girls are not new to this 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.700
 branch and wool brothers country without movement 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.740
 Since I was little, I got money for me. 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.830
 I was born in the circus in my entire family 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.220
 It's traditional circus and I ended up 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.840
 discovering a juggler after 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.759
 Over the years we play the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.319
 circus in the child and there it is 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.899
 I have been a part of a traditional family since 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.780
 small but aerial even makes some 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.899
 six years in the dressing room and one side 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.420

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.819

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.390
 clown but carito what is it like to look in the 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.250
 mirror and see this transformation is 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.520
 rewarding because you know you 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.200
 then it will be seen with other eyes and 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.300
 people will imagine a world of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.300
 fantasy behind that mask 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030
 ah 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.820
 this circus was founded in 2004 the group 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.740
 holds a show in the capital and this 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.680
 who runs the country on tour 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.500
 the structure is great over here are more 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.780
 of 120 costumes and many professionals 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.820
 on cast part are around 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:26.310
 about 40 people and a plus 40 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.220
 people in other areas 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.620
 a lot of people and a lot of change that the circus 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.630
 he mobilized in various parts of the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.520
 administrative part with a company 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.830
 even the ticket sales system 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.210
 Today it's all computerized so you 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.380
 can buy tickets to the circus through 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.320
 Internet 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.890
 he adapted in the technical part of sound 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.750
 light and the technical level of the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.480
 artist has also improved a lot because he 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.850
 sought in theater in dance in gymnastics 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.650
 other elements for 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.020
 add your number to the essence of 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.140
 circus continues you only evolve as 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.880
 artist and you grow and 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.940
 evolution as the public 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.860
 Changing with the internet now by 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.720
 example, this generation that 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.520
 there is another vision 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.590
 So for you to steal, let's say the 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.840
 The laughter of this group is a bit more 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.520
 hard but you can only you have 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.040
 to be aware of what happens in the 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.930
 and try to merge with you 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.170
 already have baggage essence of our 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.170
 era was more the animals clown 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.959
 now they have invested elsewhere in the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.790
 part of dance is not other options as well 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.070
 It was much better, huh? 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.739
 one of the formulas to guarantee the eyes 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.480
 of these new children has been 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.380
 exactly the partnership with the class of the 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.630
 monica 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.060
 this month the full initiative two 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.810
 years and it seems that the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.450
 My commanding the girl nothing more. 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.220
 I think its thematic as it is I think 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.980
 which is interesting for the children with 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.290
 sure will miss imagines do not have to 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.010
 have an agenda or if he spoke on the awning 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.110
 everything right comes from 25 tennis under canvas 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.360
 while the children indulge in 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.600
 fun adults enter the 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.600
 Just kidding 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.959
 and so circus goes on with all the 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.920
 will and love of whoever performs the show 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.560
 happen to the circus 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.590
 In my life, my job is not passion. 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.000
 I see myself without a provincial circle 5 is 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.590
 everything in my life 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.570
 the artist's greatest pleasure is to be in the 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.830
 stage every time you come close to the 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.420
 time for the ring we always stay 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.460
 with that cold in the belly because the 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.350
 we must work and receive the applause 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.730
 of the public so this is more important 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.730
 it's our live
