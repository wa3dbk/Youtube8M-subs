right now this is the base vector since

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.620 
right now this is the base vector since
I<00:00:28.070> knew<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.370> tail<00:00:28.580> wouldn't<00:00:28.940> be<00:00:29.030> visible<00:00:29.210> in

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:44.179 
larger shine in there is six pointed

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.270 
larger shine in there is six pointed
shape<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.050> smaller<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.620> skewed<00:00:46.010> four

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
shape and the smaller a skewed four

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.459 
shape and the smaller a skewed four
pointed<00:00:46.670> shape<00:00:46.909> their<00:00:47.780> eye<00:00:47.809> colors<00:00:48.289> are

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
pointed shape their eye colors are

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.139 
pointed shape their eye colors are
normally<00:00:48.769> a<00:00:48.800> little<00:00:49.070> more<00:00:49.219> pastel<00:00:49.730> than<00:00:49.999> their

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
normally a little more pastel than their

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.559 
normally a little more pastel than their
regular<00:00:50.510> colored<00:00:50.839> counterparties<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:53.300> next

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:53.569 
regular colored counterparties the next

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:55.509 
regular colored counterparties the next
step<00:00:53.780> is<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.140> add<00:00:54.260> full<00:00:54.620> body<00:00:54.859> and<00:00:55.100> hair<00:00:55.309> color

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
step is to add full body and hair color

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.020 
step is to add full body and hair color
as<00:00:56.499> you<00:00:57.499> can<00:00:57.649> see<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.159> body<00:00:58.309> color<00:00:58.640> is<00:00:58.789> pretty

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
as you can see the body color is pretty

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.270 
as you can see the body color is pretty
much<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.479> same<00:00:59.659> to<00:00:59.870> regular<00:01:00.199> colors<00:01:00.589> but<00:01:01.159> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
much the same to regular colors but the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.549 
much the same to regular colors but the
main<00:01:01.460> has<00:01:01.699> a<00:01:01.729> lot<00:01:01.940> of<00:01:01.969> gradients<00:01:02.569> to<00:01:02.600> it<00:01:02.870> while

points at the same opacity don't make
them<00:03:59.989> too<00:04:00.170> big<00:04:00.440> or<00:04:00.739> too<00:04:00.799> fat<00:04:01.519> you<00:04:02.269> can<00:04:02.420> make

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
them too big or too fat you can make

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.449 
them too big or too fat you can make
them<00:04:02.720> as<00:04:02.840> small<00:04:03.019> as<00:04:03.170> you<00:04:03.290> like<00:04:03.319> however<00:04:03.890> and

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
them as small as you like however and

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.569 
them as small as you like however and
that<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.900> how<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:06.319> vector<00:04:06.890> out<00:04:07.010> crystal<00:04:07.430> ponies

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
that is how I vector out crystal ponies

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.739 
that is how I vector out crystal ponies
I<00:04:08.060> hope<00:04:08.659> this<00:04:08.810> tutorial<00:04:08.989> has<00:04:09.530> been<00:04:09.560> helpful
