00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:06.589
 all nintendo accessories produced for balls with sto are always region 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.559
 free or compatible with all versions of consoles distributed in 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.319
 world 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:14.679
 for some reason sites that sell a package of controllers sell title 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.419
 original controllers 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:18.739
 japponesi 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:20.850
 that had been one of the glories 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.039
 and bad reproduction 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.519
 these against the door decapitated Italian dominetor 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.349
 who says he bought it from a wholesaler 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.340
 files imported from Japan 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.580
 but to see that that alone can do anything else 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.580
 that from the bad couple 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.170
 packaging is totally original 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.979
 bet japponesi instructions 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.979
 cricket club nintendo 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.010
 at first sight 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.150
 this looks like 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
 with original controller 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.900
 I say first sight 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.660
 because despite 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.080
 the manufacturer's codes 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.570
 when they are very visible 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.740
 they are identical to the new controllers 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.619
 in reality 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.480
 they are to make us 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.280
 the first thing we notice is that the keys are noisy 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.600
 all the data 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.310
 make a big mess 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.880
 He was crazy 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.320
 it is very prominent 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 when the others are cashed in the original one 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.790
 in addition 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.410
 there are a whole TV series 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.640
 manufacturing defects 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.170
 so arretro that it should be 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.550
 very opaque and instead very shiny 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.009
 the front 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.760
 write black controllers that are not a pair 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.270
 original 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.020
 should be 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.300
 extremely shiny 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.750
 eo stumps here instead is a 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.120
 matt black and inhomogeneous 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.380
 not even fear button printed as checking originals 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:13.979
 also the holes in the audio area are too big 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.589
 and all of you ate I do not know that they are suitable comes 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.829
 but if there are technical defects 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.299
 which also concern the external rubber as you can see it is difficult 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:29.299
 be inserted 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.079
 it is not well adherent 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.929
 as for the original 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.009
 it's a bomb 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.009
 electrostatic to understand ip all the crap 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.619
 the front holes were not made perfectly like 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.419
 the original controllers but 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.719
 it's all deformed 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.889
 it is also the hot wii and nintendo press 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.889
 and from here they were made with a very simple print 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.749
 prostate in the realization boxes can think that controls everything for 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.969
 everything works 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.989
 actually, it may seem like this first 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.269
 but it is not true but with the heel of functionality 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.889
 to see this 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.089
 we leave with the cotral withdraw 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:20.879
 the first thing you notice playing and star 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.879
 the pointer continues to jump between missing 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.789
 is the reason 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.789
 is that it does not avoid leaking fuse 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.349
 this original check 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.349
 increasing sensitivity the long life of the 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.689
 text ball at the bar taken from the controller 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.999
 they are always bigger 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.739
 and what to say or do 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.389
 most 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.030
 and here we approach 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.979
 *he looks at him 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.979
 you see 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.329
 sharply 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.399
 hi hi hi 5 led 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:00.139
 internet on aruba 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.139
 5 LEDs spoken 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:08.399
 this with the original 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.729
 preset the non-original one 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.139
 she too had the rigid roof too bright 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.590
 face quiz 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.900
 the assertiveness regulation 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.279
 does not exist 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.330
 increases the intensity 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.439
 pollen 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.809
 equal drums 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:45.959
 so can you say fuck really controller does not make any kind of 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.860
 reasoning control on the intensity of the points 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.330
 these can be seen much more clearly when approaching, the intensity does not vary 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.559
 and especially when you are close 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.349
 ah sensor bar 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.349
 what a big mess happens 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.020
 we can handle 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.169
 more point sources 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.430
 so it's enough that turning on the light in the house and controller cost does not work 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.180
 more 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.130
 another 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.130
 defect such as 28 controllers 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:25.839
 but the volume 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.379
 netlog an original way I have clean sound 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:34.089
 u sole 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:37.089
 escort corsten gallico 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.990
 it is also very much in stock of how much paper is on paper 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.830
 another flaw is that at the end of each sound 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.419
 there is a click 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:50.990
 it's very annoying new 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.990
 games commented 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.069
 dyed peruzzi 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.210
 while as far as you have 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.210
 regarding original 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.279
 I have to turn off 48 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:15.279
 Tuttomercatoweb 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.979
 original text 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:28.300
 the lowest volume 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.410
 and even turning down his assistant entirely 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:35.439
 I don't forget cooked and eaten 

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:38.439
 and at the end of each sound there is no sound of stucco 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.699
 another difference that you notice 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.469
 which made it so bad 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:48.839
 and the vibration 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:51.360
 and of course the video spoiler 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.139
 when we talk about contact we all know that 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.259
 which has a leavening 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:59.080
 the more you shoot me a step 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.080
 which makes us understand that he brought us to a post on a button 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:06.069
 while the non-original one 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.669
 every time I talk to you on a button 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.309
 here you see how it was film streaming 

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:16.770
 every time I talk to you on a button 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.080
 one has the very long vibration 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.330
 the very long vibration breaks apart from the passion for the 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.279
 photography video games 

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.960
 directly during the game the template vibration forever given 27 

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:32.959
 ita 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:38.509
 as for non-rinse 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:42.599
 works quite well compared to him a lot 

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:45.379
 obviously sees it simpler 

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:49.229
 however, however, the relationship hurt so much the same as the colors of the 

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:51.330
 practices that suck 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.069
 and it has also been said instead of going down 

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:57.210
 taaac like the original one then 

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.469
 straight extinguished makes noises this makes noise 

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:04.669
 and it revolves around an angle equity diet is practically in your underwear
