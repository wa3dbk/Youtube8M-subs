put the DLC maps in the free-for-all

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.310 
put the DLC maps in the free-for-all
playlist<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.670> think<00:02:00.329> all<00:02:00.509> four<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.840> those<00:02:00.990> maps

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
playlist I think all four of those maps

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.740 
playlist I think all four of those maps
would<00:02:01.500> play<00:02:01.740> pretty<00:02:02.040> well<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.750> free-for-all

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
would play pretty well in free-for-all

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.740 
would play pretty well in free-for-all
but<00:02:04.409> especially<00:02:04.649> for

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
but especially for

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.160 
but especially for
ugh<00:02:05.840> an<00:02:06.170> ignition<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:07.040> am<00:02:07.910> very<00:02:07.940> curious<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.780> see

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
ugh an ignition I am very curious to see

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.740 
ugh an ignition I am very curious to see
what<00:02:09.350> I<00:02:09.380> can<00:02:09.500> get<00:02:09.770> done<00:02:09.830> on<00:02:10.340> those<00:02:11.060> two<00:02:11.270> maps<00:02:11.510> as

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
what I can get done on those two maps as

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.740 
what I can get done on those two maps as
far<00:02:11.960> as<00:02:12.050> free-for-all<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.650> concerned<00:02:13.070> but

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
far as free-for-all is concerned but

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.050 
far as free-for-all is concerned but
yeah<00:02:14.750> man<00:02:15.110> Tina<00:02:15.560> mark<00:02:16.130> cookie<00:02:16.490> boy<00:02:16.700> up<00:02:16.910> right

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
yeah man Tina mark cookie boy up right

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.380 
yeah man Tina mark cookie boy up right
quick<00:02:17.500> but<00:02:18.500> anyway<00:02:18.890> somebody<00:02:19.820> asked<00:02:20.150> me<00:02:20.210> in

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
quick but anyway somebody asked me in

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.360 
quick but anyway somebody asked me in
the<00:02:20.510> comments<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.050> my<00:02:21.350> last<00:02:21.560> video<00:02:21.860> man<00:02:22.130> what

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
the comments of my last video man what

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.360 
the comments of my last video man what
is<00:02:22.520> my<00:02:22.700> favorite<00:02:23.240> SMG<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.410> use<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.980> guys<00:02:25.160> are

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
is my favorite SMG to use you guys are

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.000 
is my favorite SMG to use you guys are
very<00:02:25.640> accustomed<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.240> seeing<00:02:26.810> me<00:02:27.110> run<00:02:27.890> around

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
very accustomed to seeing me run around

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.820 
very accustomed to seeing me run around
with<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> SMG<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.470> that's<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.680> good

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
with the SMG and so that's a good

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.660 
with the SMG and so that's a good
question<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.430> think<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.510> best<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.990> in<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.320> game

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
question I think the best to in the game

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.070 
question I think the best to in the game
are<00:02:34.670> easily<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.510> mtar<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:37.490> vector<00:02:38.080> and

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
are easily the mtar and the vector and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.170 
are easily the mtar and the vector and
it's<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.739> close<00:02:39.950> one<00:02:40.160> for<00:02:40.459> sure<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.880> think<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
it's a close one for sure I think the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.110 
it's a close one for sure I think the
mtar<00:02:41.630> is<00:02:41.870> probably<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.590> little<00:02:43.040> bit<00:02:43.370> better<00:02:43.640> you

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
mtar is probably a little bit better you

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.580 
mtar is probably a little bit better you
know<00:02:44.239> I'm<00:02:44.390> saying<00:02:44.720> especially<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.500> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
know I'm saying especially in the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.530 
know I'm saying especially in the
overall<00:02:46.010> sense<00:02:46.280> because<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.880> has<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.360> much

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
overall sense because it has so much

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.260 
overall sense because it has so much
range<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.380> allows<00:02:48.739> you<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.130> be<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.670> lot<00:02:50.239> more

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
range it allows you to be a lot more

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.020 
range it allows you to be a lot more
versatile<00:02:51.220> but<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.370> vector<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.700> like<00:02:52.910> the

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
versatile but the vector I like the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.520 
versatile but the vector I like the
vector<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.360> lot<00:02:53.630> though<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.959> has<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:54.110> great

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
vector a lot though it has a great

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.160 
vector a lot though it has a great
crispy<00:02:55.430> shot<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:56.300> know<00:02:56.420> I'm<00:02:56.570> saying<00:02:56.870> very

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
crispy shot you know I'm saying very

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.330 
crispy shot you know I'm saying very
crisp<00:02:57.650> Phil<00:02:58.810> but<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.320> is<00:03:00.470> what<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.160> you

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
crisp Phil but it is what it is and you

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.940 
crisp Phil but it is what it is and you
guys<00:03:02.030> also<00:03:02.360> asked<00:03:02.810> me<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:03.020> lot<00:03:03.080> about<00:03:03.320> my<00:03:03.620> class

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
guys also asked me a lot about my class

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.090 
guys also asked me a lot about my class
setup<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.640> run<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.660> same<00:03:05.870> thing<00:03:06.140> for<00:03:06.380> any<00:03:06.530> SMG

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
setup I run the same thing for any SMG

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.010 
setup I run the same thing for any SMG
class<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.850> virtually<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.570> think<00:03:08.810> it's<00:03:08.930> the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
class and virtually I think it's the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.890 
class and virtually I think it's the
same<00:03:09.230> thing<00:03:09.500> for<00:03:09.769> assault<00:03:10.459> rifles<00:03:10.880> too<00:03:11.120> it's

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
same thing for assault rifles too it's

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.050 
same thing for assault rifles too it's
ready<00:03:12.620> up<00:03:12.860> now<00:03:13.760> dead<00:03:14.060> silence<00:03:15.040> amplify
