00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.520
 hello the garden is a place that 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.530
 take advantage especially in spring and 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.540
 summer is here when the plants are 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.549
 more beautiful and leafy but what happens 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.170
 when we do not have shadows many times 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.900
 the heat is so intense and the sun so 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.640
 direct that we can not take advantage of today 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.939
 we will devote ourselves to gardens in full 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.800
 Sun 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.439
 On the one hand we will make projects that 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.300
 produce shade and we'll also see what 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.480
 species tolerate being exposed to the sun 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.190
 direct first let's perform this 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.470
 solid that has a hedge composed of 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.740
 ligustrine and whistles by on and that resists 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.270
 very good sun 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.860
 but here on this corner there are some 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.050
 hydrangea who prefer semi-shade 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.600
 a damage from excess sun is seen in the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.940
 reddish edge of its leaves what we will do 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.950
 to protect them is to shade with these 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 totora umbrella that we wait for 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.570
 adding a thick tag, the idea is 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.100
 put several at different heights to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.100
 produce a more natural shade 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.430
 this corner has species that tolerate 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.170
 very well the sun like roses and this 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.330
 elect permit that is a shrub that 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.460
 reaches two meters high in the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.580
 Summer becomes leafy and its branches 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.920
 they fill with showy flowers 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.290
 another shrub that tolerates the sun well in 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.990
 the euro nica a small shrub and very 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.210
 branched its flowers that are elongated 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.490
 and in the form of spike do not need many 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.410
 care has easy cultivation what 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.930
 allows to adapt to any type of 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.640
 well drained surface that yes in epoch 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.830
 of frost is better to protect them 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.450
 when we have plants in pots that 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.370
 they spend a good part of the day in full sun 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.229
 It is convenient to worry about retaining 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.020
 humidity because the flowerpot heats up and 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.820
 the water evaporates too fast for 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.650
 fix it we can put vermiculite 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.810
 it is not necessary to do a transplant 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.000
 It is enough to dig the earth to put 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.560
 the little movie since with the irrigation goes 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.980
 to move to encompass all the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.260
 planter 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.300
 to keep the grass well green in 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.940
 areas of excessive sun there are certain data 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.770
 It is advisable to know first how to water 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.530
 at night and with abundant amounts of 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.790
 water for the roots to deepen 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.680
 second we should not cut it flush 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.380
 because with that we expose the earth to 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.090
 sun and it is dry and third must 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.770
 avoid fertilizers with high 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.480
 nitrogen content because this 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.120
 produces new shoots that are very 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.250
 claimants of water what is worth should 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.050
 incorporate is fertilizers rich in 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.260
 potassium that improve the strength of 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.260
 its roots 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.020
 The most natural thing in a garden is to create a 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.730
 shadow with trees 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.290
 this can be planting those on land or 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.330
 well when you guys are doing a 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.250
 project with potted trees is 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.630
 try to triangulate three pots and 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.090
 join them with planks that serve as 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.790
 benches we make 60 x 60 drawers 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.070
 centimeters joining five pieces of 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.290
 marine we put them on boards 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.600
 of three by one inch fixing the with 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.640
 tips on their ends then on their 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.220
 we make openings of 23 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.410
 centimeters long by 7 high for 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.560
 fit the pine planks of 10 x 4 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.560
 inches 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.209
 these trees are birches can be 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.160
 in these pots easily about 8 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.110
 years and produce a nice shade 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.000
 light when we create shadows with 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.190
 trees what we have to fix is 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.260
 in its shape and its size to determine 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.120
 when they tense the shadows according to that 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.080
 density we will see what species can 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.330
 grow below them there are three types of 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.640
 shadows lightly have it trees 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.290
 like birch or parkinson ya shadow 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.330
 moderate tree like the liquid 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.250
 amber and finally dense shade 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.640
 produced by the very leafy crowns 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.650
 of camphor or catalpa another way to 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.510
 create shadow is to use these curtains 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.160
 The idea is to take advantage of the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.860
 height hanging the of these racks 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.209
 that are built with 3 x 2 sticks 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.819
 inches is 1.98 meters tall and 98 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.730
 centimeters wide at its base we put 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.349
 a piece of stick of 45 centimeters for 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.900
 make support and get the frame 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.880
 be stable and to disguise its base 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.280
 we can paint it in some green color 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.380
 Grass-like 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.940
 we hang the curtain and we form 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.650
 screens that can be moved according to 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.420
 the position of the sun is an excellent 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.370
 place for children to play put 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.370
 a table and even protect from the wind 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.260
 i 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.900
 and to generate shade on the terrace nothing 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.660
 better than putting a pergola under it 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.980
 can put a link or a dining room 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.080
 we hope that some of these ideas are 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.300
 can incorporate in your yard or garden and 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.100
 so protect yourself from the summer sun we 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.420
 we see next week in another do it 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.420
 yourself from homecenter sun
