where you live but you also have to look

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.219 
where you live but you also have to look
at<00:01:22.979> cleanses<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.180> about<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:25.110> you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
at cleanses as not just about what you

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.109 
at cleanses as not just about what you
take<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:26.159> your<00:01:26.310> life<00:01:26.460> or<00:01:26.700> what<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.909> put

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
take out of your life or what you put

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.499 
take out of your life or what you put
into<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> see<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.150> when

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
into it and so I like to see it as when

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.390 
into it and so I like to see it as when
you<00:01:30.600> promise<00:01:31.079> yourself<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.159> you're<00:01:32.310> going

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400

to<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.579> something<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.119> certain<00:01:33.390> amount<00:01:33.420> of

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to do something for a certain amount of

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.359 
to do something for a certain amount of
time<00:01:33.810> might<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.470> well<00:01:34.500> add<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.130> bunch<00:01:35.280> of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
time might as well add in a bunch of
