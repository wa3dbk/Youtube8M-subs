00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
for some skills four-star week four as

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.160 
for some skills four-star week four as
you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.670> see<00:00:44.850> they<00:00:45.000> 24<00:00:45.600> years<00:00:45.840> old<00:00:46.050> and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
you can see they 24 years old and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.110 
you can see they 24 years old and
Brazilian<00:00:47.510> 92<00:00:48.510> acceleration<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.469> 85<00:00:50.120> 85

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
Brazilian 92 acceleration and 85 85

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.369 
Brazilian 92 acceleration and 85 85
sprint<00:00:51.510> speed<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.750> believe<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.199> he's

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
sprint speed I believe so he's

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.209 
sprint speed I believe so he's
absolutely<00:00:52.710> rapid<00:00:53.340> 62<00:00:54.180> strength<00:00:54.649> 89<00:00:55.649> agility

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
absolutely rapid 62 strength 89 agility

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.340 
absolutely rapid 62 strength 89 agility
in<00:00:56.340> 83<00:00:56.670> balanced<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.360> he's<00:00:57.510> impossible<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.170> get

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
in 83 balanced so he's impossible to get

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.689 
in 83 balanced so he's impossible to get
off<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> ball<00:00:58.710> because<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.949> his<00:00:59.070> high<00:00:59.250> jetty

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
off the ball because of his high jetty

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.240 
off the ball because of his high jetty
and<00:00:59.879> he<00:01:00.510> never<00:01:00.690> falls<00:01:00.960> over<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.289> well<00:01:01.440> anyway

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
and he never falls over as well anyway

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.880 
and he never falls over as well anyway
so<00:01:02.280> we're<00:01:02.520> gonna<00:01:02.640> move<00:01:02.760> into<00:01:02.940> Clips<00:01:03.300> now<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
so we're gonna move into Clips now and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.500 
so we're gonna move into Clips now and
Willian<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> player<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.150> well

you can see here I've got his pros in
his<00:02:39.150> concert<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.750> guess<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.319> con<00:02:40.709> would<00:02:40.920> be<00:02:41.069> his

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
his concert I guess a con would be his

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.250 
his concert I guess a con would be his
price<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.150> predict<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.959> go<00:02:43.110> up

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
price and I predict it to go up

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.050 
price and I predict it to go up
massively<00:02:43.709> side<00:02:44.040> by<00:02:44.250> him<00:02:44.400> now<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.610> think<00:02:44.790> you've

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
massively side by him now I think you've

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.600 
massively side by him now I think you've
got<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.360> 60<00:02:45.840> or<00:02:45.930> 70<00:02:46.290> K<00:02:46.440> from<00:02:46.500> 40<00:02:47.040> K<00:02:47.190> which<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.459> now

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
got to 60 or 70 K from 40 K which is now

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.309 
got to 60 or 70 K from 40 K which is now
I<00:02:47.819> gave<00:02:48.120> him<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.329> nine<00:02:48.569> point<00:02:48.690> five<00:02:48.930> rating

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
I gave him a nine point five rating

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.110 
I gave him a nine point five rating

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
this is just so beautiful when you get

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.680 
this is just so beautiful when you get
cut<00:02:59.099> inside<00:02:59.430> with<00:02:59.640> him<00:02:59.790> and<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.060> just<00:03:00.090> place

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
cut inside with him and you just place

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.690 
cut inside with him and you just place
it<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.079> corner<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:01.470> goes<00:03:01.680> in<00:03:01.860> every<00:03:02.040> single

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
it in the corner it goes in every single

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.150 
it in the corner it goes in every single
time<00:03:02.970> positioning<00:03:03.900> again<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.410> really<00:03:04.799> nice<00:03:04.980> he

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
time positioning again is really nice he

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.589 
time positioning again is really nice he
just<00:03:05.340> seems<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.610> be<00:03:05.730> right<00:03:06.000> in<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.420> right

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
just seems to be right in the right

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.940 
just seems to be right in the right
position<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:06.959> make<00:03:07.170> those<00:03:07.319> runs<00:03:07.560> on<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.799> wing

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
position to make those runs on the wing

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.009 
position to make those runs on the wing
sets<00:03:08.519> free<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.030> then<00:03:09.150> puts<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.569> perfect

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
sets free and then puts the perfect

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.750 
sets free and then puts the perfect
cross<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.349> or<00:03:10.560> cuts<00:03:10.829> inside<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.310> finesse<00:03:11.579> it

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
cross in or cuts inside and finesse it

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.280

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
to the corner he's such an amazing

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.080

player<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:13.799> would<00:03:13.920> fully<00:03:14.340> advise<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.819> guys<00:03:14.970> to

go<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.269> get<00:03:15.660> him<00:03:15.780> especially<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.350> think<00:03:16.410> he

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
go and get him especially so I think he

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.800 
go and get him especially so I think he
will<00:03:16.769> rise<00:03:17.010> in<00:03:17.220> price

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
will rise in price

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.640 
will rise in price
anyways<00:03:18.810> that's<00:03:18.930> pretty<00:03:19.170> much<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.380> end<00:03:19.530> of

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
anyways that's pretty much the end of

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.990 
anyways that's pretty much the end of
