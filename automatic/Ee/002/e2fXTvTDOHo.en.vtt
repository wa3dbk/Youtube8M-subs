and<00:03:23.239> tracks<00:03:23.450> really<00:03:23.840> isn't<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.079> attractive

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
and tracks really isn't that attractive

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.559 
and tracks really isn't that attractive
to<00:03:24.650> me<00:03:24.739> anymore<00:03:24.950> now<00:03:25.760> obviously<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.329> does

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
to me anymore now obviously this does

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.179 
to me anymore now obviously this does
have<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.780> negative<00:03:27.139> effect<00:03:27.470> because<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:28.040> does

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
have a negative effect because it does

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:29.559 
have a negative effect because it does
eliminate<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.760> traditional<00:03:28.909> sense<00:03:29.419> of

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
eliminate the traditional sense of

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.729 
eliminate the traditional sense of
achievement<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.230> might<00:03:30.470> get<00:03:30.620> in<00:03:30.680> a

something like a main story or a

long<00:03:45.319> race<00:03:45.590> now<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.549> talk<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.819> little<00:03:46.940> bit<00:03:47.090> about

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
long race now to talk a little bit about

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.180 
long race now to talk a little bit about
the<00:03:47.449> car<00:03:47.690> roster<00:03:48.169> I<00:03:48.349> think<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.859> default

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
the car roster I think the default

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.129 
the car roster I think the default
amount<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.579> cars<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:49.849> it<00:03:50.000> comes<00:03:50.150> with<00:03:50.389> is<00:03:50.569> 65

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
amount of cars that it comes with is 65

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.199 
amount of cars that it comes with is 65
if<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.620> picked<00:03:51.859> up<00:03:51.979> the<00:03:52.280> limited<00:03:52.669> edition

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
if you picked up the limited edition

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.670 
if you picked up the limited edition
version<00:03:53.599> you<00:03:53.810> might<00:03:53.930> have<00:03:54.079> got<00:03:54.199> an<00:03:54.290> additional

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
version you might have got an additional

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.469 
version you might have got an additional
5<00:03:54.979> cars<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.669> then<00:03:55.849> I<00:03:55.940> do<00:03:56.000> believe<00:03:56.120> that

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:56.479 
5 cars and then I do believe that

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.210 
5 cars and then I do believe that
there's<00:03:56.629> gonna<00:03:56.750> be<00:03:56.959> some<00:03:57.139> free<00:03:57.440> DLC<00:03:57.949> cars

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
there's gonna be some free DLC cars

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.670 
there's gonna be some free DLC cars
coming<00:03:58.609> as<00:03:58.729> well<00:03:58.909> so<00:03:59.599> I<00:03:59.629> think<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.229> total

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
coming as well so I think the total

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.250 
coming as well so I think the total
amount<00:04:00.889> of<00:04:00.949> cars<00:04:01.220> with<00:04:01.970> all<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.269> DLC<00:04:02.720> included

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
amount of cars with all the DLC included

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.719 
amount of cars with all the DLC included
at<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.680> moment<00:04:04.099> is<00:04:04.190> probably<00:04:04.489> something

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:04.729 
at the moment is probably something

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.879 
at the moment is probably something
around<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:05.030> 75<00:04:05.599> number<00:04:06.019> now<00:04:06.440> this<00:04:06.590> doesn't

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
around the 75 number now this doesn't

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.369 
around the 75 number now this doesn't
sound<00:04:07.010> huge<00:04:07.459> obviously<00:04:07.970> Gran<00:04:08.299> Turismo<00:04:08.569> 6<00:04:09.139> I

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
sound huge obviously Gran Turismo 6 I

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.409 
sound huge obviously Gran Turismo 6 I
think<00:04:09.409> has<00:04:09.769> like<00:04:10.129> hundreds<00:04:10.609> of<00:04:10.699> cars<00:04:10.970> but<00:04:11.359> the

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
think has like hundreds of cars but the

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.179 
think has like hundreds of cars but the
roster<00:04:11.689> is<00:04:11.840> quite<00:04:12.109> diverse<00:04:12.349> even<00:04:12.859> if<00:04:12.949> it<00:04:13.069> is<00:04:13.159> a

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189 
roster is quite diverse even if it is a

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.979 
roster is quite diverse even if it is a
little<00:04:13.400> bit<00:04:13.549> limited<00:04:13.699> there<00:04:14.599> aren't<00:04:14.810> too<00:04:14.959> many

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
little bit limited there aren't too many

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.899 
little bit limited there aren't too many
basic<00:04:15.560> road-going<00:04:15.829> cars<00:04:16.400> you've<00:04:16.639> got<00:04:16.820> the

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:16.909 
basic road-going cars you've got the

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.250 
basic road-going cars you've got the
renault<00:04:17.150> clio<00:04:17.449> but<00:04:17.780> then<00:04:17.870> you've<00:04:17.989> got<00:04:18.139> things

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
renault clio but then you've got things

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.649 
renault clio but then you've got things
like<00:04:18.409> the<00:04:18.620> r8<00:04:19.039> as<00:04:19.250> well<00:04:19.489> but<00:04:20.060> most<00:04:20.269> of<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.419> cars

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
like the r8 as well but most of the cars

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.180 
like the r8 as well but most of the cars
are<00:04:20.810> dedicated<00:04:21.320> races<00:04:21.739> so<00:04:21.919> you<00:04:21.979> have

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
are dedicated races so you have

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.159 
are dedicated races so you have
everything<00:04:22.430> from<00:04:22.580> open<00:04:23.180> wheels<00:04:23.419> to<00:04:23.840> LeMans

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
everything from open wheels to LeMans

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.379 
everything from open wheels to LeMans
type<00:04:24.590> races<00:04:25.099> to<00:04:25.430> things<00:04:25.639> like<00:04:25.759> the<00:04:25.970> radical

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
type races to things like the radical

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.689 
type races to things like the radical
there<00:04:27.139> is<00:04:27.259> the<00:04:27.380> obvious<00:04:27.680> gap<00:04:27.949> of<00:04:28.130> Ferrari<00:04:28.490> and

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
there is the obvious gap of Ferrari and

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.070 
there is the obvious gap of Ferrari and
Lamborghini<00:04:28.849> but<00:04:29.419> from<00:04:29.539> what<00:04:29.659> I<00:04:29.690> understand

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
Lamborghini but from what I understand

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.990 
Lamborghini but from what I understand
that<00:04:30.199> will<00:04:30.289> be<00:04:30.349> added<00:04:30.530> with<00:04:30.740> DLC<00:04:31.190> later<00:04:31.430> on<00:04:31.639> now

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
that will be added with DLC later on now

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.189 
that will be added with DLC later on now
I<00:04:32.090> have<00:04:32.240> no<00:04:32.449> idea<00:04:32.720> if<00:04:32.810> that's<00:04:32.870> going<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.139> be

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
I have no idea if that's going to be

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.909 
I have no idea if that's going to be
paid<00:04:33.470> or<00:04:33.710> free<00:04:33.979> but<00:04:34.190> I<00:04:34.250> have<00:04:34.400> a<00:04:34.430> feeling

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
paid or free but I have a feeling

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.649 
paid or free but I have a feeling
who<00:04:35.039> paid<00:04:35.340> which<00:04:35.879> is<00:04:36.030> annoying<00:04:36.270> but<00:04:36.599> that's

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
who paid which is annoying but that's

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.689 
who paid which is annoying but that's
kind<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.110> gaming<00:04:37.319> these<00:04:37.590> days<00:04:37.800> now<00:04:38.490> like<00:04:38.669> I

different perspectives that you can race

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.769 
different perspectives that you can race
from<00:05:01.499> so<00:05:01.770> there's<00:05:01.979> the<00:05:02.219> full<00:05:03.150> road<00:05:03.449> with

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:03.779 
from so there's the full road with

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:06.050 
from so there's the full road with
absolutely<00:05:04.349> no<00:05:04.740> car<00:05:05.039> you've<00:05:05.460> got<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.669> couple<00:05:05.879> of

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
absolutely no car you've got a couple of

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.700 
absolutely no car you've got a couple of
different<00:05:06.419> in<00:05:06.629> car<00:05:06.900> modes<00:05:07.199> we've<00:05:07.469> got<00:05:07.590> the

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
different in car modes we've got the

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.260 
different in car modes we've got the
helmet<00:05:07.949> mode<00:05:08.250> which<00:05:08.729> is<00:05:08.879> really<00:05:09.120> interesting

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
helmet mode which is really interesting

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.689 
helmet mode which is really interesting
because<00:05:09.750> if<00:05:10.020> you<00:05:10.050> choose<00:05:10.319> that<00:05:10.379> the<00:05:11.219> helmet

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
because if you choose that the helmet

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.790 
because if you choose that the helmet
will<00:05:11.819> actually<00:05:12.300> focus<00:05:12.659> on<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.080> apex<00:05:13.500> of<00:05:13.650> the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
will actually focus on the apex of the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.769 
will actually focus on the apex of the
corner<00:05:14.009> and<00:05:14.340> kind<00:05:14.639> of<00:05:14.759> blur<00:05:15.029> out<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.419> rest<00:05:15.629> of

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:15.779 
corner and kind of blur out the rest of

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:17.869 
corner and kind of blur out the rest of
the<00:05:15.870> track<00:05:16.139> so<00:05:16.740> if<00:05:16.979> you<00:05:17.069> don't<00:05:17.250> like<00:05:17.400> racing

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
the track so if you don't like racing

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.969 
the track so if you don't like racing
with<00:05:18.180> that<00:05:18.389> racing<00:05:18.900> line<00:05:19.139> Adon<00:05:19.620> which<00:05:19.830> I

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
with that racing line Adon which I

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.070 
with that racing line Adon which I
really<00:05:20.279> don't<00:05:20.490> you<00:05:21.029> can<00:05:21.210> actually<00:05:21.389> use<00:05:21.689> the

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
really don't you can actually use the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.320 
really don't you can actually use the
helmet<00:05:22.650> camp<00:05:22.919> to<00:05:23.159> kind<00:05:23.400> of<00:05:23.520> guide<00:05:23.879> you<00:05:23.939> into

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
helmet camp to kind of guide you into

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.149 
helmet camp to kind of guide you into
apex<00:05:24.779> corners<00:05:25.379> and<00:05:25.529> when<00:05:25.620> you<00:05:25.710> should<00:05:25.889> start

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
apex corners and when you should start

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.800 
apex corners and when you should start
braking<00:05:26.699> and<00:05:26.819> turning<00:05:27.000> in<00:05:27.300> which<00:05:27.449> i<00:05:27.569> think<00:05:27.629> is

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
braking and turning in which i think is

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.439 
braking and turning in which i think is
really<00:05:27.960> cool<00:05:28.259> the<00:05:29.099> audio<00:05:29.430> of<00:05:29.610> all<00:05:29.759> the<00:05:29.879> cars<00:05:30.150> is

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
really cool the audio of all the cars is

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
the ps4 although I will say on

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.760 
the ps4 although I will say on
graphically<00:06:46.690> intensive<00:06:47.169> circuits<00:06:47.650> like

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
graphically intensive circuits like

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.370 
graphically intensive circuits like
Menaka<00:06:48.340> there<00:06:49.210> is<00:06:49.330> a<00:06:49.360> little<00:06:49.600> bit<00:06:49.690> of<00:06:49.840> it's

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
Menaka there is a little bit of it's

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.290 
Menaka there is a little bit of it's
almost<00:06:50.830> like<00:06:51.039> screen<00:06:51.370> tearing<00:06:51.699> but<00:06:51.910> it's<00:06:52.060> it's

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
almost like screen tearing but it's it's

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.029 
almost like screen tearing but it's it's
not<00:06:52.479> quite<00:06:52.539> as<00:06:52.990> bad<00:06:53.139> as<00:06:53.320> screen<00:06:53.590> tearing<00:06:53.830> it's

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 
not quite as bad as screen tearing it's

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.430 
not quite as bad as screen tearing it's
like<00:06:54.190> screen<00:06:54.580> rolling<00:06:55.060> it's<00:06:55.630> not<00:06:55.870> super<00:06:56.259> bad

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
like screen rolling it's not super bad

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.409 
like screen rolling it's not super bad
and<00:06:56.740> again<00:06:57.430> I'm<00:06:57.580> hoping<00:06:57.759> that<00:06:58.000> it<00:06:58.090> gets<00:06:58.210> fixed

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419 
and again I'm hoping that it gets fixed

00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:59.939 
and again I'm hoping that it gets fixed
in<00:06:58.630> a<00:06:58.690> patch<00:06:58.930> but<00:06:59.199> overall<00:06:59.710> the<00:06:59.800> performance

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
in a patch but overall the performance

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:01.770 
in a patch but overall the performance
has<00:07:00.400> been<00:07:00.430> really<00:07:00.940> impressive<00:07:01.270> and<00:07:01.600> it's<00:07:01.720> a

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
has been really impressive and it's a

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.960 
has been really impressive and it's a
really<00:07:02.020> great<00:07:02.259> looking<00:07:02.590> game<00:07:02.770> so<00:07:03.669> my<00:07:03.789> final

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
really great looking game so my final

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.850 
really great looking game so my final
