00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.910 
serve day especially at home and then we
go<00:04:09.230> away<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.500> Berlin<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.220> secured<00:04:11.500> champion<00:04:12.500> we

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
go away to Berlin a secured champion we

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.130 
go away to Berlin a secured champion we
champions<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.550> I<00:04:13.970> think<00:04:14.510> we'd<00:04:14.600> be<00:04:14.720> sure<00:04:14.840> that

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
champions and I think we'd be sure that

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.130 
champions and I think we'd be sure that
from<00:04:15.770> how<00:04:16.430> consistent<00:04:17.209> we've<00:04:17.359> been<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.989> whole

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140
