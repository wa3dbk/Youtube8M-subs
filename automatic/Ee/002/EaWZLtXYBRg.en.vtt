so<00:00:35.680> this<00:00:35.920> is<00:00:36.040> what<00:00:36.190> mountain<00:00:36.340> bike<00:00:36.699> trail<00:00:37.030> bike

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
so this is what mountain bike trail bike

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.990 
so this is what mountain bike trail bike
of<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.420> year<00:00:37.559> 2015<00:00:38.559> dream<00:00:39.220> bike<00:00:39.430> it's<00:00:39.760> the

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
of the year 2015 dream bike it's the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.560 
of the year 2015 dream bike it's the
Yeti<00:00:40.300> SB<00:00:40.780> 5c<00:00:41.290> it's<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.370> 5<00:00:42.699> inch<00:00:42.910> version<00:00:43.390> of

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
Yeti SB 5c it's the 5 inch version of

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.619 
Yeti SB 5c it's the 5 inch version of
the<00:00:44.110> Yeti<00:00:44.650> SB<00:00:45.280> 6c<00:00:45.730> which<00:00:45.879> is<00:00:46.030> what<00:00:46.239> Jared

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
the Yeti SB 6c which is what Jared

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.000 
the Yeti SB 6c which is what Jared
Graves<00:00:46.930> has<00:00:47.080> been<00:00:47.260> racing<00:00:47.710> pretty

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
Graves has been racing pretty

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.509 
Graves has been racing pretty
successfully<00:00:48.670> in<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.180> EWS<00:00:49.600> in<00:00:49.930> 2014<00:00:50.830> so

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
successfully in the EWS in 2014 so

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.180 
successfully in the EWS in 2014 so
perhaps<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:52.000> biggest<00:00:52.269> story<00:00:52.659> with<00:00:52.869> the<00:00:53.080> SV<00:00:53.619> 5c

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
perhaps the biggest story with the SV 5c

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.609 
perhaps the biggest story with the SV 5c
is<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.909> switch<00:00:55.299> infinity<00:00:55.809> link<00:00:56.019> which<00:00:56.350> is<00:00:56.379> the

is the switch infinity link which is the

in collaboration with fox normally with
the<00:01:01.180> Yeti<00:01:01.330> you<00:01:01.690> find<00:01:01.960> that<00:01:02.049> they're<00:01:02.229> very<00:01:02.409> good

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
the Yeti you find that they're very good

the switch link and what you have is a

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
down not very much at all what this

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.440 
down not very much at all what this
switch<00:01:20.890> infinity<00:01:21.430> link<00:01:21.610> meant<00:01:21.880> was<00:01:22.119> that<00:01:22.150> when

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
switch infinity link meant was that when

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.330 
switch infinity link meant was that when
we're<00:01:22.600> jumping<00:01:22.960> from<00:01:23.140> say<00:01:23.410> 160<00:01:23.800> mile<00:01:24.130> bike

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
we're jumping from say 160 mile bike

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.850 
we're jumping from say 160 mile bike
onto<00:01:24.850> this<00:01:25.030> 130<00:01:25.540> mile<00:01:25.780> bike<00:01:25.960> we<00:01:26.500> didn't<00:01:26.740> have

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
onto this 130 mile bike we didn't have

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.560 
onto this 130 mile bike we didn't have
to<00:01:27.010> change<00:01:27.280> our<00:01:27.610> approach<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.120> trail<00:01:28.360> we

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
to change our approach to the trail we

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.150 
to change our approach to the trail we
could<00:01:28.840> still<00:01:29.140> attack<00:01:29.410> as<00:01:29.560> hard<00:01:29.770> as<00:01:29.890> we<00:01:29.980> were

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
could still attack as hard as we were

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.680 
could still attack as hard as we were
you<00:01:30.640> don't<00:01:30.790> have<00:01:30.910> to<00:01:31.000> change<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.420> way<00:01:31.540> you're

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
you don't have to change the way you're

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.390 
you don't have to change the way you're
riding<00:01:32.140> just<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.530> fit<00:01:32.770> into<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.160> fact<00:01:33.370> that

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
riding just to fit into the fact that

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.830 
riding just to fit into the fact that
you<00:01:33.550> have<00:01:33.760> that<00:01:33.970> a<00:01:34.000> little<00:01:34.180> bit<00:01:34.270> less<00:01:34.420> travel

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
you have that a little bit less travel

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.750 
you have that a little bit less travel
what<00:01:35.200> also<00:01:35.530> means<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.830> we<00:01:36.100> now<00:01:36.250> have<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.460> Yeti

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
what also means that we now have a Yeti

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.180 
what also means that we now have a Yeti
which<00:01:37.090> pedals<00:01:37.840> really<00:01:38.170> well<00:01:38.350> still<00:01:38.680> it<00:01:38.830> pedals

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
which pedals really well still it pedals

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.280 
which pedals really well still it pedals
efficiently<00:01:39.790> it's<00:01:40.300> got<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.810> small<00:01:41.080> bump

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
efficiently it's got the small bump

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.660 
efficiently it's got the small bump
sensitivity's<00:01:41.860> brilliant<00:01:42.250> but<00:01:42.460> it<00:01:42.520> also

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
sensitivity's brilliant but it also

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.399 
sensitivity's brilliant but it also
handles<00:01:43.030> those<00:01:43.330> bigger<00:01:43.630> square<00:01:44.020> edge<00:01:44.140> hits

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
handles those bigger square edge hits

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.140 
handles those bigger square edge hits
fantastically<00:01:45.340> as<00:01:45.460> well<00:01:45.640> which<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:45.970> something

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
fantastically as well which is something

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.790 
fantastically as well which is something
which<00:01:46.420> perhaps<00:01:46.870> has<00:01:47.110> been<00:01:47.290> lacking<00:01:47.500> with

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
which perhaps has been lacking with

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.070 
which perhaps has been lacking with
earlier<00:01:48.159> switch<00:01:48.640> linked<00:01:49.060> yet<00:01:49.479> is<00:01:49.630> in<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.870> past

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
earlier switch linked yet is in the past

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.040 
earlier switch linked yet is in the past
so<00:01:51.070> what<00:01:51.250> we<00:01:51.340> found<00:01:51.490> with<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.790> AES<00:01:52.330> v5c<00:01:52.990> is

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
so what we found with the AES v5c is

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.200 
so what we found with the AES v5c is
it's<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.380> ridiculously<00:01:53.979> fast<00:01:54.220> bike<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:55.030> can

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
it's a ridiculously fast bike you can

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.940 
it's a ridiculously fast bike you can
batter<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:55.600> over<00:01:55.840> rocks<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.380> roots<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.860> it's

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
batter it over rocks and roots and it's

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.040 
batter it over rocks and roots and it's
completely<00:01:57.430> unfazed<00:01:57.850> perhaps<00:01:58.690> doesn't<00:01:58.960> have

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
completely unfazed perhaps doesn't have

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
the Puffin verba some bikes but if you

the Puffin verba some bikes but if you
want<00:02:00.940> to<00:02:01.000> go<00:02:01.090> fast<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.720> ultimately<00:02:02.590> that's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
want to go fast and ultimately that's

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.530 
want to go fast and ultimately that's
what<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.040> lot<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.159> people<00:02:03.280> want<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.610> do<00:02:03.760> this

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
what a lot of people want to do this

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.539 
what a lot of people want to do this
bike<00:02:04.810> is<00:02:05.049> one<00:02:05.260> of<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.440> prime<00:02:05.950> machines<00:02:06.340> for

doing that so being a carbon yet it

something with a bit of a stronger edge
to<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.400> can<00:03:06.520> really<00:03:06.700> cut<00:03:07.000> into<00:03:07.150> the
