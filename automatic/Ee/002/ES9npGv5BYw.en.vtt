little<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:27.050> flip<00:00:28.050> try<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> flatten<00:00:28.759> the<00:00:29.759> shaft

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
little and flip try to flatten the shaft

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.820 
little and flip try to flatten the shaft
back<00:00:30.509> to<00:00:30.750> straight<00:00:31.320> position<00:00:33.500> if<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.650> take

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
back to straight position if you take

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.770 
back to straight position if you take
your<00:00:34.949> time<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.519> gently<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.510> have

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
your time you do it gently and you have

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.170 
your time you do it gently and you have
placed<00:00:37.080> this<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> way<00:00:37.940> but<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.059> up

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
placed this all the way but it up

placed this all the way but it up
against<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.540> Chuck<00:00:42.320> you<00:00:43.320> should<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.650> able<00:00:43.769> to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
against the Chuck you should be able to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.670 
against the Chuck you should be able to
do<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.340> out<00:00:44.750> with<00:00:45.750> no<00:00:45.870> problem<00:00:46.290> hopefully

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
do this out with no problem hopefully

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.910 
do this out with no problem hopefully
you'll<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.580> tool<00:00:47.850> such<00:00:48.089> as<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.769> you<00:00:49.769> can

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
you'll have a tool such as this you can

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.939 
you'll have a tool such as this you can
also<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.519> a<00:00:50.790> vise<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:52.530> only<00:00:52.710> thing<00:00:52.830> with

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
also do it in a vise the only thing with

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.170 
also do it in a vise the only thing with
the<00:00:53.040> vise<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.370> you're<00:00:53.729> gonna<00:00:53.909> have<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the vise is you're gonna have to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.670 
the vise is you're gonna have to
manually<00:00:54.510> rotate<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.080> and<00:00:55.229> find<00:00:55.409> out<00:00:55.530> what

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
manually rotate it and find out what

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200 
manually rotate it and find out what
their<00:00:55.799> high<00:00:55.949> points<00:00:56.309> are<00:00:56.430> where<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.790> bent<00:00:57.000> is

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
their high points are where the bent is

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.479 
their high points are where the bent is
on<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:58.140> shaft<00:00:58.820> this<00:00:59.820> works<00:01:00.890> great<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.369> have<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
on the shaft this works great you have a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.719 
on the shaft this works great you have a
lake<00:01:02.729> you<00:01:03.119> can<00:01:03.299> do<00:01:03.479> that<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
lake you can do that and if you have a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.969 
lake you can do that and if you have a
plate<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.330> probably<00:01:06.810> already<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.830> how<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
plate you probably already know how to

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.219 
plate you probably already know how to
do<00:01:08.159> these<00:01:08.310> things<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.780> video<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.140> just

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

there's<00:01:18.450> another<00:01:18.689> tool<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.500> use<00:01:19.680> this

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
there's another tool that I can use this

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.660 
there's another tool that I can use this
is<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.550> hard<00:01:20.940> plastic<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.800> just<00:01:22.800> tap<00:01:23.040> gently<00:01:23.340> is

is a hard plastic and just tap gently is
your<00:01:23.790> manually<00:01:24.300> turning<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.960> Chuck<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:26.850> find

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
your manually turning the Chuck to find

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.960 
your manually turning the Chuck to find
out<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.360> those<00:01:27.480> high<00:01:27.690> points<00:01:27.930> out<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.970> once

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
out what those high points out are once

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.080 
out what those high points out are once
this<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.600> done<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.550> want<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.910> find

this is all done and you want to find

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.600 
this is all done and you want to find
out<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.600> spinning<00:01:34.200> too<00:01:34.230> you<00:01:34.620> can<00:01:34.800> put

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
out if it's spinning too you can put

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.310 
out if it's spinning too you can put
your<00:01:36.350> lathe<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.560> low<00:01:38.040> speed<00:01:39.350> turn<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.500> on

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
your lathe on low speed turn it on

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.680 
your lathe on low speed turn it on
you<00:01:42.500> can<00:01:42.860> get<00:01:42.980> a<00:01:43.010> two<00:01:43.280> indication<00:01:43.940> with<00:01:44.450> that

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
you can get a two indication with that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.250 
you can get a two indication with that
chef<00:01:45.110> spinning<00:01:45.760> you<00:01:46.760> or<00:01:46.940> not

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260 

now<00:01:49.830> depending<00:01:50.370> how<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.490> crash<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.120> where

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
now depending how you crash and where

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.440 
now depending how you crash and where
the<00:01:51.390> band<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.080> shaft<00:01:53.150> you<00:01:54.150> bend<00:01:54.330> this

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the band is on the shaft you bend this

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.630 
the band is on the shaft you bend this
shot<00:01:54.660> typically<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.290> shafts<00:01:56.100> tend<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.430> bend

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
shot typically the shafts tend to bend

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
shot typically the shafts tend to bend
and<00:01:56.820> break<00:01:56.970> this<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:57.840> didn't<00:01:58.050> break<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.410> just

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and break this one didn't break it just

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.160 
and break this one didn't break it just
bent<00:01:58.890> slightly<00:01:59.160> they<00:02:00.030> tend<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.330> bend<00:02:00.540> near<00:02:00.900> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
bent slightly they tend to bend near the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.690 
bent slightly they tend to bend near the
where<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.070> threading<00:02:02.490> starts<00:02:03.230> and<00:02:04.520> but<00:02:05.520> this

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
where the threading starts and but this

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.359 
where the threading starts and but this
one<00:02:05.910> actually<00:02:06.480> bent<00:02:06.930> where<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.650> connection

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
one actually bent where the connection

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.530 
one actually bent where the connection
to<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.670> end<00:02:09.000> build<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.980> so<00:02:10.980> I<00:02:11.310> had<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.730> tap<00:02:12.330> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
to that end build is so I had to tap it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.850 
to that end build is so I had to tap it
a<00:02:12.690> little<00:02:12.960> further<00:02:13.230> inside<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.660> shaft<00:02:15.860> I'll

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
a little further inside the shaft I'll

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.110 
a little further inside the shaft I'll
tape<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.070> too<00:02:17.250> far<00:02:17.400> out<00:02:17.520> because<00:02:17.730> you're<00:02:18.000> not

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
tape it too far out because you're not

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.850 
tape it too far out because you're not
bending<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:19.440> chef<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.890> too<00:02:20.070> much<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:22.020> it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
bending the chef that too much so it

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.100 
bending the chef that too much so it
took<00:02:23.010> me<00:02:23.160> about<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.430> don't<00:02:23.940> know<00:02:24.090> about<00:02:24.240> 10<00:02:24.600> 10

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
took me about I don't know about 10 10

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.530 
took me about I don't know about 10 10
tabs<00:02:26.930> using<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.430> plastic<00:02:29.430> mallet<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.360> got

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
tabs using the plastic mallet and I got

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.630 
tabs using the plastic mallet and I got
it<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.170> point<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.340> see<00:02:32.490> here<00:02:34.640> it

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
it to this point so we can see here it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.940 
it to this point so we can see here it
has<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.850> little<00:02:36.270> bit<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.690> wobble<00:02:36.900> at<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.680> very

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
has a little bit of a wobble at the very

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.130 
has a little bit of a wobble at the very
end<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.370> tip<00:02:38.640> I'm<00:02:39.510> not<00:02:39.780> too<00:02:39.960> concerned

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
end of the tip I'm not too concerned

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.160 
end of the tip I'm not too concerned
about<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:41.030> now<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.060> forgot<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.600> shaft<00:02:42.870> at

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
about that now I forgot the shaft at

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.990 
about that now I forgot the shaft at
this<00:02:43.380> point<00:02:43.620> your<00:02:43.830> fate<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.580> can<00:02:44.760> chuck

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
this point your fate and if I can chuck

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
this point your fate and if I can chuck
it<00:02:45.030> here<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:46.440> finish<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.460> that<00:02:47.970> end<00:02:48.180> it'll

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
it here I can finish that that end it'll

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.920 
it here I can finish that that end it'll
be<00:02:49.230> perfectly<00:02:49.620> straight<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:53.209> as<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.360> said<00:02:54.420> I'm

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
be perfectly straight but as I said I'm

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.150 
be perfectly straight but as I said I'm
not<00:02:55.080> too<00:02:55.230> concerned<00:02:55.410> with<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.860> at<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.130> end

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
not too concerned with it at the end

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.740 
not too concerned with it at the end
because<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.000> where<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.300> propeller<00:02:57.570> is

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
because this is where the propeller is

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.540 
because this is where the propeller is
not<00:02:57.930> seen<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.290> its<00:02:58.500> own<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:58.800> this<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.130> true<00:02:59.370> with

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
not seen in its own so this is true with

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.430 
not seen in its own so this is true with
the<00:02:59.610> rest<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.970> shaft<00:03:00.240> this<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.600> where<00:03:00.780> is

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
the rest of the shaft this is where is

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.600 
the rest of the shaft this is where is
where<00:03:01.500> you're<00:03:01.770> going<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.980> spin<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.280> propeller

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
where you're going to spin the propeller

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.590 
where you're going to spin the propeller
to<00:03:03.770> now<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:05.760> reason<00:03:06.030> why<00:03:06.150> I'm<00:03:06.270> using<00:03:06.300> this<00:03:08.600> the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
to now the reason why I'm using this the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.150 
to now the reason why I'm using this the
reason<00:03:09.900> why<00:03:09.989> you're<00:03:10.140> seeing<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.590> end<00:03:10.920> bill

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
reason why you're seeing that end bill

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.090 
reason why you're seeing that end bill
still<00:03:12.090> attached<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.110> shaft<00:03:13.440> why<00:03:13.680> not<00:03:13.890> just

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
still attached to the shaft why not just

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.760 
still attached to the shaft why not just
remove<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:14.610> complete<00:03:15.030> shaft<00:03:15.300> in<00:03:15.570> in<00:03:15.770> Chuck

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
remove this complete shaft in in Chuck

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.940 
remove this complete shaft in in Chuck
it<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.160> believe<00:03:17.510> when<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.870> have<00:03:19.320> difficulty

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
it and I believe when I have difficulty

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.410 
it and I believe when I have difficulty
removing<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:21.770> shaft<00:03:22.770> from<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.310> end<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.610> on<00:03:23.760> a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
removing the shaft from the end of on a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.560 
removing the shaft from the end of on a
small<00:03:24.780> press<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.980> didn't<00:03:26.160> want<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.370> risk

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
small press and I didn't want to risk

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.790 
small press and I didn't want to risk
loosening<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.690> magnets<00:03:28.110> if<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.709> know

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
loosening the magnets if you know

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.680 
loosening the magnets if you know
something<00:03:29.250> went<00:03:29.520> wrong<00:03:29.670> there<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.570> I<00:03:30.600> just

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
something went wrong there so I just

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.229 
something went wrong there so I just
left<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.200> as<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.770> this<00:03:32.250> works<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:32.880> there's

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
left it as this this works and there's

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.150 
left it as this this works and there's
no<00:03:33.330> need<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.630> remove<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.350> shaft<00:03:34.560> if<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:34.890> do<00:03:35.040> it

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
no need to remove the shaft if you do it

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.699 
no need to remove the shaft if you do it
this<00:03:35.280> way<00:03:37.850> okay<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:38.910> we<00:03:39.450> have<00:03:39.630> fixed<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.440> shaft

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
this way okay so we have fixed the shaft

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.180 
this way okay so we have fixed the shaft
and<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.070> motor<00:03:41.970> here<00:03:42.330> using<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.410> complete

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
and the motor here using the complete

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.080 
and the motor here using the complete
end<00:03:44.550> bill<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.510> shaft<00:03:46.260> as<00:03:46.470> we<00:03:46.850> showed<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.880> little

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
end bill and shaft as we showed a little

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.810 
end bill and shaft as we showed a little
while<00:03:48.300> in<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.540> video<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:50.310> now<00:03:50.580> we're<00:03:50.730> going

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
while in the video and now we're going

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.780 
while in the video and now we're going
to<00:03:50.910> be<00:03:51.110> putting<00:03:52.110> back<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:53.630> parts<00:03:54.630> here

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
to be putting back the parts here

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.509 
to be putting back the parts here
so<00:03:57.790> work<00:03:58.689> in<00:03:58.870> reverse<00:03:59.409> order<00:03:59.829> as<00:04:00.040> we<00:04:00.189> took<00:04:00.370> it

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
so work in reverse order as we took it

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.670 
so work in reverse order as we took it
out<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.939> you<00:04:01.569> can<00:04:01.689> use<00:04:01.840> this<00:04:02.019> section<00:04:02.349> of<00:04:02.590> the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
out and you can use this section of the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.869 
out and you can use this section of the
video<00:04:02.829> to<00:04:04.049> remove<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.680> parts<00:04:06.010> remove

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
video to remove the the parts remove

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.679 
video to remove the the parts remove
this<00:04:07.030> this<00:04:07.299> complete<00:04:08.019> section<00:04:08.379> from<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:09.689> from

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
this this complete section from the from

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.390 
this this complete section from the from
the<00:04:10.810> motor<00:04:10.989> now<00:04:11.349> there's<00:04:11.590> quite<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.010> bit<00:04:12.189> of<00:04:12.220> a

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
the motor now there's quite a bit of a

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.550 
the motor now there's quite a bit of a
tension<00:04:12.790> there<00:04:13.000> grab<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:13.930> that's<00:04:14.170> because<00:04:14.409> of

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
tension there grab and that's because of

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.469 
tension there grab and that's because of
the<00:04:14.680> high<00:04:14.829> power<00:04:15.040> magnets<00:04:15.549> that<00:04:15.640> these<00:04:16.180> motors

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
the high power magnets that these motors

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.909 
the high power magnets that these motors
use<00:04:17.070> okay<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.130> basically<00:04:18.459> put<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.030> back<00:04:19.209> on

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
use okay so basically put that back on

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:27.480 
use okay so basically put that back on
there<00:04:20.919> is<00:04:21.100> a<00:04:22.259> small<00:04:23.259> brass<00:04:24.180> washer<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:27.190> fits

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
there is a small brass washer that fits

there is a small brass washer that fits
right<00:04:27.699> over<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:28.150> end<00:04:28.479> of<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.470> shaft<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.130> the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
right over the end of the shaft and the

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:37.010 
right over the end of the shaft and the
end<00:04:31.570> of<00:04:31.720> this<00:04:31.870> shaft<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:33.539> grooved<00:04:34.539> for<00:04:35.530> this

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
end of this shaft is grooved for this

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.790 
end of this shaft is grooved for this
c-clip<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.639> a<00:04:39.669> spring<00:04:40.090> c-clip<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:41.620> it's

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
c-clip this is a spring c-clip and it's

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.890 
c-clip this is a spring c-clip and it's
be<00:04:42.010> carefully<00:04:42.520> inserted<00:04:43.060> back<00:04:43.210> into<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.690> C

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
be carefully inserted back into the C

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.100 
be carefully inserted back into the C
group<00:04:44.880> so<00:04:45.880> I'm<00:04:46.030> gonna<00:04:46.180> try<00:04:46.389> to<00:04:46.419> do<00:04:46.630> this<00:04:46.810> while

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
group so I'm gonna try to do this while

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.600 
group so I'm gonna try to do this while
filming<00:04:47.610> okay<00:04:48.870> just<00:04:49.870> simply<00:04:50.139> locate<00:04:50.560> that<00:04:50.740> C

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
filming okay just simply locate that C
