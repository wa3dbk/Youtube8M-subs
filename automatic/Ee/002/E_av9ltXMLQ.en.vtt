00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.460
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.080
 new video on this occasion I bring you the 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.910
 chrome guide and as you have already seen 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.010
 of the channel you also have the video without 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.810
 no type of cut with a tune 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.849
 background of what was the first 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.860
 Kill this bowl with the brotherhood order 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.689
 immortal I'm uploading these videos the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.490
 kiel like that with music and without any kind of 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.689
 explanation because the links of the 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.369
 I'm uploading videos to google 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.900
 progress as you know those who 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.550
 You know this page because it has a 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.410
 section where the guild can climb 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.210
 your kills and so on you see that 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.500
 You can see the meeting then 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.149
 in this way also and without 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.710
 entertain us more let's apply now 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.030
 this voice to start let's talk about 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.980
 the three skills he will give to the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.989
 tanks one of them is the armor 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.670
 laviada this skill will make the 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.320
 affected tank see reduced its 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.019
 Movement speed 15 percent 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.239
 and it will also increase the damage that a 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.710
 20 percent must also be said that 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.960
 this ability can accumulate up to 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.429
 five times but the tanks should 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.769
 the boss changed whenever this 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.420
 skill affects one of them another 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.070
 very important skill for them will be 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.050
 stone fists what he will do 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.570
 inflict a lot of damage about 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.520
 350 k of physical damage that will be divided 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.740
 equal parts between the objective is that 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.670
 are within a radius of 15 meters being the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.439
 maximum to divide 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.580
 of two players therefore both 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.860
 tanks will have to be in the same 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.150
 position throughout the fight and the 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.159
 last life that is dedicated to the 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.159
 tanks will be onslaught stability 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.110
 will produce 366 k of physical damage that 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.420
 will increase depending on how close you 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.890
 Chromium is the player so 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.140
 when chrome is punishing 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.119
 stability the tank that is with the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.700
 boss should get as far away as he can 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.229
 and then quickly return to him this 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.759
 ability will also affect us the rest 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.860
 of the raid which the only thing 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.180
 we will have to do it will be cured 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.649
 that ranges will already be what 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.479
 far enough away and the scrum 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.100
 also because they will be placed at 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.600
 where will the tanks be? 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.460
 now we will talk about skills that are not 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.140
 will affect the entire rai including some 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.090
 from them to the tanks also one of 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.670
 they will be breath of stone in this 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.200
 chrome moment will inflict 24 thousand damages 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.270
 nature to all players every 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.340
 second if at the end of this ability 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.170
 proved that he does not find his goal to 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.450
 melee will continue to punish that skill 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.190
 therefore it is very important that 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.840
 always the tank comes back fast after 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.180
 of the attacks and other skill that 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.769
 we will comment later on another of the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.480
 skills that will affect us like raid 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.070
 will be the machacan during with this 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.960
 chrome skill hit the ground and 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.750
 will cause a 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.190
 in cascade inflingir to 160 k of the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.870
 nature to all those who 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.640
 find their way however the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.290
 most entertaining skill of the meeting 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.970
 and for which we will see the grudges in the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.040
 different guild will be the dirt road 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.230
 entangled with this skill you will see that 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.640
 all yellow circles will appear 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.380
 the players included the tanks 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.050
 they should be placed on top of a circle 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.820
 yellow and specific one player per 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.290
 each circle will therefore have to 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.820
 be coordinated and if we see that a 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.860
 partner has already reached a circle 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.540
 we will have to go to another one once it passes 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.980
 seconds of these circles will emerge 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.080
 stone hands that will finish us 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.000
 preventing us from flying in addition 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.100
 they will also make us immune to physical damage 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.230
 but as long as we remain trapped in 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.600
 these stone hands inflict on us 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.250
 5000 nature year every second the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.750
 goal of letting ourselves be trapped by these 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.430
 hands will be to avoid the skill 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.890
 thunderous thuds this skill 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.600
 will inflict 51,000 physical damage to all 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.670
 the players every second and we also 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.200
 will therefore launch through the air 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.910
 the root should be trapped in the hands 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.070
 if he does not want to die either for that damage 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.960
 physical so high that there will be or with the 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.730
 fall itself if your class does not have 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.800
 no way to cushion the damage of 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.870
 fall we will have to synchronize so that 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.760
 when chrome once it castrates 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.769
 hits 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.269
 the hands go dying is very 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.980
 important that we not kill the hands of 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.049
 stone before thunderous thumping 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.180
 end because all those 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.579
 who are released will receive that physical damage 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.319
 of 51 cases per second will also be very 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.239
 important to give priority to the hand of 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.920
 tank since if chrome stops 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.110
 castellar thunderous thumping and its 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.060
 goal or your tank is not melee 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.650
 will begin to cast stone breath to 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.209
 the whole root apart from those hands of 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.190
 stone we will have to face other 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.359
 that as you are seeing on the screen will be 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.159
 of earth rune skill 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.230
 crushing grams make stability 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.940
 two stone hands will emerge with a 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.329
 red symbol on the path between both 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.730
 two 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.859
 if someone will pass between both hands 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.019
 these would be closed by clapping and 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.549
 would inflict in 170 cases of damage 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.590
 nature to all the players that 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.900
 find your step, they will also be 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.700
 studied for 5 seconds in the case 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.739
 that nobody passes between these hands the 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.750
 the second time that chrome or caster one of 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.600
 crushing land both pairs of hands 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.190
 they will give that clap therefore it will be necessary 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.139
 be very attentive where the second one comes out 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.820
 pair of hands to thus move away 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.310
 trajectory of this and the first pair 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.990
 because once you exit the second such 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.700
 will be closed in addition to all these 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.160
 skills that we carry long 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.750
 one of them reverberations is 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.070
 lara skill whenever chrome does 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.320
 a skill that hits the ground 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.910
 creating those sonic reverberations that 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.950
 you are seeing on the screen we should 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.570
 dodge them at all times and in case 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.660
 that we get in touch with them 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.390
 We will inflict 56 cases of sonic damage 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.950
 causing them to disappear and to 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.780
 finish the last bility that will do 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.790
 shattered earth with this skill 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.730
 inflict 32 faces of damage nature 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.260
 4 players were also in addition and before 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.090
 I forget that enter cromos 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.310
 frenzy just like what happened with the 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.780
 butcher this one will enter this state 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.760
 when 30% health arrives 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.860
 inflicting 20% more damage 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.500
 increasing its speed to that a 20 by 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.290
 cent and also throwing skills 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.880
 more often and up to here the guide 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.290
 chrome as you see the positioning of 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.570
 the raids are that is to the right or 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.710
 Unlike the scrum left aside 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.450
 rangers we will always try is 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.370
 stay together because in this 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.440
 combat the sustained damage will be very 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.290
 high therefore it is very important 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.400
 that individually we mitigate all the 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.050
 possible harm and do not eat 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.210
 Stupid skills are like 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.190
 reverberations the crush during 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.240
 hit her with the hands of the route of 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.009
 crushing earth 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.050
 and not get on top of the route of 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.849
 tangled earth or eliminate one of the 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.860
 hands before the boss ends with 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.960
 soft thumping beats and now already 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.639
 If I shut up and if you liked it, you know 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.440
 that you can give me a like to add it to 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.060
