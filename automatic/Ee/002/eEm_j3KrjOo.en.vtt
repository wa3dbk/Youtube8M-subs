00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
figures because you can see we have the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.300 
figures because you can see we have the
loop<00:01:49.030> on<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.329> top<00:01:49.360> so<00:01:49.689> you<00:01:49.780> could<00:01:49.899> actually

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
loop on the top so you could actually

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.830 
loop on the top so you could actually
thread<00:01:51.310> something<00:01:52.119> through<00:01:52.360> there<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.720> could

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
thread something through there you could

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.609 
thread something through there you could
have<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.110> as<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.649> necklace<00:01:54.490> or<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.820> charm<00:01:55.619> so

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
have it as a necklace or a charm so

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.130 
have it as a necklace or a charm so
there<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.040> that<00:01:57.549> scope<00:01:58.030> for<00:01:58.299> us<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.750> is<00:01:58.780> a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
there is that scope for us and it is a

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.190 
there is that scope for us and it is a
flatter<00:01:59.979> rubbery<00:02:00.579> so<00:02:01.509> I'll<00:02:01.659> think<00:02:01.899> about<00:02:02.020> it

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
flatter rubbery so I'll think about it

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.469 
flatter rubbery so I'll think about it
it<00:02:02.380> does<00:02:02.560> look<00:02:02.590> quite<00:02:02.979> cool<00:02:03.310> anyway<00:02:03.729> we<00:02:04.299> have

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
it does look quite cool anyway we have

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.520 
it does look quite cool anyway we have
another<00:02:04.659> smash<00:02:05.110> thank<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:08.289> egg

kinder eggs
so<00:02:22.769> I'm<00:02:23.069> looking<00:02:23.400> here<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:24.329> have<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> net<00:02:24.720> a

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
so I'm looking here we have a net a

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.869 
so I'm looking here we have a net a
headless<00:02:25.939> spider-man<00:02:27.500> but<00:02:28.500> I'm<00:02:29.370> quite<00:02:29.670> sure

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
headless spider-man but I'm quite sure

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.640 
headless spider-man but I'm quite sure
it<00:02:29.939> isn't<00:02:30.239> broken<00:02:30.569> because<00:02:31.079> we<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.439> just

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
it isn't broken because we can just

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.440 
it isn't broken because we can just
sleep<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.640> head<00:02:32.819> on<00:02:32.939> there<00:02:33.150> there<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:33.420> go

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
sleep the head on there there you go

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.780 
sleep the head on there there you go
over<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> head<00:02:34.049> just<00:02:34.739> slips<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:35.400> there<00:02:35.549> so

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
over the head just slips on there so

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.910 
over the head just slips on there so
that<00:02:35.819> isn't<00:02:36.329> very<00:02:36.360> good<00:02:36.720> not<00:02:37.319> very<00:02:37.349> good<00:02:37.709> for

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
that isn't very good not very good for

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.039 
that isn't very good not very good for
younger<00:02:38.400> kids<00:02:38.579> guys<00:02:39.120> does<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.629> have<00:02:39.780> an<00:02:39.900> age

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049
