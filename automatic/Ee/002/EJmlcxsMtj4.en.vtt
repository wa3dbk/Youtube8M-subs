surgeon from Bogota Colombia I am kind
of<00:00:09.540> an<00:00:09.660> expert<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.440> liposuction<00:00:11.099> especially

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
of an expert in liposuction especially

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.400 
of an expert in liposuction especially
in<00:00:11.849> body<00:00:12.030> contouring<00:00:12.389> all<00:00:12.690> over<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.200> world

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
in body contouring all over the world

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.880 
in body contouring all over the world
and<00:00:14.179> the<00:00:15.179> idea<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.900> developed<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
and the idea is that I developed a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.130 
and the idea is that I developed a
specific<00:00:17.730> kind<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.180> liposuction<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:19.020> is

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
specific kind of liposuction that is

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.740 
specific kind of liposuction that is
called<00:00:19.350> high<00:00:19.619> definition<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.510> later<00:00:21.510> we

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
called high definition and later we

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.790 
called high definition and later we
developed<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:23.510> new<00:00:24.510> kind<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.289> hide<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> village

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
developed a new kind of hide the village

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.310 
developed a new kind of hide the village
is<00:00:25.920> called<00:00:26.189> dynamic<00:00:26.580> definition<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:28.140> I'm

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
is called dynamic definition and I'm

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.919 
is called dynamic definition and I'm
here<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.680> Australia<00:00:29.189> during<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.519> course<00:00:29.929> we're

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
actually teaching to doctors here in the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.170 
actually teaching to doctors here in the
cosmos<00:00:34.590> clinic<00:00:35.010> about<00:00:35.760> these<00:00:36.000> new

cosmos clinic about these new

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.209 
cosmos clinic about these new
technologies<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> new<00:00:37.500> techniques<00:00:38.100> that

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
technologies and the new techniques that

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.340 
technologies and the new techniques that
I<00:00:38.399> developed<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.570> quite<00:00:39.870> interesting

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
I developed it's quite interesting

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.069 
I developed it's quite interesting
because<00:00:40.469> there<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.550> nothing<00:00:42.149> out<00:00:42.600> there<00:00:42.660> that

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
because there was nothing out there that

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.660 
because there was nothing out there that
you<00:00:43.530> could<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.450> achieve<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.170> very<00:00:46.410> athletic

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
you could do to achieve a very athletic

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.270 
you could do to achieve a very athletic
definition<00:00:47.840> we<00:00:48.840> lipo<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.350> anything<00:00:50.129> else

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
definition we lipo with anything else

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.040 
definition we lipo with anything else
that<00:00:50.460> was<00:00:51.320> available<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.969> think<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.300> mean<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
that was available I think the mean the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.380 
that was available I think the mean the
mean<00:00:55.230> achieving<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.070> could<00:00:56.520> get<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
mean achieving that we could get is that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.990 
mean achieving that we could get is that
we<00:00:57.660> could<00:00:57.899> get<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.739> perfect<00:00:59.340> result<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.879> we

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
we could get the perfect result that we

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.990 
we could get the perfect result that we
always<00:01:00.359> wanted<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.989> know<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
always wanted you know is to get the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.280 
always wanted you know is to get the
results<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.989> could<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.640> long<00:01:06.090> long<00:01:06.840> term

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
results you could get in long long term

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.570 
results you could get in long long term
with<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> gym<00:01:10.220> for<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.549> I

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
with just going to the gym for that I I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.490 
with just going to the gym for that I I
think<00:01:11.909> there<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.540> something<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.049> has<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.409> be

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
think there is something that has to be

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.999 
think there is something that has to be
clear<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.850> when<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.960> six-pack<00:01:16.350> when

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
clear and when you get the six-pack when

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.310 
clear and when you get the six-pack when
you<00:01:17.159> get<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> perfect<00:01:17.909> body<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:19.049> have

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
you get a perfect body you know you have

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.499 
you get a perfect body you know you have
to<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> genes<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.759> them<00:01:21.060> now

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
to have the genes to get them now

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.820 
to have the genes to get them now
there's<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.960> rule<00:01:23.270> around<00:01:24.270> 5%<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> general

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
there's a rule around 5% of the general

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.780 
there's a rule around 5% of the general
population

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
population

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.730 
population
have<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> proper<00:01:27.659> genes<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.080> actually<00:01:28.409> get

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
have the proper genes to actually get

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.800 
have the proper genes to actually get
there<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:29.729> why<00:01:29.909> there<00:01:30.600> are<00:01:30.659> some

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
there you know that's why there are some

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.240 
there you know that's why there are some
people<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.439> gym<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.979> get<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
people that go to gym and get the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.999 
people that go to gym and get the
results<00:01:32.610> almost<00:01:33.210> instantly<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.079> there<00:01:34.920> are

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
results almost instantly and there are

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
results almost instantly and there are
people<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.400> go<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> gym<00:01:35.970> all<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.329> lives<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
people that go to gym all the lives and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.740 
people that go to gym all the lives and
they<00:01:37.259> cannot<00:01:37.560> achieve<00:01:37.740> anything<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.759> so

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
they cannot achieve anything you know so

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.609 
they cannot achieve anything you know so
we're<00:01:40.110> kind<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.829> giving<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.549> jump<00:01:41.880> start<00:01:42.329> for

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
we're kind of giving the jump start for

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.929 
we're kind of giving the jump start for
getting<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> results<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.130> maintaining<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
getting the results and maintaining the

getting the results and maintaining the
results

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.160 

well<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.820> technology<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.539> we<00:01:54.719> use<00:01:54.750> is

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
well the technology that we use is

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.039 
well the technology that we use is
called<00:01:55.200> laser<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.430> major<00:01:56.789> right<00:01:57.600> now<00:01:57.780> is

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
called laser in the major right now is

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.560 
called laser in the major right now is
one<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.649> cutting-edge<00:01:59.640> technologies

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
one of the cutting-edge technologies

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.980 
one of the cutting-edge technologies
that<00:02:00.719> we<00:02:00.899> use<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.710> liposuction<00:02:02.600> one<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
that we use for liposuction one of the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.740 
that we use for liposuction one of the
main<00:02:04.710> advantages<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.520> these<00:02:05.729> technologies<00:02:06.600> is

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
main advantages of these technologies is

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.650 
main advantages of these technologies is
that<00:02:06.780> we<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.409> get<00:02:07.700> superior<00:02:08.700> salt<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.479> get

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that we can get superior salt we can get

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.990 
that we can get superior salt we can get
very<00:02:10.140> artistic<00:02:10.649> results<00:02:11.130> because<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:11.819> go

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
very artistic results because we can go

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.449 
very artistic results because we can go
with<00:02:12.569> very<00:02:12.900> very<00:02:13.170> small<00:02:14.360> probes<00:02:15.500> into<00:02:16.500> very

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
little bit but in the in some sense we

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.720 
little bit but in the in some sense we
are<00:03:14.920> actually<00:03:15.690> overriding<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:17.440> hard<00:03:18.100> part<00:03:18.460> of

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
the physical training when we do that

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.500 
the physical training when we do that
the<00:03:22.960> idea<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.320> as<00:03:23.740> soon<00:03:24.460> as<00:03:24.610> you<00:03:24.820> go<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.090> gym

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
the idea that as soon as you go to gym

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.710 
the idea that as soon as you go to gym
and<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.840> already<00:03:25.990> see<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.560> results<00:03:26.980> you

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
and you already see the results you

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.930 
and you already see the results you
actually<00:03:28.720> get<00:03:28.960> into<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.500> new<00:03:29.860> cycle<00:03:30.610> if<00:03:30.910> you

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
actually get into a new cycle if you

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.970 
actually get into a new cycle if you
like<00:03:31.240> you<00:03:31.450> know<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.900> actually<00:03:32.110> when<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.680> see

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
like you know you actually when you see

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.670 
like you know you actually when you see
it<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.460> you<00:03:34.120> realize<00:03:34.360> you<00:03:34.840> are<00:03:34.870> actually<00:03:35.110> more

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
it and you realize you are actually more

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.360 
it and you realize you are actually more
optimistic<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.780> actually<00:03:38.050> change<00:03:38.920> the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
abbot's

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.030 
abbot's
do<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.780> said<00:03:40.990> you<00:03:41.140> do<00:03:41.740> you<00:03:41.860> been

doing you I start eating well you start

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.440 
doing you I start eating well you start
going<00:03:44.200> to<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.470> gym<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:44.890> so<00:03:45.550> new<00:03:45.730> life<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.209> can

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
going to a gym and so new life I can

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.750 
going to a gym and so new life I can
actually<00:03:46.810> have<00:03:47.170> this<00:03:47.380> spark<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.280> change<00:03:48.580> the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
actually have this spark to change the

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.880 
actually have this spark to change the
whole<00:03:48.940> thing

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.800 

I<00:03:54.920> think<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:55.970> perfect<00:03:56.360> candidate<00:03:56.720> is

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
I think the perfect candidate is

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.530 
I think the perfect candidate is
somebody<00:03:57.260> there's<00:03:57.530> quite<00:03:58.040> motivated<00:03:58.940> into

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
somebody there's quite motivated into

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.200 
somebody there's quite motivated into
changing<00:04:00.230> their<00:04:00.950> their<00:04:01.370> lives<00:04:01.580> in<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.030> sense

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
changing their their lives in the sense

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.120 
changing their their lives in the sense
that<00:04:02.270> they<00:04:02.450> want<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.900> be<00:04:03.020> more<00:04:03.200> cleric<00:04:03.620> they

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
that they want to be more cleric they

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.220 
that they want to be more cleric they
want<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.490> look<00:04:04.640> younger<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.300> they<00:04:05.870> want<00:04:06.110> to

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
want to look younger and they want to

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:14.680 
want to look younger and they want to
look<00:04:06.380> more<00:04:06.560> static<00:04:12.730> he<00:04:13.730> has<00:04:13.940> been<00:04:14.210> using<00:04:14.450> the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
look more static he has been using the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.990 
look more static he has been using the
base<00:04:14.870> year<00:04:15.080> for<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:15.440> quite<00:04:15.770> long<00:04:15.800> time<00:04:16.220> I<00:04:16.549> think

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
base year for a quite long time I think

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.490 
base year for a quite long time I think
it<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.359> over<00:04:17.570> a<00:04:17.720> year<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:19.690> there<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:20.810> two<00:04:21.079> parts

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
it is over a year and there is two parts

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.870 
it is over a year and there is two parts
you<00:04:21.650> know<00:04:21.799> there<00:04:21.950> are<00:04:22.040> two<00:04:22.190> reports<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.700> this

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
you know there are two reports in this

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.300 
you know there are two reports in this
one<00:04:23.600> is<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.870> technology<00:04:24.590> that<00:04:24.740> we<00:04:24.890> use<00:04:24.920> it<00:04:25.280> is

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
one is the technology that we use it is

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
one is the technology that we use it is
for<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.670> Pacer

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330

this<00:04:33.380> kind<00:04:33.620> of<00:04:33.650> technology<00:04:34.040> you<00:04:35.030> can<00:04:35.240> go<00:04:35.419> to<00:04:35.480> a

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
this kind of technology you can go to a

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.830 
this kind of technology you can go to a
very<00:04:35.930> advanced<00:04:36.620> technique<00:04:37.510> that<00:04:38.510> is<00:04:38.690> the

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
very advanced technique that is the

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.930 
very advanced technique that is the
technique<00:04:39.140> we<00:04:39.440> use<00:04:39.620> for<00:04:39.860> dynamic<00:04:40.310> definition

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
technique we use for dynamic definition

starting<00:04:41.450> with<00:04:41.540> hospice<00:04:42.080> clinic<00:04:42.410> here<00:04:42.740> in

Australia<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.580> think<00:04:44.030> is<00:04:44.540> is<00:04:44.870> worthwhile<00:04:45.200> to

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
Australia I think is is worthwhile to

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.740

visit you know to see some point afters
to<00:04:48.050> meet<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.410> doctor<00:04:48.890> you<00:04:49.130> know<00:04:49.250> is<00:04:49.400> now<00:04:50.240> this

to meet the doctor you know is now this

kind of fun to front face-to-face

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.470 
kind of fun to front face-to-face
interaction<00:04:54.680> is<00:04:54.830> very<00:04:54.919> good<00:04:55.370> so<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:56.030> can<00:04:56.300> make

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
interaction is very good so you can make

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.020 
interaction is very good so you can make
the<00:04:56.660> decision
