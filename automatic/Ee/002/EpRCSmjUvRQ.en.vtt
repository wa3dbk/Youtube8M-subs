00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.040
 from lion from a city that smells 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.230
 final stink talks about something else and already 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.139
 today accompanies me hope gabriel 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.450
 that I think was made early because I think 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.980
 I said matosas let's see a pretty 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.989
 final is a final 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.610
 beautiful spectacular intense emotive 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.680
 you said the city is convulsing 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.989
 revolutionized the last end here is 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.210
 he played in the year 97 since they are 16 years old 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.160
 this city that this hobby required 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.349
 an epic moment like this and talking about 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.300
 the hobby I think we have to see 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.250
 this amateur that we discovered yesterday in 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.170
 a long long wait and leave all 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.480
 speaks and will explain what it was that 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.920
 happened in these hours 48 hours little 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.559
 least since the opening of the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.239
 lockers let's see is showing 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.940
 we are well passionate we are well 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.170
 impassioned, that is, what has been happening 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.089
 it matters how much time we lose 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.399
 only what we are interested in is having 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.559
 the ticket in the hand and gabriel we have 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.089
 that talk about soccer yesterday the microphones 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.310
 They rose light for the timely 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.560
 talk with rafa marquez 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.480
 it remains to say a pillar or the pillar 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.040
 most important of this beast so that the 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.890
 day tomorrow are playing the great 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.720
 final so is Marquez the bastion of 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.400
 the defense of lyon one of the least 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.470
 expired throughout the tournament 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.850
 one of the keys to what the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.170
 team of matosas as an argument 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.390
 solid to be addressed as the new 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.160
 Mexican tournament champion a football 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.020
 as offensive as the error starts 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.670
 from behind with rafa marquez that gives 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.710
 out to the team let's listen to the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.190
 mexican surely mundialista in 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.190
 Brazil 2014 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.420
 there is always nervousness before a great 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.330
 party like this so trying to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.040
 The time goes by quickly because one 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.290
 What you want is that this start 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.740
 game is I think equally important 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:51.500
 make it a title that I won in 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.500
 europe I think they are all worth the same 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.509
 I think that adding one more title to 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.630
 repertoire I think it gives even more 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.270
 value so I'm not in my final stretch 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.250
 of my career and it's a title that is in 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.470
 a very important game I think we 'll see 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.750
 a tactical war tomorrow 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.430

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.599
