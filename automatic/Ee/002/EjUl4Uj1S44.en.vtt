 by a 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.760
 we want to present the wealth and the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.850
 amplitude of influences of the Greek on 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.070
 the modern painters from manÃ© and 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.680
 throughout the entire 20th century in that 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.290
 meaning the Greek is the painter who 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.870
 includes more decisively the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.300
 main movements that since 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.630
 then they happen manes esam the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.180
 cubism picasso expressionism are the

 American paint is made with dust and 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.460
 painting after the second 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.460
 World War 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.230
 and the taste for 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.990
 Grays to Cezanne is influenced by the appearance 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.900
 constructive for picasso and cubism 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.670
 the last Greek will be key later in the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.770
 Orphism influences the ability

 constructive color in the expression 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.130

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.620
 comes from the bottom of the box the

 figures later in the case of polo there 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.580
 a very marked influence of the 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.770
 greco and at the same time of picasso that 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.540
 is influenced in turn by the Greek and

 orozco that is influenced by picasso and 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.800
 by greco with which the density 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.460
 decreasing influences are
