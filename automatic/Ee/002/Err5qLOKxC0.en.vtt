remove the lily from the main stem I

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.459

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
recommend putting them on a paper plate

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.500 
recommend putting them on a paper plate
or<00:00:34.739> some<00:00:35.130> type<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.309> surface<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.910> actually<00:00:36.210> cut

or some type of surface to actually cut

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.209 
or some type of surface to actually cut
I'm<00:00:36.960> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> use<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> sharp<00:00:37.559> knife<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:38.129> our

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
I'm going to use a sharp knife for our

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.590 
I'm going to use a sharp knife for our
demonstration<00:00:38.790> purposes<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.420> your

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
demonstration purposes but with your

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.170 
demonstration purposes but with your
students<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.170> recommend<00:00:40.890> using<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.340> plastic

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
students I recommend using a plastic

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.299 
students I recommend using a plastic
knife<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.320> they<00:00:43.410> don't<00:00:43.559> cut<00:00:43.710> their<00:00:43.920> fingers

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
knife so they don't cut their fingers

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.279 
knife so they don't cut their fingers
but<00:00:44.940> it'll<00:00:45.120> still<00:00:45.300> cut<00:00:45.570> through<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.079> plant

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
but it'll still cut through the plant

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.490 
but it'll still cut through the plant
material<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:46.890> very<00:00:47.070> soft<00:00:48.500> you

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
material because it's very soft you

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.229 
material because it's very soft you
should<00:00:49.710> cut<00:00:49.920> through<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:51.750> lily<00:00:52.230> petal<00:00:53.239> very

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
should cut through the lily petal very

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.400 
should cut through the lily petal very
gently<00:00:56.000> then<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.180> sort<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.360> peel<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.350> back

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
gently then just sort of peel that back

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.340 
gently then just sort of peel that back
and<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.120> break<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.690> off<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.260> see

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and you can break it off you can see

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.500 
and you can break it off you can see
where<00:01:01.469> we've<00:01:01.590> cut<00:01:01.859> there<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.329> that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
where we've cut there just to get that

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
where we've cut there just to get that
open<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:04.260> what<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.589> want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.070> get

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
open because what we want to do is get

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.070 
open because what we want to do is get
to<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.400> inside<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.360> flower<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:06.960> can

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to the inside of the flower so we can

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.230 
to the inside of the flower so we can
see<00:01:07.200> those<00:01:07.350> parts<00:01:07.770> down<00:01:07.979> inside<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.090> we've

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
see those parts down inside so we've

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.230 
see those parts down inside so we've
moved<00:01:09.479> removed<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> petal<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:12.000> we're<00:01:12.119> going

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
moved removed the petal and we're going

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.670 
moved removed the petal and we're going
to<00:01:12.299> spread<00:01:12.479> these<00:01:12.659> other<00:01:12.840> petals<00:01:13.110> apart<00:01:13.560> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
to spread these other petals apart a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
to spread these other petals apart a
little<00:01:13.830> bit<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.310> down<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.000> there

that Center one out then we're going to
pull<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.650> right<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.630> like<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
pull that right out like so so the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.800 
pull that right out like so so the
statement<00:01:32.250> actually<00:01:32.939> has<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> anther<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
statement actually has the anther and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.780 
statement actually has the anther and
the<00:01:33.900> filament<00:01:34.200> attached<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.670> that's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the filament attached to it and that's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.039 
the filament attached to it and that's
how<00:01:35.909> they're<00:01:36.030> attached<00:01:36.329> down<00:01:36.540> at<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> bottom

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
how they're attached down at the bottom

ovary<00:02:16.020> because<00:02:16.800> which<00:02:17.099> we<00:02:17.220> want<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.459> do<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.730> get

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
ovary because which we want to do is get

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.740 
ovary because which we want to do is get
inside<00:02:18.510> there<00:02:19.849> so<00:02:20.849> we<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.060> see<00:02:21.180> those<00:02:21.300> ovules

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
inside there so we can see those ovules

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.120 
inside there so we can see those ovules
inside<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.410> ovary<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:25.290> often<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.650> textbook

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
inside the ovary so often in textbook

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.640 
inside the ovary so often in textbook
images<00:02:27.030> that's<00:02:27.180> what<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.540> see<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.410> flower

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
images that's what we see is the flower

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.410 
images that's what we see is the flower
that's<00:02:28.920> split<00:02:29.220> open<00:02:29.520> like<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.120> all<00:02:30.300> the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
that's split open like that and all the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.080 
that's split open like that and all the
parts<00:02:30.900> are<00:02:31.020> labeled<00:02:31.410> but<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.489> having<00:02:33.000> an

parts are labeled but but having an

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.130 
parts are labeled but but having an
actual<00:02:33.330> flower<00:02:33.600> there<00:02:33.810> we're<00:02:33.900> going<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.080> be

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
actual flower there we're going to be

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.720 
actual flower there we're going to be
able<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.290> see<00:02:34.500> all<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.800> then<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.400> recommend

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
able to see all that then I recommend

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.900 
able to see all that then I recommend
using<00:02:36.209> some<00:02:37.140> type<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.440> hand<00:02:37.680> lens<00:02:37.910> magnifying

glass so you can look up very closely
with<00:02:41.670> our<00:02:41.819> flower<00:02:42.060> cut<00:02:42.390> open<00:02:42.690> now<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.349> see

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
with our flower cut open now you can see

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.440 
with our flower cut open now you can see
all<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.340> flower<00:02:44.580> parts<00:02:45.000> let's<00:02:45.269> just

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
all of the flower parts let's just

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.630 
all of the flower parts let's just
review<00:02:45.840> those<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:46.800> have<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.040> petals<00:02:47.459> which

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
review those we have the petals which

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.750 
review those we have the petals which
are<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.819> orange<00:02:47.970> parts<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.810> outside<00:02:49.760> we

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
are the orange parts on the outside we

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.479 
are the orange parts on the outside we
have<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.420> stamen<00:02:52.010> which<00:02:53.010> are<00:02:53.160> all<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.280> these

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
have the stamen which are all of these

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.120 
have the stamen which are all of these
are<00:02:54.060> individual<00:02:54.569> stamens<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.860> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
are individual stamens and this is the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.770 
are individual stamens and this is the
anther<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.790> filament<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.390> makes<00:02:57.600> up

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
anther and the filament that makes up

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.949 
anther and the filament that makes up
this<00:02:57.959> statement<00:02:58.200> then<00:02:58.890> we<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.959> pistil

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
this statement then we have the pistil

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.449 
this statement then we have the pistil
that's<00:03:01.290> runs<00:03:01.560> down<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.010> center<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.340> the

these all together make up the parts of

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.270 
these all together make up the parts of
the<00:03:14.010> flower<00:03:15.709> after<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.769> have<00:03:16.890> your<00:03:17.010> flower
