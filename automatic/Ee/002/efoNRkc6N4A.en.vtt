00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.790
 a new video here on technology 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.370
 every year, the iphone comes from here 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.980
 and it is not over for a long time 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.699
 may we finally have your newest iphone 6 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.140
 marvel s and in the face of this 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.300
 festivities on 19 september I have 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.430
 me with elias at another 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.619
 really highly recommended technology 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.840
 youtube-link in the video description 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.689
 hand set the table and we have 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.270
 our wishes just on paper 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.059
 which ones apart from 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.480
 the rumored our personal 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.910
 wishes to the iphone 6 it would be in the sense 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.910
 elias i pass the word on 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.449
 Thank you Ben we know it all from the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.010
 apple watch and most likely 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.909
 it is also in the iphone 6 s to use 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.250
 come 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.800
 The speech is from forster of the new 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.449
 input method the solid of light weight 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.309
 press differs and thereby 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.080
 completely new ways of operation 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.060
 allows and I think in the six it 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.340
 guaranteed to save a lot of time 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.640
 second , the better me too 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.180
 Camera since the lens of the iphone 6 now 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.820
 already felt meter from the housing 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.450
 A new sensor should stick out 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.429
 for example, recordings in 2015 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.009
 standard 4k will not be a problem 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.830
 maybe slow motion included in 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.590
 Fulda should not have any 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.569
 represent obstacles and actually 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.880
 Surprisingly, this will also 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.069
 most likely implemented for that 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.289
 what so the round just on rumors 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.799
 Power makes expectations seem even higher 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.409
 it is even the talk of 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:52.039
 high quality good as well 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.259
 for example, a beginner dslr and 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.420
 that my goodness that would be a real one 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.920
 quantum leap in an age in 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.289
 which already a large part of the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.200
 competition on displays with more than 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.810
 1080p sets depends on your normal model 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.840
 just behind with 720p 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.480
 that's why 1080p panel would be in the normal 6 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.790
 s and maybe even 1 2 k display im 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.280
 6 s plus more than desirable 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.489
 as penultimate we come now to the 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.709
 thinner bams that the iphone 6 plus 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.230
 larger than other smartphones with 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.360
 a lot more display is coming 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.400
 not from somewhere because it has 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.970
 apparently also the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.040
 biggest texts countries and by 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.290
 You could also reduce this 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.019
 Loosely put on a larger display 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.019
 without sacrificing mobility 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.120
 make and that he is really horny 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.129
 Lastly , we come to one 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.050
 wish I really every year on 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.390
 new wishes and that would be one 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.310
 waterproof iphone i know it is 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.080
 unlikely because of the connections 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.910
 would certainly not cover 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.340
 apples design language fit 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.230
 well , I thought so too 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.940
 the antenna stripe but that is one 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.040
 another topic so it remains exciting 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.720
 to wait for her soon with ours 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.730
 beloved iphones go for a dive 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.170
 then we are already at the end 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.620
 arrived is actually remains 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.120
 exciting what apple now on 9 september 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.520
 will introduce us what wishes 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.670
 actually been implemented 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.270
 the other five people still see 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.150
 would like to 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.160
 secondly, I look on the part of ilias in the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.480
 video description over there i have 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.460
 a link to the video 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.670
 upward channel drives in this sense can 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.470
 I only say if you like it 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.990
 also up if it is not you 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.030
 has a thumb down 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.340
 Feedback in the comments and in 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.910
 red subscribers to fight even 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.610
 to press 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.010
 and if you have a few wishes to the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.480
 iPhone 6 says it best 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.570
 also in the comments 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.880
 in the wiki, I'm looking forward to that 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.500
 next video with you goodbye 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.500
 or subordinate benedict
