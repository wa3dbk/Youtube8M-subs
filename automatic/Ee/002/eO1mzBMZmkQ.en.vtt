00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
this that made sledgehammer create the

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.760 
this that made sledgehammer create the
fucking<00:05:23.970> jumping<00:05:24.510> movement<00:05:25.110> fest<00:05:25.410> that<00:05:25.620> was

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
fucking jumping movement fest that was

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.250 
fucking jumping movement fest that was
advanced<00:05:26.310> warfare<00:05:26.730> people<00:05:27.270> were<00:05:27.360> too<00:05:27.600> slow<00:05:27.810> so

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
advanced warfare people were too slow so

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.570 
advanced warfare people were too slow so
they<00:05:28.380> needed<00:05:28.560> something<00:05:28.890> sped<00:05:29.280> up<00:05:29.430> and

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
they needed something sped up and

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.760 
they needed something sped up and
unfortunately<00:05:30.240> we<00:05:30.420> ended<00:05:30.660> up<00:05:30.750> with<00:05:30.960> that<00:05:31.170> but

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
unfortunately we ended up with that but

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.260 
unfortunately we ended up with that but
