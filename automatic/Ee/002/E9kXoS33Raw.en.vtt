00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.269
 exciting with the combat that we 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.370
 wait this Saturday Saturday omar chávez el 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.330
 son of the great Mexican champion 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.900
 confronting daniel galen sandoval 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.830
 first with you my dear omar chávez 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.500
 what has been spoken in the networks 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.830
 social let me show you these these 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.440
 tweets that you have put yourself 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.660
 galeno is the picture you had of 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.970
 omar with your face like a white and you 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.790
 public omar is worth dreaming if your 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.439
 family and friends tell you and raise the 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.780
 telling them you're going to win and that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.940
 It will not happen if what I would like 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.540
 to say is that your family tells you 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.700
 often they spend going to knock him out 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.470
 it's not that my family supports me or 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.330
 that someone do a lens or 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.000
 take me to heaven but that my work 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.830
 my qualities and my strength above 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.680
 ring says it and I have no doubt 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.960
 how good it will be because never again 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.150

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.630

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.970
 win and we go like me and the god what

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.200
 in my quality god varied with sparring 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.150
 that expanded with the opposite to the canvas 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.890
 they have been about to beat him and I'm not 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.270
 being that why win not because 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.860

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.050
