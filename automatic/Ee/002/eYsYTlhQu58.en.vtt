happening when we start a project I

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.830 
happening when we start a project I
think<00:00:36.610> especially<00:00:36.700> with<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.150> games<00:00:37.390> it's

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
think especially with the games it's

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.680 
think especially with the games it's
it's<00:00:38.230> a<00:00:38.590> it's<00:00:38.950> a<00:00:39.640> hard<00:00:39.910> thing<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.420> kind<00:00:40.570> of

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
it's a it's a hard thing to kind of

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.520 
it's a it's a hard thing to kind of
fully<00:00:41.020> understand<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:42.040> size<00:00:42.340> of<00:00:42.640> it<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.530> the

fully understand the size of it and the

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.260 
fully understand the size of it and the
complexity<00:00:45.070> of<00:00:45.220> it<00:00:45.490> because<00:00:45.790> it's<00:00:45.970> it's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
complexity of it because it's it's

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.790

more interesting than other things we
had<00:01:14.950> looked<00:01:15.190> at<00:01:15.310> in<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.610> past<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.869> way<00:01:17.229> you

why<00:01:25.300> you<00:01:25.660> know<00:01:26.080> especially<00:01:26.259> this<00:01:26.979> game<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.640> so

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
why you know especially this game is so

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.420 
why you know especially this game is so
interesting<00:01:29.050> because<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.440> is<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:30.340> know

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
interesting because it is you know

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.760 
interesting because it is you know
people<00:01:30.729> ask<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.420> a<00:01:31.600> film<00:01:32.020> or<00:01:32.200> is<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:32.470> a<00:01:32.560> game

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
people ask is it a film or is it a game

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.490 
people ask is it a film or is it a game
and<00:01:33.009> there<00:01:33.430> is<00:01:33.550> no<00:01:33.729> difference<00:01:34.149> not<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.990> me<00:01:35.140> you

and there is no difference not to me you

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.440 
and there is no difference not to me you
could<00:01:35.680> sit<00:01:35.920> there<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.250> watch<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.549> as<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:37.090> film

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
could sit there and watch it as a film

could sit there and watch it as a film
so<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.740> way<00:01:38.979> of<00:01:39.250> trying<00:01:39.580> to<00:01:39.700> musically<00:01:40.240> tell<00:01:40.420> a

sit there for five six hours and they
you<00:04:36.419> don't<00:04:36.660> want<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.050> kill<00:04:37.320> them<00:04:37.500> with<00:04:37.919> it<00:04:38.160> with

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
you don't want to kill them with it with

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.270 
you don't want to kill them with it with
this<00:04:38.580> theme<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:40.110> keeps<00:04:40.410> appearing<00:04:40.830> all<00:04:41.100> the

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
this theme that keeps appearing all the

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.520 
this theme that keeps appearing all the
time<00:04:41.490> so<00:04:41.820> I<00:04:42.030> think<00:04:42.330> what<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.960> challenge<00:04:43.380> with

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
time so I think what the challenge with

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.100 
time so I think what the challenge with
this<00:04:43.740> game<00:04:44.580> was<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.970> try<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.240> figure<00:04:45.570> out<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.780> way

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
this game was to try to figure out a way

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.909 
this game was to try to figure out a way
of<00:04:47.120> musically<00:04:48.120> telling<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.810> story<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.500> the

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
of musically telling a story and the

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.800 
of musically telling a story and the
having<00:04:50.310> development<00:04:50.910> of<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.120> characters<00:04:51.600> but

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
having development of the characters but

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.580 
having development of the characters but
not<00:04:52.139> necessarily<00:04:53.060> become<00:04:54.060> bit<00:04:54.990> make<00:04:55.199> it<00:04:55.229> be

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
not necessarily become bit make it be

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.279 
not necessarily become bit make it be
repetitive<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:57.360> know<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.720> thing<00:04:57.900> is<00:04:58.050> is<00:04:58.199> that

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
repetitive you know the thing is is that

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.390 
repetitive you know the thing is is that
unlike<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:58.620> film<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.699> only<00:05:00.060> time<00:05:00.330> you<00:05:00.660> actually

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
unlike a film the only time you actually

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.370 
unlike a film the only time you actually
fully<00:05:02.400> understand<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.360> think<00:05:03.690> with<00:05:03.810> music<00:05:04.200> what

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
fully understand I think with music what

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.430 
fully understand I think with music what
we've<00:05:04.650> managed<00:05:05.039> to<00:05:05.099> actually<00:05:05.280> do<00:05:05.700> is<00:05:05.970> when<00:05:06.780> you

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
we've managed to actually do is when you

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.040 
we've managed to actually do is when you
have<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.830> time<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:08.280> sit<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.490> play<00:05:08.789> the<00:05:08.820> game

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
have the time to sit and play the game

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.790 
have the time to sit and play the game
because<00:05:10.050> we<00:05:10.289> don't<00:05:10.500> fully<00:05:11.660> understand<00:05:12.800> how

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
because we don't fully understand how

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.370 
because we don't fully understand how
much<00:05:14.190> you<00:05:14.460> know<00:05:14.580> how<00:05:15.030> it<00:05:15.240> really<00:05:15.840> will<00:05:16.139> work

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
much you know how it really will work

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.810 
much you know how it really will work
out<00:05:16.650> especially<00:05:17.010> with<00:05:17.250> this<00:05:17.400> gate<00:05:17.669> because

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
out especially with this gate because

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.129 
out especially with this gate because
you're<00:05:18.090> choosing<00:05:18.450> different<00:05:18.570> decisions

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
you're choosing different decisions

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.500 
you're choosing different decisions
constantly<00:05:20.070> unlike<00:05:21.000> some<00:05:21.330> of<00:05:21.419> the<00:05:21.450> other

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
constantly unlike some of the other

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.390 
constantly unlike some of the other
games<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.020> we've<00:05:22.260> worked<00:05:22.289> on<00:05:22.740> you<00:05:23.190> have<00:05:23.370> a

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
games that we've worked on you have a

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.730 
games that we've worked on you have a
very<00:05:23.820> clear<00:05:24.090> vision<00:05:24.150> of<00:05:24.690> what<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:25.139> end<00:05:25.260> story

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
very clear vision of what the end story

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.430 
very clear vision of what the end story
is<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.580> with<00:05:26.700> this<00:05:26.910> it's<00:05:27.599> just<00:05:27.750> so<00:05:28.080> exciting

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
is and with this it's just so exciting

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.430 
is and with this it's just so exciting
because<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.830> story<00:05:29.099> changes<00:05:29.389> so<00:05:30.389> the<00:05:31.050> music

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
because the story changes so the music

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.790 
because the story changes so the music
experience<00:05:32.010> changes<00:05:32.700> so<00:05:32.910> it<00:05:33.840> hands<00:05:34.139> plays<00:05:34.500> it

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
experience changes so it hands plays it

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.379 
experience changes so it hands plays it
tomorrow<00:05:35.220> you'll<00:05:35.910> have<00:05:36.150> a<00:05:36.180> different

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
tomorrow you'll have a different

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.290 
tomorrow you'll have a different
experience<00:05:37.050> musically<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:37.979> game<00:05:38.789> wise<00:05:39.060> than

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
experience musically and game wise than

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.360 
experience musically and game wise than
I<00:05:39.419> will<00:05:39.690> so<00:05:39.990> it's<00:05:40.500> always<00:05:40.950> going<00:05:41.130> to<00:05:41.190> keep

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
I will so it's always going to keep

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.080 
I will so it's always going to keep
changing

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
changing

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:54.220 
changing
you
