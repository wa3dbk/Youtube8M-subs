so<00:00:06.980> BMW<00:00:07.980> has<00:00:08.099> developed<00:00:08.519> their<00:00:08.610> cars<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.630> far

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
so BMW has developed their cars so far

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.560 
so BMW has developed their cars so far
they<00:00:10.260> are<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:10.650> sophisticated<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.670> so<00:00:12.210> amazing

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
they are so sophisticated and so amazing

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.870 
they are so sophisticated and so amazing
that<00:00:12.690> that<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.679> now<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.219> time<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.429> elevate

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
that that that now it's time to elevate

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.939 
that that that now it's time to elevate
the<00:00:15.000> drivers<00:00:15.389> how<00:00:15.780> do<00:00:15.839> they<00:00:15.990> do<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.289> they<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:16.740> it

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the drivers how do they do it they do it

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.160 
the drivers how do they do it they do it
the<00:00:17.070> exact<00:00:17.670> same<00:00:17.789> way<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.109> our

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
the exact same way that we do it in our

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.410 
the exact same way that we do it in our
racecars<00:00:19.650> they've<00:00:20.039> developed<00:00:20.279> an<00:00:20.550> app<00:00:20.760> that

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
racecars they've developed an app that

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.540 
racecars they've developed an app that
after<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:22.050> around<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.560> lap<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.220> pull<00:00:23.460> up

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
after you go around a lap you pull up

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.160 
after you go around a lap you pull up
the<00:00:23.640> app<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.150> look<00:00:24.359> at<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
the app you look at you can see the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.230 
the app you look at you can see the
performance<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.800> handling<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> braking<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
performance the handling the braking the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.419 
performance the handling the braking the
g-force<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.779> turn<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.590> then<00:00:28.949> compare<00:00:29.400> it

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
g-force that turn in and then compare it

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790 
g-force that turn in and then compare it
a<00:00:29.609> lap<00:00:29.880> after<00:00:30.150> lap<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:31.109> can<00:00:31.140> find<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.560> better

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
a lap after lap you can find a better

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.290 
a lap after lap you can find a better
way<00:00:32.009> when<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.250> see<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> better<00:00:32.640> way<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.180> when

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
way when you see a better way like when

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.660 
way when you see a better way like when
we<00:00:33.420> overlay<00:00:33.930> from<00:00:34.290> driver<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.739> driver<00:00:34.950> oh<00:00:35.190> he's

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
we overlay from driver to driver oh he's

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.280 
we overlay from driver to driver oh he's
braking<00:00:36.030> later<00:00:36.210> oh<00:00:36.450> he's<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> throttle

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
braking later oh he's on the throttle

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.720 
braking later oh he's on the throttle
sooner<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.280> done

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
sooner it can be done

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.639 
sooner it can be done
it'll<00:00:39.120> elevate<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> driver<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.290> even<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
it'll elevate the driver to even the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.889 
it'll elevate the driver to even the
performance<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.610> BMW<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.510> capable<00:00:42.840> of

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
performance of what a BMW is capable of

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.950 
performance of what a BMW is capable of
doing<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.770> another<00:00:44.129> thought<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.700> how<00:00:45.420> BMW

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
doing just another thought of how BMW

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.630 
doing just another thought of how BMW
can<00:00:46.140> not<00:00:46.320> only<00:00:46.469> improve<00:00:46.620> their<00:00:46.950> cars<00:00:47.129> but

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
can not only improve their cars but

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.340 
can not only improve their cars but
improve<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.420> spacer<00:00:48.809> that's<00:00:48.989> behind<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
improve the spacer that's behind the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.970 
improve the spacer that's behind the
steering<00:00:49.530> wheel<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.920> what<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:51.829> what<00:00:52.829> we

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
steering wheel like what we do what we

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.150 
steering wheel like what we do what we
did<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.579> built<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.360> fantastic<00:00:55.020> track<00:00:55.829> app

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
did was we built a fantastic track app

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.220 
did was we built a fantastic track app

at your run on the track in great detail
and<00:01:27.270> an<00:01:27.659> intuitive<00:01:27.990> way<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.950> understand<00:01:29.430> first

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and an intuitive way to understand first

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.609 
and an intuitive way to understand first
of<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:29.939> your<00:01:30.119> lap<00:01:30.270> times<00:01:30.600> were<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.500> then

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
of all what your lap times were but then

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.380 
of all what your lap times were but then
secondly<00:01:31.979> exactly<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.850> did<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.210> turn

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
secondly exactly what you did in turn

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.090 
secondly exactly what you did in turn
three<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.320> your<00:01:34.530> throttle<00:01:35.009> position

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
three what was your throttle position

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.359 
three what was your throttle position
how<00:01:36.090> did<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.479> how<00:01:37.320> did<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.009> lap

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
how did you how did you get to that lap

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.310 
how did you how did you get to that lap
time<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.909> they're<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.990> coolest

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
time and they're really the coolest

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.760 
time and they're really the coolest
feature<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.720> compare<00:01:43.200> your

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
feature I think is you can compare your

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010 
feature I think is you can compare your
recording<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.759> your<00:01:44.790> instructors<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.810> maybe

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
recording with your instructors or maybe

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.980 
recording with your instructors or maybe
a<00:01:46.110> friend<00:01:46.409> who<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.740> faster<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.780> both

recordings you email them to each other

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.120 
recordings you email them to each other
you<00:01:51.180> open<00:01:51.450> them<00:01:51.540> both<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> app<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.560> you

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
you open them both up in the app and you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.880 
you open them both up in the app and you
can<00:01:53.280> actually<00:01:53.460> overlay<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.509> data<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.170> such<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
can actually overlay the data in such a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.850 
can actually overlay the data in such a
way<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.579> see<00:01:56.880> why<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:58.140> turn<00:01:58.469> three

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
way that you can see why on turn three

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.039 
way that you can see why on turn three
was<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.340> driver<00:01:59.790> slower<00:02:00.180> than<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> other<00:02:00.689> one

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
was one driver slower than the other one

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.469 
was one driver slower than the other one
one<00:02:01.380> driver<00:02:01.590> for<00:02:01.890> example<00:02:02.280> came<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.119> slower

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
one driver for example came in slower

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.899 
one driver for example came in slower
and<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.770> was<00:02:04.979> able<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.280> accelerate<00:02:05.549> through

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and and was able to accelerate through

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.639 
and and was able to accelerate through
the<00:02:06.119> turn<00:02:06.360> better<00:02:06.719> getting<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> throttle

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
the turn better getting on the throttle

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.359 
the turn better getting on the throttle
earlier

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
earlier

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.830 
earlier
which<00:02:08.580> paid<00:02:08.880> dividends<00:02:09.330> over<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.690> long

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
which paid dividends over the long

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.140 
which paid dividends over the long
straight<00:02:10.310> resulting<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.459> better<00:02:11.489> lap<00:02:11.849> time

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
straight resulting in a better lap time

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.850 
straight resulting in a better lap time
and<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:12.989> can<00:02:13.140> really<00:02:13.290> get<00:02:13.500> into<00:02:13.739> these
