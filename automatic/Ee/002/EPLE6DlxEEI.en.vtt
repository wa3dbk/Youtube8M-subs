that<00:01:09.550> you'll<00:01:09.790> also<00:01:09.910> be<00:01:10.119> drawing<00:01:10.390> three<00:01:10.750> tiles

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
that you'll also be drawing three tiles

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.499 
that you'll also be drawing three tiles
into<00:01:11.350> your<00:01:11.619> hand<00:01:11.950> one<00:01:12.729> player<00:01:12.970> will<00:01:13.210> start

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
into your hand one player will start

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.660 
into your hand one player will start
first<00:01:13.720> by<00:01:13.869> placing<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.380> tile<00:01:14.619> and<00:01:14.890> then<00:01:15.310> drawing

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
first by placing a tile and then drawing

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.700 
first by placing a tile and then drawing
another<00:01:16.060> tile<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.659> then<00:01:17.050> players<00:01:17.320> will<00:01:17.530> take

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
another tile and then players will take

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.800 
another tile and then players will take
turns<00:01:18.009> now<00:01:18.640> when<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:18.880> place<00:01:19.150> it<00:01:19.180> on<00:01:19.420> your<00:01:19.600> turn

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
turns now when you place it on your turn

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.210 
turns now when you place it on your turn
the<00:01:20.200> only<00:01:20.350> rules<00:01:20.560> are<00:01:20.740> that<00:01:20.770> you<00:01:20.920> have<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.070> just

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
the only rules are that you have to just

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.609 
the only rules are that you have to just
place<00:01:21.430> it<00:01:21.610> next<00:01:22.330> to<00:01:22.570> another<00:01:22.869> tile<00:01:23.170> you<00:01:23.380> can't

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
place it next to another tile you can't

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.440 
place it next to another tile you can't
have<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.369> can't<00:01:24.399> have<00:01:24.729> it<00:01:24.850> like<00:01:24.880> half<00:01:25.210> on<00:01:25.420> a

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
have you can't have it like half on a

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.420 
have you can't have it like half on a
town<00:01:25.690> no<00:01:25.960> diagonal<00:01:26.470> so<00:01:27.009> this<00:01:27.160> needs<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.369> be

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
town no diagonal so this needs to be

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.790 
town no diagonal so this needs to be
next<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.820> another<00:01:28.149> tile<00:01:28.509> and<00:01:28.840> players<00:01:29.649> are

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
next to another tile and players are

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.830 
next to another tile and players are
going<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.009> be<00:01:30.100> attempting<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.759> make<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.180> large

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
going to be attempting to make a large

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.749 
going to be attempting to make a large
group<00:01:32.170> so<00:01:32.320> if<00:01:32.410> I<00:01:32.470> have<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.680> robots<00:01:33.070> this<00:01:33.610> would

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
group so if I have the robots this would

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.550 
group so if I have the robots this would
be<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.880> good<00:01:34.090> idea<00:01:34.210> for<00:01:34.450> me<00:01:34.750> because<00:01:35.110> at<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.410> end

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
be a good idea for me because at the end

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.230 
be a good idea for me because at the end
of<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.740> game<00:01:35.950> you're<00:01:36.460> gonna<00:01:36.550> score<00:01:36.850> points

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
of the game you're gonna score points

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.719 
of the game you're gonna score points
equal<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.630> your<00:01:37.899> largest<00:01:38.320> group<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:39.340> if<00:01:39.429> I<00:01:39.520> was

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
equal to your largest group so if I was

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.850 
equal to your largest group so if I was
the<00:01:39.880> robots<00:01:40.270> for<00:01:40.450> example<00:01:40.899> and<00:01:41.140> this<00:01:41.530> was<00:01:41.710> the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
the robots for example and this was the

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.469 
the robots for example and this was the
endgame<00:01:42.310> scoring<00:01:42.759> which<00:01:43.090> would<00:01:43.270> not<00:01:43.450> be

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
endgame scoring which would not be

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.480 
endgame scoring which would not be
because<00:01:43.720> there's<00:01:43.929> only<00:01:43.990> four<00:01:44.259> tiles<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.830> would

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
because there's only four tiles I would

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.669 
because there's only four tiles I would
get<00:01:45.670> four<00:01:45.970> points<00:01:46.450> because<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.259> have<00:01:47.470> four

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
get four points because I have four

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.350 
get four points because I have four
robots<00:01:47.920> next<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.789> each<00:01:48.910> other

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
robots next to each other

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.389 
robots next to each other
however<00:01:50.050> there's<00:01:50.200> other<00:01:50.350> things<00:01:51.160> this<00:01:51.340> is

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
however there's other things this is

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.190 
however there's other things this is
green<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:51.940> it's<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.119> battery<00:01:52.509> that's<00:01:52.990> worth

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
green and it's a battery that's worth

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.440 
green and it's a battery that's worth
three<00:01:53.619> points<00:01:54.100> for<00:01:54.400> me<00:01:54.579> just<00:01:55.180> like<00:01:55.299> this

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
three points for me just like this

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.569 
three points for me just like this
treasure<00:01:55.869> chest<00:01:56.259> here<00:01:56.409> is<00:01:56.619> worth<00:01:57.220> three

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
treasure chest here is worth three

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.270 
treasure chest here is worth three
points<00:01:57.820> for<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.570> Pirates<00:01:58.990> there's<00:01:59.979> also

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
points for the Pirates there's also

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.789 
points for the Pirates there's also
things<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.360> will<00:02:01.689> deliberately<00:02:02.409> attack

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
things that will deliberately attack

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.370 
things that will deliberately attack
something<00:02:03.100> for<00:02:03.369> example<00:02:03.759> if<00:02:03.970> this<00:02:04.570> is<00:02:04.899> placed

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
something for example if this is placed

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.830 
something for example if this is placed
like<00:02:05.560> here<00:02:05.829> this<00:02:06.460> cancels<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.509> thing<00:02:07.689> it's

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
like here this cancels the thing it's

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.310 
like here this cancels the thing it's
next<00:02:08.079> to<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:09.100> Kraken<00:02:09.729> cancels<00:02:10.239> out<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.720> pirate

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
next to the Kraken cancels out a pirate

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
tile on your turn so you're going to

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.810 
tile on your turn so you're going to
draw<00:02:35.260> in<00:02:35.500> place<00:02:35.769> I'm<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.519> you're<00:02:36.640> going<00:02:36.760> to

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
draw in place I'm so you're going to

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.020 
draw in place I'm so you're going to
place<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.329> then<00:02:37.780> draw<00:02:38.110> or<00:02:38.549> move<00:02:39.549> your<00:02:39.790> base

place and then draw or move your base

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.940 
place and then draw or move your base
tile<00:02:40.299> if<00:02:40.570> it's<00:02:40.840> already<00:02:41.200> on<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.470> board<00:02:41.650> and

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
tile if it's already on the board and

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.800 
tile if it's already on the board and
players<00:02:42.610> when<00:02:42.850> they<00:02:42.970> play<00:02:43.150> these<00:02:43.360> there's<00:02:43.630> all

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
players when they play these there's all

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.020 
players when they play these there's all
sorts<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.200> tiles<00:02:44.530> some<00:02:44.769> have<00:02:44.950> negatives<00:02:45.820> all

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
sorts of tiles some have negatives all

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.849 
sorts of tiles some have negatives all
over<00:02:46.359> them<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.720> you'll<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:46.959> placing<00:02:47.500> them<00:02:47.620> down

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
over them so you'll be placing them down

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.310 
over them so you'll be placing them down
and<00:02:48.070> again<00:02:48.730> your<00:02:48.940> goal<00:02:49.209> is<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.570> make<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
and again your goal is to make the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.319 
and again your goal is to make the
largest<00:02:50.829> group<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.430> can<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.910> one<00:02:52.090> color

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
largest group that you can of one color

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.789 
largest group that you can of one color
see<00:02:52.540> how<00:02:52.570> big<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.959> group<00:02:53.049> of<00:02:53.230> red<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.590> right

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
see how big the group of red is right

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.310 
see how big the group of red is right
here<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:54.730> red<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.120> probably<00:02:55.329> winning<00:02:55.959> at<00:02:56.109> this

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
here so red is probably winning at this

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.190 
here so red is probably winning at this
point<00:02:57.180> some<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.360> tiles<00:02:58.660> when<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.930> place

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
point some of the tiles when you place

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.170 
point some of the tiles when you place
them<00:02:59.470> will<00:02:59.830> have<00:03:00.010> different<00:03:00.280> effects<00:03:00.819> on<00:03:01.000> them

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
them will have different effects on them

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.770 
them will have different effects on them
for<00:03:01.330> example<00:03:01.569> this<00:03:01.840> one<00:03:02.050> here<00:03:02.080> when<00:03:02.620> I

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
for example this one here when I

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.199 
for example this one here when I
place<00:03:02.990> this<00:03:03.230> tile<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.709> can<00:03:04.280> rotate<00:03:04.520> one<00:03:05.030> other

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
place this tile I can rotate one other

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.490 
place this tile I can rotate one other
tile<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.810> play

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
tile in play

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.500 
tile in play
that's<00:03:07.370> right<00:03:07.580> robots<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.090> don't<00:03:08.240> have<00:03:08.360> that

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
that's right robots you don't have that

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.110 
that's right robots you don't have that
big<00:03:08.660> group<00:03:08.900> anymore<00:03:09.220> others<00:03:10.220> allow<00:03:10.670> me<00:03:10.910> to

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
big group anymore others allow me to

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.140 
big group anymore others allow me to
switch<00:03:11.450> any<00:03:11.750> two<00:03:12.020> tiles<00:03:12.440> in<00:03:12.680> play<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.280> then

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
switch any two tiles in play and then

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.780 
switch any two tiles in play and then
this<00:03:14.480> one<00:03:14.750> here<00:03:15.140> allows<00:03:15.530> me<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.920> take<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.430> tile

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
this one here allows me to take a tile

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.059 
this one here allows me to take a tile
off<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.690> board<00:03:17.900> put<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.350> my<00:03:18.530> hand<00:03:18.860> and

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
off the board put it in my hand and

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.610 
off the board put it in my hand and
replace<00:03:19.850> with<00:03:20.000> another<00:03:20.060> tile<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:21.260> much<00:03:21.410> for

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
replace with another tile so much for

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.460 
replace with another tile so much for
the<00:03:21.709> ninjas<00:03:22.160> giant<00:03:22.970> grouping<00:03:23.360> this<00:03:24.110> will<00:03:24.319> go

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
the ninjas giant grouping this will go

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.199 
the ninjas giant grouping this will go
until<00:03:24.650> all<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:25.069> tiles<00:03:25.400> have<00:03:25.459> been<00:03:25.760> played<00:03:26.000> at

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
until all the tiles have been played at

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.970 
until all the tiles have been played at
that<00:03:26.360> point<00:03:26.630> like<00:03:26.780> I<00:03:26.959> said<00:03:27.200> you'll<00:03:27.680> look<00:03:27.830> at

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
that point like I said you'll look at

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.250 
that point like I said you'll look at
your<00:03:28.010> biggest<00:03:28.489> group<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.090> have

is the winner pirates ninjas robots and
zombies<00:03:38.209> like<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:38.510> said<00:03:38.690> it's<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.900> tile<00:03:39.140> placing

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
zombies like I said it's a tile placing

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.070 
zombies like I said it's a tile placing
game<00:03:39.920> as<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.519> very<00:03:40.730> simple<00:03:41.090> one<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.750> mean<00:03:41.930> you're

just making a big group of your own and
you<00:03:45.290> have<00:03:45.320> three<00:03:45.709> tiles<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:46.130> pick<00:03:46.280> for<00:03:46.430> him

you have three tiles to pick for him

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:47.740 
you have three tiles to pick for him
once<00:03:46.640> you<00:03:46.730> play<00:03:46.880> your<00:03:47.060> base<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:47.390> have<00:03:47.480> four

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
once you play your base you have four

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.330 
once you play your base you have four
tiles<00:03:47.989> to<00:03:48.200> pick<00:03:48.350> from<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:49.040> might<00:03:49.220> as<00:03:49.310> well

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
tiles to pick from you might as well

well this is gonna help someone else out
so<00:04:10.430> I'll<00:04:10.519> put<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.790> somewhere<00:04:10.970> else

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
so I'll put it somewhere else

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.050 
so I'll put it somewhere else
now<00:04:12.049> the<00:04:12.110> tiles<00:04:12.500> that<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.769> switch<00:04:13.310> tiles<00:04:13.640> or

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
now the tiles that you switch tiles or

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.030 
now the tiles that you switch tiles or
rotate<00:04:14.600> tiles<00:04:14.870> those<00:04:15.500> are<00:04:15.650> pretty<00:04:15.829> powerful

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
rotate tiles those are pretty powerful

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.190 
rotate tiles those are pretty powerful
if<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:16.640> have<00:04:16.850> one<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.660> might<00:04:17.840> want<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.019> hang

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
if you have one you might want to hang

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.870 
if you have one you might want to hang
on<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.560> it<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.829> final<00:04:19.160> round<00:04:19.190> because<00:04:19.760> of

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
on to it to the final round because of

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.849 
on to it to the final round because of
how<00:04:20.000> useful<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.660> is<00:04:20.780> if<00:04:21.109> you're<00:04:21.620> playing<00:04:21.769> with

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
how useful it is if you're playing with

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.710 
how useful it is if you're playing with
two<00:04:22.100> players<00:04:22.400> each<00:04:22.640> player<00:04:22.700> plays<00:04:23.180> two<00:04:23.450> things

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
two players each player plays two things

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.420 
two players each player plays two things
so<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:23.960> might<00:04:24.169> be<00:04:24.320> pirates<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:24.890> robots<00:04:25.250> and

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
so I might be pirates and robots and

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.940 
so I might be pirates and robots and
your<00:04:25.580> ninjas<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:26.720> zombies<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.380> then<00:04:27.860> you

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
your ninjas and zombies and then you

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.469 
your ninjas and zombies and then you
have<00:04:28.039> two<00:04:28.250> colors<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.729> you'll<00:04:28.820> take<00:04:29.030> each<00:04:29.240> of

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
have two colors and you'll take each of

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.230 
have two colors and you'll take each of
those<00:04:29.570> groups<00:04:29.780> but<00:04:30.640> just<00:04:31.640> very<00:04:31.850> simple

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
those groups but just very simple

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.969 
those groups but just very simple
easygoing<00:04:32.780> game<00:04:33.050> that<00:04:33.440> does<00:04:33.590> not<00:04:33.710> mean<00:04:33.950> I

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
easygoing game that does not mean I

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.830 
easygoing game that does not mean I
don't<00:04:34.100> that<00:04:34.789> I<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:35.120> dislike<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.720> I

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
don't that I that I dislike it I

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.150 
don't that I that I dislike it I
actually<00:04:35.930> think<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.289> game<00:04:36.440> is<00:04:36.470> fine<00:04:36.860> there

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160

you know the dragon takes that ninjas I
like<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.640> it<00:04:58.729> works<00:04:58.940> well<00:04:59.150> it's<00:04:59.510> also

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
like that and it works well it's also

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.590 
like that and it works well it's also
very<00:04:59.840> quick<00:05:00.350> and<00:05:01.340> so<00:05:01.520> this<00:05:02.000> is<00:05:02.120> a<00:05:02.150> game<00:05:02.360> that's

very quick and so this is a game that's

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.210 
very quick and so this is a game that's
like<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:02.750> gateway<00:05:03.110> style<00:05:03.530> game<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.800> game<00:05:04.010> that<00:05:04.070> I

think people can easily get into like a

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.360 
think people can easily get into like a
throw<00:05:05.900> on<00:05:06.020> table<00:05:06.289> and<00:05:06.380> say<00:05:06.560> hey<00:05:06.950> let's<00:05:07.190> play

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
throw on table and say hey let's play

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.190 
throw on table and say hey let's play
this<00:05:07.580> with<00:05:07.729> people<00:05:07.820> going<00:05:08.240> in<00:05:08.360> okay<00:05:08.780> let's<00:05:08.990> try
