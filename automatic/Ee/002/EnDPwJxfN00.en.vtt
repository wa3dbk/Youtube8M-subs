hinge joint for the tank was attached to
after<00:01:49.520> removing<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.000> hinge<00:01:50.780> bracket<00:01:51.730> is<00:01:52.730> to

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
after removing the hinge bracket is to

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.300 
after removing the hinge bracket is to
remove<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.510> side<00:01:53.750> panels<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:54.890> we<00:01:55.010> can<00:01:55.160> get

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
remove the side panels so we can get

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.220 
remove the side panels so we can get

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
panels use our same 2:30 start dry yep

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.200 
panels use our same 2:30 start dry yep
then<00:02:05.990> they<00:02:06.200> then<00:02:06.410> just<00:02:06.770> unclip<00:02:07.730> the<00:02:07.880> top<00:02:08.060> and
