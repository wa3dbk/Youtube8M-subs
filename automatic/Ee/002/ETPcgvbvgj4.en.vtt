00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
it's a couple more pieces so we got a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.800 
it's a couple more pieces so we got a
put-on<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:33.320> those<00:02:33.500> white<00:02:34.690> white<00:02:36.700> black<00:02:37.810> and

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
put-on so those white white black and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.830 
put-on so those white white black and
that<00:02:39.020> is<00:02:39.320> our<00:02:39.650> fire<00:02:39.890> station<00:02:40.610> now<00:02:41.420> if<00:02:41.570> you<00:02:41.690> look

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
that is our fire station now if you look

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.150 
that is our fire station now if you look
it<00:02:42.080> doesn't<00:02:42.230> look<00:02:42.410> like<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.680> one<00:02:42.770> in<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.010> box

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
it doesn't look like the one in the box

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.890 
it doesn't look like the one in the box
because<00:02:43.580> well<00:02:44.239> though

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
because well though

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.300 
because well though
blowing<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.350> box<00:02:45.530> doesn't<00:02:45.890> have<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.250> right

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
blowing the box doesn't have the right

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.030 
blowing the box doesn't have the right
pieces<00:02:46.520> so<00:02:47.480> we<00:02:47.600> made<00:02:47.870> our<00:02:47.900> own<00:02:48.170> right<00:02:48.620> here

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
pieces so we made our own right here

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.140 
pieces so we made our own right here
pretty<00:02:49.459> cool<00:02:49.730> don't<00:02:49.850> you<00:02:49.970> think

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.850 

now<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:53.480> set<00:02:53.690> comes<00:02:53.989> with<00:02:54.080> Marshall<00:02:54.650> right

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
now this set comes with Marshall right

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.010 
now this set comes with Marshall right
here<00:02:55.250> but<00:02:55.820> you<00:02:55.910> can<00:02:56.060> get<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.239> different<00:02:56.660> set<00:02:56.870> and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
here but you can get a different set and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.500 
here but you can get a different set and
guess<00:02:57.320> he<00:02:57.470> comes<00:02:57.709> with<00:02:57.860> it

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
guess he comes with it

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.260 
guess he comes with it
that's<00:02:59.510> right<00:03:00.230> it's<00:03:00.590> sky<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.910> we've<00:03:02.090> got

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
that's right it's sky so we've got

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.449 
that's right it's sky so we've got
Marshall<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.200> then<00:03:03.380> we've<00:03:03.530> got<00:03:03.709> sky<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.340> her

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
Marshall and then we've got sky and her

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.180 
Marshall and then we've got sky and her
pup<00:03:04.730> pack<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.390> she<00:03:05.540> could<00:03:05.690> fly<00:03:05.930> in<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:07.040> we've

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
pup pack and she could fly in but we've

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.130 
pup pack and she could fly in but we've
got<00:03:07.400> another<00:03:07.670> person<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.330> guess<00:03:08.720> who's<00:03:08.900> coming

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
got another person to guess who's coming

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.830 
got another person to guess who's coming
in<00:03:09.260> why<00:03:09.830> it's<00:03:10.070> none<00:03:10.310> other<00:03:10.340> than<00:03:10.670> Chase<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.690> on

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
in why it's none other than Chase is on

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.699 
in why it's none other than Chase is on
the<00:03:11.870> case<00:03:13.330> because<00:03:14.330> well<00:03:14.630> he's<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.170> case

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
the case because well he's on the case

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.390 
the case because well he's on the case
so<00:03:16.070> there's<00:03:16.310> chase<00:03:16.790> now<00:03:17.600> chase<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.590> Skye<00:03:19.370> are

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
so there's chase now chase and Skye are

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.250
