you're<00:04:25.889> saying<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.550> don't<00:04:27.060> know<00:04:27.240> I'm<00:04:27.659> maybe

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
you're saying I don't know I'm maybe

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.279 
you're saying I don't know I'm maybe
probably<00:04:29.580> Francois<00:04:30.419> Allaire<00:04:30.449> i'm<00:04:30.900> guessing

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
probably Francois Allaire i'm guessing

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.680 
probably Francois Allaire i'm guessing
the<00:04:31.320> fact<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:31.889> we<00:04:32.039> signed<00:04:32.280> him<00:04:32.449> maybe<00:04:33.449> their

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
the fact that we signed him maybe their

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.920 
the fact that we signed him maybe their
persistence<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.979> do<00:04:35.849> feel<00:04:36.240> he<00:04:36.419> struggled<00:04:36.840> with

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
persistence I do feel he struggled with

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.379 
persistence I do feel he struggled with
the<00:04:37.020> decision<00:04:37.289> and<00:04:37.590> our<00:04:37.680> thought<00:04:38.220> was<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.430> we

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
the decision and our thought was that we

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:40.879 
the decision and our thought was that we
wanted<00:04:39.539> to<00:04:39.720> be<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.960> last<00:04:40.139> team<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.470> talk<00:04:40.680> to

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
wanted to be the last team you talk to

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.540 
wanted to be the last team you talk to
and<00:04:41.070> that's<00:04:41.729> why<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:41.940> went<00:04:42.120> back<00:04:42.330> over<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:44.460> know

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
and that's why I went back over you know

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.730 
and that's why I went back over you know
maybe<00:04:44.729> just<00:04:45.090> maybe<00:04:45.599> just<00:04:45.960> us<00:04:46.110> pounding<00:04:46.590> them<00:04:46.680> i

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
maybe just maybe just us pounding them i

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.379 
maybe just maybe just us pounding them i
don't<00:04:46.919> know<00:04:47.039> maybe<00:04:47.340> opportunity<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.300> we

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
don't know maybe opportunity and we

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.599 
don't know maybe opportunity and we
don't<00:04:49.820> you'd<00:04:50.820> have<00:04:50.909> to<00:04:51.000> ask<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.389> honest
