the never-before-seen footage of the
screen<00:00:39.120> aid<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.360> action<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.780> mob<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.110> dead

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
screen aid in action on mob of the dead

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.959 
screen aid in action on mob of the dead
when<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.829> equip<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.399> grenade<00:00:41.700> through

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
when we equip this grenade through

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.000 
when we equip this grenade through
modification<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:43.230> did<00:00:43.410> show<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
modification it did show up on the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.979 
modification it did show up on the
screen<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> HUD<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.480> bottom<00:00:45.809> right

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
screen and the HUD in the bottom right

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.410 
screen and the HUD in the bottom right
is<00:00:46.140> three<00:00:46.530> grenades<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.789> coding<00:00:48.270> in

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
is three grenades so there is coding in

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.330 
is three grenades so there is coding in
this<00:00:48.690> game<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.200> graphic<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.829> actually

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
this game for that graphic to actually

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.250 
this game for that graphic to actually
be<00:00:50.489> able<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.969> appear<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.570> does<00:00:51.840> take<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
be able to appear it does take up the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.840 
be able to appear it does take up the
spot<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.620> hells<00:00:52.890> Redeemer<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.670> like

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
spot of the hells Redeemer so it's like

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.369 
spot of the hells Redeemer so it's like
you<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> other<00:00:55.079> but

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
you have to have one or the other but

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
you have to have one or the other but
not<00:00:55.559> both<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.280> coding<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> animation<00:00:57.420> is

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
not both the coding for the animation is

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
not both the coding for the animation is
all<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.289> player<00:00:58.469> holding<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> grenade

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
all there the player holding the grenade

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.580 
all there the player holding the grenade
and<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.879> pulling<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> pen<00:01:00.660> tossing<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and the pulling of the pen tossing it it

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.529 
and the pulling of the pen tossing it it
landing<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.430> exploding<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.149> emitting

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
landing and then exploding and emitting

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.119 
landing and then exploding and emitting
off<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> white<00:01:03.960> smoke<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> grenade<00:01:05.010> does

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
off the white smoke now the grenade does

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.100 
off the white smoke now the grenade does
not<00:01:05.339> work<00:01:05.640> against<00:01:06.090> zombies<00:01:06.240> or<00:01:06.659> Brutus

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
not work against zombies or Brutus

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.929 
not work against zombies or Brutus
they've<00:01:07.650> both<00:01:07.890> still<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.790> come

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
they've both still see you and come

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.940 
they've both still see you and come
after<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.900> had<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> theory<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.830> what

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
after you so I had a theory for what

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.500 
after you so I had a theory for what
this<00:01:11.130> smoke<00:01:11.430> grenade<00:01:11.700> could<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.119> be

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
this smoke grenade could actually be

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.149 
this smoke grenade could actually be
meant<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.290> will<00:01:13.439> explain<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
meant for and I will explain that in a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.649 
meant for and I will explain that in a
moment<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.580> there's<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.090> interesting<00:01:15.630> thing

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
moment and there's one interesting thing

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.510 
moment and there's one interesting thing
that<00:01:16.140> not<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> lot<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.830> people<00:01:17.040> know<00:01:17.250> about

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that not a lot of people know about

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520 
that not a lot of people know about
because<00:01:17.939> animation<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.049> obvious

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
because animation is not that obvious

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.200 
because animation is not that obvious
but<00:01:19.830> when<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> boss<00:01:20.280> word<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.700> zombie<00:01:21.030> comes

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
but when the boss word is zombie comes

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.969 
but when the boss word is zombie comes
around<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.930> shoot<00:01:22.170> off<00:01:22.259> his<00:01:22.290> helmet<00:01:22.590> he

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.520 
around and you shoot off his helmet he
then<00:01:23.159> stops<00:01:23.520> grabs<00:01:24.240> two<00:01:24.540> smoke<00:01:24.869> grenades<00:01:25.200> off

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
then stops grabs two smoke grenades off

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.590 
then stops grabs two smoke grenades off
his<00:01:25.799> chest<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:26.490> throws<00:01:26.790> them<00:01:27.000> down<00:01:27.210> he

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
his chest and then throws them down he

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.300 
his chest and then throws them down he
does<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.229> try<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.680> confuse<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> other

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
does this to try and confuse the other

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.520 
does this to try and confuse the other
players<00:01:29.610> attacking<00:01:30.390> him<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> smoke<00:01:31.290> bombs

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
players attacking him so the smoke bombs

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.770 
players attacking him so the smoke bombs
we<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.250> sure<00:01:32.280> exist<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.119> him<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.689> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
we know for sure exist for him but it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.179 
we know for sure exist for him but it
doesn't<00:01:33.869> explain<00:01:34.200> why<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.740> coding<00:01:35.130> in

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
doesn't explain why there is coding in

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.920 
doesn't explain why there is coding in
the<00:01:35.280> game<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.729> allows<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> player<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the game that allows for a player to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.569 
the game that allows for a player to
have<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.380> their<00:01:37.530> loadout<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.250> able<00:01:38.430> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
have it in their loadout and be able to

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.760 
have it in their loadout and be able to
actually<00:01:39.119> throw<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.630> everything<00:01:40.229> my

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
actually throw it in everything my

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.410 
actually throw it in everything my
theory<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.280> maybe<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.790> was<00:01:41.970> intended

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
theory is that maybe this was intended

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.330 
theory is that maybe this was intended
for<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.930> player<00:01:43.200> versus<00:01:43.680> player<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:44.280> like

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
for like player versus player just like

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.160 
for like player versus player just like
in<00:01:44.549> multiplayer<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.329> since<00:01:45.659> mob<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> Dead

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
in multiplayer and since mob of the Dead

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.200 
in multiplayer and since mob of the Dead
is<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.320> only<00:01:46.710> zombies<00:01:47.280> map<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> player

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
is the only zombies map to have a player

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.330 
is the only zombies map to have a player
versus<00:01:48.630> player<00:01:48.659> part<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> game<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.100> kind

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
versus player part in the game it kind

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520 
versus player part in the game it kind
of<00:01:50.369> made<00:01:50.520> sense<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.000> me<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.570> during<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> easter

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
of made sense to me so during the easter

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.440 
of made sense to me so during the easter
egg<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.920> pop<00:01:53.189> goes<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.460> weasel'<00:01:54.060> there<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
egg of pop goes the weasel' there is a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.359 
egg of pop goes the weasel' there is a
standoff<00:01:54.930> between<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.439> four<00:01:55.619> players<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
standoff between the four players on the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.920 
standoff between the four players on the
bridge<00:01:56.579> now<00:01:56.939> let's<00:01:57.119> talk<00:01:57.270> about<00:01:57.329> how<00:01:57.570> freakin

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
bridge now let's talk about how freakin

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.630 
bridge now let's talk about how freakin
small<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.439> bridges<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.130> there's<00:01:59.369> really

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
small that bridges and there's really

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.490 
small that bridges and there's really
nowhere<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.090> hide<00:02:00.240> seems<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> great<00:02:01.229> time

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
nowhere to hide seems like a great time

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.170 
nowhere to hide seems like a great time
to<00:02:01.740> break<00:02:01.979> out<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> smoke<00:02:02.460> grenades<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.030> try

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
to break out the smoke grenades and try

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.940 
to break out the smoke grenades and try
to<00:02:03.240> stay<00:02:03.450> alive<00:02:03.570> another<00:02:04.500> thing<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.860> was

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to stay alive another thing that was

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.649 
to stay alive another thing that was
interesting<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.060> get<00:02:06.270> downed

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
interesting is that if you get downed

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.570 
interesting is that if you get downed
and<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> smoke<00:02:07.860> grenades<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.369> your

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
and you have the smoke grenades and your

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.790 
and you have the smoke grenades and your
loadout<00:02:08.970> when<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.539> revive<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.289> does<00:02:10.590> not

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
loadout when you revive it does not

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.480 
loadout when you revive it does not
return<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.760> makes<00:02:11.970> sense<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
return so it makes sense to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.640 
return so it makes sense to
me<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.030> was<00:02:13.150> intended<00:02:13.510> encoded<00:02:14.200> for<00:02:14.560> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
me that it was intended encoded for the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.290 
me that it was intended encoded for the
end<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.250> game<00:02:15.430> during<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.790> Easter<00:02:16.150> egg

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
end of the game during the Easter egg

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.630 
end of the game during the Easter egg
because<00:02:16.780> once<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.290> get<00:02:17.410> down<00:02:17.650> it's<00:02:18.100> game<00:02:18.400> over

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
because once you get down it's game over

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.760 
because once you get down it's game over
and<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.390> wouldn't<00:02:19.660> be<00:02:19.840> necessary<00:02:20.350> for<00:02:20.470> there

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
and it wouldn't be necessary for there

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.560 
and it wouldn't be necessary for there
to<00:02:20.800> be<00:02:20.920> additional<00:02:21.580> programming<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.480> would

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
to be additional programming that would

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.910 
to be additional programming that would
allow<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.930> return<00:02:23.290> back<00:02:23.530> into<00:02:23.830> your

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
allow it to return back into your

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.800 
allow it to return back into your
loadout<00:02:24.340> what<00:02:24.700> tactical<00:02:25.180> equipment<00:02:25.600> have<00:02:25.720> you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
loadout what tactical equipment have you

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.690 
loadout what tactical equipment have you
ever<00:02:26.020> seen<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.590> goes<00:02:26.740> away<00:02:26.890> if<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.220> only<00:02:27.460> get

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
ever seen that goes away if you only get

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.340 
ever seen that goes away if you only get
down<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.210> do<00:02:28.480> not<00:02:28.600> bleed<00:02:28.810> out<00:02:28.960> all<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.200> way

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
down and do not bleed out all the way

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.350 
down and do not bleed out all the way
not<00:02:29.860> sure<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.190> makes<00:02:30.370> sense<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.850> any<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.240> you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
not sure that makes sense to any of you

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.550 
not sure that makes sense to any of you
but<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.630> makes<00:02:31.780> sense<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.170> me

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
but it makes sense to me

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.650 
but it makes sense to me
so<00:02:32.710> is<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.070> just<00:02:33.130> some<00:02:33.670> scrap<00:02:34.060> coating<00:02:34.510> that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
so is this just some scrap coating that

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.660 
so is this just some scrap coating that
never<00:02:34.900> made<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.200> into<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.590> game<00:02:35.770> or<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.550> an

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
never made it into the game or is it an

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.160 
never made it into the game or is it an
easter<00:02:37.030> egg<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.210> we<00:02:37.540> have<00:02:37.660> never<00:02:37.900> figured

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
easter egg that we have never figured

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.710 
easter egg that we have never figured
out<00:02:38.410> because<00:02:39.040> recently<00:02:39.460> Treyarch<00:02:40.180> announced

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
out because recently Treyarch announced

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.800 
out because recently Treyarch announced
at<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.050> 2015<00:02:41.740> San<00:02:42.460> Diego<00:02:42.850> comic-con<00:02:43.240> that

at the 2015 San Diego comic-con that
there<00:02:43.960> are<00:02:44.110> multiple<00:02:44.320> Easter<00:02:44.830> eggs<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.220> have

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
there are multiple Easter eggs that have

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.850 
there are multiple Easter eggs that have
not<00:02:45.790> been<00:02:45.820> discovered<00:02:46.570> which<00:02:46.930> really<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.620> kind

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
not been discovered which really is kind

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.350 
not been discovered which really is kind
of<00:02:47.920> shocking<00:02:48.100> slick<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:49.030> have<00:02:49.210> been
