hair is a st unto itself it likes to
grow<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.690> phases<00:00:16.679> and<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.130> constantly

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:17.849 
grow in phases and it is constantly

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.189 
grow in phases and it is constantly
cycling<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.789> first<00:00:21.029> cycle<00:00:21.269> the<00:00:21.630> cycle

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
cycling the the first cycle the cycle

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.230 
cycling the the first cycle the cycle
that<00:00:22.230> most<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.800> your<00:00:22.949> hair<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.730> your

that most of your hair is in on your
scalp<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:24.810> any<00:00:24.960> particular<00:00:25.230> time<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
scalp at any particular time is the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.069 
scalp at any particular time is the
growth<00:00:26.220> cycle<00:00:26.519> or<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> antigen<00:00:27.359> phase<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
growth cycle or the antigen phase and

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.649 
growth cycle or the antigen phase and
that<00:00:28.740> that's<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.579> last<00:00:29.939> year's<00:00:30.419> which

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:30.659 
that that's like the last year's which

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.060 
that that's like the last year's which
is<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:30.960> can<00:00:31.199> grow<00:00:31.320> hair<00:00:31.619> that's<00:00:31.859> very

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
is how you can grow hair that's very

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.660 
is how you can grow hair that's very
long<00:00:32.340> um<00:00:32.809> there's<00:00:33.809> two<00:00:33.870> other<00:00:34.199> cycles<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
long um there's two other cycles and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.420 
long um there's two other cycles and
those<00:00:36.329> are<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.410> shedding<00:00:37.710> cycle<00:00:38.190> which<00:00:38.280> is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
those are the shedding cycle which is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.349 
those are the shedding cycle which is
also<00:00:38.640> known<00:00:38.940> as<00:00:38.969> catagen<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:41.359> the

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:42.359 
also known as catagen and the the

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.119 
also known as catagen and the the
resting<00:00:42.719> phase<00:00:42.930> which<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.260> known<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.620> telogen

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
resting phase which is known as telogen

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.360 
resting phase which is known as telogen
some<00:00:44.699> people<00:00:44.969> who<00:00:45.059> go<00:00:45.210> through<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> big<00:00:45.629> shed

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
some people who go through a big shed

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.130 
some people who go through a big shed
are<00:00:47.370> said<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.719> flume<00:00:48.960> ium

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
are said to have to it in a flume ium

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.509 
are said to have to it in a flume ium
that's<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> dr.<00:00:49.800> term<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.489> big

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
that's the dr. term for kind of a big

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.020 
that's the dr. term for kind of a big
shed<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.750> those<00:00:52.620> two<00:00:52.859> cycles<00:00:53.250> also<00:00:53.370> exists<00:00:53.910> now

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
shed so those two cycles also exists now

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.569 
shed so those two cycles also exists now
one<00:00:54.179> here<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.510> transplanted<00:00:55.190> hair<00:00:56.190> kind<00:00:56.519> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
one here is transplanted hair kind of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.750 
one here is transplanted hair kind of
resets<00:00:57.179> and<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> grafts<00:00:58.800> reset<00:00:59.460> but

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
resets and not just the grafts reset but

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.970 
resets and not just the grafts reset but
if<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.179> hair<00:01:00.420> already<00:01:00.809> existing<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
if you have hair already existing in the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.580 
if you have hair already existing in the
area<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.640> transplanted<00:01:03.059> then<00:01:03.989> also<00:01:04.230> your

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
area to be transplanted then also your

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.620 
area to be transplanted then also your
your<00:01:04.620> native<00:01:05.520> hair<00:01:05.730> might<00:01:05.940> reset<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.450> well

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
your native hair might reset as well

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.210 
your native hair might reset as well
sometimes<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.320> happens<00:01:07.530> sometimes<00:01:08.100> it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
sometimes that happens sometimes it

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.630 
sometimes that happens sometimes it
doesn't

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
doesn't

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.850 
doesn't
that's<00:01:09.180> called<00:01:09.450> shock<00:01:09.750> loss<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.230> it<00:01:10.350> does<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that's called shock loss if it does and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.690 
that's called shock loss if it does and
and<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.300> it<00:01:12.660> because<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> takes<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.100> while<00:01:14.130> for

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and and it because it takes a while for

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.850 
and and it because it takes a while for
that<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.360> shedding<00:01:15.780> phase<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.560> lasts

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that that shedding phase which lasts

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.710 
that that shedding phase which lasts
about<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.160> month<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.240> resting

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
about a month and then that resting

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.720 
about a month and then that resting
phase<00:01:18.960> which<00:01:19.230> can<00:01:19.440> last<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.310> know<00:01:20.400> six

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
phase which can last up to you know six

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.000 
phase which can last up to you know six
months<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.560> back<00:01:22.590> into<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
months and then going back into the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.490 
months and then going back into the
growth<00:01:23.220> phase<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.480> hair<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> growing<00:01:25.380> at

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
growth phase you know hair is growing at

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.110 
growth phase you know hair is growing at
that<00:01:25.650> point<00:01:25.920> at<00:01:26.040> about<00:01:26.160> you<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:26.670> quarter

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
that point at about you know quarter

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.870 
that point at about you know quarter
inch<00:01:27.330> per<00:01:27.840> month<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.830> maybe<00:01:29.130> even<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.430> half-inch

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
inch per month or maybe even a half-inch

inch per month or maybe even a half-inch
per<00:01:30.060> month<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.690> order<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.050> get<00:01:31.200> an<00:01:31.290> inch<00:01:31.440> long

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
per month in order to get an inch long

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.990 
per month in order to get an inch long
hair<00:01:31.920> you're<00:01:32.250> looking<00:01:32.520> at<00:01:32.640> four<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:32.940> five

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
hair you're looking at four or five

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.200 
hair you're looking at four or five
months<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.620> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.190> that's<00:01:35.670> taking

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
months and and you know that's taking

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.000 
months and and you know that's taking
you<00:01:36.300> out<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:36.720> year<00:01:37.080> so<00:01:37.230> that's<00:01:37.440> why<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.800> takes

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
you out to a year so that's why it takes

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.060 
you out to a year so that's why it takes
a<00:01:38.190> whole<00:01:38.760> year<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.180> regrow<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.050> hair<00:01:40.230> now

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
a whole year to regrow your hair now

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.580 
a whole year to regrow your hair now
this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.400> typically<00:01:41.790> an<00:01:41.970> advantage<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.660> a<00:01:43.020> for

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
this is typically an advantage for a for

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.880 
this is typically an advantage for a for
this<00:01:43.680> particular<00:01:44.040> type<00:01:44.400> of<00:01:44.430> cosmetic<00:01:44.910> surgery

this particular type of cosmetic surgery

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.010 
this particular type of cosmetic surgery
the<00:01:46.890> results<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:47.430> dramatic<00:01:48.150> when<00:01:48.900> you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the results are dramatic when you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.860 
the results are dramatic when you
compare<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.590> before<00:01:49.980> and<00:01:50.040> after<00:01:50.310> photos<00:01:50.880> but

compare your before and after photos but
during<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.410> times<00:01:52.650> that<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.950> re<00:01:53.220> growing
