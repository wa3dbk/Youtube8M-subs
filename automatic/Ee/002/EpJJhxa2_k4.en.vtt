00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 this 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.279
 hello hello while alexander 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.050
 it's an activity that the fish 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.480
 must appreciate feeding 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.849
 actually they do not seem to have 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.710
 very fine listen and here they are 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.130
 beginning to discover realize that 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.019
 we feed her 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.869
 this is everybody thinking about sanaa this 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.820
 what to say to activate a little bit 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.809
 the ones coming to come get the 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.220
 food coming down 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.199
 gradually towards the back of the yard 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.460
 so here I look it's Vermont 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.989
 actually then this fish got 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.720
 lifted on it's a fish that lives in 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.979
 the first class rivers in 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.710
 our regions here in the north of the 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.650
 France and so this fish bad with 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.879
 unfortunately a little bit disappeared from 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.589
 our regions precisely because of the 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.350
 pollution of everything that was 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.089
 industrials etc and so our rivers 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.250
 come back let's say in a quality 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.019
 acceptable and begins to regain 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.309
 glass in verse by home is all about 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.409
 do so here we are in an aquarium 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.420
 freshwater fish 1 that's good 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.119
 exclusively cold inter water shower 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.770
 that european fish from france de 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.650
 the region of course in iraq 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.320
 it's a we only present that it has 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.579
 also some cups and like 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.810
 crayfish that are also present 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.399
 in the natural environment 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.750
 how much of the species then you have 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.490
 then we have about fifty species 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.540
 health here are about fifty species 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.920
 spread over 25 aquarium and 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.050
 the aquariums is about a 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.740
 volume of 55 cubic meters of water 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.710
 fifty five minutes 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.900
 this fauna the acea level interested 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.190
 still the public where they are more 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.110
 attracted by exoticism 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.310
 then we have nothing to do 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.020
 with the big chords and one that we can 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.670
 to meet elsewhere we are a little 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.380
 essentially educational structure 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.430
 that is to say that in fact we receive here well 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.050
 sure visitors who wish to come 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.000
 visit the aquarium of course but 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.700
 also school students continue to 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.920
 play a few more small doses to 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.150
 give them there so we gave them in 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.940
 at first a little bit of 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.100
 granules for protein intake etc. 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.330
 and then to avoid deficiencies we 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.920
 never give the same thing 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.380
 we vary so we put it too 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.420
 some small worms and the larva 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.020
 of mosquito in reality is there we put a 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.700
 little bit of mussels grind here they are 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.360
 are pampered 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.290
 they must be children 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.290
 go on we continue in valais 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.300
 in the living room alley changes regime 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.620
 food then actually there 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.690
 now we're going to spend on fish 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.860
 carnivores so the carnivores on them 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.410
 gives small fish to the like 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.600
 this this site a little rotengle so 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.860
 it's the food in nature these 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.750
 fish there are carnivores do not eat 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.530
 these fishes then we try not to 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.300
 not their may 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.740
 we could feed it inert but that 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.209
 will completely change their behavior 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.380
 coordinates live fish for 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.580
 that they keep their instinct first from 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.790
 hunters and predators 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.959
 ok so here we will put some 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.360
 one so these are fish that 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.340
 not eat every day like the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.140
 pike f-16 species that were going in 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.670
 a pike pike one to get off 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.900
 behind there is an alert there there is 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.040
 a black bass also in the aquarium that 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.170
 are on the other side we see it 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.250
 not but here they are fish all 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.200
 carnivores they have the same diet 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.459
 food eat the same thing and they 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.920
 are sized to not self 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.660
 ready to eat pictures what to eat 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.370
 each other in a circle there in this 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.830
 okay one there no one can eat another 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.360
 even if we did not feed 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.560
 this is to hear is so we forget when 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.490
 even why there are no fights this 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.560
 that there may be a fight 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.900
 this fish there and a mouth that is 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.530
 riddled with in dangerous 700 it's 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.790
 impressive 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.500
 it's very impressive 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.480
 especially not put his hand in them 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.220
 twenty seconds and small needles 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.540
 and bent inwards you in 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.540
 have 700 and they are rewarded 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.620
 unending 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.390
 Here they eat well and it's fish 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.510
 are united fish so going to have to 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.420
 give both original foods 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.190
 animal so we rowed also had the 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.110
 vegetable protein small point 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.130
 multipoint corn actually after one 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.320
 can give vegetables macedonia 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.049
 weighed from the moment we did not 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.549
 no it was cooked ie that 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.239
 often frozen is not cooked and 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.130
 so his fleet 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.560
 1 it must absolutely be found 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.020
 in the east in the filters and it pollutes 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.880
 your device to prince these fish there 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.140
 are also freshwater fish by 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.430
 actually they are water fish 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.940
 sweet my island polled are fish 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.460
 ornament 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.190
 there you have koi carp of cabbage 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.200
 bookeen sailing and with the gangs 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.400
 large sails you have the 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.690
 tench of Mongolia while departing 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.550
 it's fish the reality all that is 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.350
 normal but on tens and 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.210
 dozens of generations we get the 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.830
 fish that have peculiarities 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.510
 physical outsized 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.470
 that's it and we maintain because we're going 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.790
 to press for seems indeed 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.260
 crisscross each other etc 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.940
 we can get fish for them 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.220
 bulging eyes yes we find a 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.290
 animal is actually a fish 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.970
 that bubbles on the head of taigu 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.590
 lack that is to say it comes from 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.580
 there actually but initially all these 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.200
 fish were fish all 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.340
 classical calculations that we find in 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.340
 water in our rivers our streams 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.920
 and 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:26.139
 it's eating it's eating here it's the 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.030
 lake community so that means are 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.479
 the fish found in the lake 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.490
 valjoly 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.919
 yes actually quite if they are 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.379
 that fish has here in this 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.430
 period on community which represents a 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:38.009
 little fish that can be found 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.740
 in the lake for fishermen 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:43.080
 naturalist and that's of course but we 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.159
 did not put the fish that are 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.930
 predator there are small poles but 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.610
 generates this one it's okay it's not mean 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.440
 because in the lake of course you have 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.759
 predators and prey and 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.199
 other fish that are mixed here on 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.360
 can not get mixed up with that first name 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.069
 will create stress I imagined well I 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.060
 problems 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:00.449
 the Hindu officer this passion for 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.520
 the alexander fish then at the start 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.590
 when I was 6 my grandfather taught me 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.199
 taken to fishing a first time then 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.449
 a second time then several times in 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.800
 so taken that I got 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.020
 passionate about fishing so at the start 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.310
 yes and then I focused my studies in 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.159
 this area is in aquaculture 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.719
 and and then I had to manage a 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.699
 aquarium you're supposed to have you are 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:22.509
 obliged more way to have a certificate 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.719
 capacity 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.840
 so it's a national diploma we pass 

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:30.969
 before our fathers and to show paw 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.740
 white expensive we are well qualified 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:33.650
 to both hold animals in 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.930
 good 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.680
 in good animal conditions 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.330
 here we are 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.949
 and welcome also in public 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.509
 the sense that we are not in danger the 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.740
 public who comes to visit the aquarium 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:43.910
 because here today we have 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.699
 luck there is nobody but usually 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.680
 it's a hit on cities 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.190
 actively when we have children it is 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.770
 not easy 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.840
 this is the good position of your mission here 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.699
 you walk to explain to you that's it 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.320
 we make children aware of all this 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:58.820
 okay he does not even have that kids 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.870
 yes and adults too because we 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.220
 discover a lot of things anyway 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.880
 for my part I discovered a lot of 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.610
 things today 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.949
 thank you very much alexander here it is 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.260
 invites spectators to discover 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:11.300
 this aquarium here at valjoly 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.710
 we continue to take a tour in 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.710
 region with our agenda 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.789
 the museum of engraving and stamping 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:29.169
 de gravelines proposes to revisit its 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:29.169
 collections with a new hanging
