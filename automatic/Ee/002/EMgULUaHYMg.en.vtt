00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 so you can kenny all cameras what a 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.660
 way to 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.220
 way to make the base entry post on 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.429
 to be the golden rooster 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.230
 yes it is nice i mean number of weeks 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.870
 have to do with raids and still 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.510
 get back to basics today and yes 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.279
 with two goals , everything is yes 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.539
 very nice and natural for me 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.010
 timo 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.199
 this was the win of it 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.099
 collectively although you above it 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.529
 put out 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.789
 no, absolutely, of the collective we are 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.030
 came here with a flat battle plan 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.770
 and I think all eleven 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.110
 on the field and the players who are there 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.930
 came that and performed perfectly 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.350
 yes also helped by an early goal 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.610
 could lean back a bit more but yes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 I think that have performed perfectly 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.000
 as a collective 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.680
 when the realization grew, it was mainly 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.899
 yes a little later in the second half because we 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.870
 want the first half 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.760
 yes i think that they have a lot of chance 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.260
 create in the first half and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.370
 yes in the weather we have the rest 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.160
 said of just have to stay calm 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.989
 and those spaces will come naturally 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.360
 at a certain moment you notice that 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.850
 have their way of faith away and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.049
 that we sometimes push yes in the counter 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.570
 can come out dangerously 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.320
 and I think yes with perfect sides 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.549
 that we have those two zero scoreboard yes that 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.860
 despite those last few minutes 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.060
 still with the buttocks again 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.940
 were together 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.560
 yes it was actually done 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.299
 Jennifer and Castelen had thoughts 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.950
 creates the but because you with that 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.909
 speed and the counter who could 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.860
 what do mean 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.649
 Well yes actually in each other 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.850
 I thought we wanted to have with the players 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.759
 that we are on the field that we have it 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 have to do and knew that in advance and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.450
 yes of course if they were there then 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.740
 maybe they could have been of value 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.299
 are only 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.580
 shirt jacket moment is not going so fast 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.649
 then you can also be of value 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.720
 how sweet does it taste because yes with one 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.950
 defeat was one of them 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.270
 victory rose above the line 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.280
 simple 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.100
 yes i think we yes of course it is 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.470
 fine but I don't like that 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.299
 yes it is true antilles say because 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.750
 no extra turkeys are we Christmas 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.430
 peace 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.900
 no there are so many competitions to go 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.610
 for us it is natural if i like you 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.729
 nice that we have the good range in which we 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.370
 are busy just by pulling and 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.959
 next week races visiting the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.340
 puzzle that is a bit a bit a k 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.110
 start falling because it's a nice one 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.540
 range currently 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.030
 yes maybe that was i would guess 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.220
 was collectively just good 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.330
 yes outside of Heerenveen from few 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.330
 get goals 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.190
 and yes I think it is a compliment 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.060
 to the defense but also just 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.060
 to collective
