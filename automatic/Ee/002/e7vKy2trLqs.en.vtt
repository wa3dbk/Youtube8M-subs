viewfinders that are out on the market
and<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:41.800> think<00:01:42.070> that<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.280> quality<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:42.970> the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
and I think that the quality of the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.350 
and I think that the quality of the
Canon<00:01:43.650> viewfinder<00:01:44.650> is<00:01:44.770> pretty<00:01:45.040> good<00:01:45.280> so<00:01:46.090> it

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
Canon viewfinder is pretty good so it

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.930 
Canon viewfinder is pretty good so it
utilizes<00:01:46.900> that<00:01:47.020> good<00:01:47.260> quality<00:01:47.740> it<00:01:48.310> dampens

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
utilizes that good quality it dampens

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.000 
utilizes that good quality it dampens
all<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.390> light<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.900> really<00:01:50.229> allows<00:01:50.560> you<00:01:50.770> to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
all the light and really allows you to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
here and it's nice because I can be

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.220 
here and it's nice because I can be
stable<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:31.370> can<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.490> locked<00:02:32.730> into<00:02:32.970> place<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.660> I

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
stable I can be locked into place and I

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.140 
stable I can be locked into place and I
can<00:02:34.410> be<00:02:34.500> pulling<00:02:34.830> focus<00:02:35.220> as<00:02:35.490> opposed<00:02:35.970> to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
can be pulling focus as opposed to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.810 
can be pulling focus as opposed to
moving<00:02:36.810> where<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.500> camera<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:37.920> shift<00:02:38.460> on<00:02:38.670> its

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
moving where the camera can shift on its

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.190 
moving where the camera can shift on its
axis<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.270> little<00:02:39.480> bit<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.780> can<00:02:39.959> be<00:02:40.050> in<00:02:40.080> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
axis a little bit so I can be in a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.670 
axis a little bit so I can be in a
pretty<00:02:40.410> stable<00:02:40.680> place<00:02:41.040> moving<00:02:42.000> around<00:02:42.680> so

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
pretty stable place moving around so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.440 
pretty stable place moving around so
overall<00:02:44.070> really<00:02:44.550> happy<00:02:44.910> with<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.270> love

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450

the c300 I love the image that it gives

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.940 
the c300 I love the image that it gives
you<00:02:47.550> but<00:02:48.480> it's<00:02:48.630> kind<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.959> limiting<00:02:49.410> when<00:02:49.860> you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
you but it's kind of limiting when you

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.530 
you but it's kind of limiting when you
have<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.190> on<00:02:50.310> your<00:02:50.430> hand<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.940> it's<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.360> that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
have it on your hand and it's not that

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.780 
have it on your hand and it's not that
stable<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.560> system<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:53.250> very

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
stable so this system is very

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.150 
stable so this system is very
customizable<00:02:54.239> I<00:02:54.600> can<00:02:54.780> use<00:02:54.959> part<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.980> can

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
customizable I can use part of it I can

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.040 
customizable I can use part of it I can
use<00:02:56.280> all<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.120> I've<00:02:57.630> been<00:02:57.780> pretty<00:02:57.959> happy

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
use all of it and I've been pretty happy

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.580 
use all of it and I've been pretty happy
