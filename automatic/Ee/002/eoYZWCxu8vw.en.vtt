00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.260 
guess is maybe the knowledge of the game
you<00:01:28.500> know<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.650> again<00:01:28.920> he's<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> little<00:01:29.520> rusty<00:01:29.850> I

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you know and again he's a little rusty I

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
you know and again he's a little rusty I
think<00:01:31.049> he's<00:01:31.140> catchin<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.439> his<00:01:31.590> technique<00:01:31.920> is

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
think he's catchin up his technique is

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.160 
think he's catchin up his technique is
improving<00:01:32.340> day<00:01:32.460> by<00:01:32.490> day<00:01:32.700> his<00:01:33.479> efforts<00:01:33.840> always

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
improving day by day his efforts always

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.050 
improving day by day his efforts always
there<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.590> few<00:01:35.280> things<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.640> clean<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:35.909> in

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
there a few things that clean up in

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.690 
there a few things that clean up in
there<00:01:36.240> but

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
there but

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.639 
there but
you'll<00:01:36.909> be<00:01:37.030> okay<00:01:37.270> how<00:01:37.869> nice<00:01:38.049> is<00:01:38.259> it<00:01:38.289> for<00:01:38.560> you

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
you'll be okay how nice is it for you

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.399

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
after having to move people around and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.510 
after having to move people around and
mix<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:41.560> match<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.920> last<00:01:42.100> couple<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.460> years

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
mix and match the last couple of years

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.700 
mix and match the last couple of years
to<00:01:42.820> have<00:01:42.969> a<00:01:43.270> lot<00:01:43.719> of<00:01:43.750> guys<00:01:43.960> out<00:01:44.170> there<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.439> boys

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
to have a lot of guys out there the boys

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.380 
to have a lot of guys out there the boys
it's<00:01:45.070> nice<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.520> you<00:01:45.610> know<00:01:45.729> you're<00:01:45.850> not<00:01:46.179> only

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
it's nice and you know you're not only

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.819 
it's nice and you know you're not only
good<00:01:46.600> for<00:01:46.630> me<00:01:46.840> was<00:01:46.990> good<00:01:47.200> for<00:01:47.289> their<00:01:47.439> muscle

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
good for me was good for their muscle

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:48.840 
good for me was good for their muscle
because<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.130> don't<00:01:48.280> have<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.460> move<00:01:48.640> them<00:01:48.759> around

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
because I don't have to move them around

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.580 
because I don't have to move them around
so<00:01:49.149> much<00:01:49.329> they<00:01:49.719> can<00:01:49.780> get<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:49.990> one<00:01:50.200> spot<00:01:50.500> and

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
so much they can get a one spot and

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.319 
so much they can get a one spot and
kinda<00:01:50.770> learning<00:01:50.890> position<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:51.909> also<00:01:52.179> learn

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
kinda learning position and also learn

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.240 
kinda learning position and also learn
the<00:01:52.360> defense<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.500> really<00:01:53.679> helps<00:01:53.979> out<00:01:54.069> do<00:01:54.220> it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
the defense so it really helps out do it

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.529 
the defense so it really helps out do it
with<00:01:54.399> it's<00:01:54.549> not<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.700> good<00:01:54.880> their<00:01:55.149> minds<00:01:55.329> on

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
with it's not a good their minds on

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.789 
with it's not a good their minds on
scrum<00:01:55.810> without<00:01:56.079> trying<00:01:56.289> to<00:01:56.350> get<00:01:56.439> lined<00:01:56.619> up

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
scrum without trying to get lined up

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.100 
scrum without trying to get lined up
remember<00:01:57.280> two<00:01:57.789> or<00:01:57.880> three<00:01:57.909> positions<00:01:58.509> they<00:01:58.960> can

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
remember two or three positions they can

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.289 
remember two or three positions they can
focus<00:01:59.229> on<00:01:59.380> their<00:01:59.439> spine<00:01:59.880> how<00:02:00.880> much<00:02:01.060> will<00:02:01.179> you

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
focus on their spine how much will you

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.600 
focus on their spine how much will you
rotate<00:02:01.689> people<00:02:01.899> do<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.200> think<00:02:02.439> um<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.340> depends

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
rotate people do you think um it depends

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.160 
rotate people do you think um it depends
