00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.370
 p 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.480
 most of the times two years he was standing for good with that 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.510
 need 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.569
 they cost 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:18.220
 the one who poured on Saturdays children here makes little family living 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.460
 how do you do this that first we have to do that we are in the case 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.440
 d the nationals that require 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.050
 in the need to apply for a visa to enter Spain as is the norm 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.670
 general to come here Spanish short visit or it comes to 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.570
 national 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.100
 percent and whose flag states to which we do not have visas to get 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.360
 here to spain in a visit of this short duration for example 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.870
 we will put countries like for example colombia the peru agreement at the same time as 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.440
 This general rule rejected the need for a visa to reach 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.330
 Spain 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.120
 and we have countries such as Argentina such as Venezuela 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.680
 and even nationals we do not demand a visa for these people 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.340
 can come to Spain that does not mean they do not have to meet a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.990
 Requirements series 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.320
 of grateful people will credit what is coming and what good for certain funds 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.080
 means of living to be here in Spain that are detected in the case of 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.050
 of the community regime with these visits to get here to Spain goes 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.680
 to do everything happens the same thing you have to differentiate the percent 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.600
 standing relatives should tell the Spaniards the children of the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.090
 treat the children of the registered couple 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.960
 that come from beatings vacations we demand visa in these cases there will be 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.820
 than to ask for the corresponding family reunification visa and for 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.440
 there we started the procedure we have to demean the one who was married 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.570
 in which, as a general rule, this visa is valid 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.460
 for example low Venezuelan for example Argentine 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.969
 in this case the entrance will be made 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.119
 in the village the people if they do not win or mention that they are done as for example 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.590
 when you see the tourist 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.230
 but it will be an entry to the object that makes it especially in Spain and 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.990
 so the documentation that you have to take with you 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.710
 the relative of a Spanish citizen or community citizen will be different from the one 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.999
 they usually carry when an entity is done 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.650
 a Gonzalo object and therefore tourist the short duration of the 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:25.009
 short stay is worth its important so in some cases it has 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.999
 paralyzed and in other cases simply to this one forward will do but 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:33.769
 hydrated of the necessary documentation that allows to accredit the object of the 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.589
 village that we are banks under the same application of this regime 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:41.279
 community and that we can not prove because it is because it can be demanded by 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:45.219
 the Spanish authority of its delivery the national police or by the civil guard 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.139
 in order to determine 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:52.009
 here comes started here to Spain percent and under what conditions is it 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.009
 making the entity 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:59.009
 in the case that that should have them from 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:04.509
 the number of children of this value the Spanish on the contracts of the 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.479
 registered couple in Spanish 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:07.470
 what 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.120
 as a general rule to do national is visa required as we say 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.419
 the procedure will have to start 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.379
 with the application for a family reunification visa at the consulate 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.989
 from Spain in the country of origin for example colombia percent otari 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.119
 then came efe in these cases but that's why I requested 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:32.399
 the stylized community family reunification but of course it is not treated in the 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:36.599
 In most cases, it will be about children who are children who are younger than 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.269
 age in this case the request can not be made by the children 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.329
 because they do not have the capacity to initiate this procedure this request the 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.749
 will perform 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.719
 necessarily third person to play
