00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.660

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.660
 to me 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.890
 hello how about youtube friends like 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.140

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.509
 I am me and well I bring you a game 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.270
 quite interesting that originally 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.890
 since he is a gym animator and 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.410
 the truth is that this is very good 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.029
 game and now they brought him a web page 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.280
 that you can now play here 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.590
 completely online in a way 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.050
 easy and simple and it is a very game but 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.730
 that very funny and addictive the game 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.920
 try this genius have to guess 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.410
 a character that you are thinking about or 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.990
 a character from europe brand some 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.390
 character from some cereal box what 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.220
 let it be and simply through clues 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.400
 you are wondering until it has 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.650
 result is very accurate and almost 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.090
 always guess what you're thinking the 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.220
 true that this is the devil's game 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.840
 as I say because I always guess what 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.940
 what are you thinking so let's say 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.680
 one word and quickly and we're going to 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.600
 play a bit like you can appreciate here 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.240
 when you enter the page it tells you the 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.670
 last ten games and let's all say the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.189
 that you guessed this genius so let's 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.869
 apply here where it says play and good ya 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.590
 they know that in the description of the video you 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.329
 I leave the link so you go 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.609
 enter this page and you can play 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.280
 let's throw it fully to ask for this 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:29.939
 information the nickname by age study 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.740
 then 31 and obviously then this or 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.740
 we apply here we play 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.530
 well we can do it is let's think 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.470
 in a character it can be a pokÃ©mon a 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.659
 Mark what you want the truth 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.700
 that the harder it is and the more weird it is 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.100
 the character much more fun to see 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.500
 If I guess it, I have not put the truth 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.210
 everything and always the divine so we're going to 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.340
 think 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.869
 in the chocolate character of 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.330
 granny chocolate so let's see 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.090
 think about this character and just 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.830
 let's go here to answer the questions 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.479
 here is the first question that 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.840
 character so needed only then 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.679
 Well, if we go here, raise more characters 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.679
 singer not 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.700
 the actor does not 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.530
 the sport 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.590
 we are open to the internet 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.590
 probably 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.450
 yes 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.650
 I do not know 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.060
 yes 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.070
 do not 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.330
 their characters 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.330
 well I do not know 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.790
 yes 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.810
 his character is probably a model 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.349
 if it's a brand model 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.349
 do not 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.459
 do not 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.129
 do not 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.319
 do not 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:25.020
 if here as you can see it has already arrived at 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:28.340
 point of the meal then then 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.340
 is getting closer 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.599
 yes 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.280
 from here the character that looks like this 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.080
 who is already guessing says his 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.470
 characters have to white obviously 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.040
 Well, here is the divine, there is no here 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.040
 yes 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.470
 and as you can see here it says exactly 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.159
 where the character comes from, the truth is 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.790
 surprising and obviously for him 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.790
 we say yes 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.040
 and here it tells you how many times they have 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.140
 played and when it's very good so 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.390
 let's play quickly so they see 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.050
 that really guesses everything so 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.330
 let's think about another character 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.580
 let's think about a character that does not 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.190
 be very easy for example if we start 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.010
 in a bit bad obviously because this one 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.570
 it puts if it is related to some world 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.520
 of pokemon and automatically 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.520
 let's think about 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.650
 let's think when we go to is a woman 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.650
 let's put that 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.300
 Mexican yes 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:52.090
 more than 50 years since I say yes 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.090
 his comic actor character does not 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.500
 has passed away and I know not 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.280
 yes 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.380
 not that I am more 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.380
 yes 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.500
 do not 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.080
 and look at this the garlics very fast my 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.669
 friends the truth that is very cool this 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.009
 game so I recommend that you check 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.470

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.300
 so they had not liked the truth 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.099
 that it made me curious to have this game 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.289
 here online the truth has always 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:31.300
 been good for money 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.599

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.160
