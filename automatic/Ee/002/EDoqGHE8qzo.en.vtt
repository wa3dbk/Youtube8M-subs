your<00:01:23.240> video<00:01:23.569> at<00:01:24.440> first<00:01:24.500> I<00:01:24.979> thought<00:01:25.159> they<00:01:25.310> were

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
your video at first I thought they were

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.730 
your video at first I thought they were
were<00:01:26.119> just<00:01:26.450> merely<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.780> tool<00:01:27.380> like<00:01:27.679> a

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
were just merely a tool like a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.430 
were just merely a tool like a
commercial<00:01:28.700> but<00:01:29.450> now<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:29.630> can<00:01:29.960> see<00:01:30.140> that<00:01:30.170> there

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
commercial but now I can see that there

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.370 
commercial but now I can see that there
are<00:01:30.470> some<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.970> know<00:01:32.090> videos<00:01:32.659> being<00:01:32.899> made<00:01:33.140> that

she<00:04:12.060> started<00:04:12.570> in<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.780> in<00:04:12.900> England<00:04:13.230> on<00:04:13.350> a

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
she started in the in England on a

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.319 
she started in the in England on a
feature<00:04:13.620> called<00:04:13.829> animal<00:04:14.250> farm<00:04:14.489> we<00:04:15.030> like<00:04:15.209> it

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
feature called animal farm we like it

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.199 
feature called animal farm we like it
again<00:04:15.540> yes<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.470> know

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
again yes you know

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.180 
again yes you know
we<00:04:17.329> were<00:04:17.419> all<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.750> way<00:04:17.870> in<00:04:18.049> from<00:04:18.350> Mississauga

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
we were all the way in from Mississauga

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.330 
we were all the way in from Mississauga
-<00:04:19.840> so<00:04:20.840> we<00:04:21.139> now<00:04:21.259> go<00:04:21.410> to<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.590> painting<00:04:22.039> stage

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
- so we now go to the painting stage

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.420 
- so we now go to the painting stage
which<00:04:23.180> is<00:04:23.210> where<00:04:23.600> we<00:04:24.020> see<00:04:24.289> that<00:04:25.009> he<00:04:25.160> has<00:04:25.250> taken

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
which is where we see that he has taken

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.820 
which is where we see that he has taken
the<00:04:25.699> acetate<00:04:26.210> flipped<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.900> over<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:27.380> that<00:04:27.710> is

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
the acetate flipped it over so that is

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.490 
the acetate flipped it over so that is
now<00:04:28.060> right-side<00:04:29.060> back<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.660> we<00:04:30.229> have<00:04:30.349> now

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
now right-side back and we have now

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.330 
now right-side back and we have now
painted<00:04:31.009> it

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
painted it

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.640 
painted it
he<00:04:31.759> is<00:04:31.849> painted<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.360> very<00:04:32.690> carefully<00:04:32.930> inside

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
he is painted it very carefully inside

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.460 
he is painted it very carefully inside
the<00:04:33.830> lines<00:04:34.039> so<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.550> colour<00:04:34.759> is<00:04:35.470> fully

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
the lines so that the colour is fully

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.620 
the lines so that the colour is fully
opaque<00:04:36.830> it<00:04:37.460> looks<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.699> bit<00:04:37.729> blobby<00:04:38.060> here<00:04:38.330> but<00:04:38.539> if

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
opaque it looks a bit blobby here but if

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.540 
opaque it looks a bit blobby here but if
we<00:04:38.840> switch<00:04:39.080> it<00:04:39.319> over<00:04:39.410> you'll<00:04:40.039> see<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.310> fact

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
we switch it over you'll see the fact

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.189 
we switch it over you'll see the fact
that<00:04:40.669> that's<00:04:40.880> now<00:04:41.180> what<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.539> camera<00:04:41.840> will<00:04:41.990> see

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
that that's now what the camera will see

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.420 
that that's now what the camera will see
when<00:04:43.009> we're<00:04:43.130> shooting<00:04:43.430> scene<00:04:43.669> by<00:04:43.819> scene<00:04:45.430> so

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
when we're shooting scene by scene so

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.740 
when we're shooting scene by scene so
what<00:04:46.910> we're<00:04:47.030> about<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.300> see<00:04:47.419> is<00:04:47.539> what<00:04:47.720> a

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
what we're about to see is what a

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.820 
what we're about to see is what a
seconds<00:04:48.740> worth<00:04:48.949> of<00:04:49.690> about<00:04:50.690> -<00:04:51.139> I<00:04:51.169> think<00:04:51.320> I<00:04:51.680> don't

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
seconds worth of about - I think I don't

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.290 
seconds worth of about - I think I don't
knowbut<00:04:52.099> arguing<00:04:52.520> about<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.759> footage<00:04:53.000> but

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
knowbut arguing about the footage but

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.939 
knowbut arguing about the footage but
yes<00:04:53.509> let's<00:04:53.690> compromise<00:04:54.020> it<00:04:54.440> it's<00:04:54.590> out<00:04:54.710> just

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
yes let's compromise it it's out just

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.740 
yes let's compromise it it's out just
under<00:04:55.070> two<00:04:55.340> seconds<00:04:55.820> that's<00:04:56.240> how<00:04:56.360> many<00:04:56.539> frames

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
under two seconds that's how many frames

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.140 
under two seconds that's how many frames
and<00:04:57.139> how<00:04:57.320> many<00:04:57.500> have<00:04:57.590> you<00:04:57.620> drawn<00:04:57.949> 39<00:04:58.729> frames

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
and how many have you drawn 39 frames

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.570 
and how many have you drawn 39 frames
and<00:04:59.599> most<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.199> them<00:05:00.410> if<00:05:00.590> you<00:05:00.740> double<00:05:01.250> up<00:05:01.340> on<00:05:01.490> the

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
and most of them if you double up on the

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.700 
and most of them if you double up on the
levels<00:05:01.910> there's<00:05:02.120> about<00:05:02.270> 39<00:05:02.720> joins<00:05:03.020> there

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710
