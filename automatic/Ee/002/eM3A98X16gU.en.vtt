green<00:03:09.450> now<00:03:09.870> i<00:03:09.900> don't<00:03:10.050> know<00:03:10.350> what<00:03:10.590> the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
green now i don't know what the

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.310 
green now i don't know what the
marketing<00:03:11.190> name<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:12.320> probably

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
marketing name of it is probably

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.130 
marketing name of it is probably
something<00:03:13.620> like<00:03:13.770> sea<00:03:14.220> foam<00:03:14.900> but<00:03:15.900> it's<00:03:16.050> a

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
something like sea foam but it's a

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.080 
something like sea foam but it's a
Bluegreen<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:17.040> little<00:03:17.340> bit<00:03:17.459> more<00:03:17.610> green<00:03:18.060> than

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
Bluegreen a little bit more green than

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.660 
Bluegreen a little bit more green than
blue<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:19.410> again<00:03:19.709> it's<00:03:19.920> kind<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.370> light

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
blue but again it's kind of in the light

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.290 
blue but again it's kind of in the light
to<00:03:20.910> medium<00:03:21.090> range<00:03:21.690> for<00:03:22.110> value<00:03:22.680> it's<00:03:23.459> dull<00:03:23.910> it's

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
to medium range for value it's dull it's

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.660 
to medium range for value it's dull it's
not<00:03:24.570> real<00:03:24.870> bright<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:26.040> falls<00:03:26.250> in<00:03:26.550> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
not real bright and it falls in the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.170 
not real bright and it falls in the
blue-green<00:03:27.360> color<00:03:27.630> range<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.700> i<00:03:29.730> recommend

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
blue-green color range so i recommend

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.180 
blue-green color range so i recommend
that<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.510> go<00:03:30.840> through<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.560> identify<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
that you go through and identify the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.000 
that you go through and identify the
three<00:03:32.700> elements<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.570> every<00:03:34.110> color<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.650> this

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
three elements of every color in this

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.910 
three elements of every color in this
group<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.640> that's<00:03:35.850> going<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.090> help<00:03:36.920> define

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
group and that's going to help define

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.729 
group and that's going to help define
your<00:03:38.489> color<00:03:38.850> vision<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.870> going<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.110> help<00:03:40.380> you

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
your color vision is going to help you

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.720 
your color vision is going to help you
realize<00:03:41.630> what<00:03:42.630> is<00:03:42.870> involved<00:03:43.769> in<00:03:44.220> each<00:03:44.459> of

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
realize what is involved in each of

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.550 
realize what is involved in each of
these<00:03:44.910> colors<00:03:45.360> rather<00:03:45.989> than<00:03:46.290> calling

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
these colors rather than calling

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.830 
these colors rather than calling
something<00:03:46.920> mimosa<00:03:47.459> or<00:03:47.730> sea<00:03:48.150> foam<00:03:48.450> which<00:03:48.690> is

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
something mimosa or sea foam which is

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.420 
something mimosa or sea foam which is
not<00:03:48.989> going<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.200> be<00:03:49.350> very<00:03:49.380> helpful<00:03:49.769> when<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.280> go

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
not going to be very helpful when you go

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.170 
not going to be very helpful when you go
into<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.850> quilt<00:03:51.120> shop<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:53.670> second<00:03:54.090> thing

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
into the quilt shop the second thing

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.610 
into the quilt shop the second thing
that<00:03:54.239> i<00:03:54.420> recommend<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.050> do<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.380> go

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
through and just figure out which of

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.240 
through and just figure out which of
these<00:03:57.150> colors<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:57.900> like<00:03:58.230> for<00:03:59.160> example

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
these colors that you like for example

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.590 
these colors that you like for example
right<00:04:00.150> here<00:04:00.780> there's<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.470> gray<00:04:02.100> color<00:04:02.489> now<00:04:03.000> gray

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
right here there's a gray color now gray

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.620 
right here there's a gray color now gray
is<00:04:03.810> not<00:04:04.019> one<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.440> my<00:04:04.769> favorite<00:04:05.280> colors<00:04:05.670> it

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
is not one of my favorite colors it

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.720 
is not one of my favorite colors it
might<00:04:06.870> be<00:04:07.019> one<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.260> yours<00:04:07.590> is<00:04:07.800> so<00:04:08.010> wonderful

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
might be one of yours is so wonderful

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.509 
might be one of yours is so wonderful
but<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.780> is<00:04:09.930> not<00:04:10.110> one<00:04:10.410> of<00:04:10.440> my<00:04:10.709> favorites<00:04:11.310> and

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
but it is not one of my favorites and

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.729 
but it is not one of my favorites and
that's<00:04:12.480> important<00:04:12.930> for<00:04:12.989> me<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.170> know<00:04:13.290> because

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
that's important for me to know because

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.340 
that's important for me to know because
even<00:04:14.400> if<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.610> is<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> trendy<00:04:15.180> color<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.720> probably

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
even if it is a trendy color I probably

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.009 
even if it is a trendy color I probably
won't<00:04:16.769> be<00:04:17.070> using<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.640> lot<00:04:17.669> of<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.299> my<00:04:18.480> quilts

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
won't be using a lot of it in my quilts

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.170
