and then here's the smart see part of
the<00:01:16.020> show<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.710> tried<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.400> first

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the show we tried to do it first

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.580 
the show we tried to do it first
applying<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.240> directly<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> paper<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
applying it directly to the paper and it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.820 
applying it directly to the paper and it
was<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:20.220> hard<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> little<00:01:22.470> trick

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
little bit of pressure so that I can see

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.400 
little bit of pressure so that I can see
exactly<00:03:03.760> where<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.120> edge<00:03:04.330> is<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:04.840> then<00:03:05.320> it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
exactly where that edge is and then it

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.060 
exactly where that edge is and then it
makes<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.650> very<00:03:05.950> easy<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.490> outline<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.890> now

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
shapes with the different colored papers

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.479 
shapes with the different colored papers
so<00:04:12.150> when<00:04:12.359> in<00:04:12.599> doubt<00:04:12.650> just<00:04:13.650> put<00:04:13.829> some<00:04:14.040> fold<00:04:14.280> on

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
so when in doubt just put some fold on

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.640 
so when in doubt just put some fold on
it<00:04:14.700> it's<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.450> new<00:04:15.599> put<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.019> bird<00:04:16.229> on<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:18.650> what

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
it it's the new put a bird on it what

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.439 
it it's the new put a bird on it what

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
was that I think it said subscribe see
