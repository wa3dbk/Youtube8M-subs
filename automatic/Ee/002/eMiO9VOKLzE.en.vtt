00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
for example the knife-edge flights you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.880 
for example the knife-edge flights you
only<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.700> do<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> quarter<00:01:57.570> roll<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.229> then

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
only have to do a quarter roll and then

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.270 
only have to do a quarter roll and then
lift<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> nose<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> little<00:01:59.880> bit<00:02:00.180> with<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> rudder

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
lift the nose a little bit with a rudder

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.469 
lift the nose a little bit with a rudder
then<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.520> sticks<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.030> released

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
then the sticks can be released

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.399 
then the sticks can be released
completely<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.850> model<00:02:06.149> flies<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.930> Rails

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
as you want for a torque roll you only

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.640 
as you want for a torque roll you only
have<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.640> bring<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.240> model<00:02:14.540> into<00:02:14.960> a<00:02:14.990> vertical

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
have to bring the model into a vertical

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.340
