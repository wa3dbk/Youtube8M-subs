00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.040
 where it will rain more where it will rain - 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 Will the atmosphere dry up? 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.330
 that's what we'll see here in our already 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.340
 known map in the next 15 days and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.650
 people can see that much of the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.140
 northern region of brazil dean to the north 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 Northeastern and already in piauí maranhão and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.400
 even in the great northern river 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.039
 these tones in green representing 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.000
 rain from 100 up to 200 mm 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.400
 accumulated 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 we also see the formation that many 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 instabilities that the presence of rainfall 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.890
 areas of mato grosso 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.550
 goiás and in the federal district 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.070
 especially rainfall volumes can 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.090
 exceed 200 mm accumulated 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.530
 mining region 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.719
 the spreading of strong areas of 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.539
 instability leading to the presence of 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.270
 this rainfall and also in some areas the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.180
 and the holy spirit now what is left 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.309
 even marked is the condition of reduction of 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.829
 for areas of são paulo and also 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.140
 in some areas of the southern region indicating 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.809
 a lower frequency in the passage of 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.769
 cold fronts until the 28th, what we 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.450
 must wait 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.220
 we should expect a little condition 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.040
 rain to areas of southern Brazil 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.799
 São Paulo region of Rio de Janeiro and the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.170
 including mines and mines 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.659
 personnel on the area of ​​abstraction of 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.770
 system, which is a great 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.240
 problem 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.520
 we also have a low rainfall condition 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.860
 due to the presence of the subtropical 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.869
 atlantic south that ends up 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.090
 arrival of cold fronts or systems 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.100
 more organized to bring rain to 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.689
 this area then we will have here a 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.700
 rainy conditions 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.979
 during this period these tones 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.930
 orange we should have a maximum of 30 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.060
 accumulated millimeters we can 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.799
 see the circulation of moisture still on 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.899
 areas of the mines 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.509
 south-central holy spirit areas 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.450
 also from goiás federal district 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.640
 of mato grosso where the instabilities 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.890
 still spread throughout this area 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.630
 a very warm atmosphere and has 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.030
 risk of heavy rain showers 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.490
 as well as in areas of the northern region of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.090
 Brazil until April 2 that we should 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.250
 Tue 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.290
 we should have a little more rain on 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.300
 some areas of são paulo even in the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.340
 region of the eastern band, volumes may 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.980
 reach the accumulated 70 millimeters 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.810
 in these shades in yellow 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.450
 as in areas of the extreme west of São Paulo 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.330
 in areas of the Minas Gerais triangle in areas 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.860
 the southern part of Minas Gerais, where 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.430
 the catchment areas of the system 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.430
