does DNA thank ya DNA you then every
third<00:02:51.730> beat<00:02:51.970> which<00:02:52.209> sounds<00:02:52.569> weird<00:02:52.930> but<00:02:53.019> it's

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
third beat which sounds weird but it's

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.300 
third beat which sounds weird but it's
like<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:56.140> just<00:02:56.410> your<00:02:56.680> plate<00:02:56.890> first<00:02:57.099> you

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
so it does this DNA every third beat and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.059 
so it does this DNA every third beat and
your<00:03:27.989> right<00:03:28.140> hand<00:03:28.409> just<00:03:28.530> does<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:29.060> star<00:03:30.060> today

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.280 

how<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:42.160> does<00:04:42.370> just<00:04:42.790> three<00:04:43.090> times<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.780> hope<00:04:44.080> you

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
how it does just three times I hope you

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.480 
how it does just three times I hope you
saw<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.800> one<00:04:45.010> you<00:04:45.850> know<00:04:46.030> if<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.210> can<00:04:47.400> see<00:04:48.400> you

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
saw that one you know if you can see you

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.670 
saw that one you know if you can see you
so<00:04:49.830> every<00:04:50.830> third<00:04:51.010> beat<00:04:51.250> just<00:04:52.180> DNA<00:04:52.630> the<00:04:53.440> next

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
so every third beat just DNA the next

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.390 
so every third beat just DNA the next
part<00:04:53.920> the<00:04:54.730> last<00:04:55.000> part<00:04:55.360> it's<00:04:55.750> two<00:04:56.440> nodes<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.190> say

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
part the last part it's two nodes so say

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.980 
part the last part it's two nodes so say
like<00:04:57.580> this<00:04:58.120> if<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.450> did<00:04:58.600> this<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:01.720> kind<00:05:01.930> of

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
thing but it goes you're seeing it

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.800 
thing but it goes you're seeing it
starts<00:05:06.100> on<00:05:06.130> cna<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:07.410> every<00:05:08.410> time<00:05:08.620> you<00:05:08.830> hit<00:05:08.950> a<00:05:09.010> G

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
starts on cna and every time you hit a G

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.480 
starts on cna and every time you hit a G
you<00:05:10.810> hit<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.020> b-flat<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.830> every<00:05:12.160> time<00:05:12.310> you<00:05:12.400> hit

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
you hit a b-flat and every time you hit

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.630 
you hit a b-flat and every time you hit
a<00:05:12.550> d<00:05:12.820> you<00:05:13.000> do<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.150> b-flat<00:05:13.540> so<00:05:14.500> first<00:05:14.770> a<00:05:14.920> scale<00:05:15.190> but

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
a d you do a b-flat so first a scale but

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:25.220 
a d you do a b-flat so first a scale but
like<00:05:18.180> you<00:05:19.180> keep<00:05:19.420> going<00:05:19.540> or<00:05:20.200> no<00:05:20.380> I<00:05:20.910> always<00:05:21.910> think

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.250 

yeah<00:05:26.230> so<00:05:26.620> d<00:05:26.890> &amp;<00:05:27.190> G<00:05:27.550> always<00:05:27.880> it<00:05:28.000> a<00:05:28.060> b-flat<00:05:28.420> you
