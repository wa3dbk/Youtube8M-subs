00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.910
 good good here we are seeing in gt5 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.340
 of fish I find here today with franklin 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.080
 at the airport and although it seems 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.310
 gimmicky as if nothing is as if 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.199
 I was on any given day 'walking around 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.140
 the street today franklin has something in front 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.859
 hers quite shocking guys are the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.359
 so much if you notice what 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.359
 has is this 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.180
 amazing space is of being world 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.450
 one of the ships I would say that some of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.969
 my top 3 most I like will be the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.530
 ship is loading the horses 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.430
 seen giant action for the snow that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.469
 has a special I do not know how to call it from 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.000
 cord or cord rather if the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.010
 better gift and a kind of cable here 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.629
 letters that are entangling the entrance the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.550
 legs of what is going to be the horse this 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.719
 giant of star wars and basically because 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.230
 it was loaded was the only way to 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.830
 kill him and the truth 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.290
 remember battlefront that I love 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.690
 rather and tearing down the streets that 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.760
 but basically it's a hydra a binge 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.920
 the texture changed and I napo basically 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.479
 the cons they have that way now 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.090
 of five courses is perfectly 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.950
 recreated and really that is amazing 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.110
 the colors all all all all of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.580
 truth and nothing for what is the train 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.460
 weighing is done so there is almost a lot left 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.750
 more aerodynamic much prettier 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.000
 the address I get tired of seeing it is 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.640
 perfectly done and how it's done to 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640
 here the propellers are activated 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.500
 is that I do not know how I do between 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.420
 truth that I flip a lot god I went 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.860
 because I really promise you this last 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.080
 and how they manage to do this 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.120
 but well you have guys inside 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.510
 from my mother's spouse how handsome up 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.260
 with the helmet and everything said oysters service 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.070
 what uruguay 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.720
 look up percent they have currado 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.720
 all the button pim pam 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.920
 because it is already 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.739
 we can shoot we can change weapons 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.000
 you have it for missiles and we can also 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:19.630
 coach to perote with the tip 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.980
 to look for something to search for example a 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.750
 Zeppelin 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.220
 you have to drive the planes here on gt5 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.220
 sometimes very complicated but good 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:45.500
 the plot thickens somewhat with its tail 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.890
 I do not know if I'm going to the site 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.890
 Right 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.970
 I totally lose 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.970
 no no 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.180
 although it seems very difficult 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:15.040
 if we get close by how clear it is 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.040
 a commercial aircraft and even if it's big 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.940
 knock it down with more illusion 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:34.980
 and if it's not there, we're accelerating 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.710
 eye does not reach the children fixed by 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.430
 fixes the tickets of jos taking them 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.430
 miserable fixtures 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.300
 I have to be closer 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.300
 if tragedy comes, the 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.720
 tragedy eye eye is already yes you can 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.220
 or not I think I could male to be 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.360
 we go like this 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.770
 I give children and wines and 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.890
 wines and videos 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.890
 very well and does not get to that direct topic 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:23.440
 On May 1, we are getting closer 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.440
 boy, we're doing pretty bad 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.430
 I think we give it no longer say I 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:40.060
 there are tied we had agreed 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:41.920
 I repeat had impacted we have reached 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.810
 shit limit fuck shit we have 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.100
 arrived we have reached the limit of the map 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.450
 When you reach the limit, you fall and 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.760
 you carlos engines without speed and 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.850
 then quiet guys we do 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.850
 there 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.629
 With surprise 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.240
 to see I thought I was going to appear with the 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.740
 ship well you know not with the counted the capo 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.740
 of the ship stuck in the ground 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.500
 two 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:15.100
 I want to be and give me rivals of 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.660
 proximity or we'll have to go out I'll 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.010
 was teaching the spacecraft know to 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.840
 the soil moles 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.690
 hello sir this for come mister look 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.080
 spatially let's go knock down the 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.080
 Boys 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.300
 also here back here is the robot 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:36.300
 this 2 r2's never never knew 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.300
 pronounce the guys and I take you 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.729
 approaching little by little like no 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.310
 wants the promising thing and 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:48.080
 complicated to handle this mineral 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.080
 and above it does not go down now 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.630
 I grew up 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.130
 it's there by 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.880
 another from which an invincible track the 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.880
 doctor at the time 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.759
 I love love is very cool the 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.580
 moment that is very currado uncle is 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:19.349
 ultra currado and really that flip 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:19.349
 well leave this style 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.340
