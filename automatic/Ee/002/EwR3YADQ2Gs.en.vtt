00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
the marks are still in place that I put

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.509 
the marks are still in place that I put
down<00:00:06.660> there<00:00:06.990> then<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.740> wrap<00:00:07.919> goes<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
down there then the wrap goes on to the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.070 
down there then the wrap goes on to the
marks<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.120> start<00:00:09.389> building<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:09.870> like<00:00:10.050> a

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
marks and you start building it like a

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.310 
marks and you start building it like a
little<00:00:10.769> erector<00:00:11.160> set<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.940> word<00:00:12.210> trap<00:00:12.900> drum

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
little erector set the word trap drum

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.970 
little erector set the word trap drum
set<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.950> said<00:00:14.759> comes<00:00:15.269> from<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.690> word

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
set it said comes from the word

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.710 
set it said comes from the word
contraption<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.160> that's<00:00:17.820> pretty<00:00:18.060> much<00:00:18.180> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
contraption and that's pretty much a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.900 
contraption and that's pretty much a
good<00:00:19.080> description<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:20.310> I've<00:00:20.430> got<00:00:20.640> there

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
good description of what I've got there

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
you know a total contraption and I

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.939 
you know a total contraption and I
worked<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.660> week<00:00:24.930> or<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.320> LA<00:00:25.740> with

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
actually pretty cool for adjusting

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.869 
actually pretty cool for adjusting
because<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:53.039> know<00:00:53.129> attach<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
because you can you know attach the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.150 
because you can you know attach the

pedal to the cradle and then move the
bass<00:00:56.340> drum<00:00:56.550> around<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.809> get<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> first<00:00:58.230> level

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
bass drum around you get the first level

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.290 
bass drum around you get the first level
up<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.039> start<00:00:59.280> sticking<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.699> Tom's<00:00:59.969> on

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
up you can start sticking the Tom's on

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.599 
up you can start sticking the Tom's on
and<00:01:00.690> second<00:01:01.649> level<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.399> start

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
and second level up you can start

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.670 
and second level up you can start
sticking<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> symbols<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.930> there's<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
sticking the symbols on and there's a

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.260 
sticking the symbols on and there's a
lot<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.860> tuning<00:01:05.339> involved<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.000> I'm<00:01:06.119> always

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
lot of tuning involved so I'm always

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.210 
lot of tuning involved so I'm always
stopping<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> tweaking<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.439> adjusting<00:01:07.979> I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
stopping and tweaking and adjusting I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.850 
stopping and tweaking and adjusting I
really<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.240> idea<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.600> having<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.080> variety

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
really like the idea of having a variety

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
really like the idea of having a variety
of<00:01:11.070> pitches<00:01:11.580> down<00:01:11.729> there<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.270> move

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
of pitches down there so I can move

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.170 
of pitches down there so I can move
around<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.020> change<00:01:13.260> keys<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:14.580> day<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
around and change keys this day as you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
around and change keys this day as you
can<00:01:15.330> see<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.990> shadows<00:01:16.409> moving<00:01:16.740> across<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
can see the shadows moving across the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.030 
can see the shadows moving across the
stage<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.820> work<00:01:18.170> was<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> first<00:01:19.590> time<00:01:19.799> I'd

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
stage as I work was the first time I'd

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.030 
stage as I work was the first time I'd
set<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.520> outside<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.150> my<00:01:21.299> house<00:01:21.650> for<00:01:22.650> me<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
set it up outside of my house for me the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.429 
set it up outside of my house for me the
reason<00:01:23.220> why<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.689> people<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
reason why I you know I know people and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.109 
reason why I you know I know people and
it's<00:01:26.100> hard<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.610> past<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.860> overwhelming

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
it's hard to get past the overwhelming

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.719 
it's hard to get past the overwhelming
impression<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.720> kit<00:01:31.140> makes<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:32.369> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
impression that that kit makes but it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.969 
impression that that kit makes but it
really<00:01:33.090> isn't<00:01:33.299> about<00:01:33.630> being<00:01:33.960> big<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.680> trying

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
really isn't about being big or trying

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.330 
really isn't about being big or trying
to<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.640> know<00:01:35.729> get<00:01:36.390> attention<00:01:36.780> by<00:01:37.710> having<00:01:38.100> more

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
to you know get attention by having more

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.090 
to you know get attention by having more
drums<00:01:38.700> than<00:01:38.970> most<00:01:39.900> people<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:40.920> about

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
drums than most people it's really about

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.539 
drums than most people it's really about
I'm<00:01:41.759> trying<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.210> play<00:01:42.390> music<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.979> if

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
I'm trying to play music and so if

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.219 
I'm trying to play music and so if
you're<00:01:44.729> playing<00:01:44.909> melodies<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.659> need<00:01:45.869> notes

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
you're playing melodies you need notes

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.469 
you're playing melodies you need notes
and<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.979> can't<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.850> tom's<00:01:48.149> because
