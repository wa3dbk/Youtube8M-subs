my opinion the Marchman is one of the
the<00:00:17.070> best<00:00:17.250> classes<00:00:17.640> available<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.330> red

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480

the best classes available in red
orchestra<00:00:18.630> -<00:00:19.050> simply<00:00:19.410> because<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:20.430> can<00:00:20.750> if<00:00:21.750> you

orchestra - simply because it can if you
could<00:00:22.500> use<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.800> effectively<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.730> stop<00:00:24.029> if

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
could use it effectively it can stop if

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.570 
could use it effectively it can stop if
you'd<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.510> entire<00:00:24.960> squads<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:26.189> their<00:00:26.340> tracks

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you'd like entire squads in their tracks

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.620 
you'd like entire squads in their tracks
because<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.000> don't<00:00:27.150> want<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> guy

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
because you don't want to be the guy

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.509 
because you don't want to be the guy
running<00:00:27.960> down<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> street<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:29.279> there's<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
running down the street when there's a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.759 
running down the street when there's a
guy<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.849> high<00:00:30.210> precision<00:00:30.769> pointed

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
guy with a high precision pointed

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.530 
guy with a high precision pointed
straight<00:00:32.070> down<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.390> have

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
straight down and you know that you have

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.880 
straight down and you know that you have
no<00:00:33.690> idea<00:00:33.960> where<00:00:34.079> he<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.530> he<00:00:34.559> knows<00:00:34.770> exactly

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
no idea where he is and he knows exactly

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.560 
no idea where he is and he knows exactly
where<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.520> are

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
where you are

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.680 
where you are
so<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.680> marksmen<00:00:38.280> class<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.760> pretty<00:00:39.090> much<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
so the marksmen class is pretty much the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.639 
so the marksmen class is pretty much the
sniper<00:00:40.230> class<00:00:42.020> which<00:00:44.270> has<00:00:45.270> four<00:00:45.780> weapon

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
you have the mauser kar98k at the moment

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.110 
you have the mauser kar98k at the moment
the<00:00:51.989> Gewehr<00:00:52.350> 43<00:00:52.879> which<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.910> the

svt-40 now the my personal favorite is
the<00:01:02.399> Mosin<00:01:03.000> Nagant<00:01:03.239> simply<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:03.989> one

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the Mosin Nagant simply because of one

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.660 
the Mosin Nagant simply because of one
of<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.619> features<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:04.979> I'll<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:05.400> into<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
of the features that I'll go into a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.750 
of the features that I'll go into a
little<00:01:05.729> bit<00:01:05.970> later<00:01:06.710> but<00:01:07.710> any<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.430> them<00:01:08.580> are

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
little bit later but any of them are

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.230 
little bit later but any of them are
pretty<00:01:09.060> good<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.659> say<00:01:10.200> stay<00:01:10.470> away<00:01:10.500> from<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
pretty good I say stay away from the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.670 
pretty good I say stay away from the
Gewehr<00:01:12.240> though<00:01:12.479> because<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.080> scope<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
Gewehr though because the scope on that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.560 
Gewehr though because the scope on that
is<00:01:13.860> absolutely<00:01:14.580> miniscule<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.360> pretty

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
is absolutely miniscule it's pretty

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.999 
is absolutely miniscule it's pretty
strange

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
strange

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.429 
strange
anyway<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.780> equipment<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.960> features

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
namely those four that I mentioned

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.210 
namely those four that I mentioned
earlier<00:01:29.630> all<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:31.020> fitted<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.409> telescopic

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
sights so large ones like you can see

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.830 
sights so large ones like you can see
here<00:01:35.009> or<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.549> tiny<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.780> the

here or the tiny one which is on the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
Gewehr which I don't think I have any

gameplay<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:41.009> telescopic<00:01:41.759> sight<00:01:42.180> allows

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
gameplay for the telescopic sight allows

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.770 
gameplay for the telescopic sight allows
you<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.590> dial<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> range<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
you to dial in the range on the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.560 
you to dial in the range on the
crosshairs<00:01:46.740> themselves<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.939> might<00:01:48.479> not

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
crosshairs themselves so you might not

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
crosshairs themselves so you might not
see<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.320> many<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> these<00:01:49.920> lips<00:01:50.280> because

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
see it in many of these lips because

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.520 
see it in many of these lips because
most<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.180> these<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.720> maps<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.520> have<00:01:53.520> played<00:01:53.790> on

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
most of these the maps I have played on

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.069 
most of these the maps I have played on
relatively<00:01:55.530> small<00:01:56.119> but<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.540> scroll<00:01:57.930> on

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
relatively small but you can scroll on

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.510 
relatively small but you can scroll on
the<00:01:58.140> mouse<00:01:58.290> wheel<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.560> you'll<00:01:59.009> see<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> cross

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the mouse wheel and you'll see the cross

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.060 
the mouse wheel and you'll see the cross
has<00:01:59.670> actually<00:02:00.000> moved<00:02:00.240> up<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.509> down<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:01.590> 100

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
has actually moved up and down in 100

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.179 
has actually moved up and down in 100
meter<00:02:02.219> increments<00:02:03.500> right<00:02:04.500> there<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:04.979> see

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
meter increments right there you can see

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.429 
meter increments right there you can see
the<00:02:05.399> iron<00:02:05.969> sights<00:02:06.329> which<00:02:06.600> which<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.049> another

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the iron sights which which is another

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.410 
the iron sights which which is another
one<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
one of the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.570 
one of the
speeches<00:02:09.200> which<00:02:09.679> is<00:02:09.979> I'm<00:02:10.190> told<00:02:10.429> is

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
speeches which is I'm told is

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.270 
speeches which is I'm told is
historically<00:02:11.030> accurate<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:12.830> mounted<00:02:13.190> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
historically accurate it mounted the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.820 
historically accurate it mounted the
telescope<00:02:13.700> closed<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.360> both<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:15.260> iron<00:02:15.530> sight

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
telescope closed of both the iron sight

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.930 
telescope closed of both the iron sight
so<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.069> you<00:02:16.250> can<00:02:16.400> use<00:02:16.520> them<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.760> close

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
so that you can use them in close

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.850 
so that you can use them in close
quarters<00:02:17.300> which<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.050> pretty<00:02:18.230> useful<00:02:18.470> for

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
quarters which is pretty useful for

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.100 
quarters which is pretty useful for
things<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:19.760> can<00:02:19.880> see<00:02:20.060> there<00:02:20.270> where<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
things that you can see there where the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.660 
things that you can see there where the
guy<00:02:21.260> was<00:02:21.290> sprinting<00:02:21.800> across<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.340> I'm<00:02:22.400> pretty

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
guy was sprinting across and I'm pretty

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.770 
guy was sprinting across and I'm pretty
sure<00:02:22.760> I<00:02:22.910> would<00:02:23.120> have<00:02:23.239> been<00:02:23.360> able<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.630> follow

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
sure I would have been able to follow

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.900 
sure I would have been able to follow
him<00:02:23.989> with<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.230> sight<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:24.830> using<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.730> iron

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
him with the sight but using the iron

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.340 
him with the sight but using the iron
sights<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.480> was<00:02:27.640> able<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.870> follow<00:02:29.870> him<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.230> lot

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
sights I was able to follow him a lot

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.910 
sights I was able to follow him a lot

so<00:04:20.750> also<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.810> want<00:04:22.050> to<00:04:22.110> make<00:04:22.170> sure<00:04:22.380> that

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
so also you want to make sure that

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.940 
so also you want to make sure that
you've<00:04:22.620> confirmed<00:04:22.980> other<00:04:23.250> kills<00:04:24.800> there's<00:04:25.800> a

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
you've confirmed other kills there's a

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.250 
you've confirmed other kills there's a
feature<00:04:26.550> which<00:04:27.420> I<00:04:27.570> don't<00:04:27.630> think<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:27.960> shown<00:04:28.140> on

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
feature which I don't think is shown on

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.410 
feature which I don't think is shown on
many<00:04:28.590> of<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.770> servers<00:04:29.100> I<00:04:29.190> play<00:04:29.430> on<00:04:29.550> fat<00:04:29.790> you

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
many of the servers I play on fat you

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.930 
many of the servers I play on fat you
can<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:33.330> server<00:04:33.780> sets<00:04:34.200> up<00:04:34.350> system<00:04:34.800> where<00:04:34.980> when

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
can the server sets up system where when

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.730 
can the server sets up system where when
you<00:04:36.060> kill<00:04:36.300> someone<00:04:36.540> it<00:04:36.870> takes<00:04:37.140> 10<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.470> 15

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740

seconds for exactly appear in the kill

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.270 
seconds for exactly appear in the kill
feed<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.960> just<00:04:43.530> make<00:04:43.680> sure<00:04:43.890> that<00:04:44.040> when<00:04:44.190> you

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
feed so it just make sure that when you

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.580 
feed so it just make sure that when you
shoot<00:04:44.490> someone<00:04:44.700> you<00:04:45.090> are<00:04:45.990> looking<00:04:46.320> on<00:04:46.440> their

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
using suppression you might see it when

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.940 
using suppression you might see it when
people<00:05:21.120> realize<00:05:21.420> where<00:05:21.690> I<00:05:21.990> am<00:05:22.140> they<00:05:22.770> just

people realize where I am they just

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.460 
people realize where I am they just
annihilate<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.640> window<00:05:23.940> with<00:05:24.300> gunfire<00:05:24.960> and

to<00:05:30.630> get<00:05:30.840> out<00:05:30.960> of<00:05:30.990> there<00:05:32.270> also<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.450> can<00:05:33.660> use

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
to get out of there also you can use

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.720 
to get out of there also you can use
smoke<00:05:34.050> grenades<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.680> run<00:05:35.040> between<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.430> cover

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
you can just like these bridges here are

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.800 
you can just like these bridges here are
not<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.640> ideal

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
not the ideal

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.780
