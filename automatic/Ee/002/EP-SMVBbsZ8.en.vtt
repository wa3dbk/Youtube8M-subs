I'm asked what is the best style of

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.000 
I'm asked what is the best style of
shooting<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:06.150> it<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.509> flip<00:00:06.779> style<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:07.919> a

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
shooting is it a flip style is it a

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.390 
shooting is it a flip style is it a
static<00:00:08.460> style<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:10.110> relaxed<00:00:10.860> style<00:00:11.040> what

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
static style is it a relaxed style what

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.759 
static style is it a relaxed style what
is<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.700> best<00:00:11.849> style<00:00:12.230> well<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> can<00:00:13.500> tell<00:00:13.710> you

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
is the best style well I can tell you

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.799 
is the best style well I can tell you
one<00:00:13.950> thing<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.460> most<00:00:14.730> accurate<00:00:15.030> style<00:00:15.599> of

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
one thing the most accurate style of

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.900 
one thing the most accurate style of
shooting<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.350> with<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> frame<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.609> built

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
shooting is with a frame that is built

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.480 
shooting is with a frame that is built
for<00:00:17.970> through<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> fork<00:00:18.630> shooting<00:00:19.020> only<00:00:19.490> that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
for through the fork shooting only that

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.740 
for through the fork shooting only that
creates<00:00:20.820> less<00:00:21.029> list<00:00:21.660> shot<00:00:22.199> fouling<00:00:22.710> less

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
creates less list shot fouling less

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.420 
creates less list shot fouling less
variables<00:00:24.750> less<00:00:25.109> everything<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.400> have

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
variables less everything and you have

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.880 
variables less everything and you have
and<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:26.970> use<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> static<00:00:27.779> static<00:00:28.320> hold<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.740> your

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and you use a static static hold on your

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.370 
and you use a static static hold on your
front<00:00:29.039> hand<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:30.269> gives<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.230> most

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
front hand that gives you the most

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
front hand that gives you the most
accuracy<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.160> cuz<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.520> creates<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.000> list

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
accuracy of all cuz it creates a list

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.959 
accuracy of all cuz it creates a list
the<00:00:33.510> least<00:00:33.750> amount<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> variables<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:35.760> most

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the least amount of variables the most

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.690 
the least amount of variables the most
powerful<00:00:36.690> type<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.140> shooting<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.160> forced

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
powerful type of shooting is a forced

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.160 
powerful type of shooting is a forced
flip<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.210> front<00:00:39.510> hand<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.989> pull

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
flip with the front hand as you pull

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.530 
flip with the front hand as you pull
back<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> back<00:00:40.770> hand<00:00:41.149> what<00:00:42.149> minute<00:00:42.420> some

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
back with a back hand what minute some

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.110 
back with a back hand what minute some
people<00:00:42.750> will<00:00:42.870> call<00:00:42.989> an<00:00:43.170> active<00:00:43.350> shot<00:00:44.120> you

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
people will call an active shot you

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.650 
people will call an active shot you
never<00:00:45.360> actually<00:00:46.489> line<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.059> freeze<00:00:48.510> it

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
never actually line it up and freeze it

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.840 
never actually line it up and freeze it
on<00:00:48.780> your<00:00:48.930> target<00:00:49.320> you're<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.340> motion<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
on your target you're in motion the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.970 
on your target you're in motion the
entire<00:00:51.090> time<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.870> pulls<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.590> pulls<00:00:52.829> away

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
entire time this pulls and pulls away

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.549 
entire time this pulls and pulls away
from<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.730> shoot<00:00:54.620> hey<00:00:55.620> you're<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:57.559> shot

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
from you as you shoot hey you're a shot

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.000 
from you as you shoot hey you're a shot
where<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.859> line<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.969> up<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:01.410> shoot<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
where you line it up and shoot and that

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.100 
where you line it up and shoot and that
relaxes<00:01:02.760> through<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.390> essentially<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
relaxes through it is essentially the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.140 
relaxes through it is essentially the
same<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.530> static<00:01:05.010> shot<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> front<00:01:05.909> hand

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
same as a static shot on the front hand

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.850 
same as a static shot on the front hand
so<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.840> were<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.200> hold<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.740> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
so if I were to hold it here and I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.630 
so if I were to hold it here and I
forced<00:01:08.189> my<00:01:08.280> front<00:01:08.520> hand<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.760> freeze<00:01:10.189> or<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.520> I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
forced my front hand to freeze or if I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
forced my front hand to freeze or if I
were<00:01:11.790> forced<00:01:12.000> my<00:01:12.210> front<00:01:12.450> hand<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.320> I

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
were forced my front hand or if I

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.109 
were forced my front hand or if I
allowed<00:01:13.710> my<00:01:13.890> front<00:01:14.130> hand<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> relax<00:01:14.760> through

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
allowed my front hand to relax through

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.510 
allowed my front hand to relax through
the<00:01:15.299> shot<00:01:15.540> that's<00:01:16.500> gonna<00:01:16.710> create<00:01:17.340> this

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the shot that's gonna create this

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.810 
the shot that's gonna create this
essentially<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> same<00:01:19.070> amount<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.310> feet<00:01:20.790> per

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
essentially the same amount of feet per

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.600 
essentially the same amount of feet per
second<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.689> gonna<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.080> any<00:01:22.229> different

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
second it's not gonna be any different

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.840 
second it's not gonna be any different
but<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.509> shoot<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.460> forced<00:01:26.460> flip<00:01:26.729> I'm

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
but if I shoot with a forced flip I'm

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.390 
but if I shoot with a forced flip I'm
like<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.570> pull<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.650> out<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> my<00:01:28.979> back

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
like this and I pull it out of my back

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.090 
like this and I pull it out of my back
hand<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> forced<00:01:30.960> flip<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.799> creates

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
hand that is a forced flip it creates

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.380 
hand that is a forced flip it creates
another<00:01:32.340> variable<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.210> you're

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
another variable in there because you're

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.480 
another variable in there because you're
pulling<00:01:33.810> forward<00:01:34.290> you're<00:01:34.740> pushing<00:01:35.130> forward

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
pulling forward you're pushing forward

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.060 
pulling forward you're pushing forward
and<00:01:36.030> you're<00:01:36.900> pulling<00:01:37.170> back<00:01:37.200> at<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> same<00:01:37.799> time

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and you're pulling back at the same time

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.539 
and you're pulling back at the same time
it<00:01:38.880> creates<00:01:39.090> another<00:01:39.420> variable<00:01:40.220> but<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.250> also

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
it creates another variable but it also

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.130 
it creates another variable but it also
creates<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.970> lot<00:01:42.000> more<00:01:42.119> power<00:01:42.479> let<00:01:42.899> me<00:01:42.960> show<00:01:43.079> you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
creates a lot more power let me show you

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.200 
creates a lot more power let me show you
I'm<00:01:43.229> talking<00:01:43.409> about<00:01:44.030> okay

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
I'm talking about okay

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.210 
I'm talking about okay
this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> chronograph<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:46.649> I'm<00:01:47.009> gonna

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
this is a chronograph here I'm gonna

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.179 
this is a chronograph here I'm gonna
turn<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.619> first<00:01:49.860> thing<00:01:50.009> I'm<00:01:50.100> going

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
turn it on and the first thing I'm going

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.249 
turn it on and the first thing I'm going
to<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.460> I'm<00:01:50.579> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> shoot<00:01:50.939> three<00:01:51.899> shots

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
two hundred twenty two point seven so

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.610 
two hundred twenty two point seven so
essentially<00:02:52.670> just<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:53.000> same<00:02:53.269> shot<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.959> they're

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
essentially just a same shot and they're

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.430 
essentially just a same shot and they're
relaxed<00:02:55.130> through<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.060> shot<00:02:56.299> will<00:02:56.810> create

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
relaxed through it shot will create

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.370 
relaxed through it shot will create
exactly<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.280> same<00:02:58.519> type<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.239> feet<00:02:59.780> per<00:02:59.900> second

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
exactly the same type of feet per second

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.680 
exactly the same type of feet per second
now<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:04.310> most<00:03:04.519> powerful<00:03:04.760> type<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.359> shooting

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
now the most powerful type of shooting

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.470 
now the most powerful type of shooting
is<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:09.560> forced<00:03:09.920> flip<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.609> forced<00:03:10.940> flip<00:03:11.180> is

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
is the forced flip the forced flip is

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.569 
is the forced flip the forced flip is

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
okay force flip will create 250 point 8

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.210 
okay force flip will create 250 point 8
feet<00:04:11.010> per<00:04:11.040> second<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:14.070> approximately<00:04:16.220> 28

seven point five and this is with a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.890 
seven point five and this is with a
forced<00:04:28.380> flip<00:04:31.760> 260<00:04:32.760> and<00:04:33.330> we'll<00:04:33.570> do<00:04:33.690> one<00:04:33.870> more

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
forced flip 260 and we'll do one more

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.070 
forced flip 260 and we'll do one more
and<00:04:34.760> see<00:04:35.760> if<00:04:35.850> I<00:04:35.940> can<00:04:36.120> time<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.450> flip<00:04:36.660> just

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
and see if I can time the flip just

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.300

and<00:06:18.240> that's<00:06:18.420> what<00:06:18.540> you're<00:06:18.690> shooting<00:06:18.810> and

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
and that's what you're shooting and

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.920 
and that's what you're shooting and
that's<00:06:19.500> what<00:06:19.650> you<00:06:19.770> get<00:06:20.210> as<00:06:21.210> you<00:06:21.450> saw<00:06:21.660> right

that's what you get as you saw right

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.500 
that's what you get as you saw right
there<00:06:21.990> I'm<00:06:22.530> shooting<00:06:22.980> up<00:06:23.280> to<00:06:23.430> 250<00:06:24.180> feet<00:06:24.210> per

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
there I'm shooting up to 250 feet per

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.700 
there I'm shooting up to 250 feet per
second<00:06:24.900> with<00:06:25.110> a<00:06:25.140> flip

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
second with a flip

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.580 
second with a flip
today<00:06:26.130> is<00:06:26.400> about<00:06:26.880> 69<00:06:27.570> degrees<00:06:27.600> almost<00:06:28.170> 70

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
today is about 69 degrees almost 70

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.240 
today is about 69 degrees almost 70

so<00:06:30.120> it's<00:06:30.420> a<00:06:30.540> nice<00:06:30.690> one<00:06:31.200> it's<00:06:31.410> not<00:06:31.860> a<00:06:31.890> cold<00:06:32.220> day

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
so it's a nice one it's not a cold day

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.890 
so it's a nice one it's not a cold day
but<00:06:32.460> it's<00:06:32.760> not<00:06:32.820> exactly<00:06:33.090> a<00:06:33.330> really<00:06:33.540> warm<00:06:33.750> day

in Texas will you know in another couple
of<00:06:36.540> months<00:06:36.750> we'll<00:06:36.870> be<00:06:36.900> up<00:06:37.200> past<00:06:37.500> a<00:06:37.650> hundred<00:06:37.860> so

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
of months we'll be up past a hundred so

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.250 
of months we'll be up past a hundred so
I'm<00:06:40.740> always<00:06:41.040> going<00:06:41.250> to<00:06:41.310> be<00:06:41.550> well<00:06:41.970> above<00:06:42.260> the

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
I'm always going to be well above the

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.290 
I'm always going to be well above the
terminal<00:06:43.710> ballistic<00:06:44.900> potential<00:06:45.900> on<00:06:46.050> my<00:06:46.260> ammo

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
terminal ballistic potential on my ammo

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.670 
terminal ballistic potential on my ammo
no<00:06:48.300> matter<00:06:48.480> what<00:06:48.720> style<00:06:48.930> of<00:06:49.110> shooting<00:06:49.260> I<00:06:49.470> use

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
no matter what style of shooting I use

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.180 
no matter what style of shooting I use
so<00:06:49.890> I<00:06:49.920> always<00:06:50.730> use<00:06:51.120> the<00:06:51.780> most<00:06:52.080> accurate<00:06:52.710> style

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
so I always use the most accurate style

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.190 
so I always use the most accurate style
which<00:06:53.310> would<00:06:53.430> be<00:06:53.550> through<00:06:53.730> the<00:06:53.850> forks<00:06:54.210> with<00:06:55.170> a

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
which would be through the forks with a

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.990 
which would be through the forks with a
static<00:06:55.650> front<00:06:55.830> hand<00:06:56.130> but<00:06:56.580> if<00:06:56.670> you<00:06:56.790> live<00:06:56.970> up

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
static front hand but if you live up

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.930 
static front hand but if you live up
north<00:06:57.360> and<00:06:57.720> as<00:06:58.410> cold<00:06:58.710> you<00:06:59.370> need<00:06:59.550> to<00:06:59.640> make<00:06:59.790> up

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
north and as cold you need to make up

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.700 
north and as cold you need to make up
for<00:07:00.090> the<00:07:00.210> cold<00:07:00.420> weather<00:07:00.600> killing<00:07:01.200> your<00:07:01.290> bands

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
for the cold weather killing your bands

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.840 
for the cold weather killing your bands
and<00:07:01.920> killing<00:07:02.160> the<00:07:02.250> strength<00:07:02.460> of<00:07:02.550> your<00:07:02.640> bands

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
and killing the strength of your bands

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.150 
and killing the strength of your bands
so<00:07:03.780> the<00:07:04.110> only<00:07:04.380> way<00:07:04.560> which<00:07:04.740> you<00:07:04.860> could<00:07:04.980> probably

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
so the only way which you could probably

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.280 
so the only way which you could probably
get<00:07:05.670> a<00:07:05.700> terminal<00:07:06.260> velocity<00:07:07.260> would<00:07:07.560> be<00:07:08.240> by<00:07:09.290> flip

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.290 
get a terminal velocity would be by flip

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.980 
get a terminal velocity would be by flip
shooting<00:07:10.650> at<00:07:10.920> the<00:07:11.130> same<00:07:11.340> time<00:07:11.780> alright<00:07:12.780> that

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 
shooting at the same time alright that

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.660 
shooting at the same time alright that
should<00:07:13.020> answer<00:07:13.380> a<00:07:13.500> few<00:07:13.650> questions<00:07:13.830> thanks<00:07:14.550> for

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:14.670 
should answer a few questions thanks for

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.600 
should answer a few questions thanks for
watching<00:07:14.970> and<00:07:15.090> y'all<00:07:15.180> have<00:07:15.300> a<00:07:15.330> good<00:07:15.450> day
