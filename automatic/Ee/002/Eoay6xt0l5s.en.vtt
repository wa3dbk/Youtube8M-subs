00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
films do we we keyframe our animation so

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
films do we we keyframe our animation so
we<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.680> frame<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:52.949> oppose<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
we we go to a frame and oppose it and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.670 
we we go to a frame and oppose it and
then<00:00:53.969> go<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.570> friends<00:00:54.809> later<00:00:54.989> posted<00:00:55.410> again

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
then go for friends later posted again

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.220 
then go for friends later posted again
and<00:00:55.890> craft<00:00:56.640> our<00:00:56.879> movement<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.809> course<00:00:58.050> we

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and craft our movement and of course we

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.880 
and craft our movement and of course we
are<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.699> Norway<00:00:59.699> right<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.170> such<00:01:01.859> a
