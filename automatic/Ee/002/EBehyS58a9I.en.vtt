00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.360
 she is at home 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.220
 motorized 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.299
 the most important question when not all 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.940
 We find ourselves in a new reservoir 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.340
 what do we actually do is 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.170
 the reservoir is some kind of flooded 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.160
 mainstream vast expanses 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.630
 bays and protruding stumps 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.449
 many, many options for work 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.930
 by swim where to swim water in a huge 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:38.140
 amount of what to do how to prepare 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.210
 to such a situation in my opinion 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.250
 best to prepare 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.290
 prepare for this still at home 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.010
 working with the card for a number of factors can 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.890
 estimate 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.550
 that most likely we will look for that is 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.500
 let's say if it's midsummer then pike 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.260
 will prefer usually will 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.120
 prefer depths of approximately 3 to 6 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.879
 meters that is, we need 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.330
 interesting relief at a depth of 3 to 6 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.039
 meters 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.190
 interesting relief can be how 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:11.289
 it can be happy navels it can 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.899
 be rollers it can be braids 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.810
 locked up without tails with a shirt without 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.040
 Fry of course with Malik much better 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.130
 diverse places just huge 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.490
 amount of course I absolutely all of them 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.470
 I can't call you now but primary 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.470
 what should we repel it 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.049
 still depth if we accept 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.930
 whether we are interested in the middle 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.850
 This for trophy pike depth 3 until 6 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.150
 meters then we need relief on this 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.369
 depth before heading to 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.490
 pond to be already prepared 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:49.180
 before we swim we need a good one 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.030
 map and we need to have worked 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.079
 scheme for at least one two days, that is, we 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.409
 on our map we are looking for alleged 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.720
 areas usually always large pike 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.960
 great depths that is 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.630
 there must be some kind of depression 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.429
 pit is best fairway with 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.350
 maximum depth if in this 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.079
 pond maximum depth of 20 meters 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.079
 it means there should be 20 meters near 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:19.900
 enough cool edge and enough 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:22.180
 quick approach to this point a. herself 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.130
 maybe located on watering somewhere 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.250
 some slants groove coming out 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.860
 through this watering there is a relief on 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.080
 depth from 3 to 6 meters with contiguity 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.120
 great depth 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.510
 great if this zone is fry it 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.970
 I also have one more factor 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.760
 makes a plus to this place that is 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.070
 the presence of great depth 1 plus presence 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.210
 interesting relief 2 plus presence 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.700
 feed base is another plus sign 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.330
 places where the predator can hide another one 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.890
 very important and big plus that is 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.750
 large pikes 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.210
 she is uncomfortable to stand on such flat 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.730
 sandbanks she needed some 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.180
 microrelief it can be micro grooves 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.370
 some clay camber and some 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.480
 roots and koryazhke better not here 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.210
 such here sticking up some may 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.480
 be logs lying at the bottom much 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:24.140
 it is more convenient to hide behind these logs 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.690
 Here initially on the map we allocate for 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.130
 yourself an interesting area ie we look 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.550
 where do we have 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.650
 channel approaching as close as possible to 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.080
 watering see how deep it is 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.000
 watering let some area we 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.980
 survey we look at watering and a half or two 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.800
 a half or two but I mean the depth of grief 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.690
 a half two meters somewhere meter 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.580
 a priori, we most likely this site is not 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.570
 interested we can fly up to 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.200
 several places 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.090
 let's say how i do seemingly depth 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.610
 such a borderline in the map indicates two 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:00.110
 half meter ac3 i'm already starting 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.660
 active search large pikes I fly up 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.510
 on the curb with a distance of 200-300-400 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.270
 meters that is i hung up flew to 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.400
 of this edge came off the hydrofoil and went out 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.650
 This edge was convinced that she went to 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.959
 two two and a half meters which me 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.690
 not interested, I looked at the structure 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.709
 I admit I made a decision that 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.360
 eyebrow so-so again and moved 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.580
 another two hundred three hundred and four hundred meters 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.260
 so of course some 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.110
 interesting plot some interesting 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.970
 local place i can skip but with 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.240
 another position is impossible to embrace 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.139
 immense need to choose something and so 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.539
 way 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.060
 I still get ideas about 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:44.529
 plot that is, let's say somewhere brow 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.360
 two meters away then she starts 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:49.999
 canopy down to 4 meters and on 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.400
 watering is already 4 meters 4 meters on watering it 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:55.129
 completely different situation this is cool 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.370
 place to catch track to find good 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:01.610
 micro points already on this watering for fishing 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.770
 trophy or pike so initially 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.900
 Of course, I certainly make a start from 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.539
 depths further if i 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.789
 plot like we went out to water on 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.889
 four meters can be permanent 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.439
 snags or maybe nothing at all 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:19.120
 being here begins more 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:22.639
 tight work from this zone that is, we 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.430
 walk constant equidistant 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.620
 tacks usually with a depth of 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.349
 watering about four to five meters these 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.389
 tacks are 30 meters distance 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.089
 between the boat, that is, it turns out so 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.849
 a sinusoid is obtained such a snake if 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:41.180
 eyebrow we have sent let's say 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:43.430
 here in this plane yes then snake cut 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.449
 at 90 degrees relative to this edge 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:52.189
 this way with a watering depth of 45 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:54.169
 meters we in the structure of scania overlap 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.629
 even the zone that is, we do not miss 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.789
 nothing on this edge and we are interested 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.219
 some local navels some 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.899
 clay camber and 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:05.750
 some roots a lot of places that 

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:08.060
 on us may be interested but in general 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.009
 if the site is interesting then by it 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.169
 Of course you need to walk slowly it 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:17.779
 full-length studying it is long it is tedious 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:20.389
 sometimes 2 3-4 hours you just swim 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:22.279
 swimming swimming swimming instructed 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.259
 some reference points on all of them to you 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:26.300
 not much like you could something 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:30.319
 check something could not check at all 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.629
 and nothing is nothing you are you swimming 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:37.370
 found nothing you can swim about 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:40.909
 so about the day you can swim so 2 diamond 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.589
 a diamond can be found it comes from 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:45.019
 nowhere literally next 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:47.719
 tack you turn and you see which 

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:49.700
 I don’t know anything there as we found in 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:51.980
 Uglich reservoir flooded 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.930
 the yacht from which they caught the flooded 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.140
 yacht in the middle ruslana how to find her 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:00.530
 only full length work on 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:05.840
 this channel we swam searched floated searched 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:07.700
 sailed searched stumbled upon a yacht and here in 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.700
 what a big difference you need to look for 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.460
 promising sites and exactly depth 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:17.110
 tells us about prospects or not 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.110
 prospects of the area
