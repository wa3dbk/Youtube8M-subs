introduce<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:05.040> this<00:00:05.400> f-22<00:00:06.529> quick<00:00:07.529> build

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
introduce to you this f-22 quick build

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.540 
introduce to you this f-22 quick build
this<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.380> made<00:00:10.559> on<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> six<00:00:10.950> millimeter<00:00:11.190> two

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
this is made on a six millimeter two

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.169 
this is made on a six millimeter two
pronged<00:00:11.820> foam<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.420> had<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> sheet<00:00:13.349> lying<00:00:13.620> around

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
pronged foam I had a sheet lying around

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.599 
pronged foam I had a sheet lying around
so<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.210> just<00:00:15.450> had<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.660> build<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.049> little<00:00:16.199> guy

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
so I just had to build this little guy

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:29.060 
so I just had to build this little guy
and<00:00:18.050> a<00:00:19.050> reason<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.789> because<00:00:21.480> my<00:00:22.850> sr-71<00:00:28.070> I'm

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
and a reason for is because my sr-71 I'm

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.810 
and a reason for is because my sr-71 I'm
crashing<00:00:29.580> down<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.090> mean<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:31.610> blackbirds<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
crashing down I mean this blackbirds a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.080 
crashing down I mean this blackbirds a
beauty<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> mean<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.840> flies<00:00:34.200> great<00:00:34.820> it<00:00:35.820> won't<00:00:36.030> be

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
beauty I mean it flies great it won't be

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.319 
beauty I mean it flies great it won't be
the<00:00:36.180> last<00:00:36.210> time<00:00:36.570> I'll<00:00:36.750> be<00:00:36.840> building<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.320> guy

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
the last time I'll be building this guy

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.060 
the last time I'll be building this guy
but<00:00:39.329> uh<00:00:41.480> yeah<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:43.469> should<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.800> been<00:00:43.860> into

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
but uh yeah it should have been into

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.319 
but uh yeah it should have been into
like<00:00:44.190> should<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:44.910> went<00:00:45.030> into<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
like should have went into like a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.810 
like should have went into like a
million<00:00:45.570> pieces<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.200> uh<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.820> electrical

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
million pieces but uh the electrical

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.779 
million pieces but uh the electrical
tape<00:00:48.000> around<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> edges<00:00:48.719> helped<00:00:49.590> keep<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> all

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
tape around the edges helped keep it all

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.869 
tape around the edges helped keep it all
together<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.980> mean<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.190> wanted<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.610> give<00:00:53.820> you

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
together I mean if I wanted to give you

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.760 
together I mean if I wanted to give you
some<00:00:54.059> hot<00:00:54.210> glue<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.629> probably<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.590> guy

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
some hot glue in probably get this guy

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.119 
some hot glue in probably get this guy
back<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.340> again<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:56.789> yeah<00:00:57.739> time<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> move<00:00:58.949> on

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
back up again but yeah time to move on

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.609 
back up again but yeah time to move on

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
throttle more than enough power for this

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.230 
throttle more than enough power for this
bad<00:01:28.880> boy<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.509> I<00:01:29.600> also<00:01:29.780> added<00:01:30.250> lights<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:31.700> hope
