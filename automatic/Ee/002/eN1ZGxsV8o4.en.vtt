00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:13.879
 looking for franke from the cafÃ© moscow 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.799
 the HTC warned in Berlin and I have 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.300
 hand and after seeing my colleague 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.390
 Almir just presented the hardware 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.339
 I'd like to have now a little 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.039
 more intense look at the software 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.509
 this single new smartphones that us 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.359
 both very excited annoying 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.249
 so you get a little closer so 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.810
 the first one I'll do it again 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.710
 and then again, then you see 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.660
 this is the new lockscreen from htc one 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.750
 that with the software surface htc 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.580
 sense 5 is equipped that is called 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.130
 now only htc sense was de facto 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.100
 it's the fifth version so that's me 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.440
 pull now here was the lockscreen up 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.800
 already the first thing you see is one 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.110
 feature the up link five that is a 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.909
 self-selected news 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.800
 Compilation you can do it yourself 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.750
 certain topics or specific media 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.949
 Select here in which case it looks for 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.850
 example something from the dpa 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.780
 to see and to the star and so on me 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.520
 can roll through here so long until that 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.030
 is reached and here we will 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.280
 current news beautifully illustrated 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.409
 presented from the thematic areas the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.090
 I am interested in android next 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.560
 should also be there somehow 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.840
 I let me know I have it now 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.289
 not seen here in the software yet 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.030
 so that's flashing feed but he has 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.030
 now report a bit now 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.009
 the normal android with the schema tag 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.720
 but I also come to a whole 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.140
 normal to play when i just go 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.200
 scroll to the right so here we have 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.619
 normal google search here we have 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.869
 installed a few apps and that is 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.789
 the homescreen here we have one 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.170
 calculator widget that is natural 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.579
 also can move normally 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.930
 I think lets leave here too 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.579
 more still hovered around hinzuschalten 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.170
 and as far as I know , this is also 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.369
 brings if you do not like it when the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.930
 you are not up to date 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.720
 it wants to stay completely disconnectable 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.130
 so normal home game is the 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.470
 appstore is also one again 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.510
 little different from stock android 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.030
 unlike the previous htc 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.120
 Sense version to scroll hereafter high 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.220
 up and down 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.020
 and what is generally striking is that 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.850
 many icons for example 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.280
 look a little different that too here 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.670
 down in the doc in the bar 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.650
 bold icons something yes minimalist 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.209
 and flatter 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.910
 that's a style I like 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.790
 personally very good so much for the first time 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.400
 software design a thing that I have you 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.140
 would like to show is the camera 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.540
 function so the camera we have here 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.290
 a few guests already shot 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.760
 from htc one is relatively good now must 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.580
 I just 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.299
 is this the camera app for here 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.819
 taken below 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.480
 So I'm going to own it 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.540
 namely a feature that is so and 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.549
 and I can just enter here now 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.650
 shoot a photo but that's not a real thing 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.989
 foto but here is just a 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.599
 recorded less than three seconds of film 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.280
 So basically I can do scenes 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.829
 pick up the move I go now 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.349
 in the gallery and you see 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.970
 this one is just a little three 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.500
 seconds to see and that will 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.200
 then saved in the gallery 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.440
 from many different jurys so is 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.150
 I can also automatically from the device 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.090
 to put together a film with 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.879
 great soundtrack in the background and is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.709
 is a really exciting feature 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.329
 of course now the question if and 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.870
 To what extent is this on the pc in the 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.670
 can play form so that must 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.319
 we examine everything in detail I 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.140
 still going to be a rough one 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.900
 give an insight 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.480
 a special feature of the htc when is still 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.720
 the infrared blaster up here 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.150
 which is integrated in the power button with it 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.520
 i can have a lot of devices in my 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.980
 Living room remote control and although there are 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.590
 here is a tv 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.600
 There she is where I am here now 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.100
 TV program can select now 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.500
 of course not preset here 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.739
 I just want my postal code 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.739
 purely 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.410
 here in berlin one annually 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.110
 cable operator 1 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.570
 the stations I receive and yes with 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.820
 this tv function in combination with 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.760
 the tip with the deceased I can stop 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.710
 Watching live what is watching on TV 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.090
 runs and also directly select here 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.120
 the device and there are of course still 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.410
 additional functions you have to 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.160
 everything again in detail 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.400
 look at 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.470
 overall a very cool feature and yes 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.729
 I have heard that quite often 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.260
 that people wish that in 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.080
 smartphones again like they used to 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.800
 blaster are installed the htc one is 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.050
 now one of these is the first one 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.270
 the first smartphone for a long time 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.820
 this feature has integrated soy 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.020
 so much first to htc sense we look 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:14.669
 again in the in that construction pure 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.710
 Here is a year again this famous 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.940
 htc moderate black on white menu in the 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.850
 you look in the info times but here 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.530
 arises is wrong 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.660
 here we see exactly android version 4 1 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.790
 2 and htc 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.530
 50 I'm pretty sure it is 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.300
 that the thing is derived quickly 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.730
 Actually, we are already here 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.160
 you see a system update offered that 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.550
 will be guaranteed even if you 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.800
 you buy the device and unpack that 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.040
 is probably already a system update 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.890
 available so that was one 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.590
 rough insight into the software 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.450
 oh so before I forget it dropbox 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.940
 there are again 25 gigabyte memory like 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.710
 Last year at the one and devices 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.170
 I wanted you again youtube app 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.250
 show with a nowhere ending video 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.050
 Shake if it has to be 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.910
 here you can in fact you can ye 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.990
 again exactly when I'm back 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.990
 with the micro turn 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.179
 the sound is 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.979
 really good of the htc evo at that is 

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:22.990
 really real series and that is 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:26.709
 damn loud it is indeed too 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:29.169
 a little something audible and so 

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:30.789
 absolutely one soundwise i would almost 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:34.689
 really say a revelation very much 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:37.990
 very nice so much for the rateteam 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:41.259
 to a terrific device me and me 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.459
 are in the collective enthusiastic and we 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:44.289
 We'll be safe in that 

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:46.149
 get some shape and soon 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.129
 also test as soon as possible 

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:49.659
 frank first from android next with the 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:52.650
 htc man from berlin 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:54.680
 bye for now 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.680
