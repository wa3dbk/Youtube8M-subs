00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.419 
designer we're going to tweak a few
things<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.769> think<00:00:13.799> you'll<00:00:14.160> see<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
things and I think you'll see the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.230 
things and I think you'll see the
difference<00:00:15.320> all<00:00:16.320> right<00:00:16.440> let's<00:00:16.650> start<00:00:16.740> out<00:00:17.039> by

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
difference all right let's start out by

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.910 
difference all right let's start out by
grabbing<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.359> clip<00:00:18.570> art<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.260> let's<00:00:19.650> shrink

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
grabbing the clip art and let's shrink

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.970 
grabbing the clip art and let's shrink
it<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.340> little<00:00:20.369> bit<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.619> then<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.740> want<00:00:22.890> to

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
it just a little bit and then we want to

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.870 
it just a little bit and then we want to
change<00:00:23.539> let's<00:00:24.539> change<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.990> font<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:26.699> best

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
change let's change the font the best

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.830 
change let's change the font the best
way<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.510> if<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.140> go<00:00:28.380> into<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:30.660> add

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
way to do that is if you go into the add

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.940 
way to do that is if you go into the add
tab<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.640> preview<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.800> fonts

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
tab and you can preview the fonts

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.770 
tab and you can preview the fonts
I<00:00:37.010> like<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:37.820> one<00:00:37.880> so<00:00:38.390> we're<00:00:38.540> going<00:00:38.630> to<00:00:38.720> go

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
I like this one so we're going to go

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.380 
I like this one so we're going to go
down<00:00:39.380> here<00:00:40.480> we're<00:00:41.480> going<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:41.690> find<00:00:41.870> that<00:00:42.050> font

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.440 

and<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.170> thick<00:00:46.380> text<00:00:46.980> all<00:00:47.340> right<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:48.239> we'll

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
and a thick text all right now we'll

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.420 
and a thick text all right now we'll
shrink<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.899> song<00:00:49.140> we're<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.160> move<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
shrink it song we're going to move it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.500 
shrink it song we're going to move it
over<00:00:51.200> bring<00:00:52.200> this<00:00:52.350> up<00:00:52.559> here

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
over bring this up here

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.200 
over bring this up here
and<00:00:55.050> increase<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.649> song

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.930 

I<00:00:58.329> think<00:00:58.840> we'll<00:00:59.020> make<00:00:59.559> this<00:00:59.829> font<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.660> same

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
I think we'll make this font the same

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.899 
I think we'll make this font the same
as<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.840> word<00:01:04.019> crossroads

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.039 

I<00:01:08.159> mean<00:01:09.159> alright<00:01:09.850> let's<00:01:10.090> swing<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:10.509> down<00:01:10.719> so

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
I mean alright let's swing it down so

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.069 
I mean alright let's swing it down so
they're<00:01:11.170> both<00:01:11.289> the<00:01:11.890> same<00:01:11.920> size<00:01:12.869> move<00:01:13.869> it<00:01:13.990> up

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
they're both the same size move it up

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.550 
they're both the same size move it up
there<00:01:14.909> now<00:01:15.909> I<00:01:15.939> think<00:01:16.090> we'll<00:01:16.689> add<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.049> little<00:01:17.380> bit

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
there now I think we'll add a little bit

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.830 
there now I think we'll add a little bit
more<00:01:17.799> flair<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.399> it<00:01:18.429> we're<00:01:18.670> going<00:01:18.789> to<00:01:18.880> change
