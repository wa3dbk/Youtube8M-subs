00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
packaging because they're made of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.760 
packaging because they're made of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
it and we

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.780 
it and we
a<00:01:56.670> lot<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:58.140> packaging<00:01:58.860> itself<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
a lot the packaging itself like the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.149 
a lot the packaging itself like the
palette<00:02:00.150> itself<00:02:00.300> was<00:02:00.720> also<00:02:01.200> cardboard

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
palette itself was also cardboard

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.719 
palette itself was also cardboard
feeling<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.850> which<00:02:03.150> is<00:02:03.180> really<00:02:03.540> good<00:02:03.750> too<00:02:04.729> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
feeling so which is really good too the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.300 
feeling so which is really good too the
only<00:02:05.970> fact<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.830> make<00:02:07.830> sure<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.190> you

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
only fact is that make sure that you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.040 
only fact is that make sure that you
don't<00:02:08.459> really<00:02:08.640> hit<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> anywhere<00:02:09.420> because<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
don't really hit it anywhere because the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.690 
don't really hit it anywhere because the
card<00:02:10.289> one<00:02:10.440> might<00:02:10.649> dent<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.520> break

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
card one might dent and then you break

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.010 
card one might dent and then you break
your<00:02:11.880> eyeshadows<00:02:12.390> other<00:02:12.930> than<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.470> plastic<00:02:15.020> let

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
and more durable rather than the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.000

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
ahead and take some odd shadows and Pat

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.530 
ahead and take some odd shadows and Pat
it<00:03:37.260> on<00:03:37.440> top<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.070> make<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.400> look<00:03:38.550> a<00:03:38.850> bit

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
it on top just to make the look a bit

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.490 
it on top just to make the look a bit
more<00:03:39.720> darker<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.140> just<00:03:40.470> took<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.740> block<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:42.500> these

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
more darker I just took a block so these

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.170 
more darker I just took a block so these
eye<00:03:43.710> shadow<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.220> think<00:03:44.550> they<00:03:44.730> will<00:03:44.880> apply

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
eye shadow I think they will apply

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.180 
eye shadow I think they will apply
better<00:03:45.450> if<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.780> have<00:03:45.960> somewhat<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.590> primer<00:03:46.950> or

better if you have somewhat a primer or

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.520 
better if you have somewhat a primer or
a<00:03:47.220> base<00:03:47.520> on<00:03:47.730> Drake<00:03:47.970> but<00:03:48.450> also<00:03:48.750> i'll<00:03:49.200> give<00:03:49.380> your
