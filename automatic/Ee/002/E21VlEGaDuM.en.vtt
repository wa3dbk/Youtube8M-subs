00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.649
 hello hello there I am again 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.849
 electric motor manager of our company 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.580
 Yaroslav and I on articles 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.679
 today we will talk again about 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.220
 asynchronous motor namely 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.410
 tell the principle of work and show 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.600
 probably some shootings that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.670
 Yaroslav was happy to prepare 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.430
 let's go to him Yaroslav from me 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.109
 there is a picture 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.189
 Asynchronous motor I really want 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.059
 so you tell me what's where 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.329
 located huge engine consists 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.239
 from the stator this is the fixed part 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.280
 and the rotor itself which 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.770
 rotates in turn 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.390
 the stator and the rotor consist of windings and 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.789
 magnetic and that is, and active 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.480
 parts that are involved in the process 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.640
 electrical energy conversion 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.550
 mechanical all other parts 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.739
 are constructive provide 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.750
 stiffness can trust constructions 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:13.049
 the possibility of rotation is the bearings 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:17.520
 the fan cools the engine 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.140
 mount a good Yaroslav and maybe 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.770
 you will draw tell the circuit from the stator 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.400
 windings of course well firstly I will draw 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.210
 three phase network 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.409
 it is usually denoted bc i.e. it 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.840
 380 volts 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:43.200
 the stator is connected to it by wires 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.439
 we connect to the three-phase winding network 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.369
 stator that look like 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.369
 in the following way 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:04.460
 This is how winding looks 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:07.590
 stator and by the way yes and here we have filed 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.030
 three phase voltage on our windings 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:17.250
 the stator through it starts to flow along 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:21.000
 these currents current this current when 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.950
 leaking through the stator winding as 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:32.790
 we have space windings 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:36.300
 at an angle of 120 degrees i.e. this current 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.150
 flowing through such windings which 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.680
 arranged so space are formed 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.750
 magnetic field is magnetic field 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.780
 I'll draw the rotor immediately with the windings 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.470
 this magnetic field rotates intersects 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.310
 the rotor windings and displays them electro 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.730
 the driving force accordingly 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.580
 rotor windings as it is located 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.640
 this squirrel cage winding 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.910
 closed here like this 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.970
 pictures are like this winding 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.780
 rotor it is short closed in the form of 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.360
 squirrel cage and here's the interaction 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.100
 these stator and rotor fields leads to 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.280
 the emergence of electromagnetic 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.700
 torque which forces 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.920
 rotor rotate if you remember watched 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.110
 our videos about asynchronous motor we 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.690
 Yaroslav has already been filmed but true 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.930
 we had a synchronous motor like this 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:44.090
 live can say so if to whom 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.830
 the more convenient the video and it became useful 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.280
 we are very happy today we are also 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.420
 Yaroslav also told him today 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.430
 talked about the principle of work 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.750
 winding and asynchronous motor 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.670
 right 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.120
 watch our videos subscribe to 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.280
 channel and ask us questions if in 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.319
 something really interests us with 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.349
 pleasure we answer truth 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.340
 Of course with you were Yaroslav and anastasia 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.340
 bye bye bye
