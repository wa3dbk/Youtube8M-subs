the video it's how to break bedrock in

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.890 
the video it's how to break bedrock in
Minecraft<00:00:24.220> and<00:00:24.460> this<00:00:24.760> hasn't<00:00:25.120> been<00:00:25.270> able<00:00:25.660> to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
Minecraft and this hasn't been able to

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.860 
Minecraft and this hasn't been able to
do<00:00:26.140> for<00:00:26.530> a<00:00:26.560> long<00:00:26.860> time<00:00:27.340> and<00:00:27.670> I'm<00:00:28.540> going<00:00:28.660> to<00:00:28.720> show

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
you will need to be in 1.7.2 to do this

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.900 
you will need to be in 1.7.2 to do this
and<00:00:35.019> all<00:00:35.890> you<00:00:35.980> gonna<00:00:36.100> need<00:00:36.219> to<00:00:36.339> do<00:00:36.460> that<00:00:36.640> though

and all you gonna need to do that though
is<00:00:37.199> dark<00:00:38.199> oak<00:00:38.410> saplings<00:00:39.089> bone<00:00:40.089> meal<00:00:40.329> and<00:00:40.780> just

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
is dark oak saplings bone meal and just

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.110 
is dark oak saplings bone meal and just
a<00:00:41.559> few<00:00:42.010> extras<00:00:42.429> but<00:00:42.640> you<00:00:42.699> don't<00:00:42.850> really<00:00:42.940> need

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
a few extras but you don't really need

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.579 
a few extras but you don't really need
shears<00:00:43.480> to<00:00:43.719> be<00:00:43.780> honest<00:00:44.109> and<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:47.289> basically

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
shears to be honest and this basically

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.380 
shears to be honest and this basically
how<00:00:47.949> you<00:00:48.010> do<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:48.309> you<00:00:48.370> just<00:00:48.429> set<00:00:48.909> up<00:00:48.940> a<00:00:49.329> little

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
how you do it you just set up a little

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.439 
how you do it you just set up a little
quadrant<00:00:50.289> of<00:00:50.409> dirt<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:50.859> then<00:00:51.339> you<00:00:51.519> set<00:00:51.999> up<00:00:52.149> the

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
quadrant of dirt and then you set up the

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.189 
quadrant of dirt and then you set up the
dark<00:00:52.929> oak<00:00:53.140> saplings<00:00:54.069> and<00:00:54.339> then<00:00:54.429> you<00:00:54.519> just<00:00:55.199> do

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
dark oak saplings and then you just do

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.799 
dark oak saplings and then you just do
this<00:00:56.409> and<00:00:56.679> if<00:00:57.249> your<00:00:57.789> tree<00:00:58.030> does<00:00:58.269> this<00:00:58.479> like

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
this and if your tree does this like

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.239 
this and if your tree does this like
this<00:00:58.989> then<00:00:59.289> you<00:00:59.409> all<00:00:59.530> you<00:00:59.649> need<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.859> do<00:00:59.979> is

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
this then you all you need to do is

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.879 
this then you all you need to do is
break<00:01:00.519> the<00:01:00.789> bottom<00:01:01.210> four<00:01:01.479> and<00:01:02.350> put<00:01:02.679> more

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:02.889 
break the bottom four and put more

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:06.200 
break the bottom four and put more
saplings<00:01:03.670> down<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.239> then<00:01:04.420> keep<00:01:04.750> spamming<00:01:05.320> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
saplings down and then keep spamming and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.870 
saplings down and then keep spamming and
this<00:01:07.210> works<00:01:07.869> 100%<00:01:08.469> in<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:09.100> vanilla<00:01:09.729> like

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
this works 100% in a vanilla like

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.330 
this works 100% in a vanilla like
survival<00:01:10.479> mode<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.899> it<00:01:11.560> you<00:01:11.890> don't<00:01:12.070> have<00:01:12.250> to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
survival mode and it you don't have to

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.010 
survival mode and it you don't have to
be<00:01:12.430> in<00:01:12.520> creative<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:13.000> do<00:01:13.119> this<00:01:13.270> I'm<00:01:13.570> just<00:01:13.780> doing

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
be in creative to do this I'm just doing

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.709 
be in creative to do this I'm just doing
it<00:01:14.170> right<00:01:14.799> here<00:01:15.070> because<00:01:15.549> it's<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:16.090> lot<00:01:16.539> easier

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
it right here because it's a lot easier

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.469 
it right here because it's a lot easier
to<00:01:17.110> do<00:01:17.229> in<00:01:17.380> creative<00:01:18.100> than<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:18.369> is<00:01:18.479> survival

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
to do in creative than it is survival

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.080 
to do in creative than it is survival
and<00:01:19.750> all<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:20.770> need<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:20.979> do<00:01:21.100> is<00:01:21.369> keep<00:01:21.610> doing

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
and all you need to do is keep doing

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.899 
and all you need to do is keep doing
this<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.780> if<00:01:23.409> this<00:01:23.590> doesn't<00:01:23.860> do<00:01:24.549> it<00:01:24.700> yet

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
this and if this doesn't do it yet

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.749 
this and if this doesn't do it yet
exactly<00:01:25.539> like<00:01:25.689> this<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:26.079> want<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.289> be<00:01:26.759> you

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
exactly like this you want to be you

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.940 
exactly like this you want to be you
want<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.060> have<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.360> tree<00:01:28.630> grow<00:01:29.020> down<00:01:29.409> into<00:01:29.439> the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
want to have the tree grow down into the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.060 
want to have the tree grow down into the
floor<00:01:30.219> so<00:01:30.869> let<00:01:31.869> me<00:01:31.960> just<00:01:32.140> go<00:01:32.320> around<00:01:32.409> seeing

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
floor so let me just go around seeing

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.300 
floor so let me just go around seeing
right<00:01:33.850> here<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:35.109> cool<00:01:35.350> thing<00:01:35.590> with<00:01:35.920> dark

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
right here and the cool thing with dark

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.270 
right here and the cool thing with dark
oak<00:01:36.520> sapling<00:01:37.119> trees<00:01:37.390> is<00:01:37.810> when<00:01:38.320> they<00:01:38.560> grow<00:01:38.920> they

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
oak sapling trees is when they grow they

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.370 
oak sapling trees is when they grow they
actually<00:01:39.670> sometimes<00:01:40.149> replace<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.109> blocks

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
actually sometimes replace the blocks

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.249 
actually sometimes replace the blocks
around<00:01:41.649> them<00:01:42.130> with<00:01:42.460> their<00:01:42.939> own<00:01:43.149> tree<00:01:43.539> parts<00:01:43.929> so

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
around them with their own tree parts so

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.539 
around them with their own tree parts so
that<00:01:47.259> works<00:01:47.590> for<00:01:47.799> bedrock<00:01:48.070> as<00:01:48.250> well<00:01:48.369> it

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
that works for bedrock as well it

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.120 
that works for bedrock as well it
replaces<00:01:49.060> bedrock<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.689> I'm<00:01:50.259> pretty<00:01:50.829> sure

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
replaces bedrock and I'm pretty sure

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.669 
replaces bedrock and I'm pretty sure
it's<00:01:51.460> about<00:01:51.609> to<00:01:51.909> be<00:01:52.030> done<00:01:52.210> here<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:52.869> all<00:01:53.590> you

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
it's about to be done here so all you

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.410 
it's about to be done here so all you
need<00:01:53.829> to<00:01:53.890> do<00:01:54.009> is<00:01:54.159> break<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.609> block<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.000> then

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
need to do is break the block and then

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.569 
need to do is break the block and then
as<00:01:55.719> you<00:01:56.049> can<00:01:56.170> see<00:01:56.409> it's<00:01:56.710> actually<00:01:56.890> replaced

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
as you can see it's actually replaced

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.760 
as you can see it's actually replaced
the<00:01:58.090> bedrock<00:01:58.509> around<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:58.960> with<00:01:59.109> a<00:01:59.140> log<00:01:59.409> and

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
the bedrock around it with a log and

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.279 
the bedrock around it with a log and
then<00:01:59.920> all<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.219> need<00:02:00.249> to<00:02:00.369> do<00:02:00.549> is<00:02:00.820> you<00:02:01.810> could<00:02:01.990> if

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
then all you need to do is you could if

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.690 
then all you need to do is you could if
you're<00:02:02.499> in<00:02:02.590> survival<00:02:02.829> mode<00:02:03.070> all<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.399> need<00:02:03.609> to

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
you're in survival mode all you need to

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.330 
you're in survival mode all you need to
do<00:02:03.789> is<00:02:03.939> break<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.539> or<00:02:04.840> with<00:02:05.140> an<00:02:05.229> axe<00:02:05.409> punch<00:02:06.130> it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
do is break this or with an axe punch it

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.980 
do is break this or with an axe punch it
whatever<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:07.270> would<00:02:07.420> break<00:02:07.600> like<00:02:07.899> a

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
whatever and it would break like a

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.649 
whatever and it would break like a
normal<00:02:08.229> block<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.740> then<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.269> can<00:02:10.420> see

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
normal block and then as you can see

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.550 
normal block and then as you can see
you're<00:02:11.200> now<00:02:12.159> in<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:13.170> under

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
you're now in the under

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.350 
you're now in the under
under<00:02:14.890> there<00:02:15.040> over<00:02:15.340> worlds<00:02:15.730> if<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.150> makes

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
under there over worlds if that makes

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.410 
under there over worlds if that makes
sense<00:02:16.810> under<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.170> overworld<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:19.270> can

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
sense under the overworld and you can

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.300 
sense under the overworld and you can
definitely<00:02:19.630> do<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.620> nether<00:02:20.830> as<00:02:21.160> well

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
definitely do this in the nether as well

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.870 
definitely do this in the nether as well
on<00:02:21.520> top<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:21.940> roof<00:02:22.150> or<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> bottom<00:02:23.110> and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
on top of the roof or in the bottom and

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.979 
on top of the roof or in the bottom and
I'm<00:02:24.880> just<00:02:25.180> showing<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:25.540> here<00:02:25.750> in<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
I'm just showing you here in the

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.809 
I'm just showing you here in the
overworld<00:02:26.290> because<00:02:26.709> it's<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.250> easiest<00:02:27.580> to

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
overworld because it's the easiest to

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.210 
overworld because it's the easiest to
get<00:02:27.940> underneath<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:29.620> didn't<00:02:29.860> even<00:02:29.980> take

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
get underneath and it didn't even take

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.240 
get underneath and it didn't even take
me<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.459> long<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:31.319> get<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.470> resort<00:02:32.830> here<00:02:33.040> and

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
me that long to get the resort here and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.070 
me that long to get the resort here and
little<00:02:33.849> probably<00:02:34.239> be<00:02:34.330> in<00:02:34.450> some<00:02:34.690> other<00:02:34.780> places

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
little probably be in some other places

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.559 
little probably be in some other places
as<00:02:35.290> well<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:35.739> yes<00:02:36.430> right<00:02:36.700> here<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.390> see

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
as well so yes right here and you see

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.540 
as well so yes right here and you see
I've<00:02:37.690> got<00:02:37.720> two<00:02:38.050> broken<00:02:38.349> blocks<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.160> bedrock

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
I've got two broken blocks of bedrock

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.420 
I've got two broken blocks of bedrock
there<00:02:39.790> just<00:02:40.090> from<00:02:40.360> using<00:02:40.660> trees<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:42.160> that's

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
there just from using trees so that's

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.580 
there just from using trees so that's
the<00:02:42.580> really<00:02:42.940> awesome<00:02:43.239> part<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.230> there<00:02:44.410> as

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
the really awesome part and and there as

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.350 
the really awesome part and and there as
well<00:02:44.800> so<00:02:44.830> that's<00:02:45.310> an<00:02:45.519> even<00:02:45.730> cool<00:02:45.910> entrance

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
well so that's an even cool entrance

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.960 
well so that's an even cool entrance
right<00:02:46.510> there<00:02:46.569> are<00:02:46.750> two<00:02:46.930> wide<00:02:47.230> bit<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:48.310> let's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
right there are two wide bit and let's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.780 
right there are two wide bit and let's
see<00:02:49.269> if<00:02:49.690> we<00:02:49.930> get<00:02:50.140> any<00:02:50.350> round<00:02:50.650> here<00:02:51.100> no

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
see if we get any round here no

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.229 
see if we get any round here no
unfortunately<00:02:52.690> not<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.950> just<00:02:54.160> doing<00:02:54.880> this

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
unfortunately not but just doing this

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.420 
unfortunately not but just doing this
simple<00:02:55.870> process<00:02:56.140> allowing<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.130> break<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
simple process allowing you to break the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.400 
simple process allowing you to break the
floor<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.239> never<00:02:58.870> thought<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.380> could

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
floor that you never thought you could

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.610 
floor that you never thought you could
break<00:02:59.980> ever<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.750> being<00:03:01.750> able<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.080> like<00:03:02.349> get

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
break ever and being able to like get

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.070 
break ever and being able to like get
underneath<00:03:02.890> build<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.489> base<00:03:03.730> or<00:03:04.209> get<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.630> top<00:03:04.900> of

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
underneath build a base or get on top of

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.559 
underneath build a base or get on top of
the<00:03:05.200> nether<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:06.310> super<00:03:06.640> flat<00:03:06.940> environment

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
the nether and a super flat environment

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.640 
the nether and a super flat environment
or<00:03:07.690> there<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.170> just<00:03:08.470> start<00:03:08.920> building<00:03:09.099> away

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
or there and just start building away

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.850 
or there and just start building away
and<00:03:11.650> that's<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:12.010> seriously<00:03:12.790> awesome<00:03:12.940> trick<00:03:13.420> and
