00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
here goes so I'm using a capo think

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.499 
here goes so I'm using a capo think
that's<00:01:25.310> what<00:01:25.460> it's<00:01:25.550> called<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:28.090> um<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:29.149> guess

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:38.260 
that's what it's called and um I guess
is<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.690> G<00:01:33.190> and<00:01:34.390> it's<00:01:35.920> basically<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:37.280> just<00:01:38.060> hit<00:01:38.240> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
is a G and it's basically I just hit the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.600 
is a G and it's basically I just hit the
G<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.869> come<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.320> little<00:01:39.590> bit<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.220> then<00:01:42.610> I'm

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
G and I come a little bit and then I'm

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.910 
G and I come a little bit and then I'm
gonna<00:01:43.729> say<00:01:43.940> hammer<00:01:44.600> on<00:01:46.990> on<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.200> on<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.590> third

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
gonna say hammer on on the on the third

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.790 
gonna say hammer on on the on the third
stringer<00:01:49.670> is<00:01:49.970> if<00:01:50.330> that's<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.320> third<00:01:51.530> string

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800
