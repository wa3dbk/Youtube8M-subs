00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.149
 with the handle that is the congratulations that 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.730
 I'll teach you to do we will integrate 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.170
 fast because people tell me what 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.269
 he eats atrocious whole because it 's takes 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.309
 a lot of boil the rice 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.809
 integral is equal to the avalanche and remains 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.060
 white nothing else you have to know 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.270
 do it and put the right amount of 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.710
 water observe abide guarded integral 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.770
 since they call and they are used a lot in 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.770
 Argentina 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.430
 because every cup of rice 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.500
 those notes 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.449
 maybe I have an hour pass 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.870
 for each cup of rice I'm going to take one and 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:51.710
 a quarter of water then this 2 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.710
 and we throw a 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.649
 Y 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.649
 two 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.330
 two and a half then why do you 2 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.659
 good tricks the next good one of 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.150
 the tricks is the right amount of water 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.830
 I always put a lot of water not same I 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.290
 to have boiling two hours and it's never going to 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.290
 be talking let's raise the fire 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.810
 Bubbles are already there 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.360
 say that it's starting to boil 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.230
 let's put the fire to minimum and 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.420
 we cover 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.910
 good look after about 15 minutes 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.300
 16 minutes he already sucked all the water on 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:42.580
 rice and what I 'm going to do is leave it 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.580
 there, covered , the fire went out 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.420
 here we have the rice that we have not left 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.619
 cool down basically notice that it has 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.619
 sucked all the water 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.900
 it took us more or less to do it half 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.390
 one hour and about 15-20 minutes serving 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.130
 at a minimum fire and then we leave it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.870
 we put out the town we left there covered 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.050
 until you suck all the water and you 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.789
 it's about half an hour and we have a 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.769
 good brown rice made 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.769
 and with this we are going to make a salad 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.799
 but it's hard for me if we take too long 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.799
 beautiful
