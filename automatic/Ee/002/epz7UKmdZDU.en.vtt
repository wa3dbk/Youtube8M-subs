okay guys it is possible search the web
I<00:02:01.079> know<00:02:01.740> there's<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.659> made<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:04.340> with<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.490> help

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
I know there's I made this with the help

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.410 
I know there's I made this with the help
of<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.969> German<00:02:06.420> guy<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.960> was<00:02:08.179> installing<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
of a German guy that was installing a

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.889 
of a German guy that was installing a
backlight<00:02:09.840> on

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
backlight on

spektrum<00:02:11.379> dx6i<00:02:12.180> think<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.420> believe<00:02:13.689> so<00:02:14.650> I

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
spektrum dx6i think I believe so I

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.839 
spektrum dx6i think I believe so I
followed<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> couple<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.439> pointers<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.519> he

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
followed a couple of pointers that he

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.000 
followed a couple of pointers that he
had<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:21.000> made<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.239> project<00:02:22.599> but<00:02:23.110> with

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
had and then made this project but with

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.240 
had and then made this project but with
the<00:02:24.159> 7c<00:02:24.700> it's<00:02:25.030> little<00:02:26.019> bit<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.290> little<00:02:27.099> bit

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
the 7c it's little bit a little bit

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.440 
the 7c it's little bit a little bit
trickier<00:02:27.790> because<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.689> screen<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:30.189> comes

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
trickier because the screen that comes

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.270 
trickier because the screen that comes
from<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.569> front<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.140> not<00:02:32.290> from<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.650> back<00:02:32.829> and

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
from the front and not from the back and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.270 
from the front and not from the back and
you<00:02:33.370> need<00:02:33.549> to<00:02:34.349> jiggle<00:02:35.349> around<00:02:35.439> a<00:02:35.890> little<00:02:36.040> bit

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
you need to jiggle around a little bit
