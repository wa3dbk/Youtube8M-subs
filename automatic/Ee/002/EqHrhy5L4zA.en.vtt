 week sarah we have to do the 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.880
 100% natural modeling clay 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.550

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.410
 now we will do the modeling clay 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.730
 it's a modeling clay that when she 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.040

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.410
 For example, we made fathers 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.460
 made a little star so 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.860
 you can make what you 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.300

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.670
 will make an eris there are small 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.470
 holes and then we can take the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.580

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:08.200

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.210

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.729
