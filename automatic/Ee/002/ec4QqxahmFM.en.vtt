00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the folks in window so shows you where

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.049 
the folks in window so shows you where
the<00:00:57.329> focus<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.899> how<00:00:58.530> far<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:59.460> distance<00:00:59.850> from

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the focus is how far your distance from

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.590 
the focus is how far your distance from
the<00:01:00.300> lens<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:03.379> it<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.710> feels<00:01:05.190> really<00:01:06.090> really

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the lens and it just feels really really

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.490 
the lens and it just feels really really
nice

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
nice

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.090 
nice
I<00:01:07.530> think<00:01:08.340> Tamron<00:01:08.880> has<00:01:09.229> really<00:01:10.229> put<00:01:10.500> really

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
I think Tamron has really put really

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.630 
I think Tamron has really put really
good<00:01:11.250> arm<00:01:11.600> plastics<00:01:12.600> into<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.049> because

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
good arm plastics into this because

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.350 
good arm plastics into this because
feels<00:01:14.640> very<00:01:14.820> tough<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.310> let's<00:01:18.060> look<00:01:18.149> at<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
feels very tough so let's look at the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.139 
feels very tough so let's look at the
focusing<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.110> I'm<00:01:19.829> using<00:01:20.039> back<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.969> it

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
focusing so I'm using back because it

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.279 
focusing so I'm using back because it
does<00:01:21.360> extend<00:01:21.689> quite<00:01:22.079> a<00:01:22.110> bit<00:01:23.539> so<00:01:24.539> you<00:01:24.869> can

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
does extend quite a bit so you can

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.980 
does extend quite a bit so you can
either<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> set<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.280> my<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.789> focus<00:01:27.180> when

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
either have it set to my your focus when

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.130 
either have it set to my your focus when
you<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.770> turn<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.340> ring<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.240> focus<00:01:31.020> yourself

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
you can turn the ring and focus yourself

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.029 
you can turn the ring and focus yourself
or<00:01:31.859> if<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.609> want<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.909> turn<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.840> old<00:01:34.049> focus<00:01:34.469> the

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
or if you want to turn to old focus the

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.270 
or if you want to turn to old focus the
actually<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> push<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.969> wheel<00:01:36.829> I<00:01:37.829> mean

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
actually have to push the wheel I mean

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.359 
actually have to push the wheel I mean
the<00:01:38.430> ring<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.909> then<00:01:39.859> when<00:01:40.859> you<00:01:40.950> turn<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the ring and then when you turn it

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.039 
the ring and then when you turn it
nothing<00:01:41.939> will<00:01:42.030> happen<00:01:42.149> because<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.719> set<00:01:42.899> or

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
nothing will happen because it's set or

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.980 
nothing will happen because it's set or
not<00:01:43.079> focus<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.630> there's<00:01:45.630> an<00:01:45.780> interesting

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
not focus and there's an interesting

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.200 
not focus and there's an interesting
thing<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.469> this<00:01:46.920> which<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> switch

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
thing about this which is the switch

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.870 
thing about this which is the switch
here<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.560> turn<00:01:49.619> back<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.159> mine<00:01:50.789> your

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
here and if I turn back to mine your

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.740 
here and if I turn back to mine your
focus<00:01:52.070> there's<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.969> can<00:01:54.119> either<00:01:54.270> switch<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
focus there's you can either switch to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.459 
focus there's you can either switch to
full<00:01:54.990> which<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.369> now<00:01:56.759> or<00:01:56.969> limit<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:58.289> you

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
full which is it on now or limit if you

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.399 
full which is it on now or limit if you
have<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> long<00:01:58.710> fall<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.100> can<00:02:00.020> extend<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.229> lens

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
have a long fall you can extend the lens

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.840 
have a long fall you can extend the lens
out<00:02:01.890> fully<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.609> zoom<00:02:03.210> out<00:02:03.390> fully<00:02:04.340> sorry<00:02:05.429> focus

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
out fully and zoom out fully sorry focus

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.440 
out fully and zoom out fully sorry focus
fully<00:02:05.999> and<00:02:06.240> if<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.649> limit<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:09.300> can

fully and if have it on limit you can

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.399 
fully and if have it on limit you can
either<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:09.960> so<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.290> only

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
if I turn it back to full focus for a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.960 
if I turn it back to full focus for a
bit

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
bit

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.630 
bit
turn<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.270> limit<00:02:36.540> if<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.260> go<00:02:37.440> back<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:38.520> will

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
turn it to limit if I go back it will

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.810 
turn it to limit if I go back it will
stop<00:02:38.880> me<00:02:39.030> there<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.930> now<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.500> have<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.190> limit<00:02:41.580> from

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
stop me there so now I have a limit from

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.810 
stop me there so now I have a limit from
naught<00:02:42.239> point<00:02:42.390> four<00:02:42.750> millimeters

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
naught point four millimeters

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.020 
naught point four millimeters
I<00:02:44.880> mean<00:02:45.600> notebook<00:02:46.020> four<00:02:46.200> centimeters<00:02:46.739> or

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
I mean notebook four centimeters or

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.990 
I mean notebook four centimeters or
that's<00:02:48.030> one<00:02:48.480> point<00:02:48.660> three<00:02:48.959> feet<00:02:49.670> all<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.940> way

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
that's one point three feet all the way

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.710 
that's one point three feet all the way
down<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:52.070> twenty<00:02:53.070> nine<00:02:53.280> millimeters<00:02:54.120> or<00:02:54.300> not

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
down to twenty nine millimeters or not

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.800 
down to twenty nine millimeters or not
0.96<00:02:55.650> feet<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.970> when<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.420> have<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
0.96 feet and this is when you have the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.100 
0.96 feet and this is when you have the
one<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.350> one<00:02:58.560> aspect<00:02:58.800> ratio<00:02:59.570> so<00:03:00.570> if<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.840> turn

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
one to one aspect ratio so if I turn

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.620 
one to one aspect ratio so if I turn
that<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:02.720> think<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.170> reason<00:03:04.980> for<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:05.280> is

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
that and I think the reason for this is

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.479 
that and I think the reason for this is
when<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.720> have<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.900> set<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.830> old<00:03:08.640> focus<00:03:09.120> and

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
when you have it set to old focus and

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.800 
when you have it set to old focus and
maybe<00:03:11.489> you're<00:03:11.700> shooting<00:03:12.000> portraits<00:03:12.269> because

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
maybe you're shooting portraits because

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.479 
maybe you're shooting portraits because
this<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> very<00:03:13.560> good<00:03:13.739> lens<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:14.100> portraits

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
this is a very good lens for portraits

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.140 
this is a very good lens for portraits
by<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.730> way<00:03:15.080> maybe<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.200> want<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.380> set<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.010> to

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
by the way maybe you want to set it to

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.310 
by the way maybe you want to set it to
have<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.269> from<00:03:18.600> infinity<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:22.709> forty<00:03:23.250> five

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
have it from infinity to the forty five

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.490 
have it from infinity to the forty five
millimeters<00:03:25.320> because<00:03:27.380> sorry<00:03:28.380> meters<00:03:29.420> because

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
millimeters because sorry meters because

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.930 
millimeters because sorry meters because
you're<00:03:31.500> not<00:03:31.590> going<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.829> get<00:03:31.950> very<00:03:32.010> close<00:03:32.610> to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
you're not going to get very close to

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.509 
you're not going to get very close to
your<00:03:33.090> subject<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:34.829> don't<00:03:35.040> want<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.430> go

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
your subject and you don't want it to go

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.880 
your subject and you don't want it to go
all<00:03:35.790> if<00:03:36.209> it's<00:03:36.420> having<00:03:36.870> trouble<00:03:36.989> focus<00:03:37.769> you

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
all if it's having trouble focus you

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.830 
all if it's having trouble focus you
don't<00:03:38.010> want<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.280> go<00:03:38.400> all<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.329> way<00:03:39.360> down<00:03:39.630> and

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
don't want it to go all the way down and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.030 
don't want it to go all the way down and
back<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.980> get<00:03:41.160> in<00:03:41.250> focus<00:03:45.290> okay<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:46.350> if<00:03:46.920> I

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
back it in to get in focus okay so if I

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.210 
back it in to get in focus okay so if I
took<00:03:47.100> take<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:48.000> off<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:49.650> can<00:03:49.769> actually<00:03:49.860> see

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
took take that off you can actually see

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.130 
took take that off you can actually see
that<00:03:50.400> there's<00:03:50.850> quite<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.570> big<00:03:51.750> distance

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
that there's quite a big distance

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.289 
that there's quite a big distance
between<00:03:52.440> where<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.160> actual<00:03:55.250> lens<00:03:56.299> glasses

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
between where the actual lens glasses

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.220 
between where the actual lens glasses
and<00:03:57.980> where<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.100> lens<00:03:59.280> ends<00:03:59.730> I'm<00:03:59.940> not<00:04:00.810> sure<00:04:01.049> why

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
and where the lens ends I'm not sure why

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.710 
and where the lens ends I'm not sure why
that<00:04:01.260> is

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
that is

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.009 
that is
seriously<00:04:03.720> have<00:04:03.810> no<00:04:03.840> idea<00:04:04.260> ahem<00:04:05.660> but<00:04:06.660> it's

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
seriously have no idea ahem but it's

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.569 
seriously have no idea ahem but it's
quite<00:04:07.200> interesting<00:04:07.230> um<00:04:07.769> maybe<00:04:08.280> I'll<00:04:08.430> look

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
quite interesting um maybe I'll look

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.380 
quite interesting um maybe I'll look
into<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.200> if<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.290> take<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:10.590> off<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:12.209> can

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
into that and if I take this off you can

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.170 
into that and if I take this off you can
see<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:14.390> blades<00:04:15.390> open<00:04:16.200> up<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.910> close<00:04:17.910> down

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
see the blades open up and close down

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.150 
see the blades open up and close down
and<00:04:18.479> there's<00:04:18.989> actually<00:04:19.260> nine<00:04:19.470> blades<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:19.979> this

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
and there's actually nine blades in this

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.450 
and there's actually nine blades in this
so<00:04:20.459> if<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:21.150> have<00:04:21.180> for<00:04:21.660> example<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:22.289> light<00:04:23.130> and

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
so if you have for example a light and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.409 
so if you have for example a light and
that's<00:04:23.640> out<00:04:24.000> of<00:04:24.030> focus<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:25.860> won't<00:04:26.370> look<00:04:26.640> the

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
that's out of focus it won't look the

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.029 
that's out of focus it won't look the
the<00:04:27.750> edges<00:04:27.990> won't<00:04:28.200> be<00:04:28.289> very<00:04:28.470> sharp<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:29.010> will

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
the edges won't be very sharp it will

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.020 
the edges won't be very sharp it will
just<00:04:29.220> be<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.400> nice

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
just be a nice

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.440 
just be a nice
circle<00:04:30.390> which<00:04:30.510> I<00:04:30.750> think<00:04:31.050> looks<00:04:31.230> very<00:04:31.440> nice<00:04:32.450> so

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
circle which I think looks very nice so

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.480 
circle which I think looks very nice so
here's<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.720> Lansford<00:04:34.080> if<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.680> put<00:04:35.160> that<00:04:35.280> on<00:04:35.400> you

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
here's the Lansford if I put that on you

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.760 
here's the Lansford if I put that on you
have<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.640> eyeline<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.750> dot<00:04:36.990> with<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.260> dot<00:04:37.530> and

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
have to eyeline the dot with the dot and

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.990 
have to eyeline the dot with the dot and
then<00:04:38.640> it<00:04:38.820> just<00:04:39.210> snaps<00:04:39.660> in<00:04:40.160> so<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.340> looks<00:04:41.550> much

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
then it just snaps in so it looks much

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.150 
then it just snaps in so it looks much
bigger<00:04:42.240> not<00:04:43.050> sure<00:04:43.170> why<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:43.410> would<00:04:43.470> want<00:04:44.040> it

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
bigger not sure why you would want it

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.800 
bigger not sure why you would want it
because<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.990> depth<00:04:46.770> here<00:04:46.920> anyway<00:04:47.730> but<00:04:48.060> you

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
because of the depth here anyway but you

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.740 
because of the depth here anyway but you
know<00:04:48.930> Tamron<00:04:49.380> included<00:04:49.770> it<00:04:49.890> and<00:04:50.070> I<00:04:50.660> don't<00:04:51.660> know

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
know Tamron included it and I don't know

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.240 
know Tamron included it and I don't know
they<00:04:52.020> know<00:04:52.260> what<00:04:52.470> they're<00:04:52.650> doing<00:04:52.980> and

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
they know what they're doing and
