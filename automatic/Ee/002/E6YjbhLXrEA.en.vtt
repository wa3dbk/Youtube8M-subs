six inches in and this is just gonna be

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.160 
six inches in and this is just gonna be
my<00:00:43.530> guide<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.250> far<00:00:44.820> as<00:00:44.910> how<00:00:45.120> far<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.809> want<00:00:46.080> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
gonna be very freehand so I'm just gonna

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.069 
gonna be very freehand so I'm just gonna
take<00:00:50.219> my<00:00:50.370> rotary<00:00:50.700> cutter<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.090> take<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.719> little

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
take my rotary cutter and take a little

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.439 
take my rotary cutter and take a little
bit<00:00:52.200> of<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> curve<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
bit of a curve like this and then to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.939 
bit of a curve like this and then to
make<00:00:54.600> sure<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.989> get<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.199> symmetrical<00:00:55.829> so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
make sure that you get it symmetrical so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.979 
make sure that you get it symmetrical so
it<00:00:55.980> matches<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.520> other<00:00:56.699> side<00:00:57.000> take<00:00:57.719> what

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it matches on the other side take what

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.680 
it matches on the other side take what
you<00:00:58.170> cut<00:00:58.440> away<00:00:58.670> flip<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.850> on<00:00:59.969> itself<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.600> I'll

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
you cut away flip it on itself so I'll

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.170 
you cut away flip it on itself so I'll
show<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.930> again<00:01:01.050> take<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.039> cut<00:01:02.309> flip<00:01:03.030> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
show you again take what you cut flip it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
show you again take what you cut flip it
on<00:01:03.300> itself<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.899> match<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:04.739> tip<00:01:05.009> at<00:01:05.160> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
on itself and match up the tip at the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.950 
on itself and match up the tip at the
bottom<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> mark<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.090> made<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.539> then

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
bottom with the mark you made and then

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.719 
bottom with the mark you made and then
just<00:01:07.140> follow<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.680> edge<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.399> your

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
just follow the edge of it as your

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.460 
just follow the edge of it as your
template<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.899> way<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.320> that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
template and that way you know that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.260 
template and that way you know that
you've<00:01:10.590> cut<00:01:10.860> away<00:01:11.039> the<00:01:11.190> exact<00:01:11.520> same<00:01:11.729> amount<00:01:11.880> on

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
you've cut away the exact same amount on

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
you've cut away the exact same amount on
both<00:01:12.330> sides<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.470> open<00:01:13.800> it<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.160> should

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
both sides when you open it up it should

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.800 
both sides when you open it up it should
look<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.210> starting<00:01:15.539> to<00:01:15.630> take

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
look like this so it's starting to take

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.630 
look like this so it's starting to take
shape<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.619> want<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> flip<00:01:17.190> it<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
shape now you want to flip it so that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.370 
shape now you want to flip it so that
the<00:01:17.729> ugly<00:01:18.090> side<00:01:18.300> or<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> wrong<00:01:18.840> side<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.289> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the ugly side or the wrong side of the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.770 
the ugly side or the wrong side of the
fabric<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.890> facing<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.729> fleece<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.540> going

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
fabric is facing up and fleece is going

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.510 
fabric is facing up and fleece is going
to<00:01:21.900> curl<00:01:22.200> towards<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> wrong<00:01:22.950> side<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
to curl towards the wrong side so you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.130 
to curl towards the wrong side so you
can<00:01:23.700> always<00:01:23.850> test<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.330> by<00:01:24.479> doing<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
can always test it by doing that and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
can always test it by doing that and
you're<00:01:25.619> gonna<00:01:25.770> fold<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> outer<00:01:26.520> edges

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you're gonna fold in the outer edges

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
you're gonna fold in the outer edges
about<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> quarter<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.900> an<00:01:28.020> inch<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.710> stitch

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
about a quarter of an inch in and stitch

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.590 
about a quarter of an inch in and stitch
them<00:01:29.159> down<00:01:29.580> with<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> straight<00:01:30.119> stitch<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
them down with a straight stitch all the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.289 
them down with a straight stitch all the
way<00:01:30.810> around

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.139 

once<00:01:35.289> you're<00:01:35.469> done<00:01:35.710> with<00:01:35.890> one<00:01:36.100> side<00:01:36.159> just<00:01:36.850> flip

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
once you're done with one side just flip

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.060 
once you're done with one side just flip
it<00:01:37.179> over<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.750> repeat<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.289> same<00:01:38.469> thing<00:01:38.710> on<00:01:38.829> the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
it over and repeat the same thing on the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.810 
it over and repeat the same thing on the
other<00:01:39.250> edge

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.370 

then<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.940> need<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.120> stitch<00:01:44.480> under<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.170> raw

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
then you need to stitch under the raw

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.470 
then you need to stitch under the raw
short<00:01:45.830> edges<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.460> just<00:01:46.730> turn<00:01:46.940> it<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.180> about<00:01:47.450> a

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
short edges and just turn it in about a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.940 
short edges and just turn it in about a
quarter<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:47.960> an<00:01:48.020> inch<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.410> stitch<00:01:48.680> that<00:01:48.890> down

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
quarter of an inch and stitch that down

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.400 
quarter of an inch and stitch that down
as<00:01:49.370> well<00:01:49.400> on<00:01:49.760> both<00:01:50.090> ends<00:01:50.480> so<00:01:50.660> here<00:01:51.140> are<00:01:51.230> all<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
as well on both ends so here are all the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.200 
as well on both ends so here are all the
edges<00:01:51.740> stitched<00:01:51.980> up<00:01:52.190> flip<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.700> over<00:01:52.880> this<00:01:53.150> is

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
edges stitched up flip it over this is

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.090 
edges stitched up flip it over this is
what<00:01:53.480> it<00:01:53.570> looks<00:01:53.750> like<00:01:53.930> plain<00:01:54.230> you<00:01:54.740> can<00:01:54.770> leave

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
what it looks like plain you can leave

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.830 
what it looks like plain you can leave
it<00:01:55.220> like<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:55.370> or<00:01:55.730> embellish<00:01:56.120> it<00:01:56.300> with<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.570> bow

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
it like this or embellish it with a bow

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.540 
it like this or embellish it with a bow
and<00:01:57.020> we'll<00:01:57.170> get<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.470> that<00:01:57.620> in<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:57.800> bit<00:01:57.980> but<00:01:58.370> let's

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
and we'll get to that in a bit but let's

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.740 
and we'll get to that in a bit but let's
do<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.820> closure<00:01:59.090> first

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
do the closure first

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.930 
do the closure first
so<00:02:00.170> obviously<00:02:00.560> one<00:02:00.800> end<00:02:01.010> is<00:02:01.190> going<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.550> overlap

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
so obviously one end is going to overlap

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.700 
so obviously one end is going to overlap
the<00:02:02.210> other<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:02.660> we<00:02:02.750> need<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:02.960> figure<00:02:03.140> out<00:02:03.260> where

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
the other so we need to figure out where

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.500 
the other so we need to figure out where
the<00:02:04.280> button<00:02:04.610> hole<00:02:04.760> needs<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.030> be<00:02:05.120> and<00:02:05.360> where

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
the button hole needs to be and where

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.540 
the button hole needs to be and where
the<00:02:05.600> button<00:02:05.900> goes<00:02:06.050> grab<00:02:06.350> a<00:02:06.380> button<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.980> hand

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
the button goes grab a button a hand

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.160 
the button goes grab a button a hand
sewing<00:02:07.790> needle<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:08.240> some<00:02:08.450> thread<00:02:08.510> I'm<00:02:08.930> using

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
sewing needle and some thread I'm using

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.570 
sewing needle and some thread I'm using
embroidery<00:02:09.710> floss<00:02:09.860> because<00:02:10.130> it's<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.430> little

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
embroidery floss because it's a little

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.850 
embroidery floss because it's a little
bit<00:02:10.729> thicker<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.240> so<00:02:11.960> for<00:02:12.260> taking<00:02:12.530> on<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.770> off

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
bit thicker and so for taking on and off

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.500 
bit thicker and so for taking on and off
a<00:02:12.890> button<00:02:13.250> like<00:02:13.460> this<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.880> just<00:02:14.120> want<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.390> be

mark a little bit smaller than my button
and<00:02:45.950> we're<00:02:46.310> gonna<00:02:46.400> go<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.790> sewing<00:02:47.000> machine

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
and we're gonna go to the sewing machine

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.330 
and we're gonna go to the sewing machine
and<00:02:47.330> zig-zag<00:02:47.960> stitch<00:02:47.990> all<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.470> way<00:02:48.710> around<00:02:49.130> it

and zig-zag stitch all the way around it

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.680 
and zig-zag stitch all the way around it
you<00:02:49.550> want<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.910> little<00:02:50.030> smaller<00:02:50.450> because

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
you want it a little smaller because

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.750 
you want it a little smaller because
it's<00:02:50.990> going<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.350> stretch<00:02:51.680> once<00:02:52.310> we<00:02:52.460> put<00:02:52.670> the

it's going to stretch once we put the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.120 
it's going to stretch once we put the
button<00:02:53.030> into<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.050> zig-zag<00:02:54.530> stitch<00:02:54.560> choose

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
around the mark that you made and then

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.690 
around the mark that you made and then
carefully<00:03:00.350> take<00:03:00.530> your<00:03:00.680> scissors<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.070> cut<00:03:01.310> a

carefully take your scissors and cut a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.610 
carefully take your scissors and cut a
little<00:03:01.940> incision<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.750> middle<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.440> like

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
little incision in the middle and I like

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.560 
little incision in the middle and I like
to<00:03:03.740> go<00:03:03.830> back<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.460> bend<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.090> fold<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.480> up
