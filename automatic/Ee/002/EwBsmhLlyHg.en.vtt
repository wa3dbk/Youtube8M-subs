see<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.020> left<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.590> bit<00:00:16.650> there<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.699> floor

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
see on the left a bit there on the floor

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.810 
see on the left a bit there on the floor
the<00:00:18.690> old<00:00:18.840> generation<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:19.949> which<00:00:20.189> i<00:00:20.369> will<00:00:20.580> use

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
the old generation one which i will use

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.320 
the old generation one which i will use
to<00:00:20.850> prepare<00:00:21.769> especially<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.580> size<00:00:23.880> reduction

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
to prepare especially the size reduction

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.070 
to prepare especially the size reduction
so<00:00:24.750> let's<00:00:25.260> first<00:00:26.099> get<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> luck<00:00:26.939> edit<00:00:27.359> site<00:00:27.689> it

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
so let's first get a luck edit site it

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.749 
so let's first get a luck edit site it
looks<00:00:28.380> amazingly<00:00:29.369> thin<00:00:30.650> sometimes<00:00:31.650> almost<00:00:32.279> as

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
looks amazingly thin sometimes almost as

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.990 
looks amazingly thin sometimes almost as
thin<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.020> macbook<00:00:34.530> air<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.250> I'm<00:00:35.460> gonna<00:00:35.730> get

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
thin as I macbook air so I'm gonna get

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
thin as I macbook air so I'm gonna get
the<00:00:36.300> old<00:00:36.450> generation<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.260> put<00:00:37.410> her<00:00:37.500> over<00:00:37.710> here

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the old generation and put her over here

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.299 
the old generation and put her over here
on<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.399> side<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:40.170> how<00:00:40.739> thin

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
on the side so that you can see how thin

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.000 
on the side so that you can see how thin
it<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.610> compared<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.540> old<00:00:42.660> generation<00:00:43.110> so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it is compared to the old generation so

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.459 
it is compared to the old generation so
you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.820> see<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:46.050> really

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
you can see that it is really really

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.940 
you can see that it is really really
thin<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.039> almost<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:48.260> it<00:00:49.260> had<00:00:49.590> not

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
thin it is almost that as if it had not

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.880 
thin it is almost that as if it had not
one<00:00:50.370> screen<00:00:51.180> less<00:00:51.480> because<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.680> see<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
one screen less because you can see that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920 
one screen less because you can see that
the<00:00:53.100> whole<00:00:53.430> screen<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> old<00:00:54.449> generation

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the whole screen of the old generation

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:03.950 
the whole screen of the old generation
is<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.920> like<00:00:58.920> bigger<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:03.329> ports<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
is the like bigger so the ports on the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960 
is the like bigger so the ports on the
side<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.409> get<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> color<00:01:05.100> difference<00:01:05.790> right

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
side to get a color difference right

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.539 
side to get a color difference right
here<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.659> about<00:01:06.960> five<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.189> them<00:01:08.369> are

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
here we have about five of them are

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.910 
here we have about five of them are
really<00:01:08.939> done<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.390> well<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.439> lost<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
really done out well we have lost the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.950 
really done out well we have lost the
Ethernet<00:01:11.369> port<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.970> new<00:01:12.180> generation<00:01:12.630> has<00:01:12.750> no

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
Ethernet port the new generation has no

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.780 
Ethernet port the new generation has no
ethernet<00:01:13.470> port<00:01:13.710> also<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> optical

on top of the other one so let's get

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.380 
on top of the other one so let's get
look<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.560> size<00:02:11.060> from

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
look as the size from

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.880 
look as the size from
the<00:02:12.540> top<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.319> see<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.860> is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the top of you you can see that it is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.930 
the top of you you can see that it is
not<00:02:14.160> only<00:02:14.430> thinner<00:02:14.940> but<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.950> actually<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
not only thinner but it is actually the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.460 
not only thinner but it is actually the
