00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the cycle joker figure so i'm gonna try

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.679 
the cycle joker figure so i'm gonna try
to<00:01:05.400> push<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.700> back<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.060> bring<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> bike<00:01:06.510> in

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to push this back and bring the bike in

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.969 
to push this back and bring the bike in
so<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.860> two

get<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> hard-boiled<00:01:13.979> ur<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.430> machine

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
get the hard-boiled ur a machine

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.010 
get the hard-boiled ur a machine
hard-boiled<00:01:15.420> there<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.659> then<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.930> this

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
hard-boiled there and then you get this

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.560 
hard-boiled there and then you get this
little<00:01:16.170> standing<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> stand<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:18.000> this

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
little standing it to stand up so this

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.120 
little standing it to stand up so this
is<00:01:18.689> gonna<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:19.020> relatively<00:01:19.409> short<00:01:19.770> review

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
is gonna be relatively short review
