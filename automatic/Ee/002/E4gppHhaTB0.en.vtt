00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.880 
building it's one of those with the
separate<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:57.899> doors<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.560> each<00:01:58.680> other

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.109 
separate you know doors to each other
each<00:01:59.310> hotel<00:01:59.790> room<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.890> think<00:02:02.430> that's<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.969> good

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
each hotel room so I think that's a good

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.850 
each hotel room so I think that's a good
idea<00:02:03.299> cuz<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.869> all<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> cars<00:02:04.350> are<00:02:04.560> spread

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
idea cuz that all the cars are spread

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.889 
idea cuz that all the cars are spread
out<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.670> sneak<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.509> everyone

out you can just sneak in and everyone

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.430 
out you can just sneak in and everyone

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
it was very quiet no one bothered me and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.990 
it was very quiet no one bothered me and
I<00:02:10.830> had<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> good<00:02:11.220> night's<00:02:11.459> sleep

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
I had a good night's sleep

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.930 
I had a good night's sleep
and<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.810> also<00:02:12.959> noticed

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
and I also noticed

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.880 
and I also noticed
-<00:02:14.120> -<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.420> had<00:02:14.600> some<00:02:14.780> woods<00:02:15.020> around<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:15.830> I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
- - it had some woods around it so I

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.260 
- - it had some woods around it so I
knew<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.190> would<00:02:16.340> be<00:02:16.490> quiet<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.970> knew<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.180> would

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
knew it would be quiet I knew it would

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.540 
knew it would be quiet I knew it would
be<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> little<00:02:17.540> bit<00:02:17.750> secluded<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.220> think<00:02:19.310> that

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
be a little bit secluded so I think that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.000 
be a little bit secluded so I think that
picked<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.850> good<00:02:20.000> place<00:02:20.060> I'm<00:02:21.050> sure<00:02:21.410> I'll<00:02:21.560> try<00:02:21.860> it
