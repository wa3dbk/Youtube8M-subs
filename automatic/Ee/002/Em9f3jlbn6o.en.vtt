00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.359
 hello hello friends has closed no video 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.129
 and that's because he had only the 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:10.000
 webcam and now that I have a camera because 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:12.760
 look look like lamar can make videos 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.970
 but I do not have the last one to put what 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.089
 let's make is a tripod or a piece 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.310
 of these to take them and here I have 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.679
 all things for doing it actually 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.189
 I have nothing to do only trash and 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.460
 these clubs that I think I'm going to use a 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.460
 ax 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.870
 good and now I'm going to show you what 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.000
 it occurred to me to do would come to be something 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.500
 as a stabilizer for the camera and 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.379
 that it did not occur to me that it is the next one 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.379
 of 2001 so this is 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.290
 when they would come to be two short sticks 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.010
 and a longer stick 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.820
 a tripod of these unarmed children 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.820
 just hug this table 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.210
 which indestructibles have to be 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.480
 indestructible because it came out as two 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.810
 Lucas of the pack of two looks like 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.180
 and already in the pieces of alumina 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.800
 that it was just a strip and I was 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.020
 cutting up 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.760
 the idea I do not know where I 'm coming from again 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.370
 all those things I only have them 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.620
 voted here and the idea is to demonstrate 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.660
 that you can do something with any 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.720
 thing so let's follow the idea first with 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.520
 these long positions here and one in 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.720
 angle so that we have resistance 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.130
 same if they have better things in the if 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 I like it because it was not clear what 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.540
 long enough to traverse the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 stick but anyway I think it was 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.720
 plus 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.270
 and now that we have it ready 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.270
 we can go see how it works 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.850
 to 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.850
 ah 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.160
 to 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.709
 worse thinking that is made of three 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:56.420
 sticks and a few nails and elastic 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.420
 the same day convincing the security 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.459
 I would have preferred to use this anyway 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.870
 instead of a few sticks and this is a 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.870
 development bank that sell in the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.870
 fair as 500 pesos so more expensive 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.140
 so this would be good and what 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.700
 I learned that the most important thing is that 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.019
 can not miss in your reason there are guys 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.019
 that if he does not have a hammer
