defensively as concepts and you know

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.850 
defensively as concepts and you know
it's<00:02:08.970> been<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> few<00:02:09.450> years<00:02:09.509> since<00:02:09.989> Madden's<00:02:10.709> had

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
it's been a few years since Madden's had

it's been a few years since Madden's had
some<00:02:11.129> real<00:02:11.340> good<00:02:11.520> defense<00:02:12.060> where<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.270> could

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
some real good defense where you could

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.730 
some real good defense where you could
actually<00:02:12.420> lock<00:02:12.930> people<00:02:13.230> up

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
actually lock people up

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.160 
actually lock people up
I<00:02:14.220> would<00:02:14.490> probably<00:02:14.670> say<00:02:14.880> since<00:02:15.240> man<00:02:15.420> 10<00:02:15.870> would

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
I would probably say since man 10 would

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.380 
I would probably say since man 10 would
be<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.410> last<00:02:16.620> time<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.340> remember<00:02:17.610> where

be the last time I can remember where

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.510 
be the last time I can remember where
you<00:02:18.480> really<00:02:18.750> shut<00:02:18.960> someone<00:02:19.230> down<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.040> that's

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520

first<00:02:57.450> game<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.870> year<00:02:58.020> has<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.410> be<00:02:58.530> with

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
first game of the year has to be with

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.700 
first game of the year has to be with
the<00:02:58.770> raiders<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.370> i<00:03:00.210> start<00:03:00.570> David<00:03:00.870> Carr<00:03:01.050> he's

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
the raiders and i start David Carr he's

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.010 
the raiders and i start David Carr he's
got<00:03:01.890> 80<00:03:02.040> speed<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.760> that's<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> real

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
got 80 speed so that's the real

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.420 
got 80 speed so that's the real
difference<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.650> then<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.040> second

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
difference and then the second

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.210 
difference and then the second
difference<00:03:05.760> between<00:03:06.590> him<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.740> shop<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
difference between him and shop is the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.150 
difference between him and shop is the
throw<00:03:08.940> power<00:03:09.210> and<00:03:09.540> right<00:03:10.410> there<00:03:10.650> that's<00:03:10.920> one

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
throw power and right there that's one

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.890 
throw power and right there that's one
of<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.310> issues<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:12.060> with<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.570> game<00:03:12.690> right

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
of the issues I have with the game right

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.180 
of the issues I have with the game right
now<00:03:12.960> is<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.890> tackling<00:03:14.540> with<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:16.190> heatseeker

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
now is the tackling with that heatseeker

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.480 
now is the tackling with that heatseeker
art<00:03:17.580> or<00:03:17.790> whatever<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.390> like<00:03:18.630> gravitational

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
art or whatever is like gravitational

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.340 
art or whatever is like gravitational
now<00:03:20.490> when<00:03:20.730> i<00:03:20.760> was<00:03:21.390> playing<00:03:21.600> without<00:03:22.050> heat

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
now when i was playing without heat

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.950 
now when i was playing without heat
seeker<00:03:22.770> on<00:03:22.800> there's<00:03:23.730> no<00:03:24.090> way<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.510> tackles

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
seeker on there's no way that tackles

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.960 
seeker on there's no way that tackles
being<00:03:25.140> made<00:03:25.350> like<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.890> where<00:03:26.130> it's<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.850> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
being made like that where it's to the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.480 
being made like that where it's to the
point<00:03:27.150> where<00:03:27.390> my<00:03:27.630> dude<00:03:27.870> slows<00:03:28.320> down<00:03:28.650> for<00:03:29.070> him

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
point where my dude slows down for him

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.860 
point where my dude slows down for him
to<00:03:29.610> make<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.910> tackle<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.540> seems<00:03:30.750> like

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
to make the tackle but it seems like

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.250 
to make the tackle but it seems like
with<00:03:31.140> heat<00:03:31.320> seeker<00:03:31.710> on<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:33.720> kind<00:03:34.050> of<00:03:34.140> get

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
with heat seeker on you kind of get

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.000 
with heat seeker on you kind of get
pulled<00:03:34.680> back<00:03:34.950> into<00:03:35.430> some<00:03:36.150> sort<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.510> tackle

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
pulled back into some sort of tackle

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.560 
pulled back into some sort of tackle
animation<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.460> i'm<00:03:38.640> definitely<00:03:39.060> not<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.270> fan

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
animation and i'm definitely not a fan

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.360 
animation and i'm definitely not a fan
of<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.900> feel<00:03:40.140> like<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.410> there's<00:03:41.040> times

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
of that I feel like I there's times

running drags and it's definitely
something<00:04:08.220> that's<00:04:08.430> effective<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.270> something

i'm using another concept i'm using as a

i'm using another concept i'm using as a
drag<00:04:13.140> flat<00:04:13.500> concept<00:04:14.070> where<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.280> put<00:04:14.459> the

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
drag flat concept where you put the

either<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.370> tight<00:04:17.670> end<00:04:17.820> or<00:04:17.970> wide<00:04:18.120> receiver

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
either a tight end or wide receiver

either a tight end or wide receiver
somebody<00:04:18.930> because<00:04:19.350> it<00:04:19.620> creates<00:04:19.920> nice<00:04:20.190> little

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
somebody because it creates nice little

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.570 
somebody because it creates nice little
pic<00:04:21.480> or<00:04:21.780> bump<00:04:22.109> animation<00:04:22.770> for<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.100> defenders

and<00:04:23.700> they<00:04:23.790> both<00:04:23.940> take<00:04:24.540> each<00:04:24.690> other<00:04:24.930> out<00:04:25.020> and

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
and they both take each other out and

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.440 
and they both take each other out and
that<00:04:26.190> leaves<00:04:26.370> your<00:04:26.550> drag<00:04:26.850> wide

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
that leaves your drag wide

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.910 
that leaves your drag wide
right<00:04:27.960> here<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:28.170> don't<00:04:28.350> know<00:04:28.410> what<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.770> heck

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
can we get to stop no he holds on to

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.600 
can we get to stop no he holds on to
that<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.650> last<00:04:49.860> year<00:04:50.070> he<00:04:50.160> probably<00:04:50.400> would

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
that the last year he probably would

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.550 
that the last year he probably would
have<00:04:50.670> dropped<00:04:50.850> that<00:04:51.030> this<00:04:51.780> year<00:04:52.080> he<00:04:52.140> holds<00:04:52.470> on

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
have dropped that this year he holds on

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.650 
have dropped that this year he holds on
to<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:52.890> that's<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.250> big<00:04:53.430> difference<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:54.060> again

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
to that that's a big difference so again

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.560 
to that that's a big difference so again
I'm<00:04:54.750> still<00:04:54.990> getting<00:04:55.140> used<00:04:55.290> to<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.800> game

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
I'm still getting used to the game

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.390 
I'm still getting used to the game
building<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.660> core<00:04:58.100> foundation<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.250> knowledge

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
building a core foundation of knowledge

building a core foundation of knowledge
of<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.850> game<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.450> that<00:05:01.140> will<00:05:01.320> hopefully<00:05:01.620> help

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
of the game and that will hopefully help

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.040 
of the game and that will hopefully help
