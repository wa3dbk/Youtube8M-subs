 if you ask them this simply write in 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.050
 this is here yesterday that is here and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.590
 they have authorized it and they leave for 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.590
 to download 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.790
 since I'm unloaded in the room 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.910
 you got to download the runt this is what 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.750
 that will come out and download 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:11.440
 all this this is going to be the emulator and 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.410
 this here are the rooms are already 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.860
 downloaded so let's open the 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.800
 capcom folder we are going to put you 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.020
 extract here only that folder at 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.560
 already afterwards this can be 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.550
 delete since they have this folder as 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.040
 come you have a folder that says rooms that 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:38.099
 clear is empty 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.099
 this let's take the 3 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.980
 and let's get inside the folder 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:51.860
 of capcom inside the rooms folder 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.860
 let's deposit the 3 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.100
 the three rar files and we're going to give it 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.100
 extract here 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.709
 we wait for this to be over 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.200
 well then, since the 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.800
 three folders we are going to give you 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.430
 eliminate these we do not take care of 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.400
 let's go to part 1 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.740
 we cut them 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:30.000
 and we paste them part 2 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.520
 we select everything we cut off we take off 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.570
 outside 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.570
 part 3 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.320
 we cut everything 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.750
 we paste it after 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.819
 well then in total 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:53.909
 let's eliminate these 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:56.609
 there must be 59 irons this since 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:04:00.030
 we have all this prepared we are 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:03.180
 ready to run from here this is going to 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.639
 be the one that goes to you are going to copy and 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.579
 they're going to paste it on their desk they're going to 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:11.040
 paste on your in your taskbar where 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.120
 you want that you are going to give them 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.409
 double click 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.409
 is going to open this 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.260
 and good 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.910
 Well, let's first, nothing here 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.080
 is the control that I'm going to use those 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.760
 the controls are more or less there 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.600
 you can imagine how it 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.750
 agrees this this logically is the 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.380
 another control of another tutorial that I 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:49.430
 I did this let's get into here in the 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.430
 disc we are going to give risk and games 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.310
 and as you see here we do not have any 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.800
 this 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.879
 let's give what 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.879
 let's give it 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.290
 with directors we are going to give him the first 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.480
 and where you have your rooms 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.850
 that's where you are going to go to 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.480
 select what they are but I have inside 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.480
 from this folder 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.830
 so close 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.330
 As you can see , all the 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.000
 rooms 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.000
 this and I can start playing 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.650
 it is terrain 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.699
 that is the common control 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.500
 and I can play freely 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.919
 to 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.750
