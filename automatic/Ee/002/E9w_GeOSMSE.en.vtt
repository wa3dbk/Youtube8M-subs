mop<00:01:32.250> talent<00:01:32.790> macros<00:01:33.860> it's<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.369> little<00:01:35.549> bit

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
mop talent macros it's just a little bit

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.100 
mop talent macros it's just a little bit
tricky<00:01:36.119> because<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.990> make<00:01:37.520> six

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
tricky because you have to make six

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.200 
tricky because you have to make six
blank<00:01:40.110> macros<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.310> your<00:01:41.460> general<00:01:41.790> macros

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
blank macros in your general macros

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.850 
blank macros in your general macros
that's<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> only<00:01:43.049> caveat<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.710> all

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
that's really the only caveat with all

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.789 
that's really the only caveat with all
this<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:45.180> takes<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.570> six<00:01:45.810> macro<00:01:46.229> slots<00:01:46.560> but

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
this is it takes up six macro slots but

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.420 
this is it takes up six macro slots but
it<00:01:46.979> more<00:01:47.130> than<00:01:47.189> makes<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:47.729> convenience

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
it more than makes up for convenience

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.780 
it more than makes up for convenience
the<00:01:51.049> macros<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.259> named<00:01:52.470> tier<00:01:52.920> underscore<00:01:53.520> one

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the macros are named tier underscore one

tier underscore two etc to six and the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.910 
tier underscore two etc to six and the
add-on<00:01:58.740> will<00:01:59.040> automatically<00:01:59.939> populate<00:02:00.930> those

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
add-on will automatically populate those
