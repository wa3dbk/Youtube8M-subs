now<00:03:06.650> I'm<00:03:06.830> ready<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.220> start<00:03:07.490> debugging<00:03:07.930> I've

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
now I'm ready to start debugging I've

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.750 
now I'm ready to start debugging I've
added<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.320> bit<00:03:09.410> of<00:03:09.470> program<00:03:10.040> code<00:03:10.280> in<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.550> click

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
added a bit of program code in the click

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.460 
added a bit of program code in the click
event<00:03:10.940> handler<00:03:11.270> for<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.810> button<00:03:12.080> on<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.320> home

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.820 
event handler for the button on the home
page<00:03:12.850> so<00:03:13.850> let's<00:03:14.300> add<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.510> breakpoint<00:03:14.840> in<00:03:15.380> the

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
page so let's add a breakpoint in the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.130 
page so let's add a breakpoint in the
ActionScript<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.610> I'll<00:03:17.600> also<00:03:17.750> add<00:03:18.110> a

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
ActionScript and I'll also add a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.650 
ActionScript and I'll also add a

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
breakpoint in the mxml of the view

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.570 
breakpoint in the mxml of the view
design<00:03:22.180> now<00:03:23.180> after<00:03:24.080> a<00:03:24.140> while<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:25.040> emulator

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
design now after a while the emulator

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.950 
design now after a while the emulator
pops<00:03:26.570> up<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.460> it<00:03:28.460> will<00:03:28.610> display<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.300> home

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.420 
pops up and it will display the home
view<00:03:30.640> so<00:03:31.640> now<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:31.850> can<00:03:32.180> click<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.510> button<00:03:32.690> and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
view so now I can click the button and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.660
