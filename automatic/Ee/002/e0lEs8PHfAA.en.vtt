guess before this is my 11th season
coaching<00:00:33.360> here<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.870> before<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.350> came<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.920> think

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
coaching here and before I came I think

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.200 
coaching here and before I came I think
they<00:00:35.430> had<00:00:35.579> three<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:35.880> four<00:00:36.030> state

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
they had three or four state

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.869 
they had three or four state
championships<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.680> came<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.579> were<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
championships I came we were in the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.030 
championships I came we were in the
state<00:00:39.059> finals<00:00:39.210> my<00:00:39.750> fret<00:00:40.200> my<00:00:40.469> first<00:00:40.800> year<00:00:40.980> here

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
state finals my fret my first year here

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.299 
state finals my fret my first year here
and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.000> had<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> lull<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> few<00:00:43.110> years

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
and then we had a lull for a few years

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.470 
and then we had a lull for a few years
but<00:00:44.309> then<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.730> done<00:00:44.879> very<00:00:45.030> well<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.360> last

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
but then we have done very well the last

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.410 
but then we have done very well the last
six<00:00:46.260> years<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.789> think<00:00:47.850> consisted

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
six years it's just I think consisted

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.090 
six years it's just I think consisted
consistency<00:00:49.289> within<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> program<00:00:49.800> i<00:00:50.070> think

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
consistency within the program i think

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.189 
consistency within the program i think
is<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> big<00:00:50.670> thing<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.719> attribute<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
is a big thing we can attribute it to

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.470 
is a big thing we can attribute it to
the<00:00:52.920> fact<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.309> their<00:00:53.520> teammates<00:00:54.030> may<00:00:54.270> not

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the fact that their teammates may not

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.360 
the fact that their teammates may not

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
east coast sport so I think having a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it and then it's going to give kids a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.910 
it and then it's going to give kids a
higher<00:01:51.479> goal<00:01:51.750> team<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.229> because<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.560> before<00:01:52.890> we
