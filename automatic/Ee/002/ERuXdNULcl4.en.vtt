raised the water level water level
raised<00:01:51.220> all<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.640> way<00:01:51.759> up<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.030> top<00:01:52.149> almost

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
raised all the way up to the top almost

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.350 
raised all the way up to the top almost
spilled<00:01:53.229> over<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.940> that<00:01:54.940> brought<00:01:55.149> my

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
spilled over and that brought my

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.039 
spilled over and that brought my
salinity<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.460> 1.0<00:01:57.460> 23<00:01:58.380> which<00:01:59.380> sucks<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.479> I

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
salinity to 1.0 23 which sucks so I

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.469 
salinity to 1.0 23 which sucks so I
emailed<00:02:02.710> digital<00:02:03.430> aquatics<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:04.149> they<00:02:04.270> told

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
emailed digital aquatics and they told

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.559 
emailed digital aquatics and they told
me<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:06.009> should<00:02:06.460> have<00:02:06.490> my<00:02:09.000> pump<00:02:10.000> plugged

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
me that I should have my pump plugged

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.199 
me that I should have my pump plugged
into<00:02:10.780> channel<00:02:11.769> one<00:02:12.010> instead<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.790> channel

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
into channel one instead of channel

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.370 
into channel one instead of channel
three<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:14.440> hopefully<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.920> fixes<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:16.380> and
