00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 Hello, today we are doing 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.190
 energy bars which 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.140
 perfect for snacking and not 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.090
 harm your figure but there are them however 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.460
 should be in the morning but by 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.440
 least not before bedtime exactly 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.710
 as a sweetener we will have a wall 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.080
 and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.570
 and vegetable glycerin as you know 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.100
 steven has calories and glycerin which 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 until recently there was only 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.779
 byproduct soap making now 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.900
 actively used by manufacturers 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.939
 sports nutrition and also in different 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.420
 just such bar type by kenzo 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.910
 the fact is that in small quantities 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.790
 according to different sources from 60 to 75 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.350
 milligram 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.040
 glycerin does not affect the sugar level in 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.620
 blood that allows it to be consumed 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.840
 who follow carbohydrates also glycerin 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.600
 good stick together 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.449
 ingredients and so it is him that I will 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.460
 use instead of taking honey 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.399
 or agave nectar which is very rich 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.730
 sugars and certainly negatively affect 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.000
 blood sugar and in addition 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.350
 glycerin have a very sweet taste 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.390
 also for bonding bars we 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.549
 take coconut oil that hardens 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.380
 at low temperature and so that the bar 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.600
 answered all the rules of the right 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.080
 nutrition we add whey to it 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.119
 protein 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.340
 so our bar will 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.650
 contain complex carbohydrates healthy fats 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.610
 and some protein 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.590
 protein we breed small 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.750
 the amount of water that he was so 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.939
 thick enough then mix 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.350
 well two masses of oil 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.259
 glycerol 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.799
 and protein can even make a mixer 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.360
 all this so that the process goes faster but 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.200
 if you have patience and desire you can 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.780
 beat with a fork 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.940
 then we combine it all with cereal y 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.500
 me oatmeal you can marry and 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.850
 sorts the main thing that they were 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.869
 whole and fillers and some different 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.420
 flavoring 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.850
 according to your preference supplements it can 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.850
 be and dried fruits flax seeds 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.789
 nuts and dried berries and so on I'm 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.590
 add a little chocolate my favorite 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:13.230
 droplets with stevia 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:15.480
 and also a little flax seed 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.819
 I spread the bars in this form 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.370
 for baking but you do as you 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.010
 convenient though cubes in a box all that 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.290
 please and at 1 o'clock we fix it all in 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.060
 freezer I will immediately say that such 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.040
 candy bars are not very convenient to take with you 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.170
 because they hide at room 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.319
 temperature but here is the seal at home with 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.390
 such a bar is a pleasure 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.220
 I hope you like it in 3 c if 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.630
 yes don't forget to tell me about it 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.630
 that 's all bye for now
