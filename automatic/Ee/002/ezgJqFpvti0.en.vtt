using a scroll saw to cut them apart
after<00:02:59.440> fish<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:00.040> blade<00:03:00.370> through<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.269> slot

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
after fish this blade through the slot

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.059 
after fish this blade through the slot
which<00:03:02.950> comes<00:03:03.250> down

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.390 

tightens<00:03:07.519> up<00:03:08.620> it's<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.739> little<00:03:09.829> too<00:03:10.129> hard<00:03:10.340> to

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
tightens up it's a little too hard to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.000 
tightens up it's a little too hard to
push<00:03:10.579> down<00:03:10.849> to<00:03:11.180> get<00:03:11.329> it

push down to get it

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:21.000 
push down to get it
that's<00:03:13.010> about<00:03:13.159> right<00:03:13.219> yeah

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.890 

I<00:03:22.060> came<00:03:23.060> out<00:03:25.180> that's<00:03:26.180> how<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.390> clean<00:03:26.660> them<00:03:26.780> up

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
I came out that's how to clean them up

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.390 
I came out that's how to clean them up
is<00:03:27.080> use<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.380> sander<00:03:27.800> to<00:03:27.890> clean<00:03:27.920> up<00:03:28.250> those

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
is use the sander to clean up those

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.550 
is use the sander to clean up those
edges<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:29.420> other<00:03:29.600> way<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.780> could<00:03:30.020> do<00:03:30.170> it<00:03:30.350> to

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
edges the other way you could do it to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.900 
edges the other way you could do it to
you<00:03:30.740> is<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:31.070> can<00:03:31.100> clean<00:03:31.430> them<00:03:31.520> up<00:03:31.670> with<00:03:31.820> the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
you is you can clean them up with the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.630 
you is you can clean them up with the
router<00:03:32.150> you<00:03:32.780> need<00:03:32.960> to<00:03:33.020> be<00:03:33.140> very<00:03:33.410> careful<00:03:33.980> first

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
router you need to be very careful first

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.150 
router you need to be very careful first
thing<00:03:34.910> you<00:03:35.180> got<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.420> drop<00:03:35.570> that<00:03:35.630> blade<00:03:36.080> down<00:03:36.320> do

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
thing you got to drop that blade down do

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.450 
thing you got to drop that blade down do
your<00:03:37.310> only<00:03:37.850> kicking<00:03:38.210> off<00:03:38.360> just<00:03:38.720> in<00:03:38.930> here<00:03:42.460> these

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
your only kicking off just in here these

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:52.200 
your only kicking off just in here these
two<00:03:44.030> push<00:03:44.420> sticks<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:44.900> this

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.920 

which<00:03:52.660> mole<00:03:53.910> after<00:03:54.910> I'm<00:03:55.210> done<00:03:55.330> routing<00:03:55.810> I

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
which mole after I'm done routing I

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.070 
which mole after I'm done routing I
stacked<00:03:56.290> them<00:03:56.610> but<00:03:57.610> a<00:03:57.850> little<00:03:58.450> too<00:03:58.750> top-heavy

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
stacked them but a little too top-heavy

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.010 
stacked them but a little too top-heavy
so<00:03:59.680> what<00:03:59.800> I'm<00:03:59.890> gonna<00:04:00.010> do<00:04:00.250> instead<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:01.150> actually

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
so what I'm gonna do instead is actually

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.070 
so what I'm gonna do instead is actually
