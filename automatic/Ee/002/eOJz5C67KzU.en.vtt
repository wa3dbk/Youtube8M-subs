00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 Welcome dear 1000 ps fans 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.020
 to the 125 test series this time with the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.020
 suzuki burgman 125 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.869
 I think I have been for six years 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.580
 no longer sat on this scooter 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.650
 and we saw him today , I have to 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.170
 saying he was easily shocked 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.330
 technically and visually revised 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.100
 a little bit more supple but a bit more modern 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.090
 the bench is monstrous that is 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.970
 inconceivably 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.590
 there will even fall right next to it and 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.840
 This will now also expire us 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.760
 a few technical data on this 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.680
 by the way, model give a little 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.649
 school center can not hold out 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.270
 pick him up 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.780
 12.4 at is not the full 15 so 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.950
 would be allowed to say I say it once 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.899
 ammann also joins him is yes to should yes 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.820
 not weak, but he is leaving now 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.550
 not like other scooters also weighs 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.619
 over 160 kilo that is quite a lot for 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.240
 such a luxury scooter that's why I think 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.550
 now not as bad as you, the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.590
 so expansive is that supposed to be so 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.850
 we will afterwards there's sure to 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.440
 come talk that the luggage compartment 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.110
 under yes is also huge on the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.760
 I have two clearly arranged fittings 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.500
 round instruments speed and 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.060
 speed at an automatic or 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.860
 maybe not necessary 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.409
 then in the middle I have one 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.200
 LCD display with the time with the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.450
 driven kilometers thanks to display and 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.330
 also the average consumption of here 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.310
 at 3 liters is but we must say 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.540
 were driven relatively fast so in the 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.619
 normal case, that is probably 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.630
 under three liters 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.920
 that is with an 11 liters then comes 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.509
 you are already quite far 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.330
 this advice stood 14 65 that some have 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.299
 but also by that long motorcycles 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.340
 in my opinion comes before extremely well 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.180
 So that the landing gear is top notch 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.299
 successful 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.820
 that is both comfortable and 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.180
 so tight that that's great 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.200
 middle way and I think that's it 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.209
 Absolutely I also find the drive 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.070
 a bit sluggish you can say maybe 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.560
 I can tell you before six 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.840
 I drove over 120 years with it 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.299
 it takes bitter but over 100 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.329
 once both are well over 100 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.239
 about 110 at this time the brakes completely 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.270
 a big plus now with abs very strong 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.610
 but that regulates it 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.770
 not too early we have great 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.380
 Delay and there comes before 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.330
 of course also relatively big because of me 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.100
 have this high windshield in series 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.780
 I 've got the wide seat too 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.670
 for the passenger who, however, believe 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.110
 is almost has as on a 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.720
 bullen but has the advantage that the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.580
 whole has an incredible load volume 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.010
 In addition, I have one more 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.790
 glove compartment and below also 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.370
 in my opinion, the sitting position 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.040
 So growing the legs a little too 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.920
 Strongly angled that almost to 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.110
 low you 27 135 mm 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.580
 well then you have the legs also 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.340
 a bit higher the knee rather to 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.460
 So could win in my opinion 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.010
 Ergonomically better, it shows 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.050
 but again, in my opinion, believe 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.420
 me that the scooter now outwardly though 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.670
 was aufgehÃ¼bscht but in total 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.030
 not brand new so right again 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.770
 say 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.030
 that was already six years ago 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.610
 and that has not happened now 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.230
 developed but smaller pilots 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.420
 have it better there again and have 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.190
 even a full windbreak a third 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.410
 plus I have forgotten the tight 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.870
 we noticed that today in the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.420
 compared to the Honda PCX 125 degrees 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.800
 have tested at the ground waves though 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.110
 we took a bit faster 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.510
 pcx partially so broken 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.760
 and we do not need that at all 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.760
 is certainly synonymous because it is just like that 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.030
 strong and loaded and that would be 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.380
 also just demonstrate what all 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.670
 bringing under the bench is a 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.510
 real workhorse i mean 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.270
 I would not stroll now 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.150
 I definitely want to go with it 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.020
 But they did not stop so check my 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.750
 in the opinion of something bigger 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.239
 if you are now scooter fine and office 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.020
 I would like to show it could also be a 400 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.030
 that could really be so 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.160
 characterized that 125 it is of course not 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.460
 But so is the own buyer layer 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.820
 once and for the price of it again 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.540
 some cheaper is this 407 or and 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.390
 is synonymous with 111 or two 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.050
 Shine that is on the 12th 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.729
 Let's say 2 something reminds me 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.860
 to the gsx-r range where you only 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.870
 by looking closely then recognizes 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.000
 this $ 600,750 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.780
 and there it is as well as that can be 400 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.210
 or maybe even 600 650 he and 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.040
 now they will show you why we have the 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.040
 appreciate citizens so much
