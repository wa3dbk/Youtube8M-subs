00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090 

I<00:00:00.089> don't<00:00:00.659> have<00:00:00.900> a<00:00:00.960> lot<00:00:01.140> of<00:00:01.170> time<00:00:01.469> today<00:00:01.620> like

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
I don't have a lot of time today like

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.130 
I don't have a lot of time today like
maybe<00:00:02.310> 10<00:00:02.820> minutes<00:00:03.060> so<00:00:05.509> we'll<00:00:06.509> see<00:00:06.720> if<00:00:06.810> we<00:00:06.960> can

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
maybe 10 minutes so we'll see if we can

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.940 
maybe 10 minutes so we'll see if we can
make<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.350> home<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:07.830> 10<00:00:08.010> minutes<00:00:09.110> I<00:00:10.110> seem<00:00:10.920> to

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
make it home in 10 minutes I seem to

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.450 
make it home in 10 minutes I seem to
keep<00:00:11.219> returning<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.240> spot<00:00:13.370> over<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
keep returning to this spot over and

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.750 
keep returning to this spot over and
over<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:15.120> discovered<00:00:15.690> something<00:00:16.760> pretty

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
over that discovered something pretty

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.689 
over that discovered something pretty
interesting<00:00:17.910> uh<00:00:18.770> not<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> poison<00:00:20.279> oak<00:00:20.400> that's

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
interesting uh not the poison oak that's

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.509 
interesting uh not the poison oak that's
not<00:00:20.939> interesting<00:00:22.010> right<00:00:23.010> alongside<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
not interesting right alongside the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.670 
not interesting right alongside the
trail<00:00:23.760> coming<00:00:24.029> down<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.630> river<00:00:24.869> creek

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
trail coming down to the river creek

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.810 
trail coming down to the river creek
here<00:00:26.029> for<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.119> spring<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.369> believe<00:00:29.670> it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
here for the spring and I believe it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.510 
here for the spring and I believe it
runs<00:00:30.000> mostly<00:00:30.449> year<00:00:30.720> oh<00:00:32.000> that<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.149> icy<00:00:33.420> cold<00:00:34.520> but

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
runs mostly year oh that is icy cold but

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.180 
runs mostly year oh that is icy cold but
I<00:00:35.850> thought<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.930> came<00:00:37.110> from<00:00:37.290> across<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.710> road

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
I thought it came from across the road

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
I thought it came from across the road
over<00:00:38.520> there<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:40.110> follow<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.590> back<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:42.410> up<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
over there if we follow it back up up a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.910 
over there if we follow it back up up a
little<00:00:43.770> ways<00:00:44.870> it's<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.989> spring<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.559> comes<00:00:46.770> out

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
little ways it's a spring that comes out

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.720 
little ways it's a spring that comes out
of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> ground<00:00:48.890> probably<00:00:49.890> started<00:00:50.340> under<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
of the ground probably started under the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.020 
of the ground probably started under the
road<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.180> they<00:00:51.559> put<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> culvert<00:00:53.039> under<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.520> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
road and they put a culvert under it to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:05.840 
road and they put a culvert under it to
keep<00:00:54.210> via<00:00:54.539> oh<00:00:55.579> there's<00:00:56.579> ants<00:00:56.730> all<00:00:56.969> over<00:00:57.000> oh<00:01:04.850> no

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
keep via oh there's ants all over oh no

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.250 
keep via oh there's ants all over oh no
we<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.180> run<00:01:06.600> over<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:07.700> anyways<00:01:08.990> we<00:01:09.990> just

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
we just run over there anyways we just

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.810 
we just run over there anyways we just
put<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> culvert<00:01:10.799> into<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> spring

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
put the culvert into so that the spring

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.410 
put the culvert into so that the spring
would<00:01:12.000> come<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:12.600> we'll<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> road

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
would come up and then we'll the road

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.039 
would come up and then we'll the road
just<00:01:15.420> coming<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:15.900> pretty<00:01:16.080> good<00:01:18.020> what<00:01:19.020> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
just coming out there pretty good what I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.330 
just coming out there pretty good what I
should<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.470> some<00:01:19.740> day<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:23.659> rock<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.869> in

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
should do some day is a rock it in

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.810 
should do some day is a rock it in
that'd<00:01:26.340> be<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.759> cool<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.220> problem<00:01:29.640> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
that'd be kind of cool the problem is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.819 
that'd be kind of cool the problem is
that<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.299> spring<00:01:30.810> does<00:01:31.110> originally<00:01:31.619> under

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that the spring does originally under

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.050 
that the spring does originally under
the<00:01:32.009> road<00:01:32.220> which<00:01:34.189> which<00:01:35.189> isn't<00:01:35.579> very<00:01:36.770> sanitary

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
the road which which isn't very sanitary

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060 
the road which which isn't very sanitary
yeah<00:01:39.060> there's<00:01:39.659> an<00:01:40.049> ant<00:01:40.380> crawling<00:01:40.650> across<00:01:40.860> my

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
yeah there's an ant crawling across my

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.569 
yeah there's an ant crawling across my
lens<00:01:44.570> yes<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.750> creature<00:01:46.079> let's<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.399> we

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
lens yes the creature let's see if we

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.399 
lens yes the creature let's see if we
can't<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.149> anything<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> other<00:01:48.960> side<00:01:49.380> of

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
can't see anything on the other side of

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.730 
can't see anything on the other side of
the<00:01:49.560> road<00:01:50.540> maybe<00:01:51.540> there<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> culvert<00:01:52.500> over

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the road maybe there is a culvert over

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.950 
the road maybe there is a culvert over
there<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.250> haven't<00:01:53.509> noticed<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.689> I've

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
there and I just haven't noticed it I've

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.130 
there and I just haven't noticed it I've
looked<00:01:55.290> ha

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.779 

so<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.259> spring<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.740> right<00:02:03.979> down<00:02:04.280> in<00:02:05.270> there<00:02:06.020> a

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
so the spring is right down in there a

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.600 
so the spring is right down in there a
little<00:02:07.789> look<00:02:08.560> across<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.890> road<00:02:10.129> and<00:02:10.369> see<00:02:10.550> if

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
little look across the road and see if

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.800 
little look across the road and see if
we<00:02:10.700> can<00:02:10.819> find<00:02:11.030> anything<00:02:16.599> there's<00:02:17.599> nothing

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
we can find anything there's nothing

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.240 
we can find anything there's nothing
directly<00:02:18.410> across<00:02:18.920> from<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:20.680> but<00:02:21.680> up<00:02:22.190> here

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
directly across from it but up here

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:32.559 
directly across from it but up here
little<00:02:22.790> ways<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:26.680> little<00:02:27.680> nutty<00:02:28.989> spot<00:02:31.569> it's

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
little ways is a little nutty spot it's

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.170 
little ways is a little nutty spot it's
coming<00:02:32.959> out<00:02:33.080> right<00:02:33.260> there<00:02:33.910> but<00:02:34.910> all<00:02:35.030> that's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
coming out right there but all that's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.680 
coming out right there but all that's
going<00:02:35.540> this<00:02:35.660> way<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:39.319> can<00:02:39.500> see<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.690> water

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
going this way you can see the water

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.600 
going this way you can see the water
flowing<00:02:42.319> this<00:02:42.470> direction<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.190> then<00:02:43.310> just

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
flowing this direction and then just

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.250 
flowing this direction and then just
sinking<00:02:44.209> into<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.420> ground<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.950> even<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.370> is

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
sinking into the ground but even that is

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.589 
sinking into the ground but even that is
it's<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:51.079> culvert<00:02:51.470> score<00:02:51.709> over<00:02:51.860> there<00:02:52.040> I

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
it's the culvert score over there I

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.789 
it's the culvert score over there I
don't<00:02:53.599> know<00:02:53.690> maybe<00:02:53.930> part<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.380> does<00:02:54.560> seep

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
don't know maybe part of it does seep

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.990 
don't know maybe part of it does seep
into<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.099> ground<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.690> make<00:02:56.690> its<00:02:56.840> way<00:02:56.959> across

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
into the ground and make its way across

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:37.490 
into the ground and make its way across
but<00:02:59.980> over

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.390 

why<00:03:38.500> do<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.650> do<00:03:38.739> that<00:03:38.859> oh<00:03:40.859> yeah<00:03:41.859> that's<00:03:42.250> the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
why do I do that oh yeah that's the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.190 
why do I do that oh yeah that's the
mystery<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:43.000> day
