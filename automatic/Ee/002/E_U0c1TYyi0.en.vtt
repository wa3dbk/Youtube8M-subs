00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
ever after high the unfair stove them

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.820

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.210 
all it's the second book to and
after<00:00:20.189> high<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.010> bit

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
after high as you can see and it's a bit

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.340 
after high as you can see and it's a bit
different<00:00:23.820> from<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> first<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:25.260> not

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
different from the first one it's not

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.920 
different from the first one it's not
really<00:00:25.590> its<00:00:25.740> exact<00:00:26.010> same<00:00:26.480> series<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.720> stuff

just<00:00:28.429> different<00:00:29.480> look<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.750> guess<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.230> could<00:00:31.320> say

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439

just different look I guess it could say
so<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.540> time<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> book<00:00:34.110> is
