00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.280
 Hello 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.670
 as announced you now meant Trillium 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.929
 with the active ones having an updo makes 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.269
 if you have not seen that to their faithfulness like I have never seen 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.230
 made then that passed away in any case in the infobox which is here 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.689
 Euro to boost the coupons I'm doing et ënner updo 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.939
 but not in the typical sense of 9 chic Ilic harvest Hochstätter 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.669
 but should be almost completely relaxed 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.070
 lead here 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.290
 a mistake 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.830
 if possible Nora hair color that is a bit help me now but I think 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.870
 that will work too 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.870
 brought down these Springsteen 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.130
 are the very small they are at the European Championships for Castle no to 90 or something 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.740
 I make the following move 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 he is that makes the old braid relative rehearsals at the back of the head 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.780
 a human 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.030
 700 people then she has to take off home 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.640
 dat 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.970
 the deadline would like to pull through just a bit the animals 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.550
 out 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.550
 you can do that on points 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.410
 and then the rich simply 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.410
 on 1 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.070
 then you take a strand 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.820
 they moved 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.670
 OK OK OK 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.350
 and many task forces clicks to 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.680
 si 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.760
 that does not have to be very neat, for the young people that is 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.960
 Schülers does not look so friendly because that all hair after DC 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:56.999
 so and actually there is already the whole secret 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.999
 around the Vmax 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.799
 I hope that you can see that they are just relaxed and let 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.799
 why do you have why and only a few highlights out 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:10.949
 but I want that too sweet 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.419
 and come from Fornezzi relatively simple you can now too 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.549
 I could even take it the hardest again 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.549
 make stronger 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:47.089
 often would have to 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.389
 Porth 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.129
 so al-rahman 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.929
 yes, as you can see, that's a very weird hairstyle. Super easy to do 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.209
 and around 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.879
 that's it 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.719
 I hope I failed 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.139
 Oh yes, what I wanted to say again but I'm free, by the way 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.579
 that does not cost you anything at all that just means you have it 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.299
 every time I do a new video to make sure that you do it directly 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.269
 showed but was probably end Zeitzer yes okay so that would me 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.669
 Of course, I would be very happy if I had kidneys 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.930
 but I also always ask myself totally about comments or news or 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.090
 just a paperback as well as little else on the next stop 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.049
 is thanks to IIS
