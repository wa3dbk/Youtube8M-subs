00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.380
 very good 23 years we are a new 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.620
 video and the promised video I promised you a 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.140
 gameplay with the ms 60 with one of the 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.170
 light machine guns here you have one 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.670
 it's a gameplay that really cost me 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.269
 get a few games but good 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.109
 it's a 43 to 3 it 's pretty pretty 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:26.300
 good with this weapon and it cost me a lot 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.980
 I had a hard time catching the third 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.689
 Advantage cost me enough to get used to 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.220
 to the weapon because as you know there was never 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.570
 used light machine guns in this 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.890
 I always play all the ones I had 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.890
 used by the had collected from the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.410
 I was on the ground and I was never playing with weapons 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.780
 of these so I started to approve it and 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.240
 see how I was going I started testing the 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.520
 shooter and at first it went well I did not see 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.080
 to facilitate but it was very slow moving 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.190
 is very slow with the weapon and you know that 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.620
 for me the most important thing is to be able 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.050
 move fast and if I move slow with 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.260
 a weapon and I see that they do not work for very 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.580
 good that it is a shooter since for me it is 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.740
 but the best one of the best 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.530
 advantages of the game because it does not help me 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.479
 nothing not everyone has to play like 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.880
 it will come to him better as he believes that 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.890
 plays better and I did not work 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.380
 shooter in this class so what does it say 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.290
 I caught I got hunter hunter for me 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.640
 is super state in this game is 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.350
 impressive not simply by the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.509
 fact that you can move faster 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.040
 while pointing or you can aim and 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.220
 do as you 're walking or 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.020
 simply without aiming with the weapon but 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.399
 now yes while you shoot you follow 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.830
 moving plane where if you put on 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.200
 shoot the gun carrying the hunter 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.490
 you catch you start shooting and while 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.710
 you are shooting you move towards the 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.630
 sides and you shoot the guy moving towards 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.630
 the sides and it is impossible to give payments 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.970
 I've played in games where I 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.250
 played against an uncle wearing hunter 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.810
 began to shoot the guy we squeeze 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.220
 the one from left to right pointing and I 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.840
 has killed two shovels has been 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.340
 awesome then when was when 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.190
 I said okay I'm going to put hunter 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.679
 because this freak and I was right and you have 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.659
 and I accepted it, I realized right away 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.300
 that with a light machine gun besides 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.670
 to be able to move fast with the hunter 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.380
 since pointing I think it's faster 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.780
 even running because the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.300
 hunter how it works then you can 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.440
 do what I said 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.380
 while you are shot and still having a 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.330
 submachine gun you can win then people who 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.020
 take your rifles so it's something that 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:26.390
 serves and that is very useful as uncle 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.310
 kill with 43.4 and it kills me it worked out 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.920
 but good still with the gameplay 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.900
 you see that I carry the predator and reaper and the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.670
 paintball was pretty much always that 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.440
 I usually carry these same gusts of 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.020
 low nothing is that I like quite 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.400
 I quite like how you can link the 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.500
 simple reaper or taking pulling the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.210
 reaper and if you already have the hair is some 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.150
 as exchange exchange dh6 to pay 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.180
 blood and the reaper by ac-130 changing 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.310
 the two streaks one by one using 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.990
 the same way but the other way around 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.130
 I know if you understand me but he gave me but I 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.600
 I understood so I hope that I 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.420
 you try and you also the 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.940
 hair is exaggerated or is it a machine 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.060
 to kill is awesome as it kills 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.190
 people the bad thing if they wear blind eye that 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.010
 the difference between the hair goes well in 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.019
 the 130 c because I like them 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.120
 because I liked it more since I keep 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.989
 thinking the same but good seen as 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.430
 kill the gib in some classes 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:27.769
 he is contradicting the bad with were 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.840
 130 Even if they have an eye, I can still get there 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.150
 to see the guy running underneath the 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.790
 map and you can shoot equally and 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.560
 killing but facebook not facebook 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.750
 did not direct it was so it does not kill the 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.569
 people who have a game so if 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.239
 You have bad luck and always soled 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.010
 someone with this in all the games 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.230
 at least the ones that I get into you have 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.950
 the typical one with blind eye murderer with him 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.489
 stinger and you will last a shit 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:06.170
 so that's why I prefer a link 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:10.880
 130 for 130 because of that but good because 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:15.739
 that's why I promised you a job with this 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:19.280
 weapon here you have a little m60 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.840
 distributing with the 60's and nothing happened the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.370
 fast reapers since less than rival in 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.770
 0 as the typical one of the eyes said 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.690
 blind lame shot there are four cucumbers and 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.070
 right then they knock me down the first 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.770
 place is seen the other has also passed 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.470
 the same thing has been to throw it away and that 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.750
 destroy it so nothing I think that 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.700
 until here comes someone has little left 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.050
 there are not left almost you have me eat it 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.950
 qatada a destroyed helicopters that 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.990
 phage pay and that there are people who are healthy 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.400
 so there are people who are dedicated to 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.110
 that to shoot down helicopters you have in 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.990
 corrective helicopter for a flirt 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.070
 from above and they have fun, I think 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.780
 that the game is good to do that browns 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.700
 the delicate kills people I've 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.950
 come to see people in games that 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.900
 they finish 19 and that the only thing they have done 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.120
 it's more funny killing people when 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.830
 well here you see how they kill me once 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.110
 there they could not find nor did not have 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.660
 where to hide so it was is 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.250
 ending and the gameplay is a 43 to 3 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.040
 with a light machine gun the truth 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.110
 a quite powerful gameplay since 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.670
 I promised you so here is here 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.040
 like favorites to the video that help 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.840
 You liked it a lot and we'll see you in the 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.840
 next video goodbye 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.360
 the mention
