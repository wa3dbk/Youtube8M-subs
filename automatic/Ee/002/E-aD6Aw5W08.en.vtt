buying<00:00:51.400> it<00:00:51.699> but<00:00:52.600> I<00:00:52.780> think<00:00:52.869> it's<00:00:53.260> different

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
buying it but I think it's different

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.740 
buying it but I think it's different
right<00:00:53.799> now<00:00:54.129> I<00:00:54.369> think<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:55.000> perception<00:00:55.360> is<00:00:55.690> a

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
right now I think the perception is a

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.549 
right now I think the perception is a
real<00:00:56.369> different<00:00:57.369> for<00:00:57.519> Dallas<00:00:57.850> Cowboys<00:00:58.269> I<00:00:58.570> see

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
real different for Dallas Cowboys I see

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.340 
real different for Dallas Cowboys I see
a<00:00:59.830> lot<00:01:00.129> of<00:01:00.190> value<00:01:00.790> catching<00:01:01.510> over<00:01:01.659> field<00:01:02.080> goal

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
a lot of value catching over field goal

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.070 
a lot of value catching over field goal
at<00:01:02.500> Baltimore<00:01:03.309> simply<00:01:04.180> because<00:01:04.750> this<00:01:04.900> number

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
at Baltimore simply because this number

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.830 
at Baltimore simply because this number
is<00:01:05.320> based<00:01:05.590> on<00:01:05.830> nothing<00:01:06.159> more<00:01:06.369> than<00:01:06.610> what<00:01:07.600> the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
is based on nothing more than what the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.780 
is based on nothing more than what the
betting<00:01:08.170> public<00:01:08.350> remembers<00:01:09.010> last<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:09.670> what

that extra week I think they're going to
be<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.340> lot<00:02:48.640> crisper<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.570> offense<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.680> know

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
against the Chicago Bears and when you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.970 
against the Chicago Bears and when you
look<00:02:57.820> at<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.030> Baltimore<00:02:58.720> Ravens<00:02:58.750> we're<00:02:59.680> so

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
look at the Baltimore Ravens we're so

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.520 
look at the Baltimore Ravens we're so
used<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.550> them<00:03:00.640> being<00:03:00.880> good<00:03:01.209> defensively<00:03:01.870> we

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
used to them being good defensively we

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.050 
used to them being good defensively we
take<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.980> for<00:03:03.130> granted<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.580> that's<00:03:03.850> going<00:03:03.970> to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
take it for granted that that's going to

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.300 
take it for granted that that's going to
be<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.239> case<00:03:04.420> every<00:03:04.810> year<00:03:05.140> but<00:03:05.800> they're<00:03:06.010> not<00:03:06.250> a

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
be the case every year but they're not a

be the case every year but they're not a
good<00:03:06.640> defensive<00:03:07.180> team<00:03:07.420> this<00:03:07.600> year<00:03:07.900> because<00:03:08.260> of

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
good defensive team this year because of

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.910 
good defensive team this year because of
the<00:03:08.770> fact<00:03:09.450> simply<00:03:10.450> put<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:11.200> they're<00:03:11.590> using

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
the fact simply put that they're using

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.030 
the fact simply put that they're using
this<00:03:12.400> no-huddle<00:03:12.970> offense<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.840> that's<00:03:14.470> making

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
this no-huddle offense and that's making

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.820 
this no-huddle offense and that's making
that<00:03:15.340> defense<00:03:15.820> which<00:03:16.060> is<00:03:16.239> older<00:03:16.870> stay<00:03:17.560> on<00:03:17.739> the

that defense which is older stay on the
field<00:03:18.010> longer<00:03:18.520> than<00:03:18.670> they're<00:03:18.790> used<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:19.180> that's

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
field longer than they're used to that's

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.740 
field longer than they're used to that's
why<00:03:19.930> their<00:03:20.140> 24th<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:20.890> total<00:03:21.220> yards<00:03:21.489> allowed

22nd against the pass 19th against the
run<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.330> this<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.110> week<00:03:26.320> that<00:03:26.350> you're

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
run and this is the week that you're

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.640 
run and this is the week that you're
going<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:26.920> see<00:03:27.040> DeMarco<00:03:27.549> Murray<00:03:28.019> finally<00:03:29.019> rush

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
going to see DeMarco Murray finally rush

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.440 
going to see DeMarco Murray finally rush
for<00:03:29.890> some<00:03:30.070> yards<00:03:30.400> for<00:03:30.610> Dallas<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.120> think<00:03:31.299> that's

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
for some yards for Dallas I think that's

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.880 
for some yards for Dallas I think that's
going<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.690> be<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.930> difference-maker<00:03:32.350> and

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
going to be the difference-maker and

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.860 
going to be the difference-maker and
what<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.519> don't<00:03:33.760> why<00:03:33.910> Baltimore's<00:03:34.750> they

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
what I don't why Baltimore's they

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.660 
what I don't why Baltimore's they
putting<00:03:35.440> up<00:03:35.530> points<00:03:35.709> because<00:03:36.370> they<00:03:36.489> don't

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
putting up points because they don't

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.460 
putting up points because they don't
have<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.880> personnel<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.660> run<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:37.989> no-huddle

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
have the personnel to run that no-huddle

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.590 
have the personnel to run that no-huddle
offense<00:03:38.680> you<00:03:39.370> need<00:03:39.549> wide<00:03:39.760> receivers<00:03:40.420> that

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
offense you need wide receivers that

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.990 
offense you need wide receivers that
could<00:03:40.720> create<00:03:40.959> space<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.920> these<00:03:42.430> guys<00:03:42.640> just

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
could create space and these guys just

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.990 
could create space and these guys just
can't<00:03:43.239> get<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.600> done<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:44.019> like<00:03:44.440> Dallas

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
can't get it done I like Dallas

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.490

Victor what a week a week Cincinnati

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.380 
Victor what a week a week Cincinnati
defense<00:03:56.799> but<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.010> think<00:03:57.280> people<00:03:57.700> still<00:03:58.030> have

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
defense but I think people still have

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.690 
defense but I think people still have
that<00:03:58.810> game<00:03:59.140> in<00:03:59.350> their<00:03:59.470> mind<00:03:59.680> and<00:03:59.830> offensively

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
that game in their mind and offensively

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.490 
that game in their mind and offensively
they<00:04:00.940> have<00:04:01.090> not<00:04:01.269> been<00:04:01.420> as<00:04:01.570> productive<00:04:01.720> as<00:04:02.170> they

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
they have not been as productive as they

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.080 
they have not been as productive as they
were<00:04:02.590> in<00:04:02.830> week<00:04:03.010> one<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.670> other<00:04:03.790> thing<00:04:03.880> I

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
were in week one and the other thing I

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.640 
were in week one and the other thing I
thought<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.299> great<00:04:04.510> point<00:04:04.810> about<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.200> defense

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
thought a great point about the defense

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.140 
thought a great point about the defense
that<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.160> is<00:04:06.340> not<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.670> Baltimore<00:04:07.120> Ravens

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
that this is not the Baltimore Ravens

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.630 
that this is not the Baltimore Ravens
defense<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:07.930> we've<00:04:08.080> all<00:04:08.260> seen<00:04:08.980> play<00:04:09.459> before

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
defense that we've all seen play before

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.060 
defense that we've all seen play before
I<00:04:09.820> think<00:04:10.060> Suggs<00:04:10.390> is<00:04:10.600> huge<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.290> up<00:04:11.620> from<00:04:11.860> there

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
I think Suggs is huge that up from there

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.310 
I think Suggs is huge that up from there
gray<00:04:12.459> Kansas<00:04:12.910> City<00:04:13.120> really<00:04:13.540> did<00:04:13.750> run<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.049> ball

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
gray Kansas City really did run the ball

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.780 
gray Kansas City really did run the ball
down<00:04:14.560> their<00:04:14.739> throats<00:04:15.040> last<00:04:15.340> week<00:04:15.519> now<00:04:15.549> I<00:04:15.670> know

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
down their throats last week now I know

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.539 
down their throats last week now I know
they<00:04:16.060> only<00:04:16.260> put<00:04:17.260> six<00:04:17.590> points<00:04:18.070> on<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.340> board

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
they only put six points on the board

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.699 
they only put six points on the board
but<00:04:19.030> if<00:04:19.120> you<00:04:19.209> look<00:04:19.600> at<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.810> yardage<00:04:20.410> they

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
but if you look at the yardage they

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.680 
but if you look at the yardage they
gained<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.549> lot<00:04:21.700> of<00:04:21.760> yard<00:04:22.150> art<00:04:22.300> around

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
gained a lot of yard art around

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.680 
gained a lot of yard art around
turnovers<00:04:23.680> kill<00:04:23.890> them<00:04:24.010> you<00:04:24.340> see

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
turnovers kill them you see

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.720 
turnovers kill them you see
Alice<00:04:24.930> being<00:04:25.440> able<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.770> run<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:25.980> ball<00:04:26.070> frankly

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
Alice being able to run the ball frankly

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.940 
Alice being able to run the ball frankly
because<00:04:27.090> Dallas<00:04:27.480> right<00:04:27.750> now<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.020> 29th<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.830> in

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
because Dallas right now is 29th and in

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.340 
because Dallas right now is 29th and in
rushing<00:04:29.520> yards<00:04:29.850> which<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.360> awful<00:04:30.930> yes<00:04:31.140> but

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
rushing yards which is awful yes but

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.380 
rushing yards which is awful yes but
their<00:04:31.500> number<00:04:31.770> four<00:04:32.130> in<00:04:32.400> passing<00:04:33.060> yards<00:04:33.090> so

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
their number four in passing yards so

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.090 
their number four in passing yards so
they're<00:04:33.510> able<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.810> throw<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.290> ball<00:04:34.470> but<00:04:34.950> it

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
they're able to throw the ball but it

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.190 
they're able to throw the ball but it
hasn't<00:04:35.490> turned<00:04:35.670> into<00:04:36.060> points<00:04:36.480> reason<00:04:36.990> being

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
hasn't turned into points reason being

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.290 
hasn't turned into points reason being
they<00:04:37.800> turn<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.280> ball<00:04:38.310> over<00:04:38.490> when<00:04:39.000> you<00:04:39.120> turn

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
they turn the ball over when you turn

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.630 
they turn the ball over when you turn
the<00:04:39.330> ball<00:04:39.570> over<00:04:39.600> in<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.050> red<00:04:40.230> zone<00:04:40.640> whether

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
the ball over in the red zone whether

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.690 
the ball over in the red zone whether
you<00:04:41.880> march<00:04:42.300> 60<00:04:42.930> 70<00:04:43.290> yards<00:04:43.530> downfield<00:04:43.740> if<00:04:44.490> it

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
you march 60 70 yards downfield if it

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.610 
you march 60 70 yards downfield if it
doesn't<00:04:44.880> turn<00:04:45.120> in<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.390> points<00:04:45.810> it's<00:04:46.050> no<00:04:46.380> good

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
doesn't turn in the points it's no good

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.410 
doesn't turn in the points it's no good
and<00:04:46.860> that's<00:04:47.160> what<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.520> Alice<00:04:47.760> has<00:04:47.910> been<00:04:48.090> doing

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
and that's what the Alice has been doing

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.670 
and that's what the Alice has been doing
that's<00:04:48.570> why<00:04:48.690> they're<00:04:48.870> minus<00:04:49.260> seven<00:04:49.530> and

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
that's why they're minus seven and

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.000 
that's why they're minus seven and
turnover<00:04:50.250> so<00:04:50.430> far<00:04:50.670> this<00:04:50.820> season<00:04:50.880> but<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:52.200> really

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
turnover so far this season but I really

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.640 
turnover so far this season but I really
think<00:04:53.220> after<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:53.850> performance<00:04:54.180> we<00:04:55.050> saw<00:04:55.320> with

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
think after that performance we saw with

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.980
