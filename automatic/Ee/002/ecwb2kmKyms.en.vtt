00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 all right 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.630
 Welcome to online drawing today 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.480
 We will see how to draw the body of the 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.430
 Android number 18 in front also 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.330
 we draw this body seen in profile and 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.949
 three fourths step 1 we will draw a 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.110
 proportion line divided in two 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.550
 equal parts the top part for 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.130
 the body and the one below will be for the 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.890
 part of the legs after we draw 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.510
 in blue five divisions this what 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.789
 we do because the head of this person 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.820
 gm of a fifth of the total size 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:38.140
 of the body this also means that 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.449
 the head is very big step 2 very well 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.249
 now using the red color let's 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.139
 define the general form of the character 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:46.559
 the head we will not explain how 

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:48.489
 we do so there is a specific tutorial 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.159
 specific that talks about how to do this 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.249
 head we draw the neck very thin 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:57.190
 and the trapeze going down 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:58.620
 slightly and let's draw the shape 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.739
 of the body 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.719
 as we have said many times before 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.180
 shaped like an hourglass 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.619
 thin at the waist and it becomes wide 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.619
 towards the hips 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.640
 and we begin to draw the legs 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.200
 we look for half of the section of the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.409
 legs and up that half will be 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.689
 the knees of our character 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.670
 we draw the legs a curve in 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.829
 of the leg and another curve out of the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.149
 leg are you this person's legs 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.670
 that are a little different from others 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.799
 characters are two curves in the part 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.500
 one internal and another in the external part 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.320
 equal to part of the pimples is a 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.229
 curve in the inner part of the leg and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.560
 another curve on the outside here from 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.040
 the shin so are the legs of this 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.990
 character 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.850
 and we trace the feet of which 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.190
 we will talk in detail soon 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.500
 we draw the arms quite straight and 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.820
 a little separated from the body remember 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.010
 that the dolls are in the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.930
 center of the body straight arms 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.540
 make this character look more 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.240
 android as it gives the appearance of being a 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.660
 robot and just are not some small 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.160
 details how to define the chest we are going to 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.200
 multiply our sketch and there 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.670
 we will follow step 3 we define the head in 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.530
 this link that appears on the screen 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.930
 explains in detail how this is drawn 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.970
 head here we only do it so 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.670
 fast and we're going to start defining everything 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.830
 type of details in this step 3 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.830
 using the color black slightly 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.660
 below the waist that is the part 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.880
 more left thin of the body we draw 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.250
 what will be the belt and in a way 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.620
 rectangular we draw what will be the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.230
 vest here said a sloping line 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.460
 to define the sleeve one line 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.030
 inclined for the sleeve 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.720
 here will be the sleeves also of the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.510
 dolls stick out a little bit 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.310
 we set the skirt below the part 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.209
 central body 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.930
 here we emphasize vest also this is 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.000
 the limits of vest outside and the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.040
 boots that are below the knee 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.750
 that increase the volume of the legs 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.680
 making them see more straight lines in the part 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.609
 down 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.780
 the details of the boots we will see 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.329
 we will be seeing in other tutorials 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.790
 where we see clothes here also the neck 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.799
 from vest that we are drawing this 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.469
 We will review the type of details when 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.359
 let's do tutorials of how the 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:31.760
 clothes because these neck details are 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.379
 They repeat a lot in different clothes 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.859
 also these different lines that 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.780
 we are drawing are just details but 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.599
 that we will also study when we speak 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.599
 clothing as they are details that 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.519
 they repeat in many garments we add 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.069
 details and we remark the legs for 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.689
 that they acquire a more definitive form and 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.370
 to break the monotony of the body 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.319
 we draw a raised arm to the 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.109
 waist and so we finish our 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.819
 subtraction sketch add a clean sheet 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.129
 to trace our drawing in a way 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.750
 cleaner and detailed some of the 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.760
 aspects of this drawing require something 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.239
 of practice but it's well worth the 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.370
 effort 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.109
 by detailing our sketch we add 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.629
 the different lines that the 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.129
 clothes to finish we add some 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.560
 shadows so that our drawing looks 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.299
 more finish we hope you like this 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.930
 class and if so subscribe and 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.930
 share it
