00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 hi today i decided to share with 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.210
 you recipe my ice cream 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:15.240
 it will be the most delicious 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.439
 ice cream and at the same time she herself and 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.590
 useful because it is made of 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.310
 fruits 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.320
 summer fruits where are my fruits 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.119
 naturally from the freezer and so if u 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.710
 you haven't spent these fruits you can go 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.449
 to the store and buy it now succeeds 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.410
 a huge variety of 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.399
 I like fruit most probably 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:44.460
 fruits that i'm right and if there it is 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:47.129
 more precisely it is strawberry raspberry blueberry here 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.210
 such clarity and naturally need to go there 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.840
 put something banana and since and 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.420
 why am I super frozen so I 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.949
 pour some milk or if you 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.070
 there can be put 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:08.760
 and everything turns out god is super tasty 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.720
 banana ice cream you put very mature 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.229
 because of matured on the fact of mature 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.070
 banana 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.740
 super soft and so sweet that our 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.740
 our ice cream is frosty and you don't even need 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.840
 there will be spoons of sugar though if you 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.140
 I like the taste of vanilla, I advised you 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.500
 put or drip a few drops 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.509
 vanilla extract if you have or 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.509
 very case of a little vanilla sugar 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.430
 here is my ice cream ready 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.720
 popsicles or whatever you like so 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.769
 call it the fact that this recipe 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.940
 there is a little secret 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.250
 if you give at least a little of yours I 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.959
 ready to defrost then instead 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.739
 get a smoothie straight from the freezer 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.950
 dota track do not leave them 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.709
 bask 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.959
 otherwise get yourself no ice cream but if 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.530
 you still want lasting for 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:07.100
 original oksane well recipe then 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.739
 I advise all the same berries and fruits put 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.630
 straight from the freezer immediately blender and 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.230
 for this just add 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.859
 some milk to say so 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.720
 then this mess is actually pretty 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.609
 it's hard 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.900
 first put the blender to work but 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.420
 little by little 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.459
 he begins to grind them and it turns out 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.730
 ice cream if this frosty little 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.730
 consists of it could have been okay and 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.530
 generally need to end this conversation 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.440
 otherwise not from my shop just 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.340
 it will look looks I wish everyone necessarily 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:53.610
 try this then ice cream and up 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.610
 next meetings in the next peter bye
