00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
appeal to you but it certainly did for

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.970 
appeal to you but it certainly did for

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
me because I like to create these big

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.179 
me because I like to create these big
mine<00:00:20.520> shafts<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.840> one<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.949> dig

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
mine shafts and like this one and a dig

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.939 
mine shafts and like this one and a dig
straight<00:00:23.550> down<00:00:23.670> until<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.449> reach<00:00:24.720> bedrock<00:00:25.439> then

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
straight down until I reach bedrock then

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.220 
straight down until I reach bedrock then
count<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.400> 10<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.730> start<00:00:27.420> making<00:00:28.080> my<00:00:28.199> own

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
count up 10 and start making my own

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.160 
count up 10 and start making my own
shafts<00:00:28.650> over<00:00:28.980> there<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.779> ladder

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
shafts over there but this ladder

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.670 
shafts over there but this ladder
illuminates<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.340> little<00:00:32.640> bit<00:00:32.790> not<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.870> much

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
illuminates a little bit not a as much

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.910 
illuminates a little bit not a as much
as<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.980> torch<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:36.050> certainly<00:00:37.050> does<00:00:37.440> luminate

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
as a torch but certainly does luminate

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.180 
as a torch but certainly does luminate
and<00:00:38.600> instead<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.719> instead<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.680> going<00:00:41.010> down

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and instead of instead of you going down

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.150 
and instead of instead of you going down
placing<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.149> ladder<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:43.649> placing<00:00:44.100> a
