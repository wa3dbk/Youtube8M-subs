 36 back then, she pointed to the meadow 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.960
 have stood and is a half-hour 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.960
 moving 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.750
 when you know the village lives 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.370
 clearly concluded childhood and and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.150
 even then she gave me the old castle 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.150
 GÃ¼ssing in the village 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.660
 above warning will become 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:01:01.840
 beautiful viewpoint in mexico 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:04.860
 City where is difficult with in dialogue 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.860
 instead of the pot 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.930
 three architects give houses to the brothers 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.229
 build men quint stefan kurt and 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.240
 Raphael super three examples of how 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.960
 an architect with the environment of his 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.030
 bypasses buildings 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.040
 But the context is more than just 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.510
 the nature that surrounds a building or 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.470
 the story of a place 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:36.040
 it is about appropriateness of the expression 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.430
 if I have the private building with him 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.750
 completely contextual turn exclusively 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.740
 private meaning then the animal has become 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.680
 into the open 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.380
 that would be wrong if the building biggest 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:57.160
 importance is what 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:02.430
 thinks she's walking or walking 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.430
 wordpress 2 a personal emergency 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.000
 Architects of contex are mine 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.430
 normal resort scenic building where 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.080
 kennel miracles pose through history 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.570
 from the place then things before the beginning 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.150
 one of the extra costs one 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:28.209
 particular type want as much as possible 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:31.180
 know about it but perceive one-seated 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:35.110
 at the same time combined so imagine 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.480
 interested in concrete 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.850
 so abstract the architects the concept 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.950
 Context also need to define in 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.950
 Apply specifically to your buildings 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.220
 in the village built in the same should have 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.860
 sony presents traditional citizens 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.790
 killed 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:03.780
 and that's actually so important piece 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.180
 seven yes think it is both the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.460
 Kindergarten for children are only valid 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.460
 for girl it's up to you both 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:23.250
 they can world and looking forward 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.070
 but bad was that the tearoom 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.360
 That was crazy 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:32.100
 wilson was the track 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.020
 would have driven expressive but etc 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.330
 that is why it is only on the 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.340
 simply placed and liquidated 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.880
 that if there because no matter whether my this 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:49.730
 Area with an age built with one 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.730
 18 place to theology or her 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.890
 of course appeal to Rasta reference 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.190
 Create recognizability that 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.810
 Good piece of eyes again aspect 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.900
 Wednesday night and see to their unique 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.670
 and that we take with us is the aspect 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.080
 to make the miners a topic 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.739
 This seems to be light in the landscape 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.600
 foreground architecture is mine too 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.700
 frame the landscape and that's the way it is 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.700
 Hot for the glorious theme 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.710
 architecture in context a theme with 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.270
 special relevance in a GRAUBUNDEN 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.270
 there is no universal recipe 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.910
 ultimately do not know what that is 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:49.009
 I was following this up close 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:54.539
 Office and environment the context base 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:56.759
 ask what that means it is 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.919
 difficult term that I accompanied 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.720
 has become permanent educations too 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.280
 that one speaks for context one 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.740
 nobody really knows 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.740
 or speak that for yourself
