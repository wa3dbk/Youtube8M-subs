00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.650
 good afternoon dear subscribers today 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.740
 I would like to talk with you a little about 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.230
 cases specifically from phone case 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.940
 iphone 5s 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.250
 I think that many bloggers here know 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.410
 do constantly review on the covers how about 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.750
 they reveal the first impression all 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.699
 but it seems to me that it is not much 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.699
 not right because the main function 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.369
 The cover is still not the appearance 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.400
 phone protection at least i'm so 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.280
 I think so I think what to do 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.530
 review on the case is only when 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.630
 are you sure that up to quality 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.870
 case and is that it is able to protect 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.440
 your phone and this is known as capable 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.750
 check only time 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.840
 I repeat once again this is a floating case 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.900
 for iphone 5s i.e. it is their company 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
 For the first time ever, Apple has released a case 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.110
 there is no bumper that is earlier for 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.050
 iphone 4 4s phone 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.880
 they released a bomber and this is a full 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.660
 case 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.689
 I would like to tell a little about him 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.100
 pluses and minuses the first thing that immediately me 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.250
 liked this the fact that he completely 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.640
 leather ie it is not a skin substitute 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.050
 this is skin 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.120
 here it is a little dusty is the skin and 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.150
 I want to say quite a quality case 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.590
 This one bought in January and as you see 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.820
 I'll try now to be on 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.900
 camera visible for a second 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.570
 to be visible on the camera no 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.270
 no scratches and I do n't even know the prince 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.159
 focus but trust me on the word 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.350
 I didn't scratch it on purpose 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.299
 rubbing anything with it not the case that here 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:52.560
 have you seen how is our case I 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.170
 very well, I bought in January, then defied 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.390
 roughly two weeks stopped and then 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.670
 I realized that I like it and decided again 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.520
 wear it at all 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.860
 As for me, I cannot and do not 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.409
 I like to wear covers that is, I usually 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.269
 I buy them our day or two more and more I donâ€™t 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.370
 I can have a box full of covers 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.019
 This is the only exception. 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.300
 first time in my life when i 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.480
 really here is the department put in 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.400
 our not taking it off it's pretty weird 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.440
 for me and in general all who know me they 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.410
 surprise that's how you are at night this case 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.210
 I show yes and now if there are such people I 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.450
 I know that they are like me who 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.000
 Just well, it does not transfer covers, then I dare 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.250
 you assure that most likely this case 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.710
 You will like it and you will not 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.100
 think as if to take off as soon as possible 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.410
 so here it is but I digress a little means 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.870
 no scratches on it now 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.960
 I think you will see a very strong phone 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.900
 it fell and nothing happened to him 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.280
 but you know modern covers 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.710
 they are designed so they don't have protection 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.960
 screen that is how to explain that is 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.470
 here it is here see a little above 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.650
 Here is this region if he look, then he 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.770
 above 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:17.530
 screen that is when falling on the table in 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.420
 ordinary covers zeros in most 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.070
 ordinary covers your phone your screen 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.050
 will be scratched or somehow beaten there yet 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.150
 what happens to him is not here because 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.209
 what is here how much the beta limit of the screen is not 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:36.610
 The screen does not concern this to me very, very 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:41.350
 like well at the beginning of the case is very tight 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.540
 but like all skin, all wear out 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.310
 here is a special coating which is not 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.989
 scratches your phone really 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.580
 look he was wearing well how are you 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.230
 January 6 months at approximately and 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.270
 there are no scratches at all that is maybe 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.070
 little what is there but at that moment 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.520
 when I they trudged that moment when not 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.390
 wore 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.940
 Case now they are not think that especially 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.890
 talk a lot about the case no meaning 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.140
 no in general believe me guys this 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.410
 somewhere here for me is a unique case 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.010
 because I really wear it and don't take it off 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.390
 it is very convenient for me not very thick 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.430
 get out of pocket yes you know there 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.630
 those who are right here out of pocket 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.290
 pulling and 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.390
 he does not get very comfortable 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.270
 cool case recommend to everyone and 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.990
 especially to those people who basically 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.710
 copy 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.370
 don't like covers think what to say here 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.330
 nothing more, well, maybe the buttons 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.320
 protected here 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.000
 In general, the phone in this case is the first 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.560
 protected second 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.020
 comfortable well he looks very healthy to me 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.210
 it seems black skin and the price is not that 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.520
 You know there are covers ferrari or aston 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.440
 martin doesn't cost about three or five 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.970
 thousand that this one costs about 1000 rubles 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:07.300
 maybe 2 honestly I don't remember but 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.890
 in general, not so much money for everyone 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.510
 thank you so much for watching 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.310
