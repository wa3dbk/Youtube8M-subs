00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.490 
often Wallin's east and we got bees and
a<00:00:08.220> mansard<00:00:08.700> style<00:00:10.309> building<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:12.349> this<00:00:13.349> could

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
a mansard style building and this could

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.169 
a mansard style building and this could
be<00:00:13.620> real<00:00:13.860> tricky<00:00:14.040> sometimes<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:15.030> we're

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
be real tricky sometimes and we're

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.080 
be real tricky sometimes and we're
hoping<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:16.049> time<00:00:16.490> but<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.940> get

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
hoping that this time but we get

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.349 
hoping that this time but we get
readings<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.990> floor<00:00:19.380> okay<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.939> access

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
readings in the floor okay and to access

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
readings in the floor okay and to access
the<00:00:21.510> colony<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.960> believe<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.320> open<00:00:22.710> up<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859

the colony I believe we can open up the
side<00:00:23.160> from<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> outside<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.300> we're<00:00:24.810> hoping

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
side from the outside and we're hoping

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.390 
side from the outside and we're hoping
that<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.410> get<00:00:25.529> everything<00:00:25.800> out<00:00:26.010> there<00:00:26.250> we

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
that we can get everything out there we

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.620 
that we can get everything out there we
don't<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.760> go<00:00:26.789> inside<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.240> room<00:00:27.510> and

frightened look just like that over
there<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:12.019> a<00:02:12.110> little<00:02:12.230> small<00:02:12.650> gap<00:02:12.920> between<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
there in a little small gap between the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.090 
there in a little small gap between the
indenter<00:02:14.570> some<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:14.930> those<00:02:15.019> bricks<00:02:15.380> okay<00:02:15.920> that

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
indenter some of those bricks okay that

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.470 
indenter some of those bricks okay that
was<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.400> two<00:02:16.550> entrance<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.300> bees<00:02:17.450> are

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
was that two entrance and the bees are

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.780 
was that two entrance and the bees are
pretty<00:02:17.780> small<00:02:18.050> too<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:18.950> they<00:02:19.070> just<00:02:19.100> zip<00:02:19.640> right

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
pretty small too so they just zip right

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.250 
pretty small too so they just zip right
up<00:02:19.970> in<00:02:20.090> there<00:02:20.269> so<00:02:20.450> I'm<00:02:20.630> sure<00:02:20.810> they'd<00:02:21.019> probably

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
up in there so I'm sure they'd probably

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.470 
up in there so I'm sure they'd probably
kill<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.560> little<00:02:21.830> bit<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.070> bees<00:02:22.190> but<00:02:22.489> guarantee

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
kill a little bit of bees but guarantee

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.910 
kill a little bit of bees but guarantee
they<00:02:23.660> didn't<00:02:23.810> do<00:02:23.900> anything<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:24.500> hot<00:02:24.680> got
