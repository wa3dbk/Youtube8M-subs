all time so that's what we're going to

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.320 
all time so that's what we're going to
do<00:01:56.039> rig<00:01:57.039> everything<00:01:57.310> off<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.909> left<00:01:58.090> here

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
do rig everything off to the left here

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.870 
do rig everything off to the left here
swing<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:58.990> in<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.350> then<00:02:00.130> walk<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.549> down<00:02:00.700> the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
swing it in and then walk it down the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.950 
swing it in and then walk it down the
alleyway<00:02:01.119> between<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.630> two<00:02:01.780> houses<00:02:06.960> we

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
alleyway between the two houses we

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.289 
alleyway between the two houses we
decide<00:02:08.289> which<00:02:08.560> limb<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.280> remove<00:02:09.610> we<00:02:10.030> tie<00:02:10.179> them

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
decide which limb to remove we tie them

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.870 
decide which limb to remove we tie them
off<00:02:10.450> usually<00:02:10.959> with<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.110> running<00:02:11.350> bowline<00:02:11.880> which

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
off usually with a running bowline which

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.030 
off usually with a running bowline which
is<00:02:13.120> basically<00:02:13.930> what<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.350> running<00:02:14.680> part<00:02:14.830> is

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
is basically what the running part is

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.400 
is basically what the running part is
that<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.310> chokes<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.970> secures<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.019> limp<00:02:17.260> so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
that it chokes and secures the limp so

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.860 
that it chokes and secures the limp so
when<00:02:17.530> there's<00:02:17.709> weight<00:02:17.890> put<00:02:18.160> on<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.870> cinches

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
when there's weight put on it it cinches

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.949 
when there's weight put on it it cinches
up<00:02:19.930> around<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.470> limb<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.569> when<00:02:22.569> it's<00:02:22.720> cut

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
up around the limb and when it's cut

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.500 
up around the limb and when it's cut
free<00:02:23.470> from<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.739> tree<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.790> could<00:02:25.030> be<00:02:25.120> lowered

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
free from the tree it could be lowered

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.620 
free from the tree it could be lowered
on<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.019> off<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.500> lowering<00:02:27.160> line<00:02:27.600> which<00:02:28.600> is

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
on the off of the lowering line which is

holding it until it clears the house and

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:21.390 
holding it until it clears the house and
then<00:03:11.040> we<00:03:11.099> can<00:03:11.249> lower<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.459> into<00:03:11.609> this<00:03:11.879> zone

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.190 

in<00:03:22.239> rigging<00:03:23.019> you<00:03:23.140> want<00:03:23.349> to<00:03:23.939> see<00:03:24.939> what<00:03:25.209> where

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
in rigging you want to see what where

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.369 
in rigging you want to see what where
and<00:03:26.379> how<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.890> tree<00:03:27.220> might<00:03:27.879> go<00:03:28.360> okay<00:03:29.290> and

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
and how the tree might go okay and

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.110 
and how the tree might go okay and
that's<00:03:29.530> what<00:03:29.650> experience<00:03:30.099> teaches<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.519> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
that's what experience teaches you and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.339 
that's what experience teaches you and
some<00:03:31.360> common<00:03:31.689> sense<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:31.989> know<00:03:32.079> if<00:03:32.230> it's

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
some common sense you know if it's

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.080 
some common sense you know if it's
leaning<00:03:32.650> this<00:03:32.769> way<00:03:32.829> it's<00:03:33.640> probably<00:03:33.909> going<00:03:34.030> to

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
leaning this way it's probably going to

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.610 
leaning this way it's probably going to
go<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.329> way<00:03:34.390> so<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:34.930> can<00:03:35.140> make<00:03:35.260> your<00:03:35.409> Nagy

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
go that way so you can make your Nagy

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.970 
go that way so you can make your Nagy
and<00:03:35.860> rig<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.579> way<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:38.769> know<00:03:38.829> but

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
and rig it in that way you know but

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.679 
and rig it in that way you know but
however<00:03:39.099> there's<00:03:39.340> always<00:03:39.430> some<00:03:40.329> factors

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
however there's always some factors

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.300 
however there's always some factors
maybe<00:03:40.900> it's<00:03:41.019> rotten<00:03:41.349> inside<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.950> don't<00:03:42.040> know

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
maybe it's rotten inside you don't know

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.399 
maybe it's rotten inside you don't know
or<00:03:42.730> there<00:03:43.329> might<00:03:43.450> be<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.629> crack<00:03:43.959> or<00:03:43.989> they<00:03:44.260> might

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
or there might be a crack or they might

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.410 
or there might be a crack or they might
go<00:03:44.709> wit<00:03:44.980> might<00:03:45.159> be<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.280> gust<00:03:45.519> of<00:03:45.640> wind<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.120> your

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
go wit might be a gust of wind so your

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.039 
go wit might be a gust of wind so your
rigging<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:47.019> always<00:03:47.409> in<00:03:47.680> mind<00:03:48.519> of<00:03:48.700> backup<00:03:49.209> so

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
rigging is always in mind of backup so

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.509 
rigging is always in mind of backup so
that<00:03:50.200> you're<00:03:50.349> not<00:03:50.560> only<00:03:50.920> rigging<00:03:51.250> for<00:03:51.400> that

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
that you're not only rigging for that

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.770 
that you're not only rigging for that
moment<00:03:51.790> for<00:03:52.120> what<00:03:52.209> you're<00:03:52.329> trying<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.629> do

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
moment for what you're trying to do

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.990 
moment for what you're trying to do
let's<00:03:52.989> say<00:03:53.140> Knox<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.739> lemon<00:03:54.069> you<00:03:54.730> know<00:03:54.819> have

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
let's say Knox and lemon you know have

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.030 
let's say Knox and lemon you know have
it<00:03:55.090> go<00:03:55.209> to<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.510> right<00:03:55.720> you're<00:03:56.590> also<00:03:56.709> saying

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
it go to the right you're also saying

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.470 
it go to the right you're also saying
well<00:03:57.220> okay<00:03:57.430> well<00:03:57.609> if<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:57.849> doesn't<00:03:58.299> happen

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
well okay well if this doesn't happen

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.470 
well okay well if this doesn't happen
you<00:03:59.470> know<00:03:59.560> what<00:03:59.709> we're<00:03:59.829> going<00:03:59.920> to<00:04:00.010> do<00:04:00.329> it's<00:04:01.329> an

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
you know what we're going to do it's an

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.360 
you know what we're going to do it's an
it's<00:04:01.599> dangerous<00:04:01.930> work<00:04:02.109> so<00:04:02.859> there's<00:04:03.099> a<00:04:03.159> certain

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
it's dangerous work so there's a certain

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.610 
it's dangerous work so there's a certain
amount<00:04:03.549> of<00:04:03.790> risk<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.629> you<00:04:04.810> take<00:04:05.109> we

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
amount of risk that you take we

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.009 
amount of risk that you take we
sometimes<00:04:06.359> differentiate<00:04:07.359> between<00:04:07.450> taking<00:04:07.900> a

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
sometimes differentiate between taking a

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
gamble and taking a risk we don't gamble

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.229 
gamble and taking a risk we don't gamble
we<00:04:11.019> take<00:04:11.379> risks<00:04:11.769> is<00:04:11.920> that's<00:04:12.220> what<00:04:12.939> you<00:04:13.060> have<00:04:13.180> to

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
we take risks is that's what you have to

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.089 
we take risks is that's what you have to
do<00:04:13.420> in<00:04:13.510> order<00:04:13.569> to<00:04:13.720> get<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.900> job<00:04:14.109> done<00:04:14.170> you're

do in order to get the job done you're

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.029 
do in order to get the job done you're
always<00:04:15.250> thinking<00:04:15.879> ahead<00:04:16.150> okay<00:04:16.510> if<00:04:16.959> this<00:04:17.410> side
