00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
blueish purpose or a blueish turquoise

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.070 
blueish purpose or a blueish turquoise
color<00:02:04.670> was<00:02:04.910> because<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.420> really<00:02:05.720> didn't<00:02:05.900> want

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
color was because I really didn't want

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.320 
color was because I really didn't want
to<00:02:06.140> go<00:02:06.260> out<00:02:06.380> purple<00:02:06.770> purple<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.940> sort<00:02:08.270> of

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
to go out purple purple and it sort of

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.060 
to go out purple purple and it sort of
would<00:02:08.540> look<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.930> match<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:09.320> with<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.470> sari<00:02:09.830> so

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
would look to match you with the sari so

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.410 
would look to match you with the sari so
I<00:02:10.100> really<00:02:10.369> wanted<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.730> do<00:02:10.880> some<00:02:11.090> kind<00:02:11.120> of

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
I really wanted to do some kind of

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.960

contrast<00:02:11.930> that's<00:02:12.530> why<00:02:12.710> you<00:02:12.770> use<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.400> blue<00:02:13.670> as

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
contrast that's why you use the blue as

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.970 
contrast that's why you use the blue as
the<00:02:14.000> pop<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.510> color<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:14.990> then<00:02:15.230> I'm<00:02:15.470> gonna<00:02:15.770> use
