to pick them off and then that's the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.119 
to pick them off and then that's the
first<00:02:07.160> round<00:02:07.369> right<00:02:07.610> there<00:02:07.789> and<00:02:08.979> now<00:02:09.979> we're

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
first round right there and now we're

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.440 
first round right there and now we're
starting<00:02:10.310> up<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.580> new<00:02:10.610> round<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.090> still<00:02:11.239> have<00:02:11.360> my

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
starting up a new round is still have my

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.930 
starting up a new round is still have my
sniper<00:02:11.690> out<00:02:11.959> i<00:02:11.989> have<00:02:12.200> predator<00:02:12.530> missile<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.610> i

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
sniper out i have predator missile so i

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.570 
sniper out i have predator missile so i
try<00:02:14.210> to<00:02:14.270> wait<00:02:15.200> until<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.680> 10<00:02:15.950> seconds<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:16.430> up

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
try to wait until the 10 seconds is up

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.990 
try to wait until the 10 seconds is up
so

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
and I see I have my care package there

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.750 
and I see I have my care package there
so<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.900> continued<00:02:33.800> go<00:02:33.920> on<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.340> spot<00:02:34.580> to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
so I continued go on this and spot to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.790 
so I continued go on this and spot to
pick<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.030> off<00:02:35.150> pick<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.020> team<00:02:36.230> off<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.650> goes

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
pick it off pick the team off that goes

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.960 
pick it off pick the team off that goes
up<00:02:36.920> top<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.640> seems<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.300> be<00:02:38.390> working<00:02:39.430> but<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.640> get

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
up top it seems to be working but I get

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.110 
up top it seems to be working but I get
a<00:02:41.000> hitmarker<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.870> then<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:43.190> couldn't<00:02:43.940> find

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
a hitmarker and then I couldn't find

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.810 
a hitmarker and then I couldn't find
them<00:02:44.240> after<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.840> think<00:02:45.020> he<00:02:45.080> hid<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.340> just

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
them after that I think he hid so I just

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.020 
them after that I think he hid so I just
shoot<00:02:47.060> again<00:02:47.330> this<00:02:47.540> precaution<00:02:50.260> all<00:02:51.260> right

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
shoot again this precaution all right

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.840 
shoot again this precaution all right
also<00:02:53.350> this<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:55.190> probably<00:02:55.400> one<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.700> best

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
also this is probably one of the best

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.880 
also this is probably one of the best
