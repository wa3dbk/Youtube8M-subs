00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.879
 of the dordogne limit case engineer and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.110
 you see super hot in the 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.420
 fish currently are on the surface 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.760
 so we'll try a little fishing in 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.560
 surface but with a small difference 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.530
 we have this novelty there you see well 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.890
 no it's not a cane to their senses 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:38.500
 and a scop lunch cane it's called 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.600
 sonov is actually effect that six feet from 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.310
 long 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.940
 here but with a tc of three books 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.620
 so it's pretty tough and we're going 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.320
 use today for fishing in 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.570
 surface today I used the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.880
 nylon nylon of 30 hundredths 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.000

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.910
