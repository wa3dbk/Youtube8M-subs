in<00:00:10.510> this<00:00:10.719> segment<00:00:10.929> we're<00:00:11.230> going<00:00:11.349> to<00:00:11.410> talk

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
in this segment we're going to talk

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.320 
in this segment we're going to talk
about<00:00:11.830> the<00:00:12.099> different<00:00:12.459> backers<00:00:12.879> and<00:00:13.120> how

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
about the different backers and how

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.629 
about the different backers and how
they're<00:00:13.570> used<00:00:13.870> in<00:00:14.139> laminate<00:00:14.589> in<00:00:14.799> this<00:00:15.190> case<00:00:15.429> I

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
they're used in laminate in this case I

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.600 
they're used in laminate in this case I
have<00:00:15.849> a<00:00:16.180> flat<00:00:16.840> cut<00:00:17.110> ash<00:00:17.410> as<00:00:17.950> the<00:00:18.310> primary

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
have a flat cut ash as the primary

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.900 
have a flat cut ash as the primary
veneer<00:00:19.150> and<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:19.990> backer<00:00:20.230> is<00:00:20.590> and<00:00:21.189> actually

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
veneer and the backer is and actually

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.150 
veneer and the backer is and actually
it's<00:00:22.090> a<00:00:22.179> rotary<00:00:22.420> saw<00:00:22.840> on<00:00:22.900> Kume<00:00:23.439> which<00:00:23.710> we<00:00:23.980> use

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
it's a rotary saw on Kume which we use

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.310 
it's a rotary saw on Kume which we use
quite<00:00:24.460> often<00:00:24.759> for<00:00:25.269> our<00:00:25.330> wood<00:00:25.779> on<00:00:25.900> wood<00:00:25.929> back

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
quite often for our wood on wood back

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.200 
quite often for our wood on wood back
and<00:00:27.130> this<00:00:27.519> would<00:00:27.730> be<00:00:27.880> used<00:00:28.230> today<00:00:29.230> in

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and this would be used today in

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.640 
and this would be used today in
applications<00:00:31.210> where<00:00:31.359> you<00:00:31.419> have<00:00:31.539> a<00:00:32.110> curved

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
applications where you have a curved

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.580 
applications where you have a curved
surface<00:00:32.680> or<00:00:33.580> like<00:00:34.480> on<00:00:34.630> a<00:00:34.660> like<00:00:35.050> on<00:00:35.200> a<00:00:35.230> counter

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
surface or like on a like on a counter

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.889 
surface or like on a like on a counter
front<00:00:35.829> or<00:00:36.010> a<00:00:36.070> reception<00:00:36.610> desk<00:00:36.789> or<00:00:37.090> if<00:00:37.719> you're

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
front or a reception desk or if you're

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.520 
front or a reception desk or if you're
laying<00:00:38.110> over<00:00:38.379> a<00:00:38.530> dissimilar<00:00:39.100> material<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:41.500> a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
laying over a dissimilar material like a

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.619 
laying over a dissimilar material like a
solid<00:00:42.129> wood<00:00:42.309> construction<00:00:42.610> as<00:00:43.059> I<00:00:43.180> described

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
solid wood construction as I described

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.889 
solid wood construction as I described
earlier<00:00:44.489> because<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.730> solid<00:00:45.969> wood<00:00:46.300> actually

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
earlier because the solid wood actually

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.380 
earlier because the solid wood actually
expands<00:00:47.469> it<00:00:47.559> attracts<00:00:47.920> at<00:00:48.160> one<00:00:48.399> rate<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:48.969> if

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
expands it attracts at one rate and if

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.260 
expands it attracts at one rate and if
you<00:00:49.510> were<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.809> lathe<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.440> primary<00:00:51.250> veneer<00:00:51.670> with

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
you were to lathe a primary veneer with

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.750 
you were to lathe a primary veneer with
the<00:00:52.390> grain<00:00:52.629> running<00:00:52.989> in<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.320> same<00:00:53.530> direction

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the grain running in the same direction

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.580 
the grain running in the same direction
because<00:00:54.760> of<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.239> difference<00:00:55.840> in<00:00:55.930> expansion

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
because of the difference in expansion

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.680 
because of the difference in expansion
and<00:00:56.800> contraction<00:00:57.010> can<00:00:57.609> actually<00:00:58.030> buckle<00:00:58.510> or

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
and contraction can actually buckle or

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.200 
and contraction can actually buckle or
tear<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.410> veneer<00:00:59.680> so<00:01:00.070> what<00:01:00.340> that<00:01:00.489> backer<00:01:00.820> does

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
tear the veneer so what that backer does

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.299 
tear the veneer so what that backer does
is<00:01:01.510> it<00:01:01.809> gives<00:01:01.929> it<00:01:02.140> stability<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.800> allows<00:01:03.070> it

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
is it gives it stability and allows it

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.950 
is it gives it stability and allows it
to<00:01:03.340> stay<00:01:03.640> flat<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:06.040> you<00:01:06.220> have<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.450> phenolic

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
to stay flat then you have the phenolic

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.340 
to stay flat then you have the phenolic
back<00:01:08.170> material<00:01:08.799> and<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:10.540> is<00:01:10.810> very<00:01:11.049> much<00:01:11.290> like

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
back material and this is very much like

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.649 
back material and this is very much like
what<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:11.950> would<00:01:12.100> see<00:01:12.400> in<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.210> high<00:01:13.360> pressure

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
what you would see in a high pressure

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.530 
what you would see in a high pressure
laminate<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:14.520> used<00:01:15.520> very<00:01:15.850> much<00:01:16.090> in<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.360> same

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
laminate and used very much in the same

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.660 
laminate and used very much in the same
way<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:17.110> you<00:01:17.650> could<00:01:17.890> use<00:01:18.070> this<00:01:18.310> with<00:01:18.610> a

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
way and you could use this with a

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.050 
way and you could use this with a
contact<00:01:19.240> cement<00:01:19.509> application<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:21.549> you<00:01:21.640> didn't

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
contact cement application if you didn't

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.630 
contact cement application if you didn't
have<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.210> press<00:01:22.570> or<00:01:22.869> you<00:01:22.900> didn't<00:01:23.380> you<00:01:24.369> didn't

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
have a press or you didn't you didn't

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.819 
have a press or you didn't you didn't
have<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.850> ability<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.299> build<00:01:26.079> a<00:01:26.259> press<00:01:26.470> and

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
have the ability to build a press and

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.280 
have the ability to build a press and
press<00:01:27.009> in<00:01:27.220> place<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.759> what<00:01:28.390> this<00:01:28.540> does<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:29.110> it

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
press in place and what this does is it

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.469 
press in place and what this does is it
adds<00:01:29.560> extreme<00:01:30.159> stability<00:01:30.759> to<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:31.030> surface

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
adds extreme stability to the surface

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.960 
adds extreme stability to the surface
because<00:01:31.659> with<00:01:32.020> contact<00:01:32.530> cement<00:01:32.649> it's<00:01:33.549> a<00:01:33.729> very

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
because with contact cement it's a very

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.340 
because with contact cement it's a very
elastic<00:01:34.450> glue<00:01:35.140> line<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:36.850> have<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.509> glue

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
elastic glue line and so you have a glue

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.960 
elastic glue line and so you have a glue
line<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.799> moves<00:01:39.009> in<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:39.220> environment<00:01:39.850> and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
line that moves in the environment and

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.060 
line that moves in the environment and
then<00:01:40.210> because<00:01:40.509> wood<00:01:40.780> is<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:40.960> fibrous<00:01:41.470> material

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
then because wood is a fibrous material

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.710 
then because wood is a fibrous material
which<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:42.579> hydroscopic

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
which is hydroscopic

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.749 
which is hydroscopic
and<00:01:43.899> it<00:01:44.110> takes<00:01:44.350> on<00:01:44.560> an<00:01:44.680> expelled<00:01:45.130> moisture

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
and it takes on an expelled moisture

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.990 
and it takes on an expelled moisture
will<00:01:46.240> also<00:01:46.840> expand<00:01:47.799> a<00:01:47.829> contract<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.549> what

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
will also expand a contract and what

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.870 
will also expand a contract and what
that<00:01:49.180> backer<00:01:49.450> does<00:01:49.780> is<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.170> allows<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:51.460> not

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
that backer does is it allows it to not

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.060 
that backer does is it allows it to not
be<00:01:51.909> affected<00:01:52.750> as<00:01:52.899> much<00:01:53.229> because<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.890> glue

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
be affected as much because the glue

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.910 
be affected as much because the glue
line<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.549> moving<00:01:54.759> in<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.180> environment<00:01:55.920> also

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
line is moving in the environment also

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.039 
line is moving in the environment also
with<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.759> phenolic<00:01:58.180> back<00:01:58.360> material<00:01:58.899> if

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
with the phenolic back material if

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.380 
with the phenolic back material if
you're<00:01:59.500> laying<00:01:59.740> up<00:02:00.009> with<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.390> dissimilar

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
you're laying up with a dissimilar

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.120 
you're laying up with a dissimilar
material<00:02:01.840> or<00:02:01.960> laying<00:02:02.140> on<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.530> dissimilar

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
material or laying on to a dissimilar

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.090 
material or laying on to a dissimilar
material<00:02:03.610> like<00:02:03.789> metal<00:02:04.210> or<00:02:04.450> plastic<00:02:05.100> this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
material like metal or plastic this

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.820 
material like metal or plastic this
allows<00:02:06.460> you<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.850> do<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.180> quite<00:02:07.420> well<00:02:07.830> another

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
allows you to do that quite well another

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.310 
allows you to do that quite well another
application<00:02:09.369> for<00:02:09.759> this<00:02:10.060> as<00:02:10.330> well<00:02:10.810> as<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.170> wood

application for this as well as the wood

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.940 
application for this as well as the wood
on<00:02:11.500> wood

on wood

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.369 
on wood
is<00:02:12.040> if<00:02:12.370> you're<00:02:12.640> laying<00:02:12.910> up<00:02:13.180> on<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.810> substrate

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
is if you're laying up on a substrate

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.190 
is if you're laying up on a substrate
that's<00:02:14.680> not<00:02:14.980> exactly<00:02:15.640> perfect<00:02:16.209> where<00:02:17.050> you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
that's not exactly perfect where you

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.770 
that's not exactly perfect where you
have<00:02:17.440> some<00:02:17.920> some<00:02:18.519> defects<00:02:19.000> or<00:02:19.209> depressions

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.530 
have some some defects or depressions
that<00:02:20.050> you've<00:02:20.620> had<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.040> fill<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:22.209> didn't

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
that you've had to fill and you didn't

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.449 
that you've had to fill and you didn't
want<00:02:22.750> those<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.290> Telegraph<00:02:23.680> through<00:02:24.099> or<00:02:24.250> if

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
want those to Telegraph through or if

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.270 
want those to Telegraph through or if
you're<00:02:24.640> using<00:02:25.620> mechanical<00:02:26.620> fasteners<00:02:27.069> like

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
you're using mechanical fasteners like

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.860 
you're using mechanical fasteners like
screws<00:02:27.610> or<00:02:27.849> nails<00:02:27.879> and<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.420> had<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.690> fill

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
screws or nails and you had to fill

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.280 
screws or nails and you had to fill
those<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:30.330> inevitably<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.690> fillers<00:02:32.019> will

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
those and inevitably the fillers will

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.199 
those and inevitably the fillers will
shrink<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.680> little<00:02:32.890> bit<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.790> what<00:02:34.000> that

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
shrink a little bit and so what that

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.630 
shrink a little bit and so what that
what<00:02:34.599> these<00:02:35.170> types<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.620> backers<00:02:36.040> will<00:02:36.220> do<00:02:36.400> is

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
what these types of backers will do is

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.180 
what these types of backers will do is
eliminate<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.739> telegraphing<00:02:38.739> through<00:02:38.950> so

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
eliminate the telegraphing through so

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.400 
eliminate the telegraphing through so
you<00:02:39.250> don't<00:02:39.640> see<00:02:39.970> what's<00:02:40.209> going<00:02:40.569> on<00:02:40.660> below<00:02:41.049> it<00:02:41.200> I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
you don't see what's going on below it I

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.170 
you don't see what's going on below it I
hope<00:02:41.769> this<00:02:41.950> gives<00:02:42.129> you<00:02:42.340> an<00:02:42.459> understanding<00:02:43.120> of

hope this gives you an understanding of

hope this gives you an understanding of
the<00:02:43.299> different<00:02:43.599> types<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.959> backers<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.620> how

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
the different types of backers and how

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.130 
the different types of backers and how
they're<00:02:45.010> used<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.580> relationship<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.599> your

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
they're used in relationship to your

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.220 
they're used in relationship to your
projects
