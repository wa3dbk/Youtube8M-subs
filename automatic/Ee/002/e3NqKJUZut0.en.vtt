ways to clean the chain it's normally a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.649 
ways to clean the chain it's normally a
little<00:01:55.409> bit<00:01:55.530> easier<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.090> bring<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> chain

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
little bit easier if you bring the chain

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.130 
little bit easier if you bring the chain
onto<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.050> outside<00:01:58.200> cog<00:01:59.270> okay<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.050> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
onto the outside cog okay just going to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.660 
onto the outside cog okay just going to
give<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> little<00:02:01.649> bit<00:02:01.770> more<00:02:01.979> access<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
give you a little bit more access to the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.580 
give you a little bit more access to the
chain<00:02:02.909> we'll<00:02:03.780> start<00:02:04.080> with<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.229> top<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.440> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
chain we'll start with the top of the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.169 
chain we'll start with the top of the
chain<00:02:04.800> first<00:02:05.270> try<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.360> get<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> worst<00:02:06.780> off

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
chain first try and get the worst off

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.639 
chain first try and get the worst off
and<00:02:09.179> also<00:02:09.360> spin<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.050> chain<00:02:10.289> through<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and also spin the chain through the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.240 
and also spin the chain through the
brush<00:02:13.610> just<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.760> careful<00:02:15.209> with<00:02:15.300> your<00:02:15.450> fingers

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
brush just be careful with your fingers

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.740 
brush just be careful with your fingers
hands<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.640> fingers<00:02:18.000> particularly<00:02:18.600> when

hands and fingers particularly when

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.720 
hands and fingers particularly when
you're<00:02:18.930> doing<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.410> because<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:20.519> quite

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
you're doing this because it's quite

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.340 
you're doing this because it's quite
easy<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.090> get<00:02:21.300> them<00:02:21.480> caught<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.050> with<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
easy to get them caught in with the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.729 
easy to get them caught in with the
chain<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:24.019> know<00:02:25.019> have<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.200> few<00:02:25.230> instance

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
chain and I know have a few instance

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.229 
chain and I know have a few instance
where<00:02:25.950> people<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.400> hurt<00:02:26.610> themselves<00:02:26.790> quite

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
where people have hurt themselves quite

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.140 
where people have hurt themselves quite
badly<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.170> careful<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.590> one

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
badly so just be careful that one

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.449 
badly so just be careful that one
getting<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.269> detail<00:02:30.660> brush<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:31.140> there<00:02:31.459> start

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
getting the detail brush in there start

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.759 
getting the detail brush in there start
to<00:02:32.610> work<00:02:32.790> on<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.120> rear<00:02:33.269> mech<00:02:33.510> as<00:02:33.690> well<00:02:33.900> getting

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
cages of the rear mech that's really

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.060 
cages of the rear mech that's really
where<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.690> grease<00:02:39.959> starts<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.440> build<00:02:40.590> up<00:02:40.799> and

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
where the grease starts to build up and

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.860 
where the grease starts to build up and
works<00:02:41.519> as<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> grinding<00:02:42.299> paste<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.840> your

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
works as a grinding paste on your

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.090 
works as a grinding paste on your
components<00:02:43.670> doing<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.730> bike<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.329> gears

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
components doing the bike to the gears

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.310 
components doing the bike to the gears
means<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.340> you'll<00:02:47.519> have<00:02:47.730> access<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.209> all<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
means that you'll have access to all the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.860 
means that you'll have access to all the
sprockets<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.950> cogs<00:02:50.360> switching<00:02:51.360> sides<00:02:51.630> on

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
sprockets and cogs switching sides on

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.690 
sprockets and cogs switching sides on
the<00:02:51.959> bike<00:02:52.250> easy<00:02:53.250> access<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.910> different<00:02:54.090> parts

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
the bike easy access the different parts

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.600 
the bike easy access the different parts
and<00:02:56.700> therefore<00:02:56.910> works<00:02:57.360> well<00:02:58.070> to<00:02:59.070> get<00:02:59.280> into<00:02:59.489> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
and therefore works well to get into the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.880 
and therefore works well to get into the
nooks<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.940> crannies<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.480> clean<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:00.930> up

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.130 

now<00:03:05.890> we've<00:03:06.280> done<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.580> top<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:06.940> chain<00:03:07.180> it's

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
now we've done the top of the chain it's

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.949 
now we've done the top of the chain it's
important<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.770> you<00:03:08.830> do<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.099> underside

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
important that you do the underside

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.570 
important that you do the underside
making<00:03:10.959> sure<00:03:11.200> if<00:03:11.260> there's<00:03:11.500> anything<00:03:11.770> residual

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
making sure if there's anything residual

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.089 
making sure if there's anything residual
in<00:03:12.700> there<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:14.140> was<00:03:14.290> also<00:03:14.590> getting<00:03:14.800> cleaned

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
in there that was also getting cleaned

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:22.580 
in there that was also getting cleaned
out<00:03:19.830> just<00:03:20.830> run<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.160> bike<00:03:21.370> through<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.730> gears

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
out just run the bike through the gears

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.770 
out just run the bike through the gears
so<00:03:23.590> at<00:03:23.650> this<00:03:23.800> stage<00:03:24.099> if<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.340> have<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.610> tell<00:03:24.880> if

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
so at this stage if you have to tell if

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.199 
so at this stage if you have to tell if
everything's<00:03:26.260> nice<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.220> clean<00:03:27.730> you'll<00:03:28.000> hear

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209

everything's nice and clean you'll hear
no<00:03:28.360> grinding<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:30.160> can<00:03:30.340> see<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:31.510> chain<00:03:31.780> moving

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
no grinding you can see the chain moving

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.190 
no grinding you can see the chain moving
nice<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.269> fast<00:03:35.880> last<00:03:36.880> stage<00:03:37.180> I'm<00:03:37.959> going<00:03:38.110> to
