00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.330
 good old android friends colombia 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.570
 Welcome to Mr. Chapter how many 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.519
 servers esteban rodrÃ­guez is 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.000
 meeting and I will teach how to change the 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.100
 put animation boot animation of your 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.720
 Android device 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.480
 but if you do not know what the whore is 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.740
 dimension is this 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.740
 let's see initial phone 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.910
 but dimensions will mean 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.910
 boot animation that do this 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.980
 we see that I have here a dimension of 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.980
 the zeta spiral 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.230
 as we see, I do not have the feeling that 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.920
 can be me it seemed a bit ugly 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.300
 change this seems to me much better 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.300
 and this is botany 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.790
 we have to go to the beginning to explain 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.790
 how to change it 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.870
 and that 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.890
 We are going to do this with the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.500
 next steps to achieve can 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.780
 achieve that procedure ready what 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.390
 primordial and most important for 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.380
 to be able to do this is from the device 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.420
 router if you were daring this I will leave you 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.479
 a video in my description 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.840
 obviously where he showed you how to withdraw 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.100
 you came out in galaxy s3 ready 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.960
 then after having it rooted 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.440
 we unloaded a point africa and what 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.980
 we install that it is going to be him 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.840
 but explorer let's find him ruth 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.840
 explore what you do 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.180
 we open this 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.429
 and here we see little folders that are the 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.950
 Device root cards 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.560
 ready we obviously go the functions of 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.440
 link in addition to some wood animation 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.720
 so they can download those 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.510
 points are coming and they will not decompress 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.850
 they surround her as they are going to 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.690
 place the folder if you want to 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.019
 the sd card or in the internal this folder 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.819
 it says sd card in the folder of the 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.590
 internal memory of record is internal 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.000
 but since I already have an external one, we're going 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.750
 to go to storani 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.810
 where it says it is to dedicate as we see here 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.990
 is to dedicate and we will look at the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.300
 downloads folder that I have saved 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.560
 this 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.380
 and we are going to place the living dimension 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.920
 to be a smart example let's go to 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.920
 look for it 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.770
 and the inem 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.430
 we copy it we go back back in 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.720
 what we get to the root and we're going to 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.210
 where it says is the system folder 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.210
 ready now let's go to the middle folder 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.230
 we change this little thing 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.889
 fashion with says rr 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.889
 w 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.970
 efe 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.739
 and now let's stick I'm hit 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.540
 we see here is the one that says bitch 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.060
 measurement that is the one that comes with by 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.810
 defect to the device you can 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.780
 save 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.020
 or if not in case you want to go back to 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.920
 place the guards in any the 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.920
 let's cut it 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.720
 does not cut the tender Maurice ship 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.080
 Awaiting industry and can return 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.140
 to place if you want 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.090
 I like release by default and now 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.209
 we go again they attend half 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.009
 and the one 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.160
 and the one that is by default we're going to 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.160
 remove 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.910
 the motion here we will select 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.220
 let's read renown 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.960
 we take away 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:41.160
 which is just lowercase animation 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.160
 together and we will accept 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.070
 and after having changed the name 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.680
 we are going to restart it to see if it has been 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.729
 the procedure is a success 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.729
 we reset 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.610
 and as we see, the bitch does not come out 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.979
 dimension of android and fingerling by 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.979
 defect that freight brings 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.020
 ready friends this is all for today
