hey<00:00:01.410> guys<00:00:01.589> today<00:00:02.129> I'm<00:00:02.220> going<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.399> be

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hey guys today I'm going to be

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.610 
hey guys today I'm going to be
explaining<00:00:02.700> display<00:00:03.389> resolution<00:00:03.990> an<00:00:04.170> aspect

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
explaining display resolution an aspect

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.480 
explaining display resolution an aspect
ratio<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:06.589> can<00:00:07.589> see<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.010> background<00:00:08.189> we

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
ratio you can see in the background we

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.370 
ratio you can see in the background we
put<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> sample<00:00:09.000> video<00:00:09.389> playing<00:00:09.690> which<00:00:10.019> I'll<00:00:10.230> be

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
put a sample video playing which I'll be

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.169 
put a sample video playing which I'll be
using<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.830> demonstrate<00:00:11.030> throughout<00:00:12.030> this

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
using to demonstrate throughout this

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.279 
using to demonstrate throughout this
video<00:00:14.389> we'll<00:00:15.389> start<00:00:15.599> off<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.690> display

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
video we'll start off with display

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.040 
video we'll start off with display
resolution<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.840> quote

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
resolution so what is it to quote

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.439 
resolution so what is it to quote
Wikipedia<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.699> number<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.029> distinct

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
Wikipedia it's the number of distinct

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.870 
Wikipedia it's the number of distinct
pixels<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.170> each<00:00:22.769> dimension<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.760> be

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
pixels in each dimension that can be

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.120 
pixels in each dimension that can be
displayed<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.650> if<00:00:25.650> you're<00:00:25.769> watching<00:00:25.890> this

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.980 
displayed so if you're watching this
video<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.029> highest<00:00:27.300> quality<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.720> I've

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
video in the highest quality that I've

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.410 
video in the highest quality that I've
uploaded<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.529> YouTube<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.640> will<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.849> 1280

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
uploaded it to YouTube that will be 1280

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.020 
uploaded it to YouTube that will be 1280
by<00:00:31.019> 720<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:32.329> 720p<00:00:33.329> as<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.260> known<00:00:34.670> this<00:00:35.670> means

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
by 720 or 720p as it's known this means

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.940 
by 720 or 720p as it's known this means
that<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.440> screen

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that on the screen

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.260 
that on the screen
it's<00:00:39.440> 1280<00:00:40.440> pixels<00:00:41.010> wide<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:42.350> 720<00:00:43.350> high<00:00:44.270> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
it's 1280 pixels wide and 720 high to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.090 
it's 1280 pixels wide and 720 high to
find<00:00:45.420> out<00:00:45.600> how<00:00:45.719> many<00:00:45.780> pixels<00:00:46.079> there<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.620> we

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
find out how many pixels there are we

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.549 
find out how many pixels there are we
just<00:00:47.280> multiply<00:00:47.670> these<00:00:47.879> two<00:00:48.149> numbers<00:00:48.180> together

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
just multiply these two numbers together

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.319 
just multiply these two numbers together
so<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.770> case<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.460> bit<00:00:50.610> over<00:00:50.820> 900

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so in this case it's a bit over 900

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.860 
so in this case it's a bit over 900
thousand<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:52.670> technology<00:00:53.670> has<00:00:53.879> moved<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.300> our

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
thousand as technology has moved on our

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.520 
thousand as technology has moved on our
displays<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.590> got<00:00:55.739> more<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.190> more<00:00:56.309> pixels

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
displays have got more and more pixels

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.319 
displays have got more and more pixels
although<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> good<00:00:59.280> thing<00:00:59.309> we'd<00:01:00.120> much

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
although this is a good thing we'd much

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.180 
although this is a good thing we'd much
rather<00:01:00.359> dense<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.170> pixels<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.680> our<00:01:01.800> screens

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
rather dense of pixels in our screens

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.420 
rather dense of pixels in our screens
than<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.090> more<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.660> them<00:01:03.979> which<00:01:04.979> brings<00:01:05.280> us

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
than just more of them which brings us

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.840 
than just more of them which brings us
nicely<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.510> PPI<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.290> pixel<00:01:07.799> density<00:01:10.850> pixel

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
nicely on to PPI and pixel density pixel

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
nicely on to PPI and pixel density pixel
density<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.900> number<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> pixels<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
density is the number of pixels in a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.460 
density is the number of pixels in a
certain<00:01:14.310> space<00:01:14.689> this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.869> usually<00:01:16.110> measured

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
certain space this is usually measured

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.810 
certain space this is usually measured
in<00:01:16.680> PPI<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:18.000> pixels<00:01:18.720> per<00:01:18.990> inch<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
in PPI or pixels per inch so the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
in PPI or pixels per inch so the
difference<00:01:21.180> between<00:01:21.479> having<00:01:21.689> more<00:01:22.020> pixels

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
difference between having more pixels

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.020 
difference between having more pixels
and<00:01:22.680> having<00:01:22.950> denser<00:01:23.340> pixels<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.970> be

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
and having denser pixels can be

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.170 
and having denser pixels can be
demonstrated<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.810> an<00:01:25.049> HDTV<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.070> an<00:01:27.030> iPhone

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
demonstrated with an HDTV and an iPhone

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.960 
demonstrated with an HDTV and an iPhone
5<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:29.400> an<00:01:29.729> HD<00:01:30.150> TV<00:01:30.180> playing<00:01:30.869> blu-ray<00:01:31.350> has<00:01:31.970> well

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
5 so an HD TV playing blu-ray has well

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.260 
5 so an HD TV playing blu-ray has well
over<00:01:33.210> 2<00:01:33.420> million<00:01:33.630> pixels<00:01:34.790> whereas<00:01:35.790> an<00:01:35.909> iPhone

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
over 2 million pixels whereas an iPhone

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.230 
over 2 million pixels whereas an iPhone
5<00:01:36.570> has<00:01:37.350> less<00:01:37.710> than<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.979> million<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:39.000> over

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
5 has less than a million just over

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.260 
5 has less than a million just over
700,000<00:01:40.220> whereas<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.369> look<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> PPI

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
700,000 whereas if we look at the PPI

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.789 
700,000 whereas if we look at the PPI
the<00:01:43.140> HDTV<00:01:43.700> only<00:01:44.700> has<00:01:44.880> 102<00:01:45.720> pixels<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.500> each

do hold our phones near our face of
course<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.349> means<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:10.920> don't<00:02:11.039> have<00:02:11.160> to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
course this means that we don't have to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.770 
course this means that we don't have to
put<00:02:11.670> millions<00:02:12.000> upon<00:02:12.540> billions<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:13.110> pixel
