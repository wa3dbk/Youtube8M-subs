pieces then start doing a regular braid

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.440 
pieces then start doing a regular braid
until<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:29.500> have<00:00:29.649> like<00:00:29.829> two<00:00:29.860> links<00:00:30.520> and<00:00:30.700> then

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
when you get that part it's just like a

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.620

in the top cross it over slide your
middle<00:00:39.700> piece<00:00:39.850> up<00:00:40.000> so<00:00:40.300> it<00:00:40.360> becomes<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:40.750> top

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
middle piece up so it becomes the top

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
it gives us this pretty twisted look

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.109 
it gives us this pretty twisted look
almost<00:01:48.969> as<00:01:49.270> if<00:01:49.420> it's<00:01:49.569> not<00:01:49.810> rated<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.880> if<00:01:51.999> you

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
almost as if it's not rated so if you

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.940 
almost as if it's not rated so if you
were<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.270> look<00:01:52.450> up<00:01:52.749> from<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:53.439> bottom<00:01:53.619> or

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
were to look up from the bottom or

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.769 
were to look up from the bottom or
straight<00:01:54.369> down<00:01:54.549> it<00:01:54.880> would<00:01:55.060> look<00:01:55.209> like<00:01:55.329> a<00:01:55.389> flat

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:55.779 
straight down it would look like a flat

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:57.599 
straight down it would look like a flat
braid<00:01:56.020> but<00:01:56.590> from<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.889> side<00:01:57.099> it<00:01:57.249> just<00:01:57.399> looks

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
braid but from the side it just looks

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:59.879 
braid but from the side it just looks
like<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.939> really<00:01:58.299> pretty<00:01:58.479> delicate<00:01:58.959> twist<00:01:59.289> with

these really pretty waterfall handguns

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.139 
these really pretty waterfall handguns
so<00:02:04.179> just<00:02:04.450> keep<00:02:04.630> adding<00:02:04.869> hair<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.409> it<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:05.799> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
so just keep adding hair to it on the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.690
