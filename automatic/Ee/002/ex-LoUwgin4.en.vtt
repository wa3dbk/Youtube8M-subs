00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.760
 have you ever tried her 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.129
 presentation with a music in the 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.070
 to accompany the background 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.750
 Two questions often crop up like that 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.720
 can a piece of music on the 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.480
 shorten the duration and at the beginning and end 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.949
 slowly fade in and out or how 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.269
 can music over several slides 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.699
 be played 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.090
 on both questions you get in this 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.160
 video tutorial now an answer 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.110
 by the way, which diverse audio format 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.390
 powerpoint now supported 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.799
 You may be in the attachment of our ideas 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.129
 book under background knowledge 

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:48.339
 look up initial situation is now one 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.839
 animated slide in the the 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.330
 Club activities of a sailing sport 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.409
 Together gradually by picture 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.409
 be shown 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.989
 the duration of the animated slide too 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.430
 I throw a look in the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.840
 animation area here I can now with 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.050
 superimposed timeline very nice at 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.170
 read the last animation that this 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.020
 at 13 3 seconds to end 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.490
 I notice this time for the reduction 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.040
 or length of music around now 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.710
 Click the film to accompany the film 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.350
 I insert on 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.240
 audio audio from file and select 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.910
 my file storage the desired 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.360
 audio file off 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.120
 that takes a while 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.100
 as a placeholder for the audio file becomes 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.910
 now a gray speaker symbol 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.390
 Inserted in the middle of the slide 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.130
 First of all, I move to the side 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.770
 as soon as i put this speaker symbol 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.860
 clicking on it will bring up a bar 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.350
 with media controls and in the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.470
 The tabs will be audio 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.160
 tools format and audio tools playback 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.289
 faded in with these two 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.020
 I can insert a tab 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.709
 individually control sound file and 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.709
 to edit 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.110
 becomes an inserted audio file 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.280
 by default with the option start at 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.410
 Click the inserted I sit as 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.270
 first of all on automatically for that 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.470
 music should automatically with the start 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.300
 the film begins the playback of a 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.730
 inserted audio file is from 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.260
 powerpoint treated like an animation 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.390
 therefore I open now over animation 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.630
 animation area the animation area 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.550
 and take a closer look 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.700
 actually in the list of animation 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.880
 is the audio file in my now on 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.500
 last place listed 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.000
 because the music but directly with the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.580
 animation should begin 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.930
 I push this entry once 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.180
 all the way up to the first place 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.790
 short test of the screen animation 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.760
 shows me the one hand, the disturbing 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.650
 loudspeaker symbol in the middle of the slide 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.650
 and on the other hand that the piece of music 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.660
 it's just too long 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.950
 Speaker symbol is fast 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.410
 made invisible 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.020
 I just click in the ribbon below 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.500
 audio tools playback on at 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.720
 hide presentation around the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.840
 to cut music piece I choose over 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.820
 Audio Tools playback the command audio 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.280
 trimming 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.220
 Now a dialog box will appear in 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.430
 I with the green slider the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.740
 at the beginning and with the red slider 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.870
 the end of the up to play part 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.120
 can determine 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.760
 I have already tested the whole thing and 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.690
 would like for the 13 3 seconds long 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.690
 animation the music like ca on 17 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.000
 shorten seconds 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.650
 the whole thing should start at a minute 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.560
 and so I push the green 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.470
 Slider roughly on the position one 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.150
 minute and over the little ones 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.760
 single step switch the value exactly 1 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.710
 I pull the red slider now 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.180
 roughly to 1.17 and do that 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.570
 Fine adjustment again over the single 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.520
 Step switch over the playback 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.460
 switch in the middle I can tell me that 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.169
 listen some pieces to control when 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.780
 Everything fits, I click ok and with it 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.720
 but the music does not start abruptly 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.440
 and I stop over audio 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.740
 show tools playback at 2 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.430
 seconds and hide three 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.979
 seconds 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.949
 A short test of the screen animation 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.409
 shows me that the result fits and 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.879
 now music length and animation good 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.879
 are coordinated 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.320
 that was it 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.130
 it's so easy in the meantime 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.820
 PowerPoint 2010 insert audio files 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.820
 and edit 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.390
 that's just how easy music is 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.240
 insert several slides 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:35.570
 in a small photo shoot from total 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.230
 I'd like to have five pictures now 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.230
 have background music 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.310
 click on the slide with the first picture 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.820
 I insert on 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.820
 audio audio from file and select 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.570
 my file tray again the desired 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.570
 audio file off 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:02.139
 because an inserted audio file like a 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:05.919
 animation I will be treated now 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:10.209
 in the animation area under the effect 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:13.439
 options that the replay a5 

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:13.439
 is terminated 

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:17.339
 that was it 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.409
 but at this point is already 

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:27.009
 noted that in films across 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:29.259
 music to shorten the new functions and 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.279
 unfortunately not 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.429
 function 

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:37.029
 that works only with audio files on one 

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:41.559
 film but nevertheless we show 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:43.929
 in the break on page 1 129 to 131 like 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:46.839
 she with a little trick and a 

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:49.719
 free additional program nevertheless to 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:51.759
 come aim and then foils 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:55.799
 cut across music and 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.799
 Show and hide harmoniously
