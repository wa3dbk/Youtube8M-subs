00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.509
 feeding the newborn baby 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.149
 is the first cause of concern in 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.160
 the new moms and constitutes a 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.619
 true challenge to overcome depending on 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.840
 each and every one of the beliefs of 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:18.200
 criteria and recommendations 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.120
 often you hear naturally the 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.340
 best food that we can offer to 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.160
 newborn baby in breast milk 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.920
 and it's such a natural process so 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.980
 physiological that practically any 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.010
 mom or future mom can take it out 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.800
 easily as long as the moms 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.460
 there are certain recommendations that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.350
 we are going to give you next first in 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.020
 the foundation by caesarean section may delay 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.699
 the appearance of breast milk if the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.500
 moms do not take into account that 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.440
 circumstance as an interruption 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.540
 Sudden pregnancy that does not allow for 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.610
 that normal physiological mechanisms 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.370
 of milk production as they are in the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.309
 normal delivery are carried out they are going to 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.979
 show a bit how anxious and 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.470
 maybe frustrated by not being able to feed 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.200
 to the baby as soon as possible as they 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.229
 I would like 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.539
 in these conditions it is very important 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.420
 put the baby in direct contact with your 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.219
 mom as soon as possible since this 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.320
 will be the main stimulus for the 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.240
 milk is produced and that even 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.490
 we must be prepared so that 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.520
 appear within the first 72 hours 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.920
 after the cesarean section if the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.219
 mom is calm and is allowed 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.460
 herself a period of recovery 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.960
 for your very body they are going to be 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.159
 determinants for milk to appear 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.860
 in the least expected time and that 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.860
 chances of achieving it are much 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.079
 older adults in general should breast 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.970
 know that since he was born he presents 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.520
 naturally a reflection known as of 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.920
 search with which flips 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.689
 instinctively towards the side where it is 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.049
 receiving the stimulus on his lips 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.090
 not because precisely the hungry 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.520
 Hunger will manifest it with anxiety 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.950
 and with jiang and that's when we should 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.790
 feed 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.590
 that instinctive search reflex is the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.129
 that moms should take advantage of 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.349
 have the baby look for and latch on to the nipple 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.360
 to receive food 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.150
 directly from the mother's womb we must 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.819
 feed it to free demand this is every 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.830
 Once cry or be restless many 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.660
 sometimes stops the misconception that 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.330
 the child has to eat with certain 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.709
 schedule and this is valid for children 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.900
 of low weight or that has been born 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.690
 prematurely however babies 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.430
 born at term of good weight they ask to be 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.560
 fed in general terms in 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.510
 periods ranging from three to four 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.610
 hours in general a child can 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.890
 stay asleep periods up to 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.470
 six hours without there being any 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.599
 affectation in its development a 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.970
 extremely important recommendation in the 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.920
 need to alternate breasts in 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.380
 short periods of time or when the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.110
 mom feel that the baby starts to sound 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.880
 more strongly this tells us that at 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.220
 baby is not getting enough 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.099
 amount of milk naturally when doing 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.050
 more effort can be tired you can 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.030
 falling asleep and obviously not filling 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.040
 going to eat then every hour each 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.020
 hour and a half plus you can 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.700
 hurt mom's nipples and being 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.310
 an important factor for it to crack 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.550
 they ignite and logically produce 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.980
 pain to feed the baby 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.350
 another recommendation on equal 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.710
 importance is to take into account the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.500
 quality and quantity of milk this 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.930
 is the most must be done tests 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.980
 Periodic to know the characteristics 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.140
 of the milk that is producing 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.510
 extract it by artificial means and 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.470
 observe it after placing it in a 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.200
 glass bottle and see if the 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.590
 milk is very diluted or if you have a 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.050
 creamy yellowish consistency in the 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.810
 first case logically the baby is going to 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.910
 ask to eat more often and the 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.100
 mom has to feed him to free 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.550
 demand this is every time the child 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.530
 I requested 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.690
 another very important aspect is 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.459
 consider that in the impossibility of 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.610
 breastfeed the baby directly by 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.290
 of the mom we must use a bottle 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.510
 However, the 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.700
 functioning of them without knowing 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.000
 that the bottles should work with 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.100
 valves which by allowing the passage 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.920
 of air inside the bottles go to 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.350
 prevent negative pressure from building up 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.630
 which in turn make it difficult output 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.500
 milk to the baby's mouth too 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.690
 they will deform the silicone they are 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.030
 constituted and this deformity is 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.270
 misalignment of the baby's mouth and makes 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.550
 of emitting significant amounts of air 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.530
 this results in distension of the 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.720
 gastric chamber and the presence 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.230
 important colic and subsequently 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.730
 of vomiting a bottle to assess about 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.950
 the operation we must observe 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.440
 that bubbles form inside the 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.530
 bottle does not prevent it from forming 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.960
 but nevertheless if these bubbles the 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.380
 we notice that they are formed as inputs of 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.630
 air 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.600
 through the hole where it should come out 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.380
 milk this family is working 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.750
 wrong and we should look for a family more 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.610
 appropriate for the feeding to be 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.730
 carried out in the best way 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.730
 possible
