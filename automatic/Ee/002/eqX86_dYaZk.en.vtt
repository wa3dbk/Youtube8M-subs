00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.250
 hello everybody today's theme is pretty 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.469
 complex is called environmental problems 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.660
 I would not say some details that are 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.600
 very relevant with regard 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.880
 to the issue of environmental problems , which 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.930
 can cause a mental problem 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.300
 an example here organization to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.560
 organization, for example, it causes 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.800
 deforestation 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.360
 the organization causes, for example, 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.239
 landslide 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.809
 it causes urban waste to accumulate 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.329
 it causes a series of situations that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.309
 They will contribute to that nature 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.489
 suffer and consequently we saw 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.800
 also suffer the other detail we have 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.260
 would be industrialization 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.829
 perhaps this must come first from 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.620
 organization because it was in fact the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.460
 modern industry that we have today that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.830
 contribute to the acceleration of 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.380
 organization and at the same time as the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.420
 of the pollutants nature so 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.090
 even because the deserts 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.700
 induced by induction not only 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.369
 gases are solids are liquids are 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.590
 chemical waste and so on 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.900
 we also have the water industry that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.979
 will contribute in some way so that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.200
 a great time kimani a great 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.229
 amount of pollutants in nature 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.210
 good thing is that regardless of whether 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.540
 is an urbanization process if it is a 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.119
 industry process or in rural areas 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.430
 all this is based on the principle of 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.930
 anthropic activity of apple in exchange or 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.930
 be it the man 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.439
 acting in the middle and transforming the medium 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.079
 man causes the environment to transform and 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.079
 at the same time causes waste not everything 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.020
 waste can lead to 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.119
 major environmental problems or small 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.700
 mental problems that bring everything together 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.560
 world in large environmental 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.069
 what we have for example get some 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.770
 agro-industry is not agrochemicals 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.440
 pesticide fertilizers 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.480
 the herbicides are often thrown 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.460
 the soil and this can contribute and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.240
 He helped me with the accumulation of 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.250
 polluting genetic changes so run away 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.150
 industry same thing urbanization a 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.370
 same thing 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.090
 what would be the correct term all this 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.100
 here to try to diminish 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.660
 existing environmental problems 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.400
 nature today the word would be 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.780
 inspection 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.790
 enforcement is flawed worldwide 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.950
 the same with Brazil to 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.900
 inspection is faulty 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.030
 if all environmental laws were 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.990
 really followed to the letter and there were 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.090
 would have had 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.130
 less environmental damage 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.210
 another word that would be interesting 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.080
 here awareness 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:13.170
 but there is no awareness without 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.760
 awareness 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.310
 But how is it very simple? 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.590
 the smoker for example he is concept 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.080
 what smoking and teasing 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:30.240
 but is it sensible to change the 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.430
 smoking stance is the boy who played 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.640
 trash out the window is aware that 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.320
 that trash is one more in the middle of so many 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.570
 that are thrown out the window 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.780
 certain that will cause future problems 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.360
 is environmental litter and waste materials is 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.700
 he is aware of this but will 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.870
 it is sensible to change the posture of 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.209
 throw garbage out the window 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.160
 then the correct terms to try 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.740
 tackle this problem issue 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.900
 environmental protection would be the first 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.450
 we will increase them with this 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.780
 tax capacity that the state has 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.350
 have and awareness associated with 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.760
 awareness of population change 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.239
 without raising awareness of 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.640
 change you want to do differently 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.609
 there will be no improvement in an environment 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.390
 thanks folks like now for reading 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.390
 of the year 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.520
 observe the map of santa catarina and 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.640
 mark the correct proportions 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.870
 are related to the bored region 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.860
 river basins in the goz region 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.650
 general the economy of this region is 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.560
 characterized by the concentration of 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:49.370
 extraction of coal and other minerals 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:52.520
 nonmetallic like kaolin and agila 2 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.370
 the timber sector investments in the 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.080
 pulp and paper industries in 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.810
 apple production and potential 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.180
 tourism of rural farms have 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.370
 to resume the expansion and growth of this 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.760
 region 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.190
 This region of the state of Santa Catarina 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.040
 decade of the 1990s showed a marked 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.169
 job losses in the 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.880
 coal area due to the decision of the 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.330
 government to liberate imports from 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.540
 in this sector 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:26.990
 8 the water deficit of this region 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:30.350
 is mainly caused by extraction 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.140
 and processing of coal but also 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.390
 by the use of pesticides gotow mexico the 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.169
 industrial waste water softening 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.169
 next fans 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.500
 then the staff after reading the 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:51.350
 exercise of the options would be to 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:54.590
 indicated are 11 4 and 8 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.169
 why good this holy region 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.830
 a region of the juice axis that 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.930
 comprises an extractive pole because 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.750
 we extract coal from here 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.840
 We wonder at the kaolin there are using 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:12.110
 favorite there ie mineral resources 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.690
 for the ceramist coal industry 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.410
 power and so on 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.850
 we also have a ceramic pole pole 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.340
 Disposable Plastic Products 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.490
 like small cups 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.900
 party a clothing pole as there are factions 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.800
 and one food pole 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.930
 especially with regard to the 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.479
 rice production 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.280
 of culture in the region and this will 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.560
 with which the environmental problems 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.470
 activities. 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.410
 of industrial ceramics and 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:48.080
 at the same time agricultural activities as 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.039
 for example the evidence of agrotoxic 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.580
 everything else 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:54.830
 why option 2 can not be the correct one 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.900
 because the shaft of the shaft 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.690
 furniture is in the plateau region 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.930
 from the coup 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.850
 homes to the plateau lot ok galera 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.949
 Thanks, it 's with you. 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.750
 continue accessing our crazy site 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:11.060
 To know the dot com 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.660
 and remember the impossible is only one 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.660
 opinion issue
