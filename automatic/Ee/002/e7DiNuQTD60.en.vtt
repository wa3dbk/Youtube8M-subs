we like to turn it over every two or
three<00:01:40.320> minutes<00:01:40.650> we'd<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> lot<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.640> much

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
three minutes we'd a lot to much

three minutes we'd a lot to much
treatment<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> beat<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.020> want<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
treatment on the beat we just want to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.040 
treatment on the beat we just want to
make<00:01:43.440> sure<00:01:43.620> we<00:01:43.740> turn<00:01:43.890> once<00:01:44.900> caramelize<00:01:45.900> the

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
make sure we turn once caramelize the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.080 
make sure we turn once caramelize the
other<00:01:46.170> side<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.740> another<00:01:47.220> two<00:01:47.520> terms<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.970> we

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
other side and another two terms that we

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.200 
other side and another two terms that we
should<00:01:48.300> be<00:01:48.390> done<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.350> proper<00:01:49.380> temperature

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
should be done at the proper temperature

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.430 
should be done at the proper temperature
so<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.510> our<00:01:51.600> lettuce<00:01:51.780> which<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.110> locally

so this is our lettuce which is locally

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.950 
so this is our lettuce which is locally
