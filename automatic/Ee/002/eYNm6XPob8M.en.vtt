00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.550
 the winds that bring moisture from the ocean and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.030
 also known areas of instability 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.080
 per cube high in the atmosphere 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.880
 increased amount of clouds 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.430
 especially on the coastal strip 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.650
 between são paulo rio de janeiro and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.600
 holy spirit but even so this 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.269
 more clouds do not reach the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.160
 cause rain and so this Saturday 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.470
 which predominates is the firm time in the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.660
 part of the south-east, the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.880
 especially in the triangle 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.130
 northern region of the state of são paulo 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.930
 paulo also rio de janeiro spirit 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.239
 holy also with the firm time in the greater 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.250
 part of Saturday something that is quite 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.090
 favorable to outdoor leisure activities 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.399
 free 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.940
 these instabilities of which I spoke 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.350
 with horse and ocean moisture 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.840
 increase only the amount of clouds 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.820
 between the south coast of são paulo and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.100
 also the region of the valley of the river 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 in these areas the large number of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 clouds and those humid winds that blow 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.550
 of the ocean bringing a little more moisture 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.799
 of cold leaves temperatures a little 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.460
 during the day but even 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.049
 just as it does not rain the day will be enough 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.479
 this is repeated on Sunday 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.390
 In fact, Sunday will be the most 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.939
 still firmer than the Sabbath at all 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.170
 southeast states and therefore the sun 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.000
 appears all Sunday 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.049
 favoring the rapid increase of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.340
 with regard to minimum temperatures

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.110

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.640
 with regard to the holy spirit we have 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.799
 also increase the cold producing in the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.619

 most of the south-east on Saturday 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.600
 so cold starts but temperatures 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.390
