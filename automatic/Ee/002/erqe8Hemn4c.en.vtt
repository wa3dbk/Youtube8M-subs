00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
through the main storyline a little bit

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.820

and<00:01:07.950> access<00:01:08.670> base<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.710> so<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.979> far<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and access base here so as far as the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.870 
and access base here so as far as the
fight<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.390> concerned<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.549> quite

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
fight is concerned it can be quite

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.730 
fight is concerned it can be quite
difficult<00:01:15.060> only<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> area<00:01:16.560> that

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
difficult only because the area that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.350 
difficult only because the area that
you're<00:01:16.860> fighting<00:01:17.310> they're<00:01:17.670> fighting<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> in

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you're fighting they're fighting it in

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.480 
you're fighting they're fighting it in
it's<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.140> small<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.040> little<00:01:20.189> runway

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it's so small it's just a little runway

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.999 
it's so small it's just a little runway
as<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.939> see<00:01:21.210> right<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.900> bathed<00:01:22.830> here

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
as you see right here and bathed here

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.770 
as you see right here and bathed here
has<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> couple<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.640> area<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> effect<00:01:24.420> attacks

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
has a couple of area of effect attacks

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.590 
has a couple of area of effect attacks
so<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> gets<00:01:25.619> difficult<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.250> even<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:27.060> even<00:01:27.390> get

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
so it gets difficult to even to even get

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.780 
so it gets difficult to even to even get
your<00:01:27.750> own<00:01:27.810> attacks<00:01:28.290> off<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.860> them<00:01:29.009> or<00:01:29.159> even

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
your own attacks off on them or even

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.240 
your own attacks off on them or even
chain<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> combo<00:01:30.780> together<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.470> actually

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
chain a combo together it's actually

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.190 
chain a combo together it's actually
quite<00:01:32.400> difficult<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> suggest<00:01:34.049> is

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
quite difficult so what I suggest is

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.319 
quite difficult so what I suggest is
always<00:01:34.590> try<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.829> get<00:01:35.009> behind<00:01:35.159> base<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.850> his

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
always try to get behind base here his

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.469 
always try to get behind base here his
tail<00:01:36.689> attack<00:01:37.430> does<00:01:38.430> slightly<00:01:38.759> less<00:01:39.060> damage

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
tail attack does slightly less damage

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.179 
tail attack does slightly less damage
than<00:01:39.509> its<00:01:39.750> frontal<00:01:40.140> attacks<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.009> only

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
than its frontal attacks the only

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.740 
than its frontal attacks the only
problem<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.729> tail<00:01:41.909> attack<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
problem with this tail attack is that it

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
problem with this tail attack is that it
can<00:01:42.840> actually<00:01:42.960> sweep<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.590> off<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.890> ledge<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
can actually sweep you off the ledge and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
can actually sweep you off the ledge and
then<00:01:44.790> he'll<00:01:44.939> go<00:01:45.060> fly<00:01:45.299> around<00:01:45.479> some<00:01:45.930> more<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
then he'll go fly around some more and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.109 
then he'll go fly around some more and
it's<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:46.979> prolong<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> fight<00:01:47.850> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
it's just prolong the fight and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.899 
it's just prolong the fight and
generally<00:01:49.020> frustrate<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.759> his

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
generally frustrate you and this is his

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.520 
generally frustrate you and this is his
other<00:01:51.149> area<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.630> effect<00:01:51.960> attack<00:01:52.049> where<00:01:52.470> he

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
other area of effect attack where he

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.109 
other area of effect attack where he
pretty<00:01:52.710> much<00:01:52.799> lights<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.490> whole<00:01:53.520> landing

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
pretty much lights the whole landing

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.209 
pretty much lights the whole landing
strip<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.600> fire<00:01:54.960> which<00:01:55.470> makes<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.920> even<00:01:56.040> more

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
strip on fire which makes it even more

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.190 
strip on fire which makes it even more
difficult<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.360> get<00:01:57.479> behind<00:01:57.659> them<00:01:57.990> so

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
difficult for you to get behind them so

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.459 
difficult for you to get behind them so
the<00:01:58.680> only<00:01:58.860> thing<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.490> suggest<00:02:00.469> is

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
the only thing I can really suggest is

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.230 
the only thing I can really suggest is
make<00:02:01.799> sure<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.130> stay<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.820> way<00:02:02.969> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
make sure you stay out of the way of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.120 
make sure you stay out of the way of
that<00:02:03.420> fire<00:02:03.630> breath<00:02:03.899> attack<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.649> actually<00:02:04.950> see

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that fire breath attack you actually see

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.859 
that fire breath attack you actually see
me<00:02:05.159> running<00:02:05.610> through<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:06.000> here<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> few<00:02:06.570> times

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
me running through it here a few times

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.589 
me running through it here a few times
and<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:08.129> only<00:02:08.280> way<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.489> really<00:02:08.759> dodge<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.479> is

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
and the only way to really dodge it is

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.540 
and the only way to really dodge it is
use<00:02:10.259> your<00:02:10.470> death<00:02:10.709> grip<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.190> go<00:02:11.280> back

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
use your death grip to go back

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.640 
use your death grip to go back
on<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.850> platform<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.480> used<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.930> access<00:02:13.440> both

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
on the platform you used to access both

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.190 
on the platform you used to access both
here<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.580> wait<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.060> subside<00:02:15.630> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
here and just wait for it to subside the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.900 
here and just wait for it to subside the
only<00:02:16.350> problem<00:02:16.680> with<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.800> again<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.640> BAE

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
only problem with that again is that BAE

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.390 
only problem with that again is that BAE
Thea<00:02:18.150> will<00:02:18.300> start<00:02:18.600> flying<00:02:18.870> around<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.590> it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
Thea will start flying around and it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.310 
Thea will start flying around and it
will<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:20.670> prolong<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> fight<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.110> can

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
will just prolong the fight but you can

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.320 
will just prolong the fight but you can
you<00:02:22.500> know<00:02:22.530> regroup<00:02:23.160> do<00:02:23.790> all<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.120> wonderful

here it'll definitely help and I know
it's<00:03:17.700> tempting<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.239> use<00:03:18.270> chaos<00:03:18.780> born<00:03:19.080> right

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
it's tempting to use chaos born right

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.660 
it's tempting to use chaos born right
away<00:03:19.500> but<00:03:19.560> make<00:03:19.920> sure<00:03:19.950> you're<00:03:20.370> comfortable

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.430 
away but make sure you're comfortable
with<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.450> amount<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.780> health<00:03:21.930> potions<00:03:22.380> you

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
with the amount of health potions you

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.920 
with the amount of health potions you
have<00:03:22.650> before<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.459> use<00:03:23.640> chaos<00:03:24.000> form<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.540> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
have before you use chaos form and the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.510 
have before you use chaos form and the
amount<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.260> health<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.709> boss<00:03:25.920> has<00:03:26.220> because

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
amount of health the boss has because

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.150 
amount of health the boss has because
you<00:03:26.610> have<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.790> take<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.150> into<00:03:27.870> consideration

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
you have to take that into consideration

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.010 
you have to take that into consideration
before<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.430> use<00:03:29.790> your<00:03:30.030> most<00:03:30.180> powerful<00:03:30.420> form

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
before you use your most powerful form

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.010 
before you use your most powerful form

so that's essentially bate there and you

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.390 
so that's essentially bate there and you
actually<00:03:34.170> see<00:03:34.440> me<00:03:34.560> shoot<00:03:34.830> them<00:03:34.950> off<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.250> ledge

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
right there I got pretty lucky and that

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.590
