who's been actually that's exactly

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.220 
who's been actually that's exactly
correct<00:01:56.910> that's<00:01:57.300> exactly<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.870> reason<00:01:58.020> we

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
correct that's exactly the reason we

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.170 
correct that's exactly the reason we
would<00:01:58.470> design<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> particular<00:01:58.950> product<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.700> as

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
would design a particular product is as

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.440 
would design a particular product is as
I<00:02:00.240> say<00:02:00.480> it's<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.630> lightweight

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
I say it's the lightweight

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:10.550 
I say it's the lightweight
