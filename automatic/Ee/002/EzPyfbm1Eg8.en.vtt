the key takeaway driving the Honda Civic

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.179 
the key takeaway driving the Honda Civic
is<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:46.119> there<00:01:46.240> aren't<00:01:46.420> any<00:01:46.540> rough<00:01:46.930> edges<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
is that there aren't any rough edges the

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.859 
is that there aren't any rough edges the
suspension<00:01:48.670> isn't<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.000> softest<00:01:49.509> in<00:01:49.659> class

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
suspension isn't the softest in class

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.719 
suspension isn't the softest in class
but<00:01:50.259> it's<00:01:50.680> certainly<00:01:50.950> refined<00:01:51.310> enough<00:01:51.549> for

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
but it's certainly refined enough for

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.810 
but it's certainly refined enough for
most<00:01:51.820> driving<00:01:52.450> situations<00:01:53.080> add<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.759> a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
most driving situations add to that a

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.090 
most driving situations add to that a
quiet<00:01:55.119> cabin<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:55.810> excellent<00:01:56.799> outward

visibility and what you have is an
