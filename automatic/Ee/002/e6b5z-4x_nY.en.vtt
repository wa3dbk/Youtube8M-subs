some<00:02:10.860> creatures<00:02:11.250> like<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:12.269> creature<00:02:12.540> should

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
some creatures like this creature should

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.059 
some creatures like this creature should
not<00:02:13.019> be<00:02:13.170> six<00:02:13.590> with<00:02:13.860> Dolph<00:02:14.159> it<00:02:14.760> should<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.150> like

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
not be six with Dolph it should be like

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.210 
not be six with Dolph it should be like
four<00:02:17.069> or<00:02:17.640> five<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.819> don't

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
four or five it's just I don't

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.210 
four or five it's just I don't
it's<00:02:22.090> just<00:02:22.390> my<00:02:22.510> opinion<00:02:22.990> because<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.100> not

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
it's just my opinion because it's not

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.890 
it's just my opinion because it's not
like<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.520> can<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:24.880> keep<00:02:25.030> using<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.570> over<00:02:25.690> and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
like you can just keep using it over and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.750 
like you can just keep using it over and
over<00:02:26.050> again<00:02:26.140> like<00:02:26.410> once<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.800> your<00:02:27.520> graveyard

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
over again like once you your graveyard

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.760 
over again like once you your graveyard
is<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> resource<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:28.810> once<00:02:29.080> you're<00:02:29.260> out<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.620> mean

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.710 
is a resource but once you're out I mean
it<00:02:29.920> then<00:02:30.220> now<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.490> have<00:02:30.940> just<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.300> six<00:02:31.570> minute

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720
