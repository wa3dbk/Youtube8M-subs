this reentry mode straight down the
Gundam<00:03:36.700> this<00:03:37.700> line<00:03:37.970> will<00:03:38.240> take<00:03:38.480> this

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:04:01.000 

you<00:03:50.540> have<00:03:50.810> them<00:03:50.990> is<00:03:51.740> we<00:03:52.040> internal

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.140 

and<00:04:02.120> our<00:04:03.530> processor<00:04:04.530> ease<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:05.760> comes<00:04:06.000> with

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
and our processor ease it comes with

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.479 
and our processor ease it comes with
this<00:04:06.330> pink<00:04:07.080> beam<00:04:07.530> theory<00:04:07.800> which<00:04:08.069> is<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.340> wrong

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
this pink beam theory which is the wrong

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.030 
this pink beam theory which is the wrong
color<00:04:10.040> but<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.160> does<00:04:11.370> come<00:04:11.550> out<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:11.910> handle

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
color but it does come out of the handle

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.870 
color but it does come out of the handle
and<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.610> like<00:04:15.139> between<00:04:16.139> our<00:04:16.440> 12<00:04:16.949> 144<00:04:17.609> or

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
and this is like between our 12 144 or
