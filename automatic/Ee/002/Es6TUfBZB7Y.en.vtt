00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.160
 the asus padfone with a f is a 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.750
 tablet 7 inches from asus whose 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.309
 design looks a lot like that of the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.849
 nexus set she has pretty much the same 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.440
 congestion 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.300
 however the start buttons 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.789
 and volumes are on the left side 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.859
 instead of being right there is a camera 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.789
 1 megapixel front and one of 3 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.619
 megapixels in the back 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.300
 there is not much to say about these 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.869
 cameras that only provides pictures 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.450
 and correct videos there is a micro port 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.280
 usb a jack and a microphone in 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.600
 bottom of the device 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.239
 in the back there is a small enclosure 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.350
 down here and a removable part in 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.489
 high once removed what can be a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.809
 not difficult since it is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.030
 necessary to push down and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.219
 upward to remove it will find again 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.789
 slot for a sim card and a card 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.840
 micro sd the tablet to a hull in 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.090
 aluminum that gives a feeling 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.890
 nice solidity but if you 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.180
 use an excuse this you'll 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.149
 approximately the same level of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.950
 comfort the fauna dough works under 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.420
 android I'm eliminating 4.1.2 there is a 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.490
 outdoor mode that greatly increases 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.950
 the brightness of the screen what makes it sound 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.700
 ip sd screen i appreciate easier to 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.700
 see in the light of day 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.700
 asus splendid is an application that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.619
 allows you to adjust the hue the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.439
 saturation and color temperature 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 from the tablet screen it will you 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.140
 also shows how these 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 changes will affect the image before 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.799
 that you only validates them is the games 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.360
 turn fluidly but 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.680
 do not expect to regain the performance 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.490
 of the nexus s now I know that this 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.320
 is not the most important point 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.880
 but the pad fauna is not just 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.369
 a tablet is also a real 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.570
 phone 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.070
 I use a haiti card integer for the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.000
 test and unfortunately I was 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.009
 rather disappointed by the quality of the calls 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.869
 yes it's me wearing a tablet of 7 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.750
 thumbs to the ear to use it as 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.460
 phone I agree it gives a 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.840
 look pretty stupid and unfortunately 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.119
 you will have to buy your own 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.200
 headset because this tablet or 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.350
 phone trick is not provided with the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.700
 fun pad is available in the UK 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.960
 but asus does not plan to take him out 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.550
 in the united states it will cost you $ 2,175 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.630
 if you import it is 178 pounds 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.520
 at this price it's not a bad deal 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.670
 if you plan on using it at once 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.080
 as a tablet and as a phone 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.770
 however, if you use it only 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.480
 as a tablet 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.250
 I suggest you rather the nexus is 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.560
 always faster and always less 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.660
 dear i'm eric franklyn and it was a 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.660
 first glimpse of the zus fauna no soul
