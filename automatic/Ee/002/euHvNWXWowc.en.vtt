00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.269
 from portugal in network 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.040
 the sun after climbing levels 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.770

 how to discard it this is the game more than anything that I'm going to teach you how to fish 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 first we go to this page 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.010
 percent and with all due respect the creator of the game 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.030

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.979
 of these the page to which they can enter and download it 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.520
 here I need to give some recognition to him not be 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.570
 pd bounce 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.859
 here is the page we love direct to the former caracas 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.560
 2 inc 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.490
 I think that will guide everyone we have precocious of this the foundations 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.210
 how to download a file 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.409
 in these servers we do not wait for them to have equity we keep 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.970
 this same we wait for you to spend time 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.000
 we unload 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.830
 per 100 where you prefer opus and I have downloaded 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.980
 This is a page on which 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.690
 lokshiná mind sumire games we understand the game's instructions 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.320
 same is to upload a video 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.629
 so they know 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.810
 this flight, as I said, I have downloaded it, we have it 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.899
 these are the two 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.579
 what does it consist of 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.029
 in which one is the client 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:20.759
 and the other is the base 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.879
 let's say that style you dig that without this one 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.559
 this one does not work 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.559
 percent because 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:30.939
 nor why 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.010
 because this is a game already created from which it was based 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.149
 to be an adult 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:40.230
 in the town that warm style 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.230
 they can not prove it is a clear game single that does not 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.589
 in this period to 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:47.849
 they go between having a time with them 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.809
 we have to install 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.719
 you have to wait for them to load is fast 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.189
 it takes away a lot of time 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.189
 finished 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:04.099
 this was the file this is installed 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.049
 in the folder that you do not have so if they are not going to go down and they are going to 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.249
 install 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.299
 happy to the folder that you defend 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.299
 do not go to the most affected 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.579
 here we can already execute it since we already installed what we wanted 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.209
 I inform min here we are already entering the game 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.049
 l am going to recommend 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.559
 they cover 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.559
 aa control panel 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.979
 fideuá in 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.119
 well in 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.639
 the Catalan club 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.959
 navigate a port 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.959
 put 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:54.239
 and there will be the next port 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.419
 of good and I have open to accept and this is so they can access 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.829
 other intel servers is of some fault 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:02.899
 this flight 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:04.769
 Well that is the game itself 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.229
 I'll show you what nothing else 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.229
 create an account 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:14.129
 they give in creating it 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.370
 new profile 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.949
 in percent they enter 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:19.889
 a man 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.889
 kljestan a password 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.300
 think 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.349
 'Excuse me if I call you 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.349
 since in this created profile 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.300
 here we are already 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.590
 we already have the account created 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.550
 that it's a matter of playing 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.289
 in the other video 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.029
 I'm going to show you how to leave 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.430
 and how they are created because if Eden is a little tedious alive 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.340
 for that reason you avoid not using magicians 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.289
 it's totally keyboard 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:51.300
 whole 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.870
 the little arrow 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.050
 percent 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.240
 some buttons 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.990
 but this is all something quick and simple 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.270
 a game to have fun and pretend 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.469
