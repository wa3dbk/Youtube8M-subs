right<00:02:35.590> I'm<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:37.100> thinking<00:02:37.370> about<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.880> way

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
right I'm just thinking about the way

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:46.440 
right I'm just thinking about the way
things<00:02:38.480> might<00:02:39.080> have<00:02:39.290> been<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:40.190> know

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.290

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
go s / 8g she because we're all both you

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.170 
go s / 8g she because we're all both you
know<00:03:02.590> yeah<00:03:03.100> I'm<00:03:03.400> just<00:03:03.550> tired<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.970> people

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
know yeah I'm just tired of people

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.500 
know yeah I'm just tired of people
turning<00:03:04.830> everything<00:03:05.830> procreational<00:03:06.820> yeah

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
turning everything procreational yeah

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.910 
turning everything procreational yeah
because<00:03:07.660> we're<00:03:07.930> at<00:03:07.990> this<00:03:08.140> crucial<00:03:08.380> juncture

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
because we're at this crucial juncture

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.800 
because we're at this crucial juncture
in<00:03:08.980> evolution<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.640> it's<00:03:09.970> time<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.240> move<00:03:10.450> over

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
in evolution and it's time to move over

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.229 
in evolution and it's time to move over
and<00:03:11.230> it's<00:03:11.470> like<00:03:11.560> before<00:03:11.980> once<00:03:12.430> we<00:03:12.670> had<00:03:12.970> to

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
and it's like before once we had to

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.690 
and it's like before once we had to
overlap<00:03:13.660> biologic<00:03:14.620> reproductive<00:03:15.250> right<00:03:15.520> um

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
overlap biologic reproductive right um

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.080 
overlap biologic reproductive right um
sex<00:03:16.390> with<00:03:16.830> erogenous<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.190> erogenous<00:03:18.820> and

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
sex with erogenous and erogenous and

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.390 
sex with erogenous and erogenous and
everything<00:03:19.450> else<00:03:19.570> but<00:03:19.870> now<00:03:20.080> we<00:03:20.830> don't<00:03:21.010> because

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
everything else but now we don't because

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.490 
everything else but now we don't because
we<00:03:21.610> are<00:03:21.760> established<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:23.080> know<00:03:23.200> go<00:03:23.470> to

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
we are established you know go to

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.140 
we are established you know go to
Beijing<00:03:24.010> during<00:03:24.310> rush<00:03:24.489> hour<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.910> see<00:03:25.000> what

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
Beijing during rush hour and see what

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.850 
Beijing during rush hour and see what
you<00:03:25.269> get<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.690> know<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:25.840> we<00:03:26.080> humans<00:03:26.739> are

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
you get you know that we humans are

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.680 
you get you know that we humans are
established<00:03:27.370> on<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.519> planet<00:03:27.910> so<00:03:28.330> now<00:03:28.480> it's

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
established on the planet so now it's

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.979 
established on the planet so now it's
time<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:30.040> move<00:03:30.370> out<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:30.790> redefine<00:03:31.750> the

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
time to move out and redefine the

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.259 
time to move out and redefine the
nuclear<00:03:32.320> family<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.769> redefine<00:03:33.370> how<00:03:33.910> we<00:03:33.970> get

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
nuclear family and redefine how we get

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.040 
nuclear family and redefine how we get
sexual<00:03:34.780> erogenous<00:03:36.150> expand<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.420> nuclear

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
sexual erogenous expand the nuclear

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.460 
sexual erogenous expand the nuclear
family<00:03:38.470> so<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.730> radiates<00:03:40.720> do<00:03:41.200> you<00:03:41.290> like

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
family so that it radiates do you like

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.460 
family so that it radiates do you like
that<00:03:41.680> nuclear<00:03:42.370> radiation<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.260> like

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
that nuclear radiation so that it like

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.060 
that nuclear radiation so that it like
actually<00:03:45.010> covers<00:03:45.730> everybody<00:03:46.420> is<00:03:46.830> part<00:03:47.830> of<00:03:47.950> the

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
actually covers everybody is part of the

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.120 
actually covers everybody is part of the
big<00:03:48.280> tent<00:03:48.640> it's<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.870> big<00:03:50.110> big-ass<00:03:50.470> tent

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
big tent it's the big big-ass tent

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.220 
big tent it's the big big-ass tent
that's<00:03:51.790> where<00:03:52.090> we're<00:03:52.360> mentally<00:03:52.810> going<00:03:52.989> I

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
that's where we're mentally going I

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.050 
that's where we're mentally going I
think<00:03:53.500> well<00:03:53.860> yeah<00:03:54.070> because<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.640> think<00:03:54.700> we<00:03:54.940> have

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
think well yeah because I think we have

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.229 
think well yeah because I think we have
to<00:03:55.209> realize<00:03:55.570> that<00:03:55.840> we<00:03:56.380> live<00:03:56.680> within<00:03:57.459> the

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
to realize that we live within the

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:06.420 
to realize that we live within the
biosphere<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.079> not<00:03:59.260> on

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.619 

I<00:04:08.189> wish<00:04:09.189> you<00:04:09.370> would<00:04:09.549> invent<00:04:09.939> some<00:04:10.239> kind<00:04:10.269> of

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
I wish you would invent some kind of

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.710 
I wish you would invent some kind of
cell<00:04:10.930> or<00:04:11.260> gene<00:04:11.530> or<00:04:11.680> whatever<00:04:11.950> it<00:04:12.129> is<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:12.579> I<00:04:13.209> can

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
cell or gene or whatever it is so I can

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.110 
cell or gene or whatever it is so I can
like<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.260> we<00:04:14.409> can<00:04:14.590> like<00:04:14.769> put<00:04:14.799> it<00:04:15.189> in<00:04:15.340> people<00:04:15.909> I

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
like so we can like put it in people I

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.509 
like so we can like put it in people I
think<00:04:16.449> it's<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.780> block<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.440> lower<00:04:17.650> chakras<00:04:18.310> so

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
think it's to block the lower chakras so

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.729 
think it's to block the lower chakras so
they<00:04:18.669> don't<00:04:18.910> just<00:04:19.509> whore<00:04:19.930> their<00:04:20.199> fucking<00:04:20.560> life

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
they don't just whore their fucking life

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.800 
they don't just whore their fucking life
from<00:04:20.979> their<00:04:21.130> power<00:04:21.310> away<00:04:21.579> I<00:04:22.000> think<00:04:22.389> we<00:04:22.630> got<00:04:22.780> to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
from their power away I think we got to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.779 
from their power away I think we got to
block<00:04:23.110> that<00:04:23.410> lower<00:04:23.590> chakra<00:04:24.220> with<00:04:24.400> us<00:04:24.580> some

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
block that lower chakra with us some

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.350 
block that lower chakra with us some
sort<00:04:25.090> of<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.330> chip<00:04:26.020> what<00:04:26.590> do<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.770> say<00:04:27.039> to<00:04:27.100> that<00:04:28.740> I

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
sort of a chip what do you say to that I

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.680 
sort of a chip what do you say to that I
say<00:04:31.360> that<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:32.639> would<00:04:33.639> not<00:04:33.759> want<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.150> be<00:04:34.240> on<00:04:34.509> that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
say that I would not want to be on that

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.520 
say that I would not want to be on that
research<00:04:35.110> project<00:04:35.680> because<00:04:36.610> I<00:04:37.210> just<00:04:38.080> because

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
research project because I just because

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.930 
research project because I just because
you<00:04:38.650> know<00:04:38.770> why<00:04:38.979> but<00:04:39.220> you<00:04:39.370> know<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.669> would<00:04:39.820> be

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
you know why but you know it would be

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.240 
you know why but you know it would be
the<00:04:40.060> right<00:04:40.270> thing<00:04:40.350> well<00:04:41.350> I<00:04:41.380> mean<00:04:41.770> I<00:04:41.830> think<00:04:41.949> that

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
the right thing well I mean I think that

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.100 
the right thing well I mean I think that
we<00:04:42.550> need<00:04:42.729> to<00:04:42.760> get<00:04:42.970> to<00:04:43.090> some<00:04:43.270> higher<00:04:43.449> ground
