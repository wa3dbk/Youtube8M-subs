00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:06.859
 but first let's have a house 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:13.190
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:17.290
 choose Miss Lopez to put her 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.290
 then we are going to mark here 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:29.910
 with a bit of tape Mr. Sergio me 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.040
 the short the assets please thank you and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.920
 we also mark the other side 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.300
 sites for example here you have to leave it 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.300
 enough for then you can do 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.120
 is already marked 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.950
 What are you doing? Ricardo 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.390
 super because its video facility already 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.680
 you do not like that you go hundreds of videos 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.730
 does not respect the tips I also know in 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.560
 zintan a bit so you do not 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.180
 unravel while knotting a 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.270
 little alone you do not have to spend a lot of people 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.670
 then you can be removed is 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.740
 Zintan is the same sense for where 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.740
 they turn if you do not learn 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.759
 in the same sense if it's not sport 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.470
 two are four 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.780
 d 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.350
 3 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.350
 Y 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.909
 and 4 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.680
 and then we are going to remove them is to do 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.370
 the world and then we remove 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.370
 and 4 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.490
 well we already have the new preparation with 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.560
 its opening which has chosen the 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.560
 Miss Laura to put the hand said 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.940
 and then now we have to open the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.540
 Cape threads as far as we have chosen 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.540
 without it being too bad 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.700
 they're open, that's why we've put the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.170
 tape so they do not get rid of that and 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.260
 now we choose for one we start to 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.780
 put them this is very important 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.170
 the gauze must be right 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.569
 have to give right and we start 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.569
 policy closest to the end 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.709
 we started with this sergio I remove the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.940
 head here for this one that is the most 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.070
 next 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.170
 we started with this and this is what 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:46.110
 important attentive we open 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.120
 a gap because we want to put this 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.000
 and from now on the gaza is made 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.990
 always following following we have gotten 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.480
 the market 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:00.170
 the next corporal is seen by the following 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.170
 hollow below 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.690
 and so it is always to continue it except the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.690
 next out is this 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.250
 do not 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.290
 and we're going to finish the first round on 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.600
 next one gets by the last one that 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.940
 remains 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.170
 If you suspect that something is wrong to take 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.870
 back because if it does not go bad 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.780
 good so that the race was nice there 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.819
 that tense just enough for it to be 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.030
 nice then the view will tell us 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.270
 the view will tell us 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.510
 so that it is pretty nice by 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.310
 here is also perfect for you too 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.220
 is how the prefect comes in here 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:50.580
 also and we squeeze a little bit and that 's it 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.410
 there are sailors who call it oxide if 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.330
 it's fine you have to go out a line towards 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.910
 side does each side as the points 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.280
 cardinal then we can choose 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.080
 any of them and we repeat again 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.080
 the operation you see how the gauze is 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.240
 now we repeat the operation we started 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.670
 with any one and we had it 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.950
 on top of one and inside 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.550
 and we continue for the next 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.550
 above 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.150
 yes 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.740
 and now we do the last one we went through 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.050
 over 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.289
 two go with three times we do 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.289
 this 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:43.259
 no need to do 4 5 and 6-4 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.360
 the third I take one any 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.750
 I would have stayed at four points 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.419
 cardinals by any of them with 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.460
 great passed it over the one that has 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.650
 right next to and below the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.650
 next this side 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:12.889
 which has below the next 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.280
 the next job the next and the 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.670
 last 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.780
 he passed them over the nearest and 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.840
 under the next one I have finished 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.760
 now it is important to tighten the 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.560
 the ends that are thought a little more 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.880
 some more come out and he think that material 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.880
 in this one has left 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.500
 Well, it's done 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:57.270
 this is the soil 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.520
 artistically 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.520
 good that turns it this floor is very well 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.879
 and when turning with the hand the tour sews 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.879
 better the gaza 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.740
 this is all very good 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.740
 this morning
