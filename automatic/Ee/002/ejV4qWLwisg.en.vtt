00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
you can see what the color actually

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:13.090

looks<00:04:58.190> like<00:04:58.370> on<00:04:58.580> my<00:04:58.610> lips<00:04:58.970> with<00:04:59.120> nothing<00:04:59.539> on<00:04:59.690> it

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.950 

and<00:05:13.640> somehow<00:05:15.430> yeah<00:05:16.430> he's<00:05:16.760> coming<00:05:17.120> off<00:05:17.270> just<00:05:17.690> as

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
and somehow yeah he's coming off just as

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.840 
and somehow yeah he's coming off just as
bright<00:05:18.320> as<00:05:18.500> it<00:05:18.680> is<00:05:21.010> and<00:05:22.010> I<00:05:22.100> think<00:05:22.340> that<00:05:22.460> this<00:05:22.580> is

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
bright as it is and I think that this is

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.330 
bright as it is and I think that this is
too<00:05:23.300> bright<00:05:24.700> for<00:05:25.700> me<00:05:26.560> that<00:05:27.560> is<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.860> color<00:05:28.100> with

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
too bright for me that is the color with

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.790 
too bright for me that is the color with
nothing<00:05:29.120> no<00:05:29.390> liner<00:05:29.750> no<00:05:30.440> gloss<00:05:30.740> nothing<00:05:32.500> so<00:05:33.500> now

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
nothing no liner no gloss nothing so now

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.330 
nothing no liner no gloss nothing so now
I<00:05:34.130> am<00:05:34.610> going<00:05:35.000> to<00:05:35.300> take<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.170> current<00:05:36.530> liner<00:05:36.830> and

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
I am going to take the current liner and

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:46.189 
I am going to take the current liner and
just<00:05:37.430> line<00:05:37.850> my<00:05:38.060> lips<00:05:38.360> with<00:05:38.630> it

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.260 

and<00:05:46.800> this<00:05:46.979> will<00:05:47.159> give<00:05:47.340> it<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.520> somewhat<00:05:48.060> of<00:05:48.180> a

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
and this will give it a somewhat of a

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.649 
and this will give it a somewhat of a
purple<00:05:49.819> appearance<00:05:50.819> rather<00:05:51.719> than<00:05:52.020> that<00:05:52.229> a

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
purple appearance rather than that a

00:05:53.659 --> 00:06:04.740 
purple appearance rather than that a
bright<00:05:54.659> coral<00:05:55.169> pink<00:05:55.499> color

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.560 

and<00:06:05.320> I'm<00:06:05.470> using<00:06:05.800> my<00:06:06.040> camera<00:06:06.340> as<00:06:06.610> a<00:06:06.640> mirror<00:06:06.820> why

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
and I'm using my camera as a mirror why

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:15.390 
and I'm using my camera as a mirror why
is<00:06:07.630> this<00:06:07.960> a<00:06:09.270> little<00:06:10.270> awkward<00:06:10.960> for<00:06:11.260> me<00:06:14.400> now

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
is this a little awkward for me now

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:29.050 
is this a little awkward for me now
blend<00:06:15.970> up

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.480 

I'm<00:06:29.630> trying<00:06:29.990> to<00:06:30.050> get<00:06:30.290> rid<00:06:30.500> of<00:06:30.620> the<00:06:30.770> obvious

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
I'm trying to get rid of the obvious

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:38.410 
I'm trying to get rid of the obvious
lying<00:06:31.910> on<00:06:32.180> my<00:06:32.330> lip<00:06:34.690> but<00:06:35.690> um<00:06:35.930> I<00:06:37.150> still<00:06:38.150> want<00:06:38.360> to

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
lying on my lip but um I still want to

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.400 
lying on my lip but um I still want to
look<00:06:38.600> the<00:06:39.260> colors<00:06:39.560> I<00:06:39.680> sort<00:06:39.890> of<00:06:39.950> look<00:06:41.410> graduated

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
look the colors I sort of look graduated

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.650 
look the colors I sort of look graduated
which<00:06:42.560> I<00:06:42.770> guess<00:06:43.100> I<00:06:43.280> achieved<00:06:43.940> for<00:06:44.360> the<00:06:44.450> most

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.660 
which I guess I achieved for the most

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.410 
which I guess I achieved for the most
part<00:06:45.310> but<00:06:46.310> this<00:06:46.490> is<00:06:46.670> what<00:06:46.820> the<00:06:46.910> color<00:06:47.090> looks

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
part but this is what the color looks

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.740 
part but this is what the color looks
like<00:06:47.630> now<00:06:48.490> not<00:06:49.490> quite<00:06:49.670> as<00:06:49.970> bright<00:06:50.330> a<00:06:50.390> little

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
like now not quite as bright a little

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.530 
like now not quite as bright a little
bit<00:06:50.900> more<00:06:51.110> wearable<00:06:52.000> and<00:06:53.000> I'm<00:06:53.150> going<00:06:53.300> to<00:06:53.330> put<00:06:53.510> a
