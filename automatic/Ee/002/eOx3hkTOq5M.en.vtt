00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
going to make sure save is checked

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.670 
going to make sure save is checked
obviously<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.630> then<00:02:13.660> you're<00:02:14.380> going<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.530> go<00:02:14.590> to

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
files for some reason I don't know why

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.550 
files for some reason I don't know why
I'm<00:02:33.730> going<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.090> go<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.210> options<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.020> make<00:02:35.500> sure

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
I'm going to go to options and make sure

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.890 
I'm going to go to options and make sure
that<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.310> on<00:02:36.490> Intel<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.360> why<00:02:37.990> you<00:02:38.050> v<00:02:38.980> codec

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
that it is on Intel I why you v codec

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.410 
that it is on Intel I why you v codec
now<00:02:40.900> i'm<00:02:41.800> pretty<00:02:42.250> sure<00:02:42.460> you'll<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:43.150> that

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
now i'm pretty sure you'll have that

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.650 
now i'm pretty sure you'll have that
because<00:02:43.840> i<00:02:44.170> did<00:02:44.470> not<00:02:44.500> install<00:02:45.070> any<00:02:45.310> codecs<00:02:46.000> on

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
because i did not install any codecs on

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.380 
because i did not install any codecs on
this<00:02:47.290> computer<00:02:47.470> yet<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:50.220> I've<00:02:51.220> never<00:02:51.880> even

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
texts I have a light I have shadowing so

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.949 
texts I have a light I have shadowing so
I<00:03:51.489> mean<00:03:51.790> if<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:51.970> don't<00:03:52.120> have<00:03:52.239> anything<00:03:52.570> and

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
I mean if you don't have anything and

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.199 
I mean if you don't have anything and
use<00:03:53.080> a<00:03:53.110> 3d<00:03:53.590> text<00:03:54.040> in<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.220> floor<00:03:54.580> then<00:03:54.970> you're

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
use a 3d text in a floor then you're

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.400 
use a 3d text in a floor then you're
going<00:03:55.330> to<00:03:55.390> be<00:03:55.510> fine<00:03:55.690> it's<00:03:55.989> going<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.230> render

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
going to be fine it's going to render

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.860 
going to be fine it's going to render
pretty<00:03:56.709> quickly<00:03:56.950> but<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:57.580> time<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.450> make<00:03:58.630> mine<00:03:58.840> a

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
pretty quickly but I time to make mine a

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.350 
pretty quickly but I time to make mine a
little<00:03:59.110> more<00:03:59.440> so<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.610> looks<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:01.060> little

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
little more so that it looks a little

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.449 
little more so that it looks a little
cooler<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:02.050> that's<00:04:02.590> why<00:04:02.770> it<00:04:02.830> takes<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:03.250> long

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
cooler and that's why it takes so long

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.699 
cooler and that's why it takes so long
