00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:03.310
 so orient Hermann 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.260
 that Wacker set off such waiver only for morning Marburg 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.149
 I've still seen this here 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:14.619
 Cantu sang the stand 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.619
 His Frisbee from HUS 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.659
 it would be so huge but also completely without drive Gran Turismo 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.710
 by hand 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.710
 to turn here and it turns well 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.620
 a fire already at this time 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.860
 and that works too 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 Sarah Latif Schwaiger were 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.370
 I had no motivation for the Munich also to work with counterweight 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.239
 it's the well-staffed studio it is 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.140
 neither heavier 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.500
 the basic structure I ask you Mar 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.920
 we can called the data based 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.900
 without using NXT engines I think he has the drive over 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.990
 Cross member edge passed 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.030
 other eyes or burscheid this i see in o-ton and then somehow 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.480
 taken over this driving 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.890
 curly 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.890
 Gondry and that there was problem 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.690
 I can not do that but only a new engine area 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.890
 Geseke 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.930
 It is a 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930
 giant machine 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.160
 who over both ears
