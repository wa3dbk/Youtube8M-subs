00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
you to control the status whether it's

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.950 
you to control the status whether it's
on<00:01:11.380> or<00:01:11.590> off<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:12.009> can<00:01:12.190> also<00:01:12.310> schedule<00:01:12.960> whenever

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
on or off you can also schedule whenever

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.840 
on or off you can also schedule whenever
you<00:01:14.050> want<00:01:14.259> these<00:01:14.440> devices<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.130> turn<00:01:15.310> on<00:01:15.580> or<00:01:15.729> off

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
you want these devices to turn on or off

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.170 
you want these devices to turn on or off
you<00:01:16.240> can<00:01:16.390> also<00:01:16.540> have<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.500> one<00:01:18.220> all<00:01:18.490> kill<00:01:18.910> switch

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
you can also have a one all kill switch

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.270 
you can also have a one all kill switch
and<00:01:19.390> turns<00:01:19.720> either<00:01:20.080> everything<00:01:20.590> on<00:01:20.890> or

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
and turns either everything on or

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.969 
and turns either everything on or
everything<00:01:21.670> off<00:01:22.060> all<00:01:22.330> at<00:01:22.600> once<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.710> last

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
everything off all at once and the last

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.410 
everything off all at once and the last
one<00:01:24.280> actually<00:01:24.700> probably<00:01:25.149> the<00:01:25.240> only

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
one actually probably the only

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.080 
one actually probably the only
thermostat<00:01:26.319> related<00:01:26.890> homekit<00:01:27.250> device<00:01:27.550> is<00:01:27.819> the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
thermostat related homekit device is the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.139 
thermostat related homekit device is the
Eco<00:01:28.479> v3<00:01:29.110> which<00:01:29.649> is<00:01:29.830> actually<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.250> smarter<00:01:30.940> Wi-Fi

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
Eco v3 which is actually a smarter Wi-Fi

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.960 
Eco v3 which is actually a smarter Wi-Fi
powered<00:01:31.899> thermostat<00:01:32.590> with<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.160> remote<00:01:33.520> sensor

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
powered thermostat with a remote sensor

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.080 
powered thermostat with a remote sensor
so<00:01:34.240> for<00:01:34.530> $229<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:36.009> can<00:01:36.160> actually<00:01:36.580> simply

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
so for $229 you can actually simply

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.660 
so for $229 you can actually simply
replace<00:01:37.869> your<00:01:38.110> existing<00:01:38.229> thermostat<00:01:39.039> and<00:01:39.250> it

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
replace your existing thermostat and it

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.180 
replace your existing thermostat and it
can<00:01:39.880> also<00:01:40.090> be<00:01:40.240> completely<00:01:40.840> controlled<00:01:41.319> inside

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
can also be completely controlled inside

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.910 
can also be completely controlled inside
a<00:01:42.520> home<00:01:42.880> kit<00:01:43.149> it's<00:01:43.690> similar<00:01:43.959> to<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.530> nest

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
a home kit it's similar to the nest

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.800 
a home kit it's similar to the nest
except<00:01:45.340> nest<00:01:45.700> does<00:01:45.910> not<00:01:46.090> work<00:01:46.240> with<00:01:46.420> home<00:01:46.600> kit

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
except nest does not work with home kit

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.960 
except nest does not work with home kit
yet<00:01:46.959> so<00:01:47.560> hopefully<00:01:48.039> this<00:01:48.220> will<00:01:48.369> come<00:01:48.610> out<00:01:48.759> and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
yet so hopefully this will come out and

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.469 
yet so hopefully this will come out and
support<00:01:49.929> home<00:01:50.110> kit<00:01:50.440> have<00:01:50.679> an<00:01:50.800> advantage<00:01:51.069> and
