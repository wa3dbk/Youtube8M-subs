00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.860
 first time I do something like that ever 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.390
 after this came out in the 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.190
 videogame the first is that the map 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.230
 I thought like father makes a map 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.970
 decorative just like all games 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.320
 that they always put a map for you 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.080
 locals on your wall or whatever you want 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.920
 but I never expected to meet this 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.540

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.069
 around I do not know very well what's going on with 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.260
 all this but it is something entertaining and 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.110
 curious and at the same time a bit creepy 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.580

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.819
