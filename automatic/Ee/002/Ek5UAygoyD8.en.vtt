00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.839 
address an issue that I've noticed
involving<00:00:13.530> intersectionality<00:00:14.490> on<00:00:14.670> this

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
involving intersectionality on this

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.480 
involving intersectionality on this
channel<00:00:15.260> obviously<00:00:16.260> not<00:00:16.619> every<00:00:17.070> video<00:00:17.250> I've

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490

made<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:18.029> perfect<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.990> would<00:00:19.109> say<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:20.039> none<00:00:20.490> of

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
made is perfect I would say that none of

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.880 
made is perfect I would say that none of
them<00:00:20.789> are<00:00:20.910> perfect<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.539> regard<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.560> it's

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
them are perfect in that regard but it's

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.160 
them are perfect in that regard but it's
something<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.519> every<00:00:23.939> week<00:00:24.119> I'm<00:00:24.420> excited<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170

week<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.430> doesn't<00:00:36.149> always<00:00:36.329> make<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.260> most

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
week it doesn't always make for the most

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.740 
week it doesn't always make for the most
consistent<00:00:38.160> video<00:00:38.430> topics<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.329> I've<00:00:39.540> noticed

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
consistent video topics and I've noticed

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.450 
consistent video topics and I've noticed
that<00:00:40.079> even<00:00:40.559> though<00:00:40.649> I've<00:00:40.770> talked<00:00:40.980> about<00:00:41.129> race

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
that even though I've talked about race

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.670 
that even though I've talked about race
in<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:42.030> couple<00:00:42.329> videos<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:43.020> haven't<00:00:43.379> really

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
in a couple videos I haven't really

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.529 
in a couple videos I haven't really
focused<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> way<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
focused on it in the way that it

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.360 
focused on it in the way that it
deserves<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.170> focused<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.739> also<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
deserves to be focused on also I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.840 
deserves to be focused on also I
realized<00:00:47.789> by<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:48.809> focusing<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.770> race<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.460> kind

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
realized by not focusing on race I kind

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.700 
realized by not focusing on race I kind
of<00:00:50.910> become<00:00:51.210> part<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> problem<00:00:51.840> third<00:00:52.500> wave

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
of become part of the problem third wave

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.580 
of become part of the problem third wave
feminism<00:00:53.100> kind<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> prides<00:00:53.760> itself<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.420> being

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
feminism kind of prides itself on being

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.900 
feminism kind of prides itself on being
intersectional<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.770> ways<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.309> previous

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
intersectional in ways that previous

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.020 
intersectional in ways that previous
waves<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.410> much<00:00:58.649> been<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.850> also

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
waves have it so much been but it's also

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.090 
waves have it so much been but it's also
really<00:01:00.449> easy<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.050> fall<00:01:01.199> into<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> trap<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
really easy to fall into the trap of

really easy to fall into the trap of
white<00:01:02.640> feminism<00:01:03.090> which<00:01:03.750> disclaimer<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.830> not

feminism practiced by white people but a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.100 
feminism practiced by white people but a
type<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> feminism<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.150> only<00:01:09.869> really

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
type of feminism that only really

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.340 
type of feminism that only really
focuses<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.369> needs<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:12.030> straight<00:01:12.900> whites

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
if able-bodied women anyway my point

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.010 
if able-bodied women anyway my point
being<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> lot<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.240> video<00:01:18.570> topics

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
being that I have a lot of video topics

being that I have a lot of video topics
plan<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.920> address<00:01:20.430> these<00:01:20.880> issues<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.720> not

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
plan to address these issues of not

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.380 
plan to address these issues of not
talking<00:01:22.380> about<00:01:22.470> race<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.820> racial<00:01:24.150> identity

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
talking about race and racial identity

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.440 
talking about race and racial identity
and<00:01:25.110> racism<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.890> much<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:27.060> should<00:01:27.090> be

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and racism as much as it should be

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.660 
and racism as much as it should be
because<00:01:27.869> apparently<00:01:28.560> even<00:01:28.860> women<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.460> color

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
because apparently even women of color

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.640 
because apparently even women of color
can<00:01:30.030> fall<00:01:30.270> into<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> trap<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.930> white<00:01:31.259> feminism

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650

owns<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.600> Japanese<00:02:32.020> restaurant<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:33.040> my<00:02:33.280> only

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
owns a Japanese restaurant so my only

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.640 
owns a Japanese restaurant so my only
real<00:02:33.670> connection<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:35.080> through<00:02:35.410> food

growing up being mixed-race I think is

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.950 
growing up being mixed-race I think is
confusing<00:02:39.100> for<00:02:39.340> most<00:02:40.060> people<00:02:40.570> the
