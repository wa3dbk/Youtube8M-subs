00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
there's a little pin in here which just

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.649 
there's a little pin in here which just
pops<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.360> pull<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.229> out<00:01:50.119> loosens<00:01:51.119> all<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.450> up

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
pops I pull this out loosens all that up

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.080 
pops I pull this out loosens all that up
