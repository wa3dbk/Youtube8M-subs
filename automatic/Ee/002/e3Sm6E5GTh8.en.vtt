00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
thing that we're going to do is fold our

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.730 
thing that we're going to do is fold our
fabric<00:01:10.420> in<00:01:10.570> half<00:01:10.810> and<00:01:11.200> make<00:01:11.409> sure<00:01:11.530> that<00:01:11.620> it

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
fabric in half and make sure that it

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.620 
fabric in half and make sure that it
covers<00:01:12.010> our<00:01:12.130> pillow<00:01:12.370> and<00:01:12.700> then<00:01:13.180> we're<00:01:13.450> going

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
covers our pillow and then we're going

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.120 
covers our pillow and then we're going
to<00:01:13.690> measure<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.140> fluffiness<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.950> pillow

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
to measure the fluffiness of the pillow

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.220 
to measure the fluffiness of the pillow
because<00:01:15.280> there<00:01:16.270> are<00:01:16.390> different<00:01:16.750> types<00:01:16.960> of

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
because there are different types of

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.810 
because there are different types of
pillows<00:01:17.560> out<00:01:17.710> there<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.160> some<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.550> them<00:01:18.730> are

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
pillows out there and some of them are

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.370 
pillows out there and some of them are
fluffier<00:01:19.240> than<00:01:19.390> other<00:01:19.570> ones<00:01:19.840> we<00:01:20.020> just<00:01:20.050> want<00:01:20.320> to

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
fluffier than other ones we just want to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.510 
fluffier than other ones we just want to
make<00:01:20.470> sure<00:01:20.500> that<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.830> fits<00:01:21.010> inside<00:01:21.160> of<00:01:21.310> our

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
make sure that it fits inside of our

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.980 
make sure that it fits inside of our
fabric<00:01:21.910> and<00:01:22.030> then<00:01:22.510> we're<00:01:22.600> going<00:01:22.750> to<00:01:22.780> measure

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
fabric and then we're going to measure

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.430 
fabric and then we're going to measure
that<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.560> Mark<00:01:24.550> it<00:01:24.700> down<00:01:24.970> so<00:01:25.810> we<00:01:25.930> know<00:01:26.080> how<00:01:26.230> big

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
that and Mark it down so we know how big

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:38.730 
that and Mark it down so we know how big
it<00:01:26.560> has<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:26.860> be

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.810 

so<00:01:39.740> once<00:01:39.920> we're<00:01:40.100> done<00:01:40.220> with<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.490> we're<00:01:40.670> just

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
so once we're done with that we're just

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.360 
so once we're done with that we're just
going<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.090> cut<00:01:41.390> out<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.900> axis<00:01:42.290> fabric<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:43.070> is

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
going to cut out the axis fabric that is

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:53.280 
going to cut out the axis fabric that is
not<00:01:43.550> needed

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.270 

and<00:01:54.290> then<00:01:54.470> we're<00:01:54.560> going<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.860> put<00:01:54.979> our<00:01:55.070> pillow

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
and then we're going to put our pillow

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.280 
and then we're going to put our pillow
back<00:01:55.520> inside<00:01:55.850> of<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.030> fabric<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:57.110> want

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
back inside of the fabric and you want

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.719 
back inside of the fabric and you want
to<00:01:57.380> mark<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.680> what<00:01:57.860> we're<00:01:58.010> going<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.280> sew<00:01:58.549> it

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
to mark it what we're going to sew it

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.790 
to mark it what we're going to sew it
