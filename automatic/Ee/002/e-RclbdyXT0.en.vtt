and it hadn't been commercialized yet
and<00:03:22.210> they<00:03:22.270> found<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.690> way<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:23.610> not<00:03:24.610> just<00:03:24.670> you

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
and they found a way to not just you

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.800 
and they found a way to not just you
know<00:03:25.780> find<00:03:26.740> its<00:03:26.950> way<00:03:27.160> but<00:03:27.460> money<00:03:28.090> finds<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.660> way

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
know find its way but money finds a way

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.690 
know find its way but money finds a way
to<00:03:28.840> make<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.380> park<00:03:29.590> reopen<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.400> we<00:03:30.520> thought

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
to make the park reopen and we thought

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.550 
to make the park reopen and we thought
maybe<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.600> know<00:03:31.720> we<00:03:31.870> did<00:03:32.050> see<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.260> they<00:03:32.500> were

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
maybe you know we did see that they were

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.920 
maybe you know we did see that they were
genetically<00:03:33.430> altering<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.210> dinosaurs<00:03:34.720> to

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
genetically altering the dinosaurs to

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.320 
genetically altering the dinosaurs to
create<00:03:35.230> indominus<00:03:35.860> rex<00:03:35.950> among<00:03:36.550> maybe<00:03:36.850> others

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
create indominus rex among maybe others

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.720 
create indominus rex among maybe others
and<00:03:37.930> we<00:03:38.050> not<00:03:38.230> perhaps<00:03:38.710> maybe<00:03:39.610> the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
and we not perhaps maybe the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.880 
and we not perhaps maybe the
velociraptors<00:03:40.660> had<00:03:40.900> some<00:03:41.200> engineering<00:03:41.590> done

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
velociraptors had some engineering done

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.410 
velociraptors had some engineering done
to<00:03:42.040> them<00:03:42.160> after<00:03:42.550> learning<00:03:42.760> what<00:03:43.030> happened<00:03:43.360> in

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
to them after learning what happened in

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.380 
to them after learning what happened in
the<00:03:43.510> kitchen<00:03:43.660> last<00:03:44.140> time<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.830> mean<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.670> was

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
the kitchen last time I mean I was

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
expecting them honestly to be doing I I

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.620 
expecting them honestly to be doing I I
was<00:03:48.400> expecting<00:03:48.880> them<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.180> have<00:03:49.300> been<00:03:49.510> the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
was expecting them to have been the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.480 
was expecting them to have been the
architects<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.440> park<00:03:50.710> in<00:03:50.980> this<00:03:51.190> movie

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
architects of the park in this movie

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.310 
architects of the park in this movie
because<00:03:51.670> they<00:03:51.910> get<00:03:52.030> were<00:03:52.150> smarter<00:03:52.600> they<00:03:53.170> got

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
because they get were smarter they got

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.170 
because they get were smarter they got
smarter<00:03:53.710> every<00:03:54.010> film<00:03:54.250> I'm<00:03:54.520> pretty<00:03:54.880> sure<00:03:55.060> they

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.450 
smarter every film I'm pretty sure they
know<00:03:55.300> trig<00:03:55.630> now<00:03:56.170> they're<00:03:56.500> like<00:03:56.650> trigonometry

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
know trig now they're like trigonometry

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.420 
know trig now they're like trigonometry
and<00:03:58.170> architecture<00:03:59.170> rocket<00:03:59.800> science<00:04:00.190> I'm

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
and architecture rocket science I'm

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.980 
and architecture rocket science I'm
pretty<00:04:00.670> sure<00:04:00.790> they<00:04:00.910> lunch<00:04:01.150> help<00:04:01.390> launch<00:04:01.630> smash

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
pretty sure they lunch help launch smash

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.250 
pretty sure they lunch help launch smash
