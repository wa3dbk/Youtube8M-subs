00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:31.809 
hard to say goodbye after a while but we

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.170 
hard to say goodbye after a while but we
go<00:00:32.079> into<00:00:32.259> it<00:00:32.380> knowing<00:00:32.619> what<00:00:32.980> we're<00:00:33.130> doing<00:00:33.460> so

there<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:36.730> this<00:00:36.850> feeling<00:00:37.089> of<00:00:37.300> loss<00:00:37.510> but<00:00:37.899> then

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
there is this feeling of loss but then

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.389 
there is this feeling of loss but then
we<00:00:38.679> saw<00:00:38.890> her<00:00:39.100> again<00:00:39.219> with<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.739> blind<00:00:41.980> person

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.759 
we saw her again with the blind person
and<00:00:42.579> it<00:00:43.300> was<00:00:43.510> just<00:00:43.749> so<00:00:43.929> amazing<00:00:44.199> it<00:00:44.530> just

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
and it was just so amazing it just

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.869 
and it was just so amazing it just
really<00:00:45.730> filled<00:00:45.969> up<00:00:46.120> that<00:00:46.710> whatever<00:00:47.879> emptiness

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
really filled up that whatever emptiness

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.910 
really filled up that whatever emptiness
we<00:00:49.059> might<00:00:49.239> have<00:00:49.480> felt<00:00:49.719> with<00:00:50.289> so<00:00:50.710> much<00:00:50.859> joy

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
we might have felt with so much joy

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.189 
we might have felt with so much joy
because<00:00:51.609> we<00:00:51.789> knew<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:51.969> she<00:00:52.420> was<00:00:52.870> really

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
because we knew that she was really

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.250 
because we knew that she was really
doing<00:00:53.469> something<00:00:53.859> great<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.309> then<00:00:55.260> the

person she was with really appreciated

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.559 
person she was with really appreciated
it<00:00:58.089> it's<00:00:59.050> hard<00:00:59.440> but<00:00:59.920> it's<00:01:00.069> also<00:01:00.569> really

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569 
it it's hard but it's also really

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.380 
it it's hard but it's also really
amazing<00:01:02.050> just<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.379> see<00:01:02.640> how<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.699> dogs<00:01:04.030> help

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
amazing just to see how the dogs help

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.830 
amazing just to see how the dogs help
people<00:01:05.490> well<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:06.520> actually<00:01:06.820> raised<00:01:07.270> marking

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
people well I actually raised marking

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.860 
people well I actually raised marking
animals<00:01:08.230> so<00:01:09.010> it's<00:01:09.340> kind<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.640> in<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.330> way<00:01:10.450> it

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
animals so it's kind of in a way it

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.560 
animals so it's kind of in a way it
makes<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.890> easier<00:01:12.250> because<00:01:12.430> this<00:01:13.000> time<00:01:13.270> I<00:01:13.540> know

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
makes it easier because this time I know

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.410 
makes it easier because this time I know
they're<00:01:14.470> going<00:01:14.620> to<00:01:14.800> get<00:01:15.010> home<00:01:15.220> not<00:01:16.120> being

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
they're going to get home not being

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.860 
they're going to get home not being
slaughtered<00:01:16.720> yeah<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:19.540> makes<00:01:19.750> a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
slaughtered yeah so that makes a

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.800 
slaughtered yeah so that makes a
difference<00:01:20.230> yeah<00:01:21.090> different

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.880 

you<00:01:26.810> don't<00:01:26.990> want<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.259> give<00:01:27.380> them<00:01:27.500> away<00:01:29.890> because

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
you don't want to give them away because

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.050 
you don't want to give them away because
you<00:01:31.009> know<00:01:31.159> they're<00:01:31.310> going<00:01:31.520> for<00:01:31.670> something

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
you know they're going for something

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.120 
you know they're going for something
good<00:01:32.240> about<00:01:32.450> somebody<00:01:32.930> else<00:01:33.140> it's<00:01:33.710> not<00:01:33.770> really

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
good about somebody else it's not really

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.399 
good about somebody else it's not really
a<00:01:34.159> choice<00:01:34.399> you<00:01:34.640> can't<00:01:34.850> really<00:01:35.240> choose<00:01:35.630> not<00:01:36.170> to

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
a choice you can't really choose not to

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.490 
a choice you can't really choose not to
keep<00:01:36.619> them<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:37.070> mean<00:01:37.369> it's<00:01:37.880> hard<00:01:38.179> yeah<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:39.380> it

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
keep them I mean it's hard yeah and it

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.719 
keep them I mean it's hard yeah and it
probably<00:01:39.860> won't<00:01:40.039> get<00:01:40.189> easier<00:01:40.310> because<00:01:40.549> this

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
probably won't get easier because this

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.749 
probably won't get easier because this
