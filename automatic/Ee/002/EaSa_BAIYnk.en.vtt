00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 good some of you have told me 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.569
 asked what he was doing or when 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.639
 would upload videos well I 'm not a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.679
 constant person and neither am I with 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.599
 the channel so I just upload videos 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.460
 when I feel inspired or I have to win 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.590
 its time since this is one of my 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.119
 hobbies however as you can see in 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.400
 the miniatures I have not been precisely 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.590
 doing nothing but I have collaborated in 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.210
 different things a long time ago I said that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.340
 would go up trailers with said 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.920
 collaborations but I have accumulated 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.529
 so without further ado let's go to the mess 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.719
 I leave you on the thumbnails the link to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.090
 the different channels if you fancy 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.250
 see any of the videos in the first place 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.960
 a take of the movie card and where do I 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.730
 of coach next to the dynamo of his 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.379
 excessive emission stuff but it's very 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.300
 versatile then the second place 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.399
 seattle nador asked me already in 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.920
 colleagues chema cheese maps for 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:55.620
 friends how poor is a mistake but no longer 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.890
 I know where a script appears was a bit 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.750
 I here has doubled with Paul number 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.250
 one of the shorts of seth macfarlane 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.250
 belong to the cavalcade of humor 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.409
 I'll do pizza again or next time 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.000
 but delighted in fourth place is left 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.259
 a collaboration with the music cycle 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.869
 ogres and cycles then the good ones with cycle 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.000
 in an evil network I had to create the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.259
 lyrics and the music shares and you see that 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.780
 I have a lot to learn 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.399
 but I 've tried to make sure that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.740
 you want to go to see them your part 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.479
 course it 's fantastic and finally the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.969
 last collaboration that was uploaded this 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.890
 same afternoon the parody of 50 shadows of 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.929
 gray with another colleague jesus mendelssohn 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.970
 where he made it clear that I do not know how to say 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.090
 hermaphrodite word 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.819
 I say great but I assure you that 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.829
 it cost me horrors and that's all 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.390
 moment and what is said if you want to see 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.220
 something you just have to click on 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.319
 thumbnails or look in the box 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.659
 description and if you do not want to see it then 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.299

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.159

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.950
 doing collaborations and preparing my 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.979
 little things so we'll hear soon 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.310

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.310

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.050

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.489
