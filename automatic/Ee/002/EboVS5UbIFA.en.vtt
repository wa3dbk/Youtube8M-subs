observations<00:01:22.920> had<00:01:23.369> already<00:01:23.490> shown<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.299> this

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
observations had already shown that this

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
debris disk is actually warped and that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.010 
debris disk is actually warped and that
there<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:26.610> comets<00:01:26.970> falling<00:01:27.330> onto<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.750> star

there are comets falling onto the star

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.469 
there are comets falling onto the star
now<00:01:28.979> these<00:01:29.130> are<00:01:29.310> telltale<00:01:29.759> signs<00:01:30.180> that

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
now these are telltale signs that

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.240 
now these are telltale signs that
strongly<00:01:30.900> suggests<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> presence<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250

with eso's very large telescope we have

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.250 
with eso's very large telescope we have
definitive<00:01:40.290> proof

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.980 

because<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.280> star<00:01:44.550> is<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.910> young<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.600> planet

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
because the star is so young the planet

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.810 
because the star is so young the planet
must<00:01:46.260> also<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.740> formed<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.340> only<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.760> few

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
must also have formed in only a few

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.570 
must also have formed in only a few
million<00:01:48.270> years<00:01:48.470> this<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.680> good<00:01:49.950> news<00:01:50.220> because

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
million years this is good news because

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.820 
million years this is good news because
we<00:01:50.910> already<00:01:51.030> knew<00:01:51.510> that<00:01:51.540> disks<00:01:52.230> around<00:01:52.320> young

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
we already knew that disks around young

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.890 
we already knew that disks around young
stars<00:01:53.000> disperse<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.360> few<00:01:54.570> million<00:01:54.720> years

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
stars disperse in a few million years

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.170 
stars disperse in a few million years

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
that giant planet formation can occur

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.120 
that giant planet formation can occur
