00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.459
 hello friends today we have launcher 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.519
 trebuchet this launcher seems to me that 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.799
 decree come cyanogenmod 11 good this 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.320
 launcher works for any android 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:17.490
 logically you have android 4.4 points 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.920
 2 kitkat onwards and good as 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.620
 we can see this launcher has is 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.870
 Quick 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.840
 and his way of being and in the description 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.260
 of the video I leave on the pk for you 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.260
 install 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.030
 as we can see is this 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.430
 I did not install it in my case because 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.360
 well, it would take a bit more good for 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:51.559
 fast this launcher has functions 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.440
 this option to be able to put a package of 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.390
 icons 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.399
 as we can see I have the gera with 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.410
 now also give us option to power 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.979
 change the displacement effect and 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.979
 horta I have the perspective 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.690
 we also have to be able to screen by 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.630
 what screen do we want by default 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.540
 as for example is this to which I put 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.120
 scream by default but if I want that 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.340
 be state I am simply going back 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.770
 right there as you just saw and the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.040
 moment to give in home returns now to 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.230
 the other screen that I also put the 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.440
 three last options would be the fund's 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.440
 screen 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.020
 that would come 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.020
 those who come on the team 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.140
 the widgets 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.820
 and the configuration here in configuration 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.079
 we have the home screen that 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.820
 here gives us the option that if we want 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.340
 that the search bar is enabled 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.640
 general that only more of the option 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.620
 to put the big icons or that are 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.520
 small and we mark destruction is 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.520
 they will see small 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.129
 how can you see 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.920
 also here in general is the style of 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.220
 d 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.270
 of letters we give in fine 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.390
 change what would be the letter being 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.080
 as we can see it was already very 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.080
 different 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.519
 and we can see and change the typeface 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.370
 I just want to go back to how we had it 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:48.370
 before then we simply turn to 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.319
 put in the option and we re-mark the 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:56.510
 that we had previously 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.510
 and let's see the change 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.680
 well I hope this video has them 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.120
 liked 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.940
 I hope you try the application and if 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.319
 it was like that we gave like and we see each other until 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.319
 another next video
