next sequel games which is another
reasons<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.750> why<00:00:51.930> we're<00:00:52.140> probably<00:00:52.350> gonna<00:00:52.559> see

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
reasons to why we're probably gonna see

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.520 
reasons to why we're probably gonna see
if<00:00:52.890> Pokemon<00:00:53.250> X&amp;Y<00:00:53.640> sequel<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.379> of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
if Pokemon X&amp;Y sequel it's because of

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.099 
if Pokemon X&amp;Y sequel it's because of
volcanion<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.730> would<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.420> weird<00:00:57.750> if

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
volcanion and it would just be weird if

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.260 
volcanion and it would just be weird if
there<00:00:58.440> wasn't<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.010> third<00:00:59.550> game<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
there wasn't a third game for the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.560 
there wasn't a third game for the
generation<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.989> six<00:01:01.489> that<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.940> weird<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.359> say

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
generation of six that was weird to say

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.800 
generation of six that was weird to say
but<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:05.460> interesting<00:01:05.939> thing<00:01:06.119> about<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.540> is

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
but the interesting thing about this is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
but the interesting thing about this is
that<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.200> powerplant<00:01:07.680> doors<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.369> always

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that the powerplant doors have always

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.920 
that the powerplant doors have always
been<00:01:09.210> locked

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.870 
volcanion and the power plane you know
there<00:01:49.890> could<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.070> multiple<00:01:50.310> doors<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.850> have

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
there could be multiple doors you have

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.850 
there could be multiple doors you have
to<00:01:51.000> go<00:01:51.090> through<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.710> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
to go through to get to this to get to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.960 
to go through to get to this to get to
the<00:01:52.920> third<00:01:53.100> door<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.430> got<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.640> go<00:01:53.729> through

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the third door you got to go through

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.300 
the third door you got to go through
first<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:54.659> get<00:01:55.350> out<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.740> key<00:01:55.950> get<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
first and then get out get a key get a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.459 
first and then get out get a key get a
key<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.700> second<00:01:57.119> da<00:01:57.479> da<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> same<00:01:58.320> thing

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
key to second da da do the same thing

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.260 
key to second da da do the same thing
for<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> third<00:01:58.890> maybe<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.759> works<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.240> that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
for the third maybe it works like that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.780 
for the third maybe it works like that
and<00:02:00.869> then<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.469> go<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> volcano<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.369> maybe<00:02:02.549> it's

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and then you go a volcano and maybe it's

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.340 
and then you go a volcano and maybe it's
gonna<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.119> something<00:02:03.450> special<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.170> Kenny

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
gonna be something special for for Kenny

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.590 
gonna be something special for for Kenny
maybe<00:02:04.649> volcanion<00:02:05.310> could<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.909> even<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.329> bigger

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
maybe volcanion could have even a bigger

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.859 
maybe volcanion could have even a bigger
role<00:02:06.960> than<00:02:06.990> Koopa<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.860> diancie<00:02:08.280> would<00:02:08.869> keep

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
role than Koopa and diancie would keep

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.170 
role than Koopa and diancie would keep
in<00:02:10.020> mind<00:02:10.259> at<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.560> time<00:02:10.619> too<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.520> know<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
in mind at this time too you know the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.540 
in mind at this time too you know the
moon

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
moon

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.280 
moon
for<00:02:13.000> volcanium<00:02:13.540> which<00:02:13.720> should<00:02:13.870> be<00:02:14.020> around

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
for volcanium which should be around

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.070 
for volcanium which should be around
probably<00:02:15.010> next<00:02:15.340> year<00:02:15.490> 2016<00:02:16.360> middle<00:02:16.750> of<00:02:16.810> July

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
probably next year 2016 middle of July

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.890 
probably next year 2016 middle of July
like<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.070> was<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:18.520> year<00:02:18.880> for<00:02:19.240> hooba

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
like it was for this year for hooba

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.020 
like it was for this year for hooba
that's<00:02:20.530> why<00:02:20.680> we<00:02:20.830> should<00:02:21.040> probably<00:02:21.400> expect<00:02:22.000> to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
that's why we should probably expect to

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.970 
that's why we should probably expect to
see<00:02:22.210> something<00:02:22.510> about<00:02:22.690> volcanion<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.560> you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
see something about volcanion and you

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.210 
see something about volcanion and you
know<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.400> feel<00:02:25.090> like<00:02:25.440> since<00:02:26.440> that's<00:02:26.650> not<00:02:26.830> that

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
know I feel like since that's not that

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.860 
know I feel like since that's not that
far<00:02:27.400> away<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:28.030> release<00:02:28.330> date<00:02:28.360> for<00:02:28.630> the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
far away and the release date for the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.780 
far away and the release date for the
next<00:02:28.990> Pokemon<00:02:29.470> X&amp;Y<00:02:29.680> sequel<00:02:30.220> games<00:02:30.400> could<00:02:30.670> be

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
next Pokemon X&amp;Y sequel games could be

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.570 
next Pokemon X&amp;Y sequel games could be
in<00:02:30.910> March<00:02:31.180> or<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.530> could<00:02:32.710> even<00:02:32.920> maybe<00:02:33.250> be<00:02:33.520> in

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
in March or it could even maybe be in

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.960 
in March or it could even maybe be in
April<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:34.420> know<00:02:34.600> two<00:02:35.080> months<00:02:35.260> away

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
April you know two months away

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.030 
April you know two months away
especially<00:02:36.970> for<00:02:37.390> Jeff<00:02:37.630> Japan<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.620> know<00:02:38.800> I

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
especially for Jeff Japan you know I

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.430 
especially for Jeff Japan you know I
feel<00:02:39.820> like<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.390> they<00:02:40.810> could<00:02:40.990> actually<00:02:41.140> turn

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
feel like that they could actually turn

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.260 
feel like that they could actually turn
this<00:02:41.590> thing<00:02:41.650> into<00:02:41.860> an<00:02:42.250> actual<00:02:42.550> events<00:02:43.120> to

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
this thing into an actual events to

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.060 
this thing into an actual events to
where<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.630> go<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.020> catch<00:02:44.290> volcanion<00:02:44.890> and

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
where you go and catch volcanion and

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.300 
where you go and catch volcanion and
then<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:47.020> know<00:02:47.230> there's<00:02:47.740> that<00:02:48.040> there's<00:02:48.250> a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
then you know there's that there's a

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.760 
then you know there's that there's a
whole<00:02:48.520> you<00:02:48.790> know<00:02:49.080> backstory<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.320> there's

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
whole you know backstory to it there's

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.260 
whole you know backstory to it there's
you<00:02:50.980> know<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.130> lot<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.700> vets<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.060> have<00:02:52.150> to

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
you know a lot of the vets you have to

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.360 
you know a lot of the vets you have to
do<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.660> whatnot<00:02:53.080> it's<00:02:53.650> not<00:02:53.860> like<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.250> know

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
do and whatnot it's not like you know

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.270 
do and whatnot it's not like you know
just<00:02:54.580> diancie<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.390> Hoopa<00:02:56.260> where<00:02:56.800> you

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
just diancie and Hoopa where you

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.060 
just diancie and Hoopa where you
basically<00:02:57.670> just<00:02:57.870> get<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.020> Pokemon<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.920> know

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
basically just get the Pokemon you know

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.580 
basically just get the Pokemon you know
changes<00:03:00.940> form<00:03:01.240> and<00:03:01.570> whether<00:03:01.750> it's<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.990> mega<00:03:02.230> or

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
changes form and whether it's a mega or

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.850 
changes form and whether it's a mega or
of<00:03:03.370> course<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.820> know<00:03:03.970> for<00:03:04.450> Bupa<00:03:05.440> it's<00:03:05.710> a

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
of course you know for Bupa it's a

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.530 
of course you know for Bupa it's a
different<00:03:06.220> kind<00:03:06.490> of<00:03:06.550> form<00:03:06.820> that<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.210> changes

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
different kind of form that it changes

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.370 
different kind of form that it changes
into<00:03:07.720> but<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:09.390> figure<00:03:10.390> that's<00:03:10.630> something<00:03:11.230> that

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
into but I figure that's something that

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.990 
into but I figure that's something that
would<00:03:11.440> have<00:03:11.620> volcana<00:03:12.160> don't<00:03:12.430> know<00:03:12.520> what<00:03:12.700> kind

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
would have volcana don't know what kind

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.150 
would have volcana don't know what kind
of<00:03:13.120> mega<00:03:13.330> evolution<00:03:13.390> or<00:03:14.050> what<00:03:14.410> kind<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.740> format

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
of mega evolution or what kind of format

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160 
of mega evolution or what kind of format
yet<00:03:15.460> that's<00:03:16.330> something<00:03:16.630> talked<00:03:16.840> about<00:03:16.900> under

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
yet that's something talked about under

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.290 
yet that's something talked about under
the<00:03:17.260> time<00:03:17.470> but<00:03:17.739> it's<00:03:18.489> just<00:03:18.640> so<00:03:18.880> weird<00:03:19.150> that

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
the time but it's just so weird that

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.000 
the time but it's just so weird that
those<00:03:19.540> power<00:03:19.810> plant<00:03:20.140> doors<00:03:20.380> have<00:03:20.590> been<00:03:20.620> there

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
those power plant doors have been there

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.070 
those power plant doors have been there
and<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.280> no<00:03:22.000> one's<00:03:22.180> been<00:03:22.360> able<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.630> open<00:03:22.810> them

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
and that no one's been able to open them

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.620 
and that no one's been able to open them
and<00:03:23.110> there's<00:03:23.410> nothing<00:03:24.040> at<00:03:24.220> all<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.209> X&amp;Y

it nobody has an answer as to why those

from Game Freak has spoken about it and
I'm<00:03:44.680> feeling<00:03:45.280> like<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:45.700> there<00:03:45.910> is<00:03:46.030> some<00:03:46.209> sort

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
I'm feeling like that there is some sort

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.540 
I'm feeling like that there is some sort
of<00:03:46.510> importance<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.200> for<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.220> Pokemon

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
of importance to that for the Pokemon

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.580 
of importance to that for the Pokemon
X&amp;Y<00:03:48.730> sequels<00:03:49.300> which<00:03:49.510> is<00:03:49.630> why<00:03:49.750> again<00:03:50.260> there's

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
X&amp;Y sequels which is why again there's

X&amp;Y sequels which is why again there's
just<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:51.040> many<00:03:51.489> reasons<00:03:52.060> as<00:03:52.300> to<00:03:52.330> why<00:03:52.540> there<00:03:53.110> has

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
just so many reasons as to why there has

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.870 
just so many reasons as to why there has
to<00:03:53.350> be<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.590> Pokemon<00:03:53.980> X&amp;Y<00:03:54.190> sequel<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:54.640> there

wasn't then forget the power plant doors
it<00:03:58.030> just<00:03:58.180> wouldn't<00:03:58.570> matter<00:03:58.810> anymore

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
it just wouldn't matter anymore
