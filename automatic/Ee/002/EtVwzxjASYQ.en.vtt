00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
first I was like what the hell is that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.750 
first I was like what the hell is that
so<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:30.989> really<00:02:31.290> didn't<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.590> then<00:02:32.250> here<00:02:32.489> again

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
so I really didn't know then here again

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.370 
so I really didn't know then here again
you<00:02:32.910> have<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.060> two<00:02:33.300> piece<00:02:33.569> wrench<00:02:33.870> here<00:02:34.200> and

you have a two piece wrench here and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.780 
you have a two piece wrench here and
then<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.400> small<00:02:36.140> lanyard<00:02:37.140> hole<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.580> can

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
then a small lanyard hole so you can

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.250 
then a small lanyard hole so you can
pick<00:02:38.910> them<00:02:39.030> up<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.420> couple<00:02:39.720> bucks<00:02:39.930> but

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
pick them up for a couple bucks but

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.770 
pick them up for a couple bucks but
they're<00:02:40.709> really<00:02:40.860> nice<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.310> mean<00:02:41.459> it's<00:02:41.780> pretty

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
they're really nice I mean it's pretty

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.630 
they're really nice I mean it's pretty
well<00:02:43.080> made<00:02:43.380> for<00:02:43.680> being<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.920> stainless<00:02:44.400> it's

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
well made for being a stainless it's

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.430 
well made for being a stainless it's
like<00:02:44.790> an<00:02:44.940> eighth<00:02:45.090> eighth<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.720> an<00:02:45.840> inch<00:02:45.870> thick<00:02:46.049> I

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
like an eighth eighth of an inch thick I

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.250 
like an eighth eighth of an inch thick I
think<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:49.319> think<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.830> chrome<00:02:50.130> plated

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
think and I think it's chrome plated

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.690 
think and I think it's chrome plated
stainless<00:02:52.260> steel<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:54.709> it's<00:02:55.709> got<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.069> vinyl

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
stainless steel and it's got the vinyl

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.850 
stainless steel and it's got the vinyl
case<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.840> just<00:02:58.200> something<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.500> go<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:58.739> your

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
case so just something to go in your

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.410 
case so just something to go in your
pocket<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.340> know<00:02:59.400> they<00:02:59.580> make<00:02:59.760> better<00:02:59.910> ones<00:03:00.180> out

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
pocket I know they make better ones out

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.110 
pocket I know they make better ones out
there<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> couple<00:03:01.650> bucks<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.819> can't

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
there but for a couple bucks you can't

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.059 
there but for a couple bucks you can't
go<00:03:03.269> wrong<00:03:03.510> with<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.900> then<00:03:04.530> we're<00:03:04.709> going<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.860> see

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
go wrong with it then we're going to see

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.789 
go wrong with it then we're going to see
what<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:05.370> could<00:03:05.459> do<00:03:05.610> with<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.880> edge<00:03:06.680> because<00:03:07.680> I

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
what we could do with the edge because I

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.870 
what we could do with the edge because I
just<00:03:07.980> picked<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.430> up<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.540> trade<00:03:10.880> first

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
just picked this up in a trade first

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.990 
just picked this up in a trade first
drop<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.799> I<00:03:13.799> couldn't<00:03:14.190> be<00:03:14.250> happier<00:03:14.670> with<00:03:14.700> it

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
drop and I couldn't be happier with it

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.640 
drop and I couldn't be happier with it
so<00:03:15.269> we'll<00:03:15.450> have<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.630> review<00:03:15.810> coming<00:03:16.260> up<00:03:16.440> for

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
so we'll have a review coming up for

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.490 
so we'll have a review coming up for
that<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:18.120> we're<00:03:18.359> going<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.510> take<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:19.019> and

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
that so we're going to take that and

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.750 
that so we're going to take that and
we're<00:03:19.650> going<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.799> see<00:03:20.040> how<00:03:20.160> good<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.370> an<00:03:20.579> edge

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
we're going to see how good of an edge

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.250 
we're going to see how good of an edge
we<00:03:21.540> could<00:03:21.690> put<00:03:21.840> on<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.950> my<00:03:23.250> other<00:03:23.400> knives
