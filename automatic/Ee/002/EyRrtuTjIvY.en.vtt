we<00:01:23.570> need<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.900> find<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:24.200> scanning<00:01:24.650> place

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
we need to find a scanning place

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.430 
we need to find a scanning place
specifically<00:01:26.060> we<00:01:26.390> need<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.720> find<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.200> highest

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
specifically we need to find the highest

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.500 
specifically we need to find the highest
resolution<00:01:27.890> scanning<00:01:28.760> that<00:01:29.180> could<00:01:29.390> be

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
resolution scanning that could be

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.780 
resolution scanning that could be
portable<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.230> be<00:01:30.320> set<00:01:30.590> up<00:01:30.710> within<00:01:30.920> a<00:01:31.100> day<00:01:31.310> to

and<00:01:33.770> when<00:01:34.070> I<00:01:34.100> say<00:01:34.400> high-tech<00:01:35.300> I'm<00:01:35.570> talking

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
and when I say high-tech I'm talking

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.380 
and when I say high-tech I'm talking
over<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.380> hundred<00:01:36.800> camera<00:01:37.250> camera<00:01:38.000> rig<00:01:38.180> that

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
would need to be traveled out there set

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.990

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
given moment when client walks in so we

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.020 
given moment when client walks in so we
drew<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.170> head<00:01:48.320> here<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.800> what<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.490> does<00:01:49.760> is

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
drew the head here and what that does is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.600 
drew the head here and what that does is
every<00:01:50.420> bit<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.200> information<00:01:51.560> correct<00:01:52.220> as<00:01:52.400> far

every bit of information correct as far

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.730 
every bit of information correct as far
as<00:01:52.670> what<00:01:52.850> here<00:01:53.090> placement<00:01:53.630> does<00:01:53.720> my<00:01:53.960> eyes<00:01:54.200> go

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
as what here placement does my eyes go

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.100 
as what here placement does my eyes go
in<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.610> out<00:01:55.700> up<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.149> down<00:01:56.240> lifts<00:01:56.840> everything

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
in and out up and down lifts everything

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:07.620 
in and out up and down lifts everything
this<00:01:57.320> is<00:01:58.210> 95%<00:01:59.210> there

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.450 

the<00:02:07.990> final<00:02:08.380> results

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
the final results

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.260 
the final results
is<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:10.270> silicone<00:02:11.110> mold<00:02:11.320> with<00:02:12.190> an<00:02:12.310> epoxy<00:02:12.670> jacket

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
is a silicone mold with an epoxy jacket

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.040 
is a silicone mold with an epoxy jacket
that<00:02:13.900> keys<00:02:14.260> together<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:15.100> two<00:02:15.400> halves

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
that keys together in two halves

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.790 
that keys together in two halves
and<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:18.190> bolted<00:02:18.510> along<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.660> center<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.290> mean

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
and it's bolted along the center I mean

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.070 
and it's bolted along the center I mean
along<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.250> flange<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:22.090> call<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.390> flange<00:02:22.660> will

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
along the flange to call the flange will

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.230 
along the flange to call the flange will
be<00:02:23.170> bolted<00:02:23.470> along<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.640> then<00:02:24.850> that's<00:02:25.030> what

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
be bolted along and then that's what

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.590 
be bolted along and then that's what
they'll<00:02:25.420> pour<00:02:25.750> silicone<00:02:26.740> into<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:28.300> get<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
they'll pour silicone into to get the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:43.260 
they'll pour silicone into to get the
final<00:02:28.930> hero<00:02:29.880> skin

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.960 

and<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:44.320> was<00:02:44.560> very<00:02:44.950> excited<00:02:45.190> about<00:02:45.490> working<00:02:45.910> on

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
and I was very excited about working on

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.880 
and I was very excited about working on
this<00:02:46.090> project<00:02:46.390> with<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.050> process<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.680> first

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
this project with the process the first

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.910 
this project with the process the first
thing<00:02:48.070> we<00:02:48.160> did<00:02:48.340> was<00:02:48.640> just<00:02:49.740> figured<00:02:50.740> out

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
thing we did was just figured out

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.650 
thing we did was just figured out
exactly<00:02:51.370> what<00:02:51.610> you<00:02:51.910> needed<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.240> do<00:02:52.360> with<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
exactly what you needed to do with the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.440 
exactly what you needed to do with the
eyes<00:02:52.810> because<00:02:53.760> as<00:02:54.760> far<00:02:54.940> as<00:02:55.000> I'm<00:02:55.120> concerned

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
eyes because as far as I'm concerned

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.760 
eyes because as far as I'm concerned
that's<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.690> most<00:02:55.810> important<00:02:56.320> part<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
that's the most important part of the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.600 
that's the most important part of the
process<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:59.380> eyes<00:02:59.500> kind<00:02:59.830> of<00:02:59.860> given<00:03:00.130> its<00:03:00.370> life

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
process the eyes kind of given its life

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.420 
process the eyes kind of given its life
so<00:03:00.970> they<00:03:01.090> have<00:03:01.240> to<00:03:01.360> be<00:03:01.480> correct<00:03:02.010> but<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.100> human

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
so they have to be correct but the human

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.830 
so they have to be correct but the human
everybody<00:03:03.850> knows<00:03:04.060> what<00:03:04.300> those<00:03:04.450> eyes<00:03:04.630> look

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
everybody knows what those eyes look

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.710 
everybody knows what those eyes look
like<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.470> if<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.340> don't<00:03:06.880> do<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.120> perfect

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
like so if you don't do it perfect

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.350 
like so if you don't do it perfect
everybody<00:03:08.530> will<00:03:08.680> know<00:03:08.710> so

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
everybody will know so

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.740 
everybody will know so
so<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.470> bottom<00:03:10.710> line<00:03:10.770> is<00:03:10.890> we<00:03:11.130> can't<00:03:11.360> we<00:03:12.360> don't

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
so the bottom line is we can't we don't

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.790 
so the bottom line is we can't we don't
have<00:03:13.500> any<00:03:13.740> liberties<00:03:14.040> with<00:03:14.610> Ronaldo<00:03:15.300> because

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
have any liberties with Ronaldo because

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.250 
have any liberties with Ronaldo because
not<00:03:16.800> only<00:03:16.830> does<00:03:17.280> everybody<00:03:17.760> know<00:03:18.000> what<00:03:18.330> a

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
not only does everybody know what a

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.670 
not only does everybody know what a
human<00:03:20.060> facial<00:03:21.260> movements<00:03:22.260> are<00:03:22.440> like

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
human facial movements are like

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.340 
human facial movements are like
everybody<00:03:23.640> knows<00:03:23.970> who<00:03:24.180> Ronaldo<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.110> that

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
everybody knows who Ronaldo is and that

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.070 
everybody knows who Ronaldo is and that
is<00:03:25.620> just<00:03:26.220> an<00:03:26.370> automatic<00:03:26.520> light<00:03:27.150> if<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.810> doesn't

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
is just an automatic light if it doesn't

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.460 
is just an automatic light if it doesn't
look<00:03:28.170> perfect<00:03:28.410> people<00:03:28.920> notice<00:03:29.340> it

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.410 

it's<00:03:35.890> not<00:03:36.070> just<00:03:36.250> making<00:03:36.460> that<00:03:36.670> circuit<00:03:37.000> custom

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
it's not just making that circuit custom

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:56.030 
it's not just making that circuit custom
circuit

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040
