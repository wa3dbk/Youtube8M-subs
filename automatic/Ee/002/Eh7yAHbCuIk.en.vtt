00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.129
 the next option that I would like 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.680
 to show 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.510
 and she, too, would go through the books 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.469
 very simple 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.709
 forecast used with 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.089
 using already quite good lats 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.259
 auth three four vac 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.650
 red will be light 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.070
 black white colors automatically 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.029
 which can be used in any 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.330
 Kievans not caring about who suits 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.490
 they or not they pass it always 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.550
 to all 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.820
 and I try critics we take 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.129
 like who on the blue is everything so that he 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.129
 combined with the background color 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.570
 tool 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.660
 Again, someone will not just brush 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.020
 we will need any available tool 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.830
 if you have a manicure couple 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.860
 probably only units for her 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.820
 cuticle which no one ever 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.810
 use 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.580
 back side of a stalker but how 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.370
 the rule just looks like it is very important 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.540
 draw this girl 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.690
 can draw ordinary bun 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.260
 cervical 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.740
 and budget flows end either 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.590
 turn and carcass draw and then all 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.030
 expenses will be 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.560
 one more option you can take 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.790
 toothpick or skewer 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.480
 and she is such an ordinary culinary skewers 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.620
 and since chicago finish 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.670
 that year 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.190
 needle 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.690
 we just need ports end doesn't matter 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.500
 which metal door of the army 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.770
 in every match who 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.770
 good practice th floor 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.390
 many do 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.710
 I go sensor, too, if it is not very sharp 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.820
 You can sharpen it and nail file 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.750
 The main thing is that somebody and a tunic code 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.850
 oppose think there 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.850
 paying ethics 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.610
 balanced 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 task 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.350
 because so do 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 with improvised means 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.799
 on the newspaper, as always, everything is open to us 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.909
 those are ready for what we are able to spend 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.909
 time that the rights would speak save 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.799
 we put the main background 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.789
 in this case 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.789
 light coloured 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.059
 we put rather big thickness on 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.059
 which our design should pay 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.809
 if so how is normal 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.059
 that you quickly grab that is not 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.409
 only layer tables 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.519
 its basis as a battlefield before drying out 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.899
 bottom layer 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:47.049
 listening to the bottom layer 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.109
 doing 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.339
 chaotic drops 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:55.579
 in the vrancha zone 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.009
 for contrast 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.009
 add bilan 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.949
 one more contrasting add what 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.709
 we have a design 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.709
 later h 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.609
 Now we take our groups cleaning 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.889
 and just in different directions we part 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.839
 single team 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.319
 sea â€‹â€‹waves 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.619
 Well, that is, an attack can be 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:27.680
 abstract what other zones 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.149
 otherwise their dogs can't do anything 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:32.899
 the longer i can't say that 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.379
 the Ukrainian side itself has repeatedly 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.739
 then it was really 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.649
 clouds on a stormy sea 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:40.760
 either at all 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.230
 rakutinoy than those who its cyclical zherdev 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.489
 district center 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.140
 in each in the capital 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.489
 previous arrival of abstraction 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.669
 what else in the very caravan svirko 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.249
 it is possible to cover baku 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.879
 practice m products he has long 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.370
 ready rebuilding then flag can push away 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.100
 can cover can not cover 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.820
 while this is to 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.150
 China crack assessment equalized and this 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.920
 Victoria Current Coverage They Like 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.600
 rule have a drying effect 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.360
 so we strive for clapping I myself 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.780
 Auchan of bureaucratic indifference 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.100
 fixer and then action stomps in 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.950
 the celebration can 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.380
 this is just the top overall coverage takes 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.400
 how it will be allocated may have 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.639
 the coating will be perceived as a design 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.249
 in portugal i just like me 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:32.580
 really like
