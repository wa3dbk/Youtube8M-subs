rail<00:00:11.840> system<00:00:12.080> to<00:00:12.440> come<00:00:12.590> out<00:00:12.770> I<00:00:13.490> thought<00:00:13.969> it

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:14.029 
rail system to come out I thought it

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:16.689 
rail system to come out I thought it
might<00:00:14.180> be<00:00:14.480> a<00:00:14.510> good<00:00:14.600> idea<00:00:14.779> to<00:00:15.139> work<00:00:15.559> on<00:00:15.859> sort<00:00:16.640> of

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
might be a good idea to work on sort of

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.730 
might be a good idea to work on sort of
some<00:00:16.970> apartments<00:00:17.660> that<00:00:17.689> we<00:00:17.930> could<00:00:18.080> then<00:00:18.289> copy

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
some apartments that we could then copy

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.409 
some apartments that we could then copy
around<00:00:19.130> and<00:00:19.369> fill<00:00:19.580> in<00:00:19.699> these<00:00:19.880> blue<00:00:20.090> areas

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:20.419 
around and fill in these blue areas

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.870 
around and fill in these blue areas
where<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:20.929> blue<00:00:21.109> cakes<00:00:21.380> were<00:00:21.589> and<00:00:21.829> so<00:00:22.609> I've

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
where the blue cakes were and so I've

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.149 
where the blue cakes were and so I've
done<00:00:23.329> that<00:00:23.599> and<00:00:23.839> templated<00:00:24.439> out<00:00:24.589> this<00:00:24.800> very

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:25.159 
done that and templated out this very

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.630 
done that and templated out this very
nice<00:00:25.779> very<00:00:26.779> functional<00:00:27.349> apartment<00:00:28.339> building

straight away is we've got a four button
combination<00:01:00.980> lock<00:01:01.160> and<00:01:01.310> we've<00:01:02.090> added<00:01:02.390> it<00:01:02.660> in

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
combination lock and we've added it in

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.719 
combination lock and we've added it in
which<00:01:03.260> is<00:01:03.410> great<00:01:03.620> so<00:01:03.860> it's<00:01:04.040> built<00:01:04.400> into<00:01:04.549> this

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
which is great so it's built into this

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.940 
which is great so it's built into this
one<00:01:05.000> little<00:01:05.150> side<00:01:05.479> area<00:01:05.840> it's<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.530> little<00:01:06.829> bit's

compact compared to the one that's

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.200 
compact compared to the one that's

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
you enter you can see we switch all the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.720 
you enter you can see we switch all the
lights<00:03:32.120> off<00:03:32.300> down<00:03:32.510> here<00:03:32.540> as<00:03:32.870> well<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:34.040> also

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
lights off down here as well I also

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.380 
lights off down here as well I also
closes<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.510> door<00:03:35.720> or<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.550> balcony<00:03:38.090> as

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
closes the door or to the balcony as

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.150 
closes the door or to the balcony as
well<00:03:38.570> so<00:03:39.110> you<00:03:39.200> don't<00:03:39.380> accidentally<00:03:39.920> leave

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
well so you don't accidentally leave

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.830 
well so you don't accidentally leave
that<00:03:40.340> open<00:03:40.459> which<00:03:41.150> is<00:03:41.300> another<00:03:41.540> cool<00:03:41.810> feature

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
that open which is another cool feature

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.400 
that open which is another cool feature
I<00:03:42.410> think<00:03:42.800> so<00:03:43.519> all<00:03:43.760> in<00:03:43.940> all<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
I think so all in all that is the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.880 
I think so all in all that is the
apartment<00:03:46.070> which<00:03:46.940> is<00:03:47.060> great<00:03:47.799> there's<00:03:48.799> a<00:03:48.860> lot

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
apartment which is great there's a lot

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.410 
apartment which is great there's a lot
in<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.370> for<00:03:49.730> its<00:03:49.880> size<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.709> or<00:03:51.709> say<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.459> lot<00:03:53.299> of

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
in it for its size and or say a lot of

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.870 
in it for its size and or say a lot of
functionality<00:03:53.810> in<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.380> as<00:03:54.560> well<00:03:54.730> wanting<00:03:55.730> to

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
functionality in it as well wanting to

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.160 
functionality in it as well wanting to
be<00:03:56.030> able<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.890> actually<00:03:57.890> enable<00:03:58.880> people<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.780> be

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
be able to actually enable people to be

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.160 
be able to actually enable people to be
able<00:04:00.320> to<00:04:00.970> use<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.150> without<00:04:02.299> having<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:02.780> be<00:04:02.840> part

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
able to use it without having to be part

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.320 
able to use it without having to be part
of<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.380> faction<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:04.040> have<00:04:04.250> at<00:04:04.610> least<00:04:04.730> some<00:04:05.030> sort

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
of a faction and have at least some sort

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.520 
of a faction and have at least some sort
of<00:04:05.680> control<00:04:06.680> over<00:04:07.150> security<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.690> like<00:04:08.900> so

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
of control over security and the like so

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.370 
of control over security and the like so
you<00:04:09.590> can<00:04:09.830> see<00:04:10.040> this<00:04:10.250> will<00:04:10.310> clone<00:04:11.150> nicely<00:04:11.660> now

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
you can see this will clone nicely now

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.710 
you can see this will clone nicely now
it's<00:04:12.590> designed<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.040> fit<00:04:13.310> into<00:04:13.489> these<00:04:13.880> sections

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
it's designed to fit into these sections

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.599 
it's designed to fit into these sections
up<00:04:15.049> here<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:15.739> you<00:04:15.799> can<00:04:16.010> see<00:04:16.040> we've<00:04:16.340> got<00:04:16.370> these

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
up here so you can see we've got these

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.420 
up here so you can see we've got these
two<00:04:16.850> gray<00:04:17.150> lines<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:18.169> actually<00:04:18.590> fits<00:04:18.830> halfway

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
two gray lines it actually fits halfway

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.909 
two gray lines it actually fits halfway
in<00:04:19.580> between<00:04:19.609> them<00:04:20.450> so<00:04:20.840> we<00:04:21.019> can<00:04:21.200> stack<00:04:21.530> two<00:04:21.739> on

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
in between them so we can stack two on

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.650 
in between them so we can stack two on
top<00:04:22.100> of<00:04:22.250> each<00:04:22.370> other<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.790> I'll<00:04:23.210> flip<00:04:23.450> between

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
top of each other and I'll flip between

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.860 
top of each other and I'll flip between
these<00:04:24.020> who<00:04:24.290> gray<00:04:24.530> ones<00:04:24.770> nicely<00:04:25.610> so<00:04:25.970> we'll<00:04:26.599> do

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
these who gray ones nicely so we'll do

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.839 
these who gray ones nicely so we'll do
one<00:04:27.050> which<00:04:27.380> actually<00:04:27.620> has<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:27.950> angled<00:04:28.520> edges

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
one which actually has the angled edges

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.760 
one which actually has the angled edges
or<00:04:29.300> save<00:04:29.599> this<00:04:29.780> one<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:30.200> then<00:04:31.130> we'll<00:04:31.190> be<00:04:31.460> out

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
or save this one and then we'll be out

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.499 
or save this one and then we'll be out
actually<00:04:32.099> start<00:04:32.340> filling<00:04:32.669> these<00:04:32.849> sections<00:04:33.300> up

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
actually start filling these sections up

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.869 
actually start filling these sections up
with<00:04:33.750> at<00:04:34.139> least<00:04:34.199> some<00:04:34.500> apartments<00:04:35.069> that<00:04:35.250> look

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 
with at least some apartments that look

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.960 
with at least some apartments that look
out<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.330> can<00:04:36.449> see<00:04:36.840> roughly<00:04:37.830> each<00:04:38.430> section

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
out and you can see roughly each section

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:46.129 
out and you can see roughly each section
here<00:04:39.180> may<00:04:39.479> fit<00:04:41.449> 68<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.710> already<00:04:44.129> that's<00:04:44.430> 16<00:04:45.139> 32

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
here may fit 68 so already that's 16 32

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.129 
here may fit 68 so already that's 16 32
on<00:04:46.620> just<00:04:47.009> six<00:04:47.220> this<00:04:47.639> side<00:04:47.909> so<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.810> can<00:04:48.930> imagine

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
on just six this side so you can imagine

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.999 
on just six this side so you can imagine
just<00:04:49.949> on<00:04:50.159> these<00:04:50.340> two<00:04:50.550> panels<00:04:51.349> across<00:04:52.349> all<00:04:52.620> of

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
just on these two panels across all of

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.670 
just on these two panels across all of
the<00:04:53.220> sections<00:04:53.460> on<00:04:54.060> all<00:04:54.750> four<00:04:55.169> sides<00:04:55.199> of<00:04:55.620> the

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
the sections on all four sides of the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.850 
the sections on all four sides of the
station<00:04:56.069> you're<00:04:56.400> getting<00:04:56.639> 128<00:04:57.860> apartment

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
station you're getting 128 apartment

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.260 
station you're getting 128 apartment
which<00:04:59.430> is<00:04:59.460> a<00:04:59.849> bit<00:05:00.090> ridiculous<00:05:00.979> I<00:05:02.120> think<00:05:03.120> my

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
which is a bit ridiculous I think my

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.860 
which is a bit ridiculous I think my
math<00:05:03.449> is<00:05:03.599> right<00:05:03.659> on<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.909> anyway<00:05:05.909> we<00:05:06.150> leave<00:05:06.720> it

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
math is right on it anyway we leave it

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.800 
math is right on it anyway we leave it
there<00:05:07.080> we'll<00:05:07.500> keep<00:05:07.800> going<00:05:08.039> and<00:05:08.430> start<00:05:08.909> adding

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
there we'll keep going and start adding

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.540 
there we'll keep going and start adding
it<00:05:10.139> all<00:05:10.259> in<00:05:10.530> but<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.830> can<00:05:11.009> see<00:05:11.159> it's<00:05:11.370> going<00:05:11.430> to

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
it all in but you can see it's going to

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.270 
it all in but you can see it's going to
look<00:05:11.669> very<00:05:11.699> cool<00:05:12.419> i'm<00:05:12.569> very<00:05:12.870> excited<00:05:13.259> and<00:05:13.560> you

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
look very cool i'm very excited and you

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.740 
look very cool i'm very excited and you
know<00:05:14.400> we're<00:05:14.580> always<00:05:14.759> pushing<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.300> boundaries

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
know we're always pushing the boundaries

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.860 
know we're always pushing the boundaries
with<00:05:16.199> things<00:05:16.470> like<00:05:16.560> logic<00:05:17.009> you<00:05:17.310> know<00:05:17.870> fitting

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
with things like logic you know fitting

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.499 
with things like logic you know fitting
that<00:05:19.169> little<00:05:19.770> section<00:05:20.039> in<00:05:20.400> their<00:05:20.759> building<00:05:21.419> it

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
that little section in their building it

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:22.939 
that little section in their building it
into<00:05:21.690> it<00:05:21.930> so<00:05:22.110> we<00:05:22.229> don't<00:05:22.259> need<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:22.590> worry<00:05:22.800> about

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
into it so we don't need to worry about

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.390 
into it so we don't need to worry about
having<00:05:23.759> to<00:05:23.880> copy<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.419> every<00:05:24.750> single<00:05:24.900> time<00:05:25.400> and

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
having to copy it every single time and

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.790 
having to copy it every single time and
trying<00:05:26.639> to<00:05:26.759> integrate<00:05:27.030> it<00:05:27.360> in<00:05:27.599> is<00:05:28.259> a<00:05:28.680> great

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
trying to integrate it in is a great

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.450 
trying to integrate it in is a great
option<00:05:29.490> for<00:05:29.909> us<00:05:30.599> and<00:05:31.409> so<00:05:31.650> on<00:05:31.830> clothes<00:05:32.099> it's<00:05:32.310> got

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
option for us and so on clothes it's got

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.550 
option for us and so on clothes it's got
some<00:05:32.610> power<00:05:32.819> in<00:05:33.060> there<00:05:33.240> utilizing<00:05:33.960> so<00:05:34.139> as<00:05:34.409> we

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
some power in there utilizing so as we
