00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 what is coming now is probably the 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.940
 photography class more important than 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.980
 you will never receive camera handling 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.809
 totally manual I know that many of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.250
 you and you carry much 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.380
 time trying to do this as is 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.330
 because if what we are going to tell you is 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.609
 understand you will not have limits in 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.230
 photography will be a matter of time but 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.439
 you better dedicate yourself to something else 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.609
 we will never advance in this world is like 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.140
 want to be a cyclist 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.960
 the first thing is to learn to ride a bike 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.130
 something similar happens here let's see it 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.130
 you'll see how interesting 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.460
 light is the basis of photography not 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.590
 only because it allows us to see the objects 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.739
 but because it transports the image to the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.360
 film through the lens you can 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.340
 have a very well composed photograph 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.079
 and very well framed but if it's wrong 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.210
 of light you will not have anything 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.550
 the photograph will automatically lose 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.370
 all its charm and eclipse everything 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.440
 other than all the elements that it shuffles 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.909
 the photographer to create an image is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.550
 undoubtedly light the most determining 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.170
 one with which we like to play and 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.630
 with which you can get the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.939
 most spectacular results 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.950
 all cameras have in 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.590
 its inside a device called the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.110
 photometer the photometer or called also 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.840
 it is possible it is a very important piece 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.530
 of the camera whose function is to measure the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.530
 light of the scene 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.780
 although in some cameras the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.120
 Most lcd screen is displayed 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.890
 perfectly looking through the viewfinder 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.020
 of the camera while we press the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.740
 trigger in half to get it 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.740
 in operation 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.030
 most cameras are used the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.310
 numerical photometer this consists of about 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.130
 positive numbers aside plus one 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.159
 plus two and other negatives on the other side 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.140
 minus one minus two and a half appears a 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.770
 zero or a signal that marks the separation 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.770
 between both 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.880
 under a tiny square you will travel 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.729
 the scene or maybe a group of them 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.119
 signaling a value towards plus 0 or 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.119
 the least 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.070
 the photometer of a camera is regulated 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.440
 manipulating the diaphragm ring and the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.120
 shutter speed roulette with 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.290
 the camera in manual operation by 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.819
 supposed 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.739
 yes when moving either of these two 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.750
 controls the square moves towards 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.780
 the most the photo we make in that 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.360
 moment will come on exposed 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.569
 that is to say with too much light in the tree 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.430
 photographic we will say burnt you have left 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.319
 get too much light into the movie and 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.450
 because of this the image appears with that 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.120
 whitish tone the reproduction of the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.880
 objects and colors is lousy all 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.680
 it has too much light 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.690
 if instead the square is going towards 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.200
 at least the photo will be dark 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.120
 in the photographic tree we will say short no 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.040
 you have let enough light pass and 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.620
 therefore the colors are very 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.350
 switched off and the objects are barely visible 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.300
 the photo lacks light but without moving 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.850
 the wheel of shutter speeds and 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.220
 the diaphragm ring or just one or 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.080
 well the two alternately achieve that 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.910
 the square is below zero 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.910
 the photo will be perfect light 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.420
 the reproduction of colors and 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.850
 objects will be the ideal and the photograph 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.500
 it will be contemplated with great pleasure in addition 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.750
 of being a faithful portrait of what I saw 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.340
 our eye to this is called measuring the 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.790
 light of the scene or as we say the 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.440
 photographers adjust the exposure and it's 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.120
 that you have to be very clear that these 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.610
 devices what they do is bring light to the 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.530
 movie then you will have to regulate them 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.690
 ok if you want the picture to come out 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.790
 correct at the moment you should think that the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.410
 photometer is infallible therefore if 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.360
 you want a picture well done you must 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.850
 adjust it to zero that is to say half 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.620
 later we will see how in some 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.620
 Sometimes we will have to help you
