00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.590
 hello dear mayor recently 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.379
 update 90 has been released for simcity game 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.140
 and our team simcity for nss decided not 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.740
 ignore this event and so 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.740
 let's start 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.100
 update 90 is very big she 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.380
 fixes many flaws especially in 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.020
 addition of the city of the future as well 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.660
 It includes new content in the game this 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.800
 it's five new times 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.830
 sights they take a little 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.059
 places are inexpensive to maintain and increase 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.460
 garage happiness 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.390
 however such attractions 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.730
 are places low 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.640
 tourist attractions and accommodate 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.710
 only 192 sima these new objects you 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.610
 can find in the specialization menu 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.729
 culture section of interest in 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.680
 new settings appear in the game settings 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.110
 motion blur when ticked 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.509
 filmed then when moving the camera along 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.410
 the city you will not observe blur 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.240
 Images 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.670
 if it is set then 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.950
 blurring will be turned on as it was before 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.070
 today and so now let's talk 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.970
 on fixes first omega towers 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.820
 the first 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.910
 improved interaction between levels 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.220
 mega towers are now commercial level not 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.290
 will complain about the lack of buyers 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.799
 when the tower has the required residential 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.080
 level 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.640
 the second problem is fixed when 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.630
 characters complained about the lack of 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.520
 work 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.799
 although there was enough in the city 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.490
 the number of vacancies is also worth noting 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.990
 that now there is such a thing as 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.430
 overworked workers sim continue 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.740
 will inform you about 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.840
 congestion if they work 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.390
 For days on end, that is, they perform 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.460
 overtime therefore for 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.799
 correcting this situation will require 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.679
 more characters to venture 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.190
 produced goods in shifts it 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.860
 fine because now there will be even less 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.750
 unemployment third radiation is stronger 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.510
 affects the inhabitants of the mega tower 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.730
 the mood drops quickly and they leave 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.590
 her did not go unheeded and 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.739
 city ​​transportation system 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.900

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.579
 train clusters at the station 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.830
 the second tram will not continue 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.110
 get stuck and stand in groups 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.630
 of today trade utility 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.030
 services as well as control signal years with 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.820
 neighbors will generate income for 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.880
 service city we 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.280

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.830
 the volume of wastewater available in the region 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.420
 reaching regions unlocks 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.990

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.320
 past some graphical problems and 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.959
