 in 2007 kaka was chosen as the best soccer player on the planet 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:15.619
 and this year was voted by the magazine teams as one of the 100 most influential people 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.999
 of the world 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:23.809
 kaká will reveal to everyone the hope that motivates him to win will 

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:26.249
 further 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.839
 will have a very good youth always turned to football everything I did 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.220
 was to go back to football 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.980
 when the teams in the afternoon were in the morning present on the trellis mornings 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.070
 so if you get stuck this variation but in youth it was very good always 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.510
 growing 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.700
 with Bible formation, my parents always educated me that way, but that's enough. 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.400
 an hour that you follow unlinked this teaching of the parents and there you 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.700
 when you separate another personal experience from your parent's 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.530
 God 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.640
 when she was 18 she was October 2000 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.950
 I had a very serious accident coming down a medical slide. 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.200
 hits my head at the bottom of the pool on the head 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.810
 shot mid-ohio neck fractured the sixth vertebra of the Flemish neck and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.340
 Basque who spent a lot in his head 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.340
 the whole class can be voted on twice 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.120
 miguelito to abuse 18 years and every day 19 strengthen and pray 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.810
 one of the most sought after for the same thing talked look you had a lot 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.130
 lucky maybe if you could not get back winning all more salable 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.530
 That's when I said 'look at the most words, thank you, but it's a space of yours. 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.990
 God's deliverance is God's love 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.150
 showing that you have a purpose in my life through football can be a 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.060
 grave illness that would otherwise be the purpose of God then 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.980
 she needs yes in coincidence in October mustang 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.920
 in November and December with sick people last Saturday unable to do 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.910
 anything 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.939
 in January 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.929
 had a debut as a professional from São Paulo so I think things 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.860
 happen by chance god has a purpose of things 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.180
 it's one of the good things bad things 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.159
 but I always believe fiction thing that comes from God 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.579
 and in the end it will be a purpose 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.759
 excellent goes and perfect good pleasing the will of God 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.029
 story that word that snail 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:18.049
 the Barbarian 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.649
 in all other countries make companies the choice of women 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.010
 so now I wanted to go 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.099
 will grow the fuvest will putting it will be this way 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.949
 I believe that today you can 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.979
 is one of the most talking to me 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.249
 and when jesus says I am the way to truth and life 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.439
 sneijder jesus sees everything is the way to follow jesus christ 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.569
 life 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.569
 they lose their jobs and the abundant life 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.069
 it is wrong happiness joy to see them from dilma hours 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.069
 not every time disney would be the way to truth and life 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.279
 Look I can not 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:01.539
 do not even think I can not imagine what my civilian life would be like 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.099
 everything that I was everything that can be done through my life 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.469
 says figueiredo with the done 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.349
 definitely sales posts 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.939
 has a purpose 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.569
 What made the deposit and in this way 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:14.829
 it's a lot of inattention 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.100
 where did I arrive? 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.339
 the life for which God has much more what we ask to have overcome 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:23.059
 my mind is happening in the life of someone who on Sunday has never 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:27.539
 I thought about being the best player in the world and they are things that God does 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.179
 in our lives that since May I really can not imagine how 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:35.469
 it would certainly not be that way if it has not been used in my life 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:36.509
 I would not do 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.469
 Let's try to compose this program. 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.439
 besides these 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.079
 people who do not talk about me 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.459
 the inmates living in these people's lives have done in my life he 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.339
 will also do so
