00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.990
 hello to all guys and welcome back in 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.850
 this new video are paolo for 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.650
 otherwise it is Italy and we are here 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.720
 today with a new video this time 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.810
 let's talk about the team of the season 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.760
 germany and precisely we bring one of the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.310
 stronger players if not perhaps that one 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.210
 with the over or the highest or robben 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.470
 team of the season or 95 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.590
 amazing features but 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.260
 truly amazing is a player 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.700
 that can easily do on 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.290
 band any role though 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.050
 probably from external right e 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:50.060
 wasted by ats is all too easy 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.470
 use it and from to the right according to me the 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.840
 position in which it makes the best it is 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.670
 more fun the speed of this 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.390
 player is really something 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.950
 incredible 97 acceleration and 97 of 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.309
 maximum speed that make it 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.710
 really a splinter on the band i 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.150
 pass the ball he runs and without 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.520
 really no trouble 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.490
 then among other things to a ball control that 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.749
 it is fantastic in fact at 95 control 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.520
 ball and a speed of 95 with 95 of 

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:22.700
 ball control is something 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 really atomic the other dribbling 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.079
 which I loved it a lot 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.020
 feature I most preferred of 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.899
 this player and we can see that 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.530
 has a 98 of pure dribbling a 98 of 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.749
 agility 96 balance and 4 star skill 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.119
 I would like to bring attention to 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:44.749
 particular manner on the 98 of practicability 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.600
 is a player that when you use it yes 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:48.679
 feels this 93 agility is beautiful a 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.200
 change direction 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.539
 fast to do any kind of 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.920
 dribbling fast to discard the man 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.749
 he is very fast, he is a player 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.689
 amazing the shot is one 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:04.670
 a deadly feature indeed in 93 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.859
 penalization that allow him to 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.959
 score practically on each side then 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.780
 if we add that to a 98 i long 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.819
 shot 94 power tive you understand that 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.470
 you can really get it from anywhere 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.319
 not in a manner of speaking but because of its own 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.450
 pull is always take the door like 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.430
 minimum so the corner kick is there 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.560
 sometimes even the golletto yes 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.989
 escape 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.750
 the passage let's say it's not much 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.819
 sense agent is unimportant because a 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.650
 player like robben is present 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.930
 want not to go to the ball because 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.060
 take the ball with robben and triple 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.970
 the soul of the world 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.030
 the passage to 81 of long passages that 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.340
 however it is not bad in short, it is not 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.709
 I would actually know why I didn't 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.359
 and one but three short passages that already are 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.359
 more plausible because to do 12 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:56.409
 the can be really very useful 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:59.690
 physical strength is another feature 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.940
 that I expected maybe 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.909
 negative instead is really good a 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.470
 part because it has 70 of physical strength 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.200
 that maybe it's not much 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.200
 the problem is that the defender before 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.549
 to be able to shoulder robben must 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.230
 reach and that's the thing 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.840
 difficult to achieve it 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.180
 robben because it really has speed 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.220
 sensational so before throwing it away 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.790
 on the ground then besides the fact that also 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.910
 98 96 of balance therefore it is not falling 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.370
 very easily and then it's a strange thing 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.269
 for a for a wing as fast robben 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.560
 as robben at 87 of stamina then 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.310
 manages to quietly donate the whole 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.050
 The game ran like a madman 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.420
 this player's prices are not 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.120
 homogeneous between xbox playstation up 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.760
 playstation is in a range between one 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.340
 million and 700 thousand and 2 2 million and 600 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.770
 mila while on xbox the price is 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.890
 significantly lower between 300 and 500 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.560
 thousand credits is a player like that 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.050
 said it has not in my opinion equal is 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.060
 really really strong 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.310
 now we can move to the screen 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.020
 summary and we can see that not 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.840
 there is no cons while instead among the 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.140
 pro there is speed ball control 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.630
 dribbling the shot the pass e 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.930
 agility the agility that as I said 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.730
 even while I was talking about dribbling it is the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.430
 which most surprised me because a 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.400
 player so agile and so jerky not 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.840
 I had never really tried the cons 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.580
 as I said there was nobody and therefore 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.790
 I would say that all you can do is give 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.680
 10 to the player as the vote 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.570
 someone can say but the two stars 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.460
 which describe these weak sentences 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.760
 I'm a cons 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.370
 according to me no because robben has only 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.260
 one foot and we agree on that 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.850
 however, even when he finds himself pulling 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.320
 having to shoot with the right rather than 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.840
 takes with the right pull with the left 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.120
 from outside and makes goals that are still 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.040
 more beautiful then absolutely second 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.690
 me is the weakest issues are not a 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.370
 against why you don't hear this 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.230
 weakness is a fantastic player 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.669
 besides the fact that playing right 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.669
 he manages to centralize himself and manages to do 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.910
 Syria around any power shots 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.580
 kind of shot is really very strong 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.260
 I think there is little to say about robben 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.690
 he is a player who absolutely goes 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.090
 tried I can recommend you if you have 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.500
 of credits to prove it to stuff the 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.350
 teams also with players 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.260
 scarce enough to have fun again 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.300
 more because really trying this 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.520
 player understand what the power of 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.260
 an exterior 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.460
 I think I said it all as much 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.440
 concerns this player 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.550
 so let's go back to another video 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.480
 the next review 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.480
 Hi everyone
