now<00:02:27.300> I've<00:02:27.450> already<00:02:27.630> thin<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.170> primer<00:02:28.500> a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
now I've already thin this primer a

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
little bit with water and we'll put it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.330 
little bit with water and we'll put it
in<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.990> viscosity<00:02:31.350> Cup<00:02:31.800> let's<00:02:31.980> see<00:02:32.100> how<00:02:32.190> long

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
in the viscosity Cup let's see how long

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.130 
in the viscosity Cup let's see how long
it<00:02:32.520> takes<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.820> empty<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.180> cup<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
it takes to empty the cup the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.560 
it takes to empty the cup the
instructions<00:02:34.680> say<00:02:34.860> 30<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.280> 40<00:02:35.730> seconds<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.420> it

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.970 
instructions say 30 to 40 seconds and it
looks<00:02:36.720> like<00:02:36.810> we're<00:02:37.080> right<00:02:37.230> about<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:37.710> that

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
looks like we're right about on that

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
thickness with the viscosity trick we

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.860 
thickness with the viscosity trick we
can<00:02:40.860> now<00:02:41.070> fill<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.520> pink<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.570> note<00:02:42.720> that

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
can now fill the pink up you note that

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.600 
can now fill the pink up you note that
we're<00:02:42.990> going<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.170> use<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.380> filter<00:02:43.860> anyway<00:02:44.400> even

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
we're going to use a filter anyway even

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.250 
we're going to use a filter anyway even
though<00:02:44.820> there<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> strainer<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.050> cup

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
though there is a strainer in the cup

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260 
though there is a strainer in the cup
itself<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.400> insurance<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.150> no

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
particles get into the paint now we can

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.850 
particles get into the paint now we can
put<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.270> lid<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.870> lock<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.350> down<00:02:52.560> we're

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
put the lid on and lock it down we're

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.730 
put the lid on and lock it down we're
ready<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.280> paint<00:02:54.170> we're<00:02:55.170> going<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.350> start<00:02:55.620> with

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
ready to paint we're going to start with

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.950 
ready to paint we're going to start with
the<00:02:55.830> ear<00:02:55.980> cap<00:02:56.250> centered<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.730> 45<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.510> produce<00:02:57.810> a

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
the ear cap centered a 45 to produce a

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.870 
the ear cap centered a 45 to produce a
round<00:02:58.170> pattern<00:02:58.680> that's<00:02:59.130> good<00:02:59.370> for<00:02:59.580> spraying

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
round pattern that's good for spraying

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.800 
round pattern that's good for spraying
the<00:03:00.060> corners

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.080 

now<00:03:06.740> we<00:03:06.800> set<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.250> air<00:03:07.370> cap<00:03:07.610> for<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:07.880> vertical

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
now we set the air cap for a vertical

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.570 
now we set the air cap for a vertical
fan<00:03:08.750> pattern<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.770> we<00:03:09.920> can<00:03:10.069> paint<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.370> main

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
fan pattern and we can paint the main

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.610 
fan pattern and we can paint the main
