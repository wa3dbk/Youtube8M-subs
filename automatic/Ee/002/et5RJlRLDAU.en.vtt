network<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.289> think<00:00:31.500> making<00:00:31.740> februari<00:00:32.340> free

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
network I think making februari free

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.370 
network I think making februari free
where<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> think<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.570> lot<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.750> people<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.260> are

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
where I think a lot of people that are

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.840 
where I think a lot of people that are
only<00:00:34.530> gonna<00:00:34.680> watch<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.100> few<00:00:35.250> shows<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.670> year

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
only gonna watch a few shows a year

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.130 
only gonna watch a few shows a year
they're<00:00:36.180> gonna<00:00:36.300> come<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:36.989> before

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
they're gonna come in right before

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
they're gonna come in right before
WrestleMania<00:00:37.890> watch<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.340> free<00:00:38.520> preview<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
WrestleMania watch the free preview and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.209 
WrestleMania watch the free preview and
then<00:00:39.629> likely<00:00:39.899> keep<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.469> service<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.040> March

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
then likely keep the service for March

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.799 
then likely keep the service for March
because<00:00:41.489> you're<00:00:41.790> getting<00:00:42.030> WrestleMania<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.780> I

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
because you're getting WrestleMania so I

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.479 
because you're getting WrestleMania so I
think<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.320> could<00:00:43.469> see<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.739> as<00:00:43.920> an<00:00:44.070> annual

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
think we could see this as an annual

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.639 
think we could see this as an annual
promotion<00:00:45.360> from<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> w/e<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.379> month<00:00:46.559> of

promotion from the w/e for the month of
februari<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.340> would<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> smart<00:00:47.850> business

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
februari it would be a smart business

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.750

nothing because that was designed to

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.170

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
and the guy to beat him as the next big

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.430 
and the guy to beat him as the next big
thing<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:31.940> if<00:03:32.330> it's<00:03:32.570> in<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.780> three<00:03:32.810> way<00:03:33.020> it<00:03:33.290> gets

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440
