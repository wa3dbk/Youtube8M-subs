aslan<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.950> mention<00:02:21.340> doing<00:02:21.970> some<00:02:22.120> ergonomics

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
aslan to mention doing some ergonomics

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.890 
aslan to mention doing some ergonomics
with<00:02:22.840> that

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
with that

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.170 
with that
and<00:02:23.989> then<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:25.220> thing<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.519> still<00:02:25.730> need<00:02:25.939> to<00:02:26.030> do<00:02:26.150> I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
and then the thing I still need to do I

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.580 
and then the thing I still need to do I
haven't<00:02:26.420> been<00:02:26.689> so<00:02:26.870> busy<00:02:27.049> I<00:02:27.200> haven't<00:02:27.379> had<00:02:27.560> a

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
haven't been so busy I haven't had a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.960 
haven't been so busy I haven't had a
chance<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.950> order<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.430> train<00:02:28.610> him<00:02:28.670> on<00:02:28.819> any

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
chance to order and train him on any

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.399 
chance to order and train him on any
health<00:02:29.180> equipment<00:02:29.659> but<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:29.870> think<00:02:30.110> he<00:02:30.230> could

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
health equipment but I think he could

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.380 
health equipment but I think he could
use<00:02:30.439> a<00:02:30.620> bath<00:02:30.980> chair<00:02:31.010> for<00:02:31.640> showering<00:02:32.030> for<00:02:32.329> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
use a bath chair for showering for the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.660 
use a bath chair for showering for the
energy<00:02:32.689> conservation<00:02:33.049> and<00:02:33.620> then<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.549> know<00:02:34.640> I

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
energy conservation and then you know I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.069 
energy conservation and then you know I
just<00:02:34.849> really<00:02:35.090> think<00:02:35.239> as<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.420> team<00:02:35.689> we<00:02:35.870> need<00:02:35.900> to

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
just really think as a team we need to

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.880 
just really think as a team we need to
focus<00:02:36.319> on<00:02:36.620> his<00:02:36.890> priorities<00:02:38.319> what<00:02:39.319> about<00:02:39.500> Petey

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
focus on his priorities what about Petey

nightmare on the stairs he he doesn't he
needs<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.680> use<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.889> rail<00:03:10.069> and<00:03:10.220> he<00:03:10.310> doesn't<00:03:10.730> um

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
needs to use the rail and he doesn't um

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.589 
needs to use the rail and he doesn't um
let's<00:03:12.109> see<00:03:12.319> follow<00:03:12.739> up<00:03:13.030> he<00:03:14.030> complains<00:03:14.389> a<00:03:14.480> lot

let's see follow up he complains a lot

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.599 
let's see follow up he complains a lot
about<00:03:14.780> his<00:03:14.930> arthritis<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:15.829> so<00:03:16.099> we<00:03:16.340> probably

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
about his arthritis and so we probably

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.360 
about his arthritis and so we probably
need<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.000> get<00:03:17.239> some<00:03:17.510> PT<00:03:17.870> on<00:03:17.989> board<00:03:18.319> to<00:03:18.739> help<00:03:19.040> him

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
need to get some PT on board to help him

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.330 
need to get some PT on board to help him
with<00:03:19.519> that<00:03:19.700> pain<00:03:19.970> later<00:03:20.650> he<00:03:21.650> might<00:03:21.859> be<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.069> good

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
with that pain later he might be a good

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.690 
with that pain later he might be a good
candidate<00:03:22.730> for<00:03:22.790> cardiac<00:03:23.239> rehab<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.680> then<00:03:25.400> I

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
candidate for cardiac rehab and then I

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.119 
candidate for cardiac rehab and then I
don't<00:03:25.970> he<00:03:26.180> just<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.720> TMJ<00:03:27.170> seems<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.829> be<00:03:27.919> a<00:03:27.949> real

don't he just the TMJ seems to be a real

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.800 
don't he just the TMJ seems to be a real
issue<00:03:28.160> too<00:03:28.669> so<00:03:28.970> somebody<00:03:29.329> needs<00:03:29.449> to<00:03:29.629> do

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
issue too so somebody needs to do

simvastatin<00:03:52.129> is<00:03:52.639> on<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.909> VA<00:03:53.060> formulary<00:03:53.659> and

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
simvastatin is on the VA formulary and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.809 
simvastatin is on the VA formulary and
that<00:03:54.019> would<00:03:54.169> be<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.290> good<00:03:54.500> choice<00:03:54.799> but<00:03:55.280> somebody

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
that would be a good choice but somebody

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.159 
that would be a good choice but somebody

think our cardiac education with a

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.390 
think our cardiac education with a
spouse<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.120> Rehab<00:04:53.510> of<00:04:53.690> course<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.290> all<00:04:55.190> that

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
spouse and Rehab of course and all that

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.790 
spouse and Rehab of course and all that
other<00:04:55.580> stuff<00:04:55.700> that<00:04:55.910> goes<00:04:56.060> with<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.800> looks

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
other stuff that goes with that looks

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.260 
other stuff that goes with that looks
like<00:04:57.980> he<00:04:58.220> and<00:04:58.280> his<00:04:58.430> wife<00:04:58.460> need<00:04:58.970> an<00:04:59.090> energy

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
like he and his wife need an energy

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.420 
like he and his wife need an energy
expenditure<00:05:00.140> you<00:05:00.500> know<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:01.190> information

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
expenditure you know the information

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.360 
expenditure you know the information
taking<00:05:02.120> vital<00:05:02.420> signs<00:05:02.660> and<00:05:03.110> those<00:05:04.100> other
