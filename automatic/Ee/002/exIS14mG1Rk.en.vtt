00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
damn close in my opinion now obviously

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.390 
damn close in my opinion now obviously
if<00:01:31.259> i'm<00:01:31.439> wrong<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:31.920> i'll<00:01:32.040> put<00:01:32.220> up<00:01:32.250> an

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
if i'm wrong then i'll put up an

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.100 
if i'm wrong then i'll put up an
annotation<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> screen<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.540> something

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.569 
along those lines to let you guys know
so<00:01:36.479> basically<00:01:36.840> keep<00:01:37.200> an<00:01:37.350> eye<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.130> 28th

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
so basically keep an eye out on the 28th

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.490 
so basically keep an eye out on the 28th
or<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.090> 4th<00:01:39.420> because<00:01:39.780> those<00:01:39.990> two<00:01:40.259> are<00:01:40.470> very

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
or the 4th because those two are very

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.069 
or the 4th because those two are very
possible<00:01:41.430> release<00:01:41.729> dates<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.360> final<00:01:42.750> stand

coming<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> DLC<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.290> safe<00:01:52.530> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
coming with the DLC I think it's safe to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.289 
coming with the DLC I think it's safe to
say<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.950> there<00:01:53.250> aren't<00:01:53.460> enough<00:01:53.610> weapons<00:01:54.149> in

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
say that there aren't enough weapons in

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.209 
say that there aren't enough weapons in
the<00:01:54.390> game<00:01:54.420> already<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.409> there<00:01:55.590> really<00:01:55.799> isn't

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the game already so there really isn't

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.490 
the game already so there really isn't
any<00:01:56.399> need<00:01:56.490> for<00:01:56.729> new<00:01:57.090> ones<00:01:57.329> now<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:58.320> my<00:01:58.469> opinion

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
any need for new ones now in my opinion

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.260 
any need for new ones now in my opinion
I<00:01:59.040> would<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.250> liked<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.729> new<00:01:59.909> weapons

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
I would have liked to see new weapons

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.120 
I would have liked to see new weapons

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
since that is my favorite part of each

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.670 
since that is my favorite part of each
DLC<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.030> mean<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.509> using<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> same<00:02:04.409> old

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
DLC I mean just using the same old

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.560

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
weapons over and over again is just

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.869 
weapons over and over again is just
boring<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.560> repetitive<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.459> definitely

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879

now since final stand is very futuristic

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.780 
now since final stand is very futuristic
it's<00:02:31.140> obviously<00:02:31.530> going<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:32.040> prototypes

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
is a very accurate weapon with the only

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.619 
is a very accurate weapon with the only
downside<00:02:38.310> being<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:38.940> have<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.450> let<00:02:39.599> it

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
downside being that you have to let it

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.839 
downside being that you have to let it
charge<00:02:39.959> up<00:02:40.170> after<00:02:40.500> pulling<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.920> trigger<00:02:41.129> so

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
charge up after pulling the trigger so

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.339 
charge up after pulling the trigger so
if<00:02:42.090> you're<00:02:42.180> going<00:02:42.329> after<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.690> moving<00:02:43.140> target

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
that gives you a bit of a challenge when

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.210

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.449 
yeah it looks cool and is fun to use but
I<00:03:15.450> just<00:03:15.720> don't<00:03:15.900> see<00:03:16.170> myself<00:03:16.349> using<00:03:16.829> it<00:03:17.099> all<00:03:17.250> too

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
I just don't see myself using it all too

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.819 
I just don't see myself using it all too
often<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:18.449> only<00:03:18.480> gadget<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.169> we<00:03:19.290> seem<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.739> be

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
often the only gadget that we seem to be

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.369 
often the only gadget that we seem to be
getting<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.280> called<00:03:20.639> the<00:03:20.819> ds3<00:03:21.239> decoy<00:03:22.019> and

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
getting is called the ds3 decoy and

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.080 
getting is called the ds3 decoy and
judging<00:03:22.799> by<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.949> title<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.459> think<00:03:23.699> it's<00:03:23.819> pretty

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
judging by the title I think it's pretty

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.849 
judging by the title I think it's pretty
damn<00:03:24.389> obvious<00:03:24.419> as<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.019> what<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.620> thing<00:03:25.829> does

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
damn obvious as to what this thing does

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.520 
damn obvious as to what this thing does
if<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:26.970> throw<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.269> down<00:03:27.419> after<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> few<00:03:28.109> seconds

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.080 
if you throw it down after a few seconds
it<00:03:28.620> will<00:03:28.739> activate<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.549> on<00:03:29.609> your<00:03:29.760> enemies

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
anyone there it essentially gives you

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
the perfect time to kill them so I can
