00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:02.400
 In addition, it is standard 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.650
 you can always expect the craziest things in terms of ideas and cda it must be 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.049
 serve 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.179
 But look at the world that makes you the turning point 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.739
 gets new insights in a very different way with people 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 morningstar days 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.710
 admittedly years of katwijk campenhout carrÃ© in amsterdam 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.110
 and this is the place where martijn aslander office a few times a week 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.259
 people from all over the country come around one hour at the end of March 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.199
 to be able to bind to martijn aslan in it stay nice, he calls himself and 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.450
 his talent is actually a people of all kinds 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.940
 just connect after talking 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.000
 and a mutual and talent exchange so that nice new ones 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.250
 innovative projects can arise 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.500
 well that he himself has to tell about what he would have 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.790
 to commit 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.660
 that's what the nonsense said 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.890
 that's the debate that's the story 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.050
 it's a another place close to the station that was on the internet and people 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.370
 the coffee and good food 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.229
 our 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.799
 what you do arose yes i like to meet people nice to 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.670
 helping people with the challenge 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.050
 which can 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.520
 mostly look at the church context and if I do it with you 6 noon one 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.500
 feeling of 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.230
 together 4 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.600
 there are three roles that 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.720
 say it 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.830
 the first role is that of party leader 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.360
 party leader is someone who still plays a lot in a very playful way 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.870
 news that the four families 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.650
 To that end, one is typically looking to make it very easy with huge amounts 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.940
 information and the chance to go 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.290
 which in particular the second round against the role of connecting 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.510
 what i actually 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.960
 doing it all day long 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.549
 combining people's information and ideas and my third round like that of 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.470
 the bills make a contraction of woods looser wizard 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.380
 and source does 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.150
 the wild world into a three types of people 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.370
 stupid and people often don't know so I like people upstairs 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.330
 average 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.290
 that the GS are fast 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.270
 in other words casting herbs and if they are flexible above average 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.820
 others get confused as things change and in a changing world 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.820
 everything can certainly be done with the project again 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.150
 it also helps when it's over but we can do it as well as you 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.430
 contain very new things mentally and that is the world in which we live that 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.389
 new things and movement so it is useful if people open above average 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:28.779
 market 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.199
 Well, with capital letters, the most important property country is 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.239
 curious people who have their mouths shut if you haven't seen them for a while 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.409
 neither themselves 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.450
 and a few years when all the nice people I have are curious too 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:41.789
 discovering things then you can learn from each other 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.789
 And that actually fits both networking worlds that are now emerging 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.579
 In addition, bee must have a lot of guts 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.790
 so don't be afraid to enter my ambition tanks a third grow and you go 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.429
 experiencing things 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:56.659
 and how sweet she must be 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.890
 A letter I actually mean Amsterdam fuss as people who prefer 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.659
 lukaku on selfless so the willingness to do something for another 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.859
 wanting to do without being pressured back 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.579
 and integer 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.559
 do not harm another in favor of yourself 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.129
 that are a completely different exchange mechanism 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.389
 that revolved around the readshop mutual balance 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.179
 and not just hard economic as systems that 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.369
 and if he gets bite 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.919
 so took care of it 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.060
 less time and with much less stress what matters is that you contrast it 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.600
 system just about reliable system that you know 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.419
 there is all I have to do 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.809
 it is in no hurry musically all day long I write on these cards that 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:53.499
 handy are low costs and always in my pocket or inside pocket 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:54.579
 to fit 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.909
 as the cooked information 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.540
 and when I'm on the train, I'm also sitting at the meeting where only a few 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.199
 percent of their brain 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.879
 and that he is denouncing so we will have to share these people 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.620
 these people have to communicate and so i'm going to those data clubs there is currently that 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.539
 you could move it more time now 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:15.029
 would be fair then if you have good things to hand that you should do 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:16.719
 I am actually an information 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:20.239
 it's great to learn and combine to develop where is it 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.009
 cheapest next to the source often takes the least effort to bother her 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.430
 and there I can reverse where the criteria come from 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.029
 nice is that what to do back comics winfried freudenberg seems human 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:35.369
 actually i'm manic positive in the end remains a lot about art 

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:39.139
 from telling I have lived and not for myself I am not concerned with it 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.930
 collecting stuff 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.930
 ma i first thought changed 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.949
 the 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.949
 k 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.560
 the
