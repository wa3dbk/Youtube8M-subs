you might need to try different speed
for<00:02:09.020> that<00:02:09.080> rpm<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.770> know<00:02:09.890> or<00:02:10.130> something<00:02:10.760> like

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
for that rpm you know or something like

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.890 
for that rpm you know or something like
that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:28.010 

here<00:02:14.470> we<00:02:14.530> go<00:02:14.620> again

one<00:03:11.209> set<00:03:11.390> up<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.659> easier<00:03:12.349> than<00:03:12.469> throttle<00:03:12.950> in

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
one set up is easier than throttle in

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.660

Oklahoma<00:03:13.870> then<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.019> I<00:03:15.049> ease<00:03:15.439> it<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.040> wonder

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
Oklahoma then that I ease it you wonder

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.849 
Oklahoma then that I ease it you wonder
rpms<00:03:17.239> out<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:17.599> have<00:03:17.689> to<00:03:17.780> do<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:17.959> in<00:03:18.049> such<00:03:18.230> lower

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
rpms out you have to do it in such lower

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.369 
rpms out you have to do it in such lower
gears<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.549> lower<00:03:19.730> gearing<00:03:20.480> like<00:03:21.230> the

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
gears and the lower gearing like the

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.399 
gears and the lower gearing like the
slow<00:03:21.620> you're<00:03:21.950> going<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:23.780> know<00:03:23.930> it's<00:03:24.140> way<00:03:24.379> more

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
slow you're going you know it's way more

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.229 
slow you're going you know it's way more
jerky<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.129> harder<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.489> control<00:03:25.760> because<00:03:26.120> the

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
jerky and harder to control because the

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.119 
jerky and harder to control because the
engine<00:03:26.569> are<00:03:26.659> the<00:03:27.200> gear<00:03:27.409> lasers<00:03:27.799> are<00:03:27.920> such

engine are the gear lasers are such

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.459 
engine are the gear lasers are such
closer<00:03:28.459> together<00:03:28.700> this<00:03:29.120> is<00:03:30.019> good<00:03:30.200> English

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:30.469 
closer together this is good English
