182 it's an interesting brew and a very

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.930 
182 it's an interesting brew and a very
interesting<00:03:53.569> try<00:03:54.020> at<00:03:54.380> something<00:03:54.440> new<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.790> the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
interesting try at something new in the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.510 
interesting try at something new in the
porter<00:03:56.360> realm<00:03:56.750> but<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.530> think<00:03:57.800> it<00:03:57.890> misses<00:03:58.280> and

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
porter realm but I think it misses and

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.059 
porter realm but I think it misses and
it<00:03:59.150> doesn't<00:03:59.420> retain<00:03:59.720> enough<00:04:00.080> of<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.620> porter

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
it doesn't retain enough of the porter

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.520 
it doesn't retain enough of the porter
