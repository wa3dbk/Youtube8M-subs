works

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.200 

when<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> gasifier<00:01:13.409> will<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.100> Italy<00:01:14.340> first

when the gasifier will be in Italy first

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.530 
when the gasifier will be in Italy first
we<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.020> open<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.560> air<00:01:16.740> valve<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.540> in

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
we have to open the air valve to the in

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.340 
we have to open the air valve to the in
litter<00:01:18.870> and<00:01:19.290> holdin<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.190> ship<00:01:20.690> after<00:01:21.690> this<00:01:22.080> is

and<00:01:33.410> then<00:01:34.410> we<00:01:34.680> blow<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> little<00:01:35.580> bit<00:01:37.640> wire

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
and then we blow a little bit wire

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.480 
and then we blow a little bit wire
inside<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:41.600> small<00:01:42.600> pop<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.619> reveal<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.250> there

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
inside a small pop to reveal that there

inside a small pop to reveal that there
is<00:01:44.700> fire

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.669 

now<00:02:03.200> there<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.280> fire<00:02:04.969> in<00:02:04.999> the<00:02:05.390> gasifier<00:02:05.960> and

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
now there is fire in the gasifier and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:13.270 
now there is fire in the gasifier and
some<00:02:07.579> smoke<00:02:07.999> this<00:02:08.509> case

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.440 

to<00:02:13.490> see<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.120> gas<00:02:15.490> impossible

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.949 

and<00:02:19.780> fire<00:02:20.020> here<00:02:20.380> in<00:02:20.410> Atlanta

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
and fire here in Atlanta

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.449 
and fire here in Atlanta
when<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.439> gas<00:02:23.909> becomes<00:02:24.909> combustible<00:02:25.290> then

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
when the gas becomes combustible then

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.020 
when the gas becomes combustible then
we<00:02:27.609> cats<00:02:28.060> choir<00:02:28.359> and<00:02:28.689> we<00:02:28.750> see<00:02:29.079> it<00:02:29.200> up<00:02:29.290> again

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
we cats choir and we see it up again

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:48.830 
we cats choir and we see it up again
gasifier<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.299> ready<00:02:31.510> for<00:02:31.780> wrong

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.440 

sometimes<00:02:49.800> this<00:02:50.010> preheating<00:02:50.760> maybe<00:02:51.030> little

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
sometimes this preheating maybe little

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.520 
sometimes this preheating maybe little
bit<00:02:51.599> teasers<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:53.870> indeed<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.020> doesn't<00:02:55.319> take

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
bit teasers but indeed it doesn't take

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.000 
bit teasers but indeed it doesn't take
so<00:02:55.770> very<00:02:55.950> long<00:02:56.220> time<00:02:56.959> very<00:02:57.959> soon<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.440> gas<00:02:58.620> will

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
so very long time very soon the gas will

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.580 
so very long time very soon the gas will
burn<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.610> then<00:03:00.420> we<00:03:00.599> just<00:03:00.900> fill<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.380> gas

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
burn and then we just fill the gas

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.420 
burn and then we just fill the gas
piping<00:03:02.190> with<00:03:02.520> gas<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.150> after<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:05.190> car

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.320 
piping with gas and after that the car
is<00:03:05.580> ready<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:06.060> drying<00:03:07.610> meanwhile<00:03:08.610> we<00:03:09.180> can
