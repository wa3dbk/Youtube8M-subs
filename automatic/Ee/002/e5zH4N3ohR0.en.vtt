00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.180
 It was the early morning of Monday and I realized you forgot to take your clothes for dry cleaning 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.260
 You can not find your keys and do not have a clue about your Facebook password. 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.680
 As soon as you start to panic, your memory seems to weaken somewhat. 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.440
 But your brain was designed to forget 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.620
 This is not necessarily a bad thing. 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.640
 [Introduction BrainCraft] 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.760
 Psychological theories try to find the meaning of forgetting parts of information 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.040
 Like all our secret words. 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.680
 The theory of damage suggests that the reason for our inability to recover information is that over time 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.720
 The effects of our memories fade away until they eventually disappear. 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.360
 Interference theory suggests that new memories compete with existing memories. 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.660
 When this new information is similar to a memory you previously owned, that information conflicts with your ability 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 To retrieve previous memories. 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.420
 In some cases we can not even store our ideas in the first place 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.020
 Neuroscientists suggest that many of these theories can be tangled at the molecular level of your brain. 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.520
 We have a "forgetting protein" in our brains called Musashi 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.400
 It works to prevent the stability of nerve clamps, structures that allow neurons to communicate with one another. 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.600
 We have another protein called adenosine that has the opposite effect 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.640
 It actually stimulates the growth of nerve clamps. 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.400
 Remembering and forgetting ideas seems like street fighting between the Musashi and the Adocene 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.160
 Their influence and determination of who is the winner depends on whether our thoughts are transmitted across 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.500
 Neural clamps are fixed and stored firmly in memory. 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.400
 In one study, researchers modified a type of genetically engineered worm 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.580
 To become the brains of these worms do not contain the Mosaic - Named them worms transformed ninja - 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.660
 Normal worms and mutant worms have learned new information, but mutant worms - which do not contain mosaics - 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.620
 Was able to retrieve information better, and was less likely to forget. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.040
 By removing "forgetfulness protein" we can learn more about how it works. 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.600
 This can help us understand the disorders that make people lose their memories like Alzheimer's patients 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.540
 And the way they are treated 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.440
 Sadly, however, we can not remove the mascara from our brains to get a supernatural memory. 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.560
 Our brains forget deliberately 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.420
 We need to forget, because the ability to forget information keeps our brains flexible to absorb new things. 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.160
 If we did not forget we would be constantly and randomly remembered 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.180
 Information is not substantial and we will not have the ability to focus on the present 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.580
 Forgetting your secret word is frustrating but completely natural. 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.300
 As we move forward in our daily lives, we unconsciously find a balance between remembering and forgetting 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.940
 If "brain launch" or "moment of vandalism" is not so bad. 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.500
 Forgetfulness helps you remember.
