00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 after seven years out of the market the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.910
 chevrolet brought back a star of the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.230
 roads 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.570
 the 2010 camaro with an average price of 24 thousand 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.490
 dollars for model v6 this machine 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.580
 with a high performance dose has 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.650
 low cost but high speed 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.029
 now it's time to paint it in the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.789
 factory painting 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.400
 the camaro's body is mounted and receives 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.170
 a protective anticorrosion layer each 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.900
 employee who enters this sector 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.040
 needs to undergo the same comic ritual 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.320
 of the day when I was to work 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.360
 seen a garment of dirt and lint and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.280
 Step by an air jet to ensure 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.690
 that there is no contamination that can 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.690
 spoil the paint of your vehicle 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.410
 Today the diary removes all dust from lint 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.469
 fabric and ensures that not wonder at the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.510
 paint if any dust and small 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.210
 particles are trapped under the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.340
 paint they can form air bubbles and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.109
 with bursting and cratering 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.809
 finish of the camaro when it enters 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.579
 in the oven to dry the paint but before 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.500
 of any paint is applied 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.420
 each car that entered the workshop 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.060
 painting must be submitted to a 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.700
 sealing process carried out by the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.770
 four- camera mounted robots on the ground 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.350
 take photos on the underside of the camaro and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.729
 saw the photos for the computer that he checks 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.439
 if the car is in perfect condition 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.990
 to be sealed 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.640
 if all is right not sent to 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.640
 the robots continue to work 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.860
 apply a layer of sealant every 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.270
 joints sealed compartment 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.520
 passenger door bags 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.930
 the openings for the wheels this guarantees 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.960
 that our customers do not have a vehicle 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.310
 with infiltration of water is very similar 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.140
 with a fence or a sink 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.600
 this is so important for the assembly of 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.560
 a car that another layer of sealant 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.680
 applied 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.420
 this time by humans people 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.220
 are very important to the process 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.970
 the robots apply the bulk of the products 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.450
 of paint and sealant but we 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.280
 we depend on our trained workers 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.790
 to make sure the robots are 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.050
 doing a good job 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.730
 All Sealing Inspection Work 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.720
 preparation and subsequent checking and 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.269
 by workers 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.150
 after each car is completely 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.890
 sealed it goes for a final inspection 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.260
 with white gloves 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.910
 before the first cover of tic and we 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.180
 we look for any minor imperfections 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.920
 that may cause another defect 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.880
 later in the process it is 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.799
 important to remove any dust or 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.420
 imperfection at this point of service 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.810
 It will give more work to repair more 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.810
 evening 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.890
 then the car goes to the cab of 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.700
 paint where it receives ink jets 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.700
 powder 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.740
 the ink is controlled electronically 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.470
 to be applied directly in the 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.170
 car the metal body acts like a magnet 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.890
 attracting it to the surface and 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.890
 of the vehicle 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.730
 lunch is almost like a magnet 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.110
 the charged particles are attracted 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.600
 by the vehicle itself 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.520
 after that process and taken to a 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.770
 oven with extremely high temperature 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.930
 which transforms the one puts a liquid that is 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.990
 cooked on the vehicle to form a 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.550
 resistant layer 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.580
 before the car received its layer 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.010
 There is one more cleaning step 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.750
 the fire before the car enters the cabin 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.580
 we have a feather duster made with 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.620
 ostrich feathers that make the powder 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.480
 trying to remove lint or dust 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.400
 that could create a defect in the 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.540
 car that will be cooked together with the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:01.210
 painting is understanding well finally time 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.210
 to apply one of ten bold colors 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.700
 It's also in the car that has 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.380
 color information and options that 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.120
 will be placed 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.150
 another reminder in front of the 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.100
 spray that of a bar code and in the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.850
 computer system it looks for which 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.880
 are the car's options 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.160
 this first car will be red and the 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.970
 from here we'll follow around the 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.280
 the rest of the production line when a 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.240
 car enters the glass cabin was he 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.430
 connect device that drives robots 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.380
 from there the robots will follow a 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.450
 step-by-step pre-programmed shooting 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.760
 jets toward the different parts of 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.040
 cars some of our robots are used 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.530
 to open luggage compartment doors and covers 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.890
 the ink is applied in the form of a rich 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.890
 son 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.700
 and spreads evenly over the 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.700
 car surface 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.270
 It is interesting that it is the same time the 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.070
 car is being painted red 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.560
 while the back car is being 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.590
 painted yellow without at least 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.690
 a drop of wrong ink ends up falling on 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.970
 either vehicle 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:26.920
 the paint is applied through 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:29.080
 electricity and magnetism to the 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.440
 painting has five cabins that apply 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.020
 all different types of colors each 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.300
 line pint of 40 cars per hour 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.200
 the camaro now goes to the oven to 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.720
 dry the car after it is applied 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.820
 and is also heated giving the car 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.800
 visable and flawless finish 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.410
 after spending 25 minutes inside a 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.230
 oven at 135 degrees centigrade 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.700
 the inspectors this life the service to un 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.770
 hope that we are getting to layer 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.360
 transparent final on the demand ink 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.000
 of imperfections and dirt that 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.250
 should be there and we find 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.350
 something we close and then 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.520
 polymers 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.310
 basically this is the last step before 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.920
 customer receives the car so it is very 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.410
 important to make sure that we are going 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.050
 remove all imperfections but something 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.710
 draws the attention of this inspector who 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.710
 we live something here 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.000
 we've already seen a dust in the layer 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.040
 transparent then we had to close 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.660
 to remove the residue 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.880
 Now that we pollute, I'm just going to paint. 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.570
 again it will come back to shine as anti 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.570
 to take 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.830
 we are now as bright as before
