and I'm pretty sure this is easier to do
if<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.040> don't<00:01:17.190> have<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:18.360> freshly<00:01:18.810> clean

guess<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.870> do<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.080> whenever<00:01:26.060> yeah<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
guess you can do it whenever yeah and
