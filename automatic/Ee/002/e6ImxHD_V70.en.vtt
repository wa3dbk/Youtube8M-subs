00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
back up a little bit here if it folded

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.710 
back up a little bit here if it folded

corners in again and written the numbers

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.830 
corners in again and written the numbers
on<00:00:35.789> then<00:00:36.789> in<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.000> video<00:00:37.239> it<00:00:37.420> tells<00:00:37.629> you<00:00:37.750> to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
right in these in these holes here this

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.779 
right in these in these holes here this
part<00:00:54.160> will<00:00:54.250> be<00:00:54.280> on<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.519> inside<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.550> fold<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:57.699> in
