00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
could be a little bit better but

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.520 
could be a little bit better but
otherwise<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.790> go<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.420> top<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.229> type

and you can and write some stuff
shouldn't<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.869> too<00:01:33.990> much<00:01:34.140> because<00:01:34.380> well<00:01:35.280> it's

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
shouldn't be too much because well it's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.149 
shouldn't be too much because well it's
not<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.850> easy<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.360> fast<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.590> quite

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
not that easy and fast but it's a quite

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.980 
not that easy and fast but it's a quite
nice<00:01:38.400> example<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.509> course<00:01:39.540> use

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
nice example but you can of course use
