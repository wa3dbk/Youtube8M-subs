00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.360
 then welcome to the stand lg 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.900
 Today we are in the living room 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.900
 digital 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:24.570
 in Paris we are here to present you a 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:28.269
 55 oled curved so 55 and at 980 which 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.960
 today is marketed at 7990 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:35.079
 euros the particularity of this screen 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:41.739
 it's to be in whitehall technology 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:44.829
 so help wsj vlg actually to add a 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.109
 sub pixels in fact white at 3,300 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.120
 pixels so red green blue for 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:53.260
 bring a lot more homogeneity in 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.879
 did what at the slab also have some 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.699
 contrasts that are excessively 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.039
 deep this start the oled we are close 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.530
 from scratch you can do but you 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.699
 do not want to be too serious so here we come 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.540
 on a product 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:12.250
 ok in terms of slab speed 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.610
 excessively habib sylla 001 and 10 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.600
 seconds 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.829
 and so it's actually pretty much 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.680
 the equivalent of what does a 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:24.580
 Plasma TV today 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.810
 you had but also you 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.360
 also have an angle of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.370
 vision is almost perfect in fact to 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.320
 178 degrees I'm going very very little 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.760
 brightness loss actually at the level of 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.830
 the slab and you have 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.200
 among other things on this TV in fact 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.090
 the addition of a sound system that was a 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.850
 little bit improved since the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.630
 television so that's a system 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.910
 2.1 or there you have speakers on 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.960
 the sides we call at register 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.690
 speak earth actually integrated in this 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.840
 gorgeous foot crystal game that delivers 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.910
 40 at the TV level you 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.040
 also have sound game that comes out under 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.630
 the slab is actually passing them on 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.320
 this wave at the back of the sights for 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.090
 return to the spectators in doing 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.190
 exactly in the TV actually at 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.890
 this particularity of making 4.3 mm 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.470
 thick on the side of the slab 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.480
 so it's a real feat 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.980
 technological and finishing at the back 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.850
 in fact we have a fiber finish 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.680
 carbon is called this is it's 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.580
 materials that are used in 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.459
 aeronautics 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.459
 we receive on luxury vehicles 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.280
 that's the level of connectivity 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.110
 complete connectivity of the usb 4 hdmi 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.610
 behind 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.490
 you are technologies then yes well 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.170
 yes he will go caste mira case you have 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:58.260
 also the tfc also from noon on 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.510
 the product a nice complementarity 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.690
 with the ecosystem of connected products 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.330
 you see all of your 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.090
 content according to different 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.550
 peripherals thanks in particular to the 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.150
 presence of the smart tv alger although 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.410
 you know with a complete portal 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.810
 be it at the high level 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.209
 content or connectivity between 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.010
 the different devices 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.080
 likewise to the presence of seven matches 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.720
 control modes today is 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.510
 truly Belgian specificity and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.420
 so it's a gyroscopic remote 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.820
 which actually allows 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.900
 control the TV very 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.540
 simple and very playful at times goes by 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.300
 gesture pointing but also to 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.940
 using a small wheel makes my 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.690
 on two successes lets scroller in 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.310
 made at different level 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.709
 outfits and simply navigate in the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.709
 smart tv and also by voice
