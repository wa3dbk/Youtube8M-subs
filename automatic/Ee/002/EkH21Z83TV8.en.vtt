really the point of this commentary what
I'm<00:01:42.570> trying<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> make<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.320> whole<00:01:43.649> point

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
I'm trying to make with this whole point

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.149 
I'm trying to make with this whole point
is<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.720> we<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.140> whole<00:01:46.320> bubble<00:01:46.979> of

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
is that we have this whole bubble of

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.830 
is that we have this whole bubble of
like<00:01:47.369> Twitter<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.880> YouTube<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.509> all<00:01:48.689> these

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
things where we're expecting we expect

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.109 
things where we're expecting we expect
the<00:01:51.659> game<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> go<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.920> well<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.520> us<00:01:53.759> because<00:01:53.939> we

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the game to go so well for us because we

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.109 
the game to go so well for us because we
see<00:01:54.329> other<00:01:54.479> people<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.229> well<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.909> we<00:01:56.909> kind

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
see other people do so well and we kind

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.300 
see other people do so well and we kind
of<00:01:57.180> get<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.420> notion<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.799> only<00:01:59.040> have

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
of get this notion that we can only have

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.880 
of get this notion that we can only have
fun<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> game<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.630> we're<00:02:01.560> doing

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
fun with the game if we're doing

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.359

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
to lie it can be satisfying to get those

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.110 
to lie it can be satisfying to get those
games<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.160> see<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.490> leaderboards<00:02:36.030> and

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
games and to see the leaderboards and

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.540 
games and to see the leaderboards and
see<00:02:36.300> you're<00:02:36.480> at<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.750> top<00:02:36.930> with<00:02:37.290> maybe<00:02:37.950> 150

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
see you're at the top with maybe 150

see you're at the top with maybe 150
kills<00:02:38.970> or<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.570> that's<00:02:40.350> pretty<00:02:41.160> cool<00:02:41.340> and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
kills or so and that's pretty cool and

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.400 
kills or so and that's pretty cool and
it's<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:41.880> actually<00:02:42.540> pretty<00:02:42.660> satisfying<00:02:43.200> but

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
it's it's actually pretty satisfying but

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.710 
it's it's actually pretty satisfying but
that's<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:43.850> that's<00:02:44.850> not<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.330> only<00:02:45.360> way<00:02:45.660> to

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
that's not that's not the only way to

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.120 
that's not that's not the only way to
have<00:02:45.900> fun<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.350> would<00:02:46.590> say<00:02:46.770> it's<00:02:46.920> not<00:02:47.070> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
have fun and I would say it's not the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.760 
have fun and I would say it's not the
best<00:02:47.490> way<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.730> have<00:02:47.970> fun<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.480> I've<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:49.590> kind

with it and that's where it's easy to

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.729 
with it and that's where it's easy to
say<00:03:23.040> oh<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.820> game<00:03:24.060> sucks<00:03:24.630> nuts<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.530> not

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
when it becomes not fun I think and I

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.520 
when it becomes not fun I think and I
think<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.239> game<00:04:06.420> was<00:04:06.630> more<00:04:07.050> made<00:04:07.260> just

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
think that the game was more made just

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.979 
think that the game was more made just
to<00:04:07.680> be<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.310> casual<00:04:08.910> shooter<00:04:09.209> with<00:04:09.390> friends<00:04:09.810> and

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
to be a casual shooter with friends and

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.470 
to be a casual shooter with friends and
that's<00:04:10.140> really<00:04:10.980> literally<00:04:11.610> what<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.180> it's

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
that's really literally what it is it's

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.020 
that's really literally what it is it's
supposed<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.959> be<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.410> casual<00:04:14.280> shooter<00:04:14.670> with

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
supposed to be a casual shooter with

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.000 
supposed to be a casual shooter with
friends<00:04:15.420> that's<00:04:15.600> what<00:04:15.780> call<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.230> duty<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.709> and

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
friends that's what call of duty is and

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.710 
friends that's what call of duty is and
then<00:04:17.130> we<00:04:17.250> make<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.580> into<00:04:17.790> this<00:04:17.880> huge<00:04:18.120> thing<00:04:18.450> of

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
then we make it into this huge thing of

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.960 
then we make it into this huge thing of
pub<00:04:19.440> stopping<00:04:19.919> and<00:04:20.130> trying<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.459> do<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:20.850> well

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
pub stopping and trying to do so well

think that we can only have fun after
that's<00:04:25.140> happened<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.830> trust<00:04:26.100> me<00:04:26.160> guys<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.370> pub

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
that's happened and trust me guys I pub

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.690 
that's happened and trust me guys I pub
stomp<00:04:26.970> all<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.270> time

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
stomp all the time

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.360 
stomp all the time
and<00:04:27.910> I<00:04:28.660> don't<00:04:29.110> get<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.380> same<00:04:29.590> enjoyment<00:04:29.980> out

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
and I don't get the same enjoyment out

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.270 
and I don't get the same enjoyment out
of<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.580> as<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:30.790> do<00:04:31.030> just<00:04:31.870> hopping<00:04:32.230> on<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.710> lobby<00:04:33.100> of

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
of it as I do just hopping on a lobby of

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.100 
of it as I do just hopping on a lobby of
mw2<00:04:33.730> playing<00:04:34.120> with<00:04:34.270> somebody's<00:04:34.660> going<00:04:34.930> for

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
mw2 playing with somebody's going for

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.950 
mw2 playing with somebody's going for
nukes<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.700> that's<00:04:36.700> just<00:04:37.330> my<00:04:37.510> opinion<00:04:37.540> I<00:04:37.930> think

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
nukes and that's just my opinion I think

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.280 
nukes and that's just my opinion I think
that<00:04:38.380> fun<00:04:38.920> doesn't<00:04:39.130> come<00:04:39.400> from<00:04:39.700> doing<00:04:40.660> well<00:04:40.870> in

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
that fun doesn't come from doing well in

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.630 
that fun doesn't come from doing well in
the<00:04:41.410> game<00:04:41.560> itself<00:04:41.890> it<00:04:42.100> doesn't<00:04:42.220> even<00:04:42.370> come

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
the game itself it doesn't even come

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.400 
the game itself it doesn't even come
from<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.910> game<00:04:43.090> itself<00:04:43.450> it<00:04:43.690> just<00:04:43.870> comes<00:04:44.080> from

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
from the game itself it just comes from

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.770 
from the game itself it just comes from
having<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.310> fun<00:04:45.520> time<00:04:45.550> with<00:04:45.790> your<00:04:46.360> friends
