00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.549
 that someone dares to claim if unlike previous months because no 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.299
 he acted despite the fact that before the act who knows who his rival would be 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.190
 God want what is needed 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.409
 in front of it flooded pawns own children 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:22.920
 that someone dares to claim 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.030
 perhaps they sang the hymn those whose doubts were questioned 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.980
 nationalization did not shed tears those sticks which we criticized in the first 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.780
 tender and cia sa emanated blood as our little fighters 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.870
 defending the colors of the flag 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.300
 that someone dares to claim if days before was in charge of sealing 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.940
 the greatest joy in history 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.380
 put for the first time 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.550
 best photo of the planet 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.240
 so that the whole world spoke with praise the Paraguayan perhaps until the 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.240
 Maradona himself did not miss a penalty 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.030
 if an error is committed by anyone but you have to have eggs to return it to 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.350
 try if he was the one who saved the potatoes leaving with 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.610
 go to several more minutes 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.440
 that the story and finish 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.440
 until a simple stroke of luck ended hopes 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.040
 who dares to claim 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.560
 if they survived stages of which powers that even champions of the 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.050
 world could not pass 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.810
 they said goodbye with their heads up, unlike others, who 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.730
 place they thought in turn 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.880
 those who did not look at each other showed me that 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.290
 we come from a nation 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.690
 we leave the heart on the court when there is 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.270
 that someone dares network 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.870
 if they were the only ones in making us forget a little far 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.710
 sharing as a family hugging at 40 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.430
 replicating with strangers 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.450
 unites us all 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.430
 regardless of religions backgrounds or political preferences that someone 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.490
 dare to claim 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.490
 if it was the selection that lied to us all with the redhead 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.160
 in the offices the programs that made us scream jump and dance 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.150
 representing not with dignity making proud and touching the glory 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.270
 even though in theory he did not know 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.610
 there was still more 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.390
 that someone dares to claim 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.529
 but please 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:09.239
 above claim
