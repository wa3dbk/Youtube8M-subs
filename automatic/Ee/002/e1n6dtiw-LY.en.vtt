00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.030
 Jesus did wonderful things and many people did not believe in him 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.679
 and followed him 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.279
 he was beneficent 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.399
 they heal the sick and teach the voices of god 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.289
 Jesus was good 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.039
 he was sinless 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.919
 he always did what god you want him to do 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.980
 he came to show us the love of god 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.220
 to get people to follow god 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.539
 and to walk 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.539
 in his voice 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.450
 but there are religious leaders very jealous of Jesus 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.170
 who did not want to admit that they had broken the laws of god and who 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.100
 knows fishermen like all the rest of the people 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.250
 their hearts were tense too 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.170
 they did not want to believe that Jesus had been sent by god 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.930
 they lied about it 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.600
 they did stop 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.190
 he was beaten 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.210
 the soldiers placed a crown of thorns on his head 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.950
 they made fun of him 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.870
 Jesus 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.870
 could have resisted and stop all this 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.000
 but he did not do it he came into the world 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.070
 to become a sacrifice 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.400
 for sins 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.540
 this is going to be sacrificed for the sins of all men 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.030
 took on him the commission the more deserved people 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.590
 the soldiers competed and I took place on a wooden cross 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.050
 where he remained lying until his death 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.600
 in those days it was the tradition since the worst criminals 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.250
 in this way more clearly 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.420
 of criminals 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.530
 have you also been put on crossovers 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.470
 but Jesus was not a criminal 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.160
 he was innocent 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.680
 he did not do anything wrong 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.390
 he died for the sins of others 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.880
 no for his 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.330
 it is not only time for the sins of the people of his time 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.780
 but also for the sins of those who would come later 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.750
 his death implements the sins of all who believe in him and who 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.700
 accept his sacrifice 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.650
 their sacrifice 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.709
 when I got my thing 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.330
 he offered the perfect sacrifice with his wearing are prevented 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.189
 he has paid meaning to the sins of the world 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.459
 god said no sacrifice 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.839
 tetris needed 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.070
 because jesus 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.070
 summer shared sacrifices 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.919
 the enemies of jesus in these have killed him 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.969
 But it was not 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.309
 after his death on the cross 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.120
 Jesus was gathered by a rich year 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.120
 who laid his body in his own grave at the turn 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:49.989
 we make a misfortune near the grave with a big stone every morning 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.320
 the third day 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.489
 some women went toton handsome 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.799
 to prepare the body as tradition dictates 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.220
 they were surprised 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.619
 duty free stone and jesus was no longer there 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:05.879
 she was even more surprised when she wanted two angels who 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.839
 announced yesterday that Jesus was alive 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:13.299
 these messengers of god recount it at sea that Jesus was resurrected from among 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.299
 the dead 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.689
 nothing 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.530
 after his resurrection 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.749
 jesus reappeared to some of his followers 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.359
 he spoke to them he eats with them 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.229
 thomas one of his followers 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:38.549
 because not had to talk about what had happened could not believe that 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.089
 Jesus was alive 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.069
 he says 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.940
 if I do not see in his hands 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.400
 the mark of the nails 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.650
 and if I do not touch his wounds 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.439
 I will not believe points 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.439
 Jesus appeared to him later and told him 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.849
 because you saw me that you believed 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.849
 happy those who have not seen and who believed 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:09.329
 for 40 days after Jesus was raised from the dead 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.599
 he has reappeared to some people 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.519
 in bright colors and knew he was alive 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.519
 it was time for him now to return to heaven 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.330
 he was completed the work he had come to accomplish 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.070
 Jesus says to his disciples 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.860
 of year and announce to everyone and everywhere what he had done 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.920
 and then in front of many of his disciples who look to go to Jesus rising from the 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.810
 ground and getting higher and higher in the nights 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.169
 and missing 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.180
 alan two gear adornments 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.880
 and announcers to the disciples that Jesus will come back one day in the same way 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.229
 he left 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.919
 he is now official 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.580
 to prepare a place for all those 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.979
 who do not believe in him 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.490
 and who follow him 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.550
 jesus and the way 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.550
 which leads us to God 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.539
 why did Jesus die on the cross 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.619
 he died to save sinners the punishment they deserve 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.469
 Jesus never sinned 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:19.009
 he died to take away the sin that separates us from God 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:23.259
 Lacroix reminds us that Jesus was immaculate lamb 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.889
 perfect kurt of god who was sacrificed for us 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:29.279
 when we believe in Jesus 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:31.229
 and we are referring 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.090
 that is, we are moving away from sin 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.620
 God forgive us 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.629
 Jesus makes us God's children and friends 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.210
 when I knew he was on earth he told a lot of stories to help 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.710
 people to understand the voices of god 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.309
 he pointed out that there were two paths 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:03.220
 everyone takes the path of sin money 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.259
 which leads to destruction and death 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.090
 we all have a sinful nature that we inherited love the first 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.770
 order 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.430
 we sinned by doing unpleasant things in the eyes of God 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:17.320
 Thursday hadi 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.770
 that we had to leave the path at the hip entered the path is 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.900
 narrow that leads to god 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.900
 so why not talk to him with your heart now 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.469
 tell him god who is almighty is sacred 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:32.219
 but I know that I'm a fisherman 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:35.029
 I confess before you that I have sinned 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.259
 I believe that Jesus died on the cross for me 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.589
 and who will pay for my sins 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:42.650
 I beg you to forgive me 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.759
 to change and clean my heart 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.869
 these two months india children 

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:52.519
