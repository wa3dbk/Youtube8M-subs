00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.099
 take off the rear wheel on a motorcycle 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.750
 poppy birds 125 to start a motorcycle 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.849
 need to put on the central step 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.669
 so that front wheel 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:33.110
 touched the ground and the back didn't touch that 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:38.949
 can be seen by its easy rotation take the key 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:41.989
 on 19 to slip it onto the wheel nut 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.820
 take the motorcycle trunk put 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.019
 motorcycle neat rear wheel and 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.090
 stepping gift key 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:56.629
 thereby weakening loosen the puff 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:59.539
 nuts and screw the nut here is nothing 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.940
 holding the wheel at the top 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.710
 gently squeeze a little upwards 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.670
 axle right hand and then left 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.789
 pulling to the end in one motion 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:17.210
 remove the sleeve spacer rented 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:21.229
 tensioners left right desirable and 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.910
 walk on waltz that finger that was 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.459
 correctly oriented then not 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.130
 What confused what to do here and 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:33.289
 tighten the nut twist and 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:39.020
 tighten the wheel 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.340
 right pull out the star board 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.310
 with star chain 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.679
 we lay it all on the ground prepared 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.289
 rag depends on the value of the chypsy and 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.690
 more precisely, its state, if not sorry we put 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.739
 just call me the chain is old 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.729
 so I will put that 

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:58.599
 and now shifting the wheel to the left pulls out 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.599
 this rock 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:09.050
 same lowering is now neat 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.050
 we roll the wheel a little tilt it 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.620
