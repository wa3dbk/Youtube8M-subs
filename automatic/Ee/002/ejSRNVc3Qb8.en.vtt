00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
so what I can do here is is scroll

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100 
so what I can do here is is scroll
scroll<00:01:11.760> through<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> let's<00:01:12.510> say<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> just

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
scroll through and let's say I just

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.030 
scroll through and let's say I just
wanted<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:14.479> sharpen<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> photo<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.590> portrait

wanted to sharpen the photo the portrait

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.789 
wanted to sharpen the photo the portrait
a<00:01:17.130> little<00:01:17.400> bit<00:01:17.549> more<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.259> portrait<00:01:19.770> mode
