00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.149 

this<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> highest<00:01:10.229> speed<00:01:10.500> without<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
this is the highest speed without the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.770 
this is the highest speed without the
mirror<00:01:11.430> being<00:01:11.729> locked<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:14.509> then<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
mirror being locked up and then the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.289 
mirror being locked up and then the
highest<00:01:16.110> speed<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:17.070> pretty<00:01:17.400> fast<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.030> five

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
highest speed is pretty fast it's five

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.170 
highest speed is pretty fast it's five
frames<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.900> second<00:01:19.380> now<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.159> mirror<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.060> be

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
frames a second now the mirror has to be

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.030 
frames a second now the mirror has to be
locked<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:21.900> special<00:01:22.290> purposes<00:01:22.830> only

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
