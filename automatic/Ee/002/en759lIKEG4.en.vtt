00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
serrated edged as well but I just tend

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.780 
serrated edged as well but I just tend
to<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.370> use<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.950> scissors<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.610> I

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
to like to use the scissors here and I

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.850 
to like to use the scissors here and I
just<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.149> here<00:00:42.829> get<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> here<00:00:44.129> at<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> base

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
just go here get it here at the base

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.600 
just go here get it here at the base
snip<00:00:47.329> snip<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.600> there<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:50.280> works<00:00:50.460> pretty

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
snip snip right there that works pretty

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.189 
snip snip right there that works pretty
well<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.030> you've<00:00:51.180> got<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> basically<00:00:51.989> two

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
well so you've got the basically two

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.040 
well so you've got the basically two
plants<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.890> wouldn't<00:00:53.760> snip<00:00:53.940> off<00:00:54.120> too<00:00:54.420> many

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
plants here wouldn't snip off too many

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.119 
plants here wouldn't snip off too many
leaves<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:56.640> see<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.940> one's<00:00:57.379> holding<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
leaves and see that one's holding you

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.880 
leaves and see that one's holding you
know<00:00:59.219> when<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> old<00:00:59.820> leaves<00:01:00.149> at<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> bottom

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
know when the old leaves at the bottom

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.429 
know when the old leaves at the bottom
are<00:01:01.890> typically<00:01:02.449> tender<00:01:03.449> yellow<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.989> die<00:01:04.170> off

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
are typically tender yellow and die off

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.289 
are typically tender yellow and die off
because<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.040> leave<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.519> plant<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.119> always

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
because the leave the plant is always

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.700 
because the leave the plant is always
going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> send<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> nutrition<00:01:07.380> up<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
going to send the nutrition up to the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.850 
going to send the nutrition up to the
youngest<00:01:08.610> leaves<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.720> see<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.710> what

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
youngest leaves you see that's just what

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.260 
youngest leaves you see that's just what
it<00:01:10.950> does<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.610> way<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.060> can

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it does and this is a way that you can

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.810 
it does and this is a way that you can
harvest<00:01:12.810> all<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.320> salad<00:01:13.740> greens<00:01:14.010> these<00:01:14.700> are

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
harvest all your salad greens these are

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
harvest all your salad greens these are
not<00:01:14.939> wages<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.450> actually<00:01:15.689> hairy<00:01:15.900> vetch<00:01:16.170> sort

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
not wages are actually hairy vetch sort

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.840 
not wages are actually hairy vetch sort
of<00:01:16.439> fixing<00:01:16.770> nitrogen<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.400> why<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:17.610> are

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
of fixing nitrogen this is why these are

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.700 
of fixing nitrogen this is why these are
so<00:01:18.000> green<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.330> healthy<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.439> got<00:01:19.560> all

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
so green and healthy because you got all

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.460 
so green and healthy because you got all
these<00:01:19.799> extra<00:01:20.600> nitrogen<00:01:21.600> being<00:01:21.720> fixed<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
these extra nitrogen being fixed in and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.469 
these extra nitrogen being fixed in and
so<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.369> kind<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.729> come<00:01:23.939> around<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
so you just kind of come around and you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.560 
so you just kind of come around and you
just<00:01:24.659> clip<00:01:25.470> snip<00:01:25.799> snip<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.330> use

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
just clip snip snip and you just use

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.429 
just clip snip snip and you just use
that<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.670> use<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.970> salad<00:01:30.540> or<00:01:30.689> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
middle of winter and this is all new

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.859 
middle of winter and this is all new
growth<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> middle<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.939> winter<00:01:54.119> which<00:01:54.720> is

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
growth in the middle of winter which is

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.420 
growth in the middle of winter which is
something<00:01:55.049> I've<00:01:55.259> never<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.710> seen<00:01:55.979> before

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
something I've never really seen before

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.420 
something I've never really seen before
but<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:58.110> probably<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> grow<00:01:59.130> very

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
but it probably not going to grow very

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.459 
but it probably not going to grow very
much<00:01:59.520> but<00:01:59.909> once<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.210> gets<00:02:00.420> more<00:02:00.960> daylight<00:02:01.320> in

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
much but once it gets more daylight in

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.410 
much but once it gets more daylight in
the<00:02:01.530> spring<00:02:01.860> it'll<00:02:02.070> grow<00:02:02.310> much<00:02:02.880> more<00:02:02.909> quickly

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the spring it'll grow much more quickly

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.889 
the spring it'll grow much more quickly
and<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:05.100> know<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.610> know<00:02:05.729> collard<00:02:06.689> greens

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
and but you know you know collard greens

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.359 
and but you know you know collard greens
are<00:02:07.049> something<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.469> grow<00:02:07.680> well<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:07.950> winter

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
are something that grow well in winter

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.250 
are something that grow well in winter
anyway<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.000> that's<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.629> good<00:02:09.869> plan<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.379> have<00:02:10.770> and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
anyway so that's a good plan to have and

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.830 
anyway so that's a good plan to have and
that<00:02:11.319> is<00:02:11.500> how<00:02:11.739> you<00:02:12.030> harvest<00:02:13.030> your<00:02:13.299> collard

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
that is how you harvest your collard

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.830 
that is how you harvest your collard
greens<00:02:14.140> see<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.680> folks
