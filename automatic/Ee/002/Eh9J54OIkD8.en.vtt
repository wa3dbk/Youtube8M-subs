00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
quite a bit now but he actually he

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.800

screwed up he went into the dirt in the
middle<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.140> road<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.320> little<00:02:21.500> bit<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:21.950> you

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
middle of the road a little bit so you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.940 
middle of the road a little bit so you
can't<00:02:23.210> really<00:02:23.300> count<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:23.870> run<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.770> was<00:02:24.920> a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
can't really count that run it was a

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.320 
can't really count that run it was a
good<00:02:25.160> run<00:02:25.400> from<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.760> beginning<00:02:26.180> though

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
good run from the beginning though

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.390 
good run from the beginning though

an Aston I love driving the DBS now on
the<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.620> hard<00:02:49.100> launch<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:50.510> know<00:02:50.630> just

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
the on the hard launch you know just

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.450 
the on the hard launch you know just
from<00:02:50.960> a<00:02:51.110> dead<00:02:51.260> stop<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.740> will<00:02:51.980> admit<00:02:52.250> he

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
from a dead stop I will admit he

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.330 
from a dead stop I will admit he
absolutely<00:02:52.910> destroyed<00:02:53.630> me<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:53.960> his<00:02:54.080> m5<00:02:54.500> but

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
absolutely destroyed me in his m5 but

absolutely destroyed me in his m5 but
you<00:02:55.460> can<00:02:55.610> see<00:02:55.760> we're<00:02:55.940> slowly<00:02:56.360> catching<00:02:56.900> up

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
you can see we're slowly catching up

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.580 
you can see we're slowly catching up
that's<00:02:57.770> that's<00:02:58.580> pretty<00:02:58.730> much<00:02:59.510> pretty<00:03:00.440> much

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
that's that's pretty much pretty much

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.830 
that's that's pretty much pretty much
due<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.250> fact<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:02.030> Aston<00:03:02.390> has<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.600> higher

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
due to the fact the Aston has a higher

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.800 
due to the fact the Aston has a higher
top<00:03:03.140> speed<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:04.280> Aston<00:03:04.730> pulls<00:03:05.090> more<00:03:05.450> in<00:03:05.720> a

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
top speed the Aston pulls more in a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.350 
top speed the Aston pulls more in a
straight<00:03:06.080> line<00:03:06.110> then<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:06.980> m5<00:03:07.550> does<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.060> m5

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
straight line then the m5 does the m5
