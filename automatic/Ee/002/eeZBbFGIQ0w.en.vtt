00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
have is these two trouble codes right

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.190 
have is these two trouble codes right
here<00:01:12.310> if<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:13.970> guys<00:01:14.119> are<00:01:14.330> wondering<00:01:14.660> what<00:01:14.930> this

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
here if you guys are wondering what this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.990 
here if you guys are wondering what this
is<00:01:15.729> this<00:01:16.729> means<00:01:17.030> that<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:18.520> there's<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.610> fin

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
is this means that the there's a fin

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.680 
is this means that the there's a fin
there's<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.929> fin<00:01:21.289> inside<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.420> dashboard<00:01:23.509> it's

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
there's a fin inside the dashboard it's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.980 
there's a fin inside the dashboard it's
a<00:01:24.319> blend<00:01:24.590> or<00:01:24.800> fan<00:01:25.069> I<00:01:25.099> believe<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.840> it's<00:01:26.840> not

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
a blend or fan I believe and it's not

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.029 
a blend or fan I believe and it's not
calibrated<00:01:27.619> correctly<00:01:28.000> so<00:01:29.000> um<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:30.349> best<00:01:30.709> time

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
calibrated correctly so um the best time

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.309 
calibrated correctly so um the best time
to<00:01:31.280> do<00:01:31.459> this<00:01:31.640> is<00:01:31.940> not<00:01:32.030> really<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.810> winter<00:01:33.080> time

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
to do this is not really the winter time

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.339 
to do this is not really the winter time
and<00:01:33.349> it's<00:01:33.649> January<00:01:34.130> now<00:01:34.399> but<00:01:35.119> today<00:01:35.390> we<00:01:36.110> have<00:01:36.319> a

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:36.349 
and it's January now but today we have a

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:39.430 
and it's January now but today we have a
49<00:01:37.099> degree<00:01:37.490> day<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.060> we'll<00:01:38.509> probably<00:01:38.899> be<00:01:39.319> able

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
49 degree day and we'll probably be able

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.040 
49 degree day and we'll probably be able
to<00:01:39.619> calibrate<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.630> what<00:01:41.780> we<00:01:41.869> have

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
to calibrate it so this is what we have

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.580 
to calibrate it so this is what we have
to<00:01:42.200> do<00:01:42.349> we<00:01:43.039> start<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.429> car<00:01:43.670> up<00:01:46.690> alright<00:01:47.690> now

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
to do we start the car up alright now

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.070 
to do we start the car up alright now
what<00:01:49.160> we're<00:01:49.369> going<00:01:49.489> to<00:01:49.520> do<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:50.030> we're<00:01:50.929> going<00:01:50.959> to
