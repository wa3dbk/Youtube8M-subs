not<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> case<00:00:21.080> it<00:00:22.080> may<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.710> downfall<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
not the case it may be a downfall to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.370 
not the case it may be a downfall to
some<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.820> guys<00:00:23.850> but<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.480> really<00:00:24.720> isn't<00:00:24.930> to

some of you guys but it really isn't to
me<00:00:25.560> honestly<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.820> my<00:00:26.970> own<00:00:27.150> opinion<00:00:28.220> but<00:00:29.220> this

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
me honestly in my own opinion but this

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.479 
me honestly in my own opinion but this
this<00:00:30.689> new<00:00:30.960> crafting<00:00:31.380> menu<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:31.920> super

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
this new crafting menu is just super

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.020 
this new crafting menu is just super
neat<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.390> think<00:00:33.870> people<00:00:34.739> would<00:00:35.030> recommend

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
neat and I think people would recommend

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.000 
neat and I think people would recommend
this<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:38.570> prefer<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.719> over<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.530> old

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
this and prefer this over the old

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.610 
this and prefer this over the old
version<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.090> crafting<00:00:42.780> menu<00:00:42.930> so

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
version of the crafting menu so

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.100 
version of the crafting menu so
basically<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.399> shows<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.180> exactly

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
basically this just shows you exactly

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.720 
basically this just shows you exactly
how<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.160> gonna<00:00:47.370> work

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
how it's gonna work

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.950 
how it's gonna work
so<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> they<00:00:50.340> shaded<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.910> one's<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
so the so they shaded in one's the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.670
