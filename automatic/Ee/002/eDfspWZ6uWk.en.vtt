00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.379
 well guys we are jargons anyway 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.740
 I am of both 13 and this is a new one 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.490
 tutorial the first on excellent teams where you 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.570
 I'll show you how to make a rose is one 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:33.059
 team with over 5,000 cries but yes 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.790
 but seeing is Spanish is really a lot 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.980
 strong and sometimes even bagatt we go 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.960
 immediately find out what the players are 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.370
 then it matters 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.160
 we have the porter in the Zaragoza that he is 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.800
 roberto who seems to be crying though 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.210
 I don't know why there is this peace to enjoy 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.340
 give another photo then central 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.699
 defensive victor ruiz is really a lot 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.960
 fort of valencia and next to him 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.950
 Majorcan defender I will succeed but the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.070
 Brazilian is as right back 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.990
 we find driving challenges even if a 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.009
 bulleri also will put arbeloa 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.360
 I have not thought about it faster and more often 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.799
 how much baggage is left instead 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.659
 puts them on 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.450
 adriano which is really the essence of 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:30.030
 bar that runs a lot 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:37.770
 then the form is 4 3 1 2 and I think 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:40.740
 it is even if the agreement is not producing 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.920
 I preferred to stay much longer on 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.780
 cost 15 5 thousand credits more or less than 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.450
 on the agreement because then it can be modified 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:55.079
 slowly and three plants are marcos 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:01.380
 centering a dance floor together with 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:05.399
 gaby of the athletic madrid and ander 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.910
 herrera always from bilbao and then instead 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.920
 as we say trequartista bojan that is 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.660
 really very tedious is that if it is 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.550
 spanish does 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:21.830
 enough understanding and first striker 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:24.530
 rodrigo del benfica and finally a 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.760
 player that is really overly 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.100
 brawl and the strongest of the team 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.170
 that is adrian as reservations committed those 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.280
 of the Spanish that this because if not 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:41.030
 obviously this too this is a 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.650
 trick he is seeing that gives me yes 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.680
 use when just so light pink 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.100
 the first that you bronzes because it is a 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.340
 you can see it as with which form 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.710
 makes more sense and therefore I understood it 82 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.360
 but as I said I had to keep myself 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.530
 on his feet 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:04.330
 then let's give roberto obviously a fort 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.780
 goalkeeper then also victor ruiz is that a 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:14.210
 78 79 defense and head of ueda 80 of 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:17.890
 speed and 76 passage and adriano foot 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:22.220
 ball and 576 of speed 80 of the dribbling 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.940
 and then gironelli right 78 also defense 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:30.400
 andrea of which we see five stars that the 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:34.670
 5 stars and de marcos that at 88 speeds 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.070
 gaby is found of passing bojan that 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.640
 very strong under speed 85 dribbling 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.730
 even rodrigo 85 company state of 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.270
 minimum a very strong and even shot 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.980
 adrian that at 85 speed and therefore it is 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.560
 really a good team and you can 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.420
 find a coach and this way 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.830
 that makes us see each other on gameplay of the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.360
 team this is a game i have 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:02.330
 registered and where an hour to a player 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.180
 immediately suffered from the beginning of 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.060
 good dribbling skills of the years paintings 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.989
 who really drinks the players 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:14.390
 easily and exchange where there is then 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:18.130
 rodrigo with a very strong shot that that 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:22.600
 beats just two minutes from the beginning 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:26.410
 and the goalkeeper and then I drag him together 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.060
 adrian does a very fast shooting axis 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.670
 strong with a great parade by roberto 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.660
 that really a great goalkeeper when the 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.270
 rules 43 great dribbling risks then 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:42.100
 I recommend it 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.290
 and also here another goal from rodrigo e 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.560
 this game from 20 50 was not a 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.910
 great opponent anyway this one 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.890
 concrete team may seem a little 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.120
 the quality I give is also very poor 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:59.410
 not to underestimate and then with another 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.480
 goal immediately sees how mark it untangles and 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.220
 he immediately asks for the passage and then also 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.340
 do not guarantee because 88 speeds 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.220
 really a lot and a midfielder 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.440
 and I really recommend it because not 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.540
 it costs nothing this really 5000 e 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.780
 6000 that maximum for having led to 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.570
 home quietly also sees almost 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.370
 roma.la as a good defense that arouses 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.950
 giromella really so much safety on 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.440
 corner kicks and in the 42 state of 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.560
 dribble these one two steps of 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.270
 first and really the midfielders a lot 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.190
 other strong parades by Roberto 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.920
 clearly it is always ready 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:40.240
 obviously the buffon is not buffon 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.580
 what 50,000 grady what this action me 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.710
 really like because the goal of 4 to 0 e 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.220
 employed everything from before everyone 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.140
 these exchanges today and then I'm here 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.590
 asshole though jumped the goalkeeper from 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.900
 I put in with adrian I think and finally 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.420
 could believe and next goal that me 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.010
 it seems on a corner kick 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.220
 if I'm not mistaken then even if maybe 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.630
 strikers are not very high e 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.390
 midfielder does not cross enough 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.510
 good and then put it easy inside 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.960
 so this is in this first team 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.980
 that I really recommend because maybe 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.960
 unfortunately he could not start from 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.670
 immediately to do otherwise not for whom 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.100
 maybe he wants to make up 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.850
 and tell me what the next team will be 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.700
 method in the convents and here the video that 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.360
 almost finished and we give each other next 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.750
 will be next 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.750
 beautiful
