00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
q94 250 on the game Lost Planet we see

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.080 
q94 250 on the game Lost Planet we see
that<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.649> significant<00:02:08.310> increase<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.700> rendered

let's take a look at multimedia when we

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.780 
let's take a look at multimedia when we
look<00:02:19.590> at<00:02:19.680> another<00:02:19.950> usage<00:02:20.310> model<00:02:20.609> such<00:02:20.760> as

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
look at another usage model such as

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.390 
look at another usage model such as
multimedia<00:02:21.239> we<00:02:21.900> once<00:02:22.109> again<00:02:22.200> see<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.739> core<00:02:22.950> i7
