00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 the recoil drive is always from 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.859
 meaning if you do not have direct 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.500
 contact with the solid earth surface 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.210
 did so when not directly connected to the earth 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.460
 can exchange pulses 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.699
 what is the case with the example 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.180
 rocket or the canaries so the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.160
 ink fishing or by the waterwheel 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.070
 I already have steps over it 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.310
 made small video or just too 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.560
 When talking pamphlets so that 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.140
 myth drive is moving forward 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.600
 systems with the recoil drive 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.629
 Work is one of the open systems 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.510
 to discuss open systems 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.750
 I am the hydro mobile r100 the hydro mobile 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.210
 exists as open an opening where eg 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.809
 water flow or fall into it 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.449
 then it may have to the front down 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.960
 and an opening through the back 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.170
 you suck something in the air 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.350
 can where he can repel 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.500
 now this case is only the opening here 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.340
 open and we can keep track of the momentum 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.030
 formulate for this system 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.369
 the impulse balance for this system 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.650
 judge is the sum over all 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.140
 Surfaces forces the adolescents 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.080
 forces are pulse currents 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.299
 Regarding a system plus the impulse 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.880
 stream that goes through the opening here 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.820
 So these impulses flow together 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.390
 result in the change rates decix 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.220
 impulses of the hydra mobile then you can 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.680
 off balance nor the masses 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.079
 Cross-country skiing namely the masses 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.920
 Electricity around the strength of the mass flow 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.140
 at the opening here is the same 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.229
 change rates in our case is now 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.540
 the mast current is negative then applies 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.719
 for the impulse stream that the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.759
 speed of the liquid at the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.700
 opening four times the mass flow through 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.490
 that mouth 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.430
 the pulse stream is now the same 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.709
 speed of the liquid in 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.140
 Opening 4 is the speed of the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.970
 hydro mobils - c4 and c4 is the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.489
 exclusivity relative to the hydro 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.890
 mobile and this camera expression you have to 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:25.090
 again with the mass amperage 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.310
 four are multiplied then still applies 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.610
 a capacitive law namely that of 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.700
 impulse equals instantaneous mass of 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.370
 times the speed of the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.890
 Automobils is the four reasons 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.380
 relationships namely the impulse balance 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.650
 the mass balance then the conversion of 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.610
 pulse current to mass flow and that 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:52.329
 Capacitive law then you can the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.930
 pulse current with the conversion to the 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.640
 insert the left side around the capacitive 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.310
 Law on the right side 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.780
 if you go mass times 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.360
 then you have to work the products 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.650
 to use the rule mass change 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.410
 Smart times speed plus mass 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.389
 times speed change rates the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.120
 speed change rates 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.920
 along with acceleration and now 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.620
 can one as auxiliary balance the 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.690
 draw a balance and say the 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.230
 reasonably current is still the same so 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.690
 So you can change rates 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.670
 speed mass current strength away 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.940
 Cut along with crowds 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.680
 change, guess what speed 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.850
 what remains is a very compact one 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.160
 Actually the same is the healthy one 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.530
 relationship for the rocket stating that 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.670
 the sum of all surfaces could 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.709
 namely pulse current strengths - the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.260
 emit speed times the 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.599
 Mass current strength to our case 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.419
 itself negatively equals mass times 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:02.230
 acceleration is when you look for - 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:04.850
 c4 times its 4 thrust then says 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.250
 It looks like the constitution 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.950
 but you can reverse it again 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.220
 interpret that you are both 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.830
 then no pulse, he advised the change 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.130
 right side is not bulls then 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.950
 Change rates if you deduce this 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.860
 with many derivations compare the 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.290
 you find in empty then you have to 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.010
 but admit the derivation from the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.320
 system itself is very very 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.560
 purposeful with clear principles 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.350
 namely balance sheet mass balance then 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.530
 the connection between masses flows 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.070
 impulse current and just a capacitive 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.070
 law
