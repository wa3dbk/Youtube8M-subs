00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.430
 hello everyone let's take another look at 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.490
 the long-suffering strider who passed 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.050
 through pretty serious hardy us and in 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.260
 general, which went through the procedure 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.390
 repair yes the fact is that some what 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.010
 watching my channel remember that he had 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.180
 such a problem that in common 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.300
 called log rock 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.050
 the gist was the following because 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.610
 serious radius on the heels of the blade frame 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.920
 slipped on this heel due 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.260
 small contact patch when pressed 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.510
 let's say on shoes in this way 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.790
 vertical backlash appeared 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.610
 how this matter was eliminated eliminated a 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.920
 but in return and spendik 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.110
 that is, if we take a closer look then 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.190
 we will see that from the side where we 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.699
 titanium plate 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.559
 peg much thicker than the other 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.030
 parties 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.040
 actually this peg was made 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.690
 to order 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.140
 there was also a big pro 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.940
 . 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.870
 in order to increase the contact patch 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.600
 hairpin with titanium frame and now this 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.119
 the knife is solid, that is, loosen it 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.240
 just impossible and initially 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.719
 even if there is minimal play 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.359
 then when tightening the axial screw 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.250
 just zero that is now by this 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.009
 the knife can be used with it 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.049
 preserved smoothness of the blade 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.930
 no problem is thrown out easily 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.590
 beyond the hole also the brain can be 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.289
 open meetings down and let's see 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.960
 the most important thing is how the frame comes in 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.890
 on pita blade 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.079
 actually like this 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.280
 problem lacquered and eliminated 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.159
 that is actually just actually 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.460
 formed early locking yes that is 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.859
 when the frame enters the first half 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.009
 blade loops where 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.749
 the bevel of this blade is even more gentle in 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.569
 In this case, there is no backlash and slip 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:11.009
 too nothing slips let's 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.980
 look at what happened with the blade 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.580
 Well , firstly, the cover has cleared in some places 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.100
 there are traces on it 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.830
 here I actually demolished the front face and 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.650
 turned the whole face 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:31.770
 in the carriage turned out actually 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.920
 hatchet until reduced by this 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.080
 Opportunities I polished the edges 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.330
 although now it is quite clear 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.620
 all small scratches are visible but if 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.100
 look like this 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.640
 mirror let's also in more detail 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.710
 consider the question of information on this even 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.040
 let's use for this electronic 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.030
 rod and try this thing 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.030
 neatly change 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.680
 so this way this picture 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:09.489
 looks sweden we carry a knife somewhere in 09 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.110
 one millimeter and the funny thing is that this 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.760
 I restored the edge very quickly 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:19.060
 literally a few passes on apex and 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.560
 after polishing adversity why the same 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.489
 lazy polishing turned out next 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.269
 the picture that is, he shaves quite cheerfully 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.640
 certainly not perfect 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.010
 paper cuts probably not very confident 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.049
 let's try sat me interested too 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:38.140
 look pretty good 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.840
 and let's not forget that in general 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.000
 geometry on this blade 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.390
 for this to remember this even 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.769
 need to look at his shoes 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.870
 such a thing well let's give a little more 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.959
 dilute this video is hidden a small 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.430
 Parcel from China at the same time see how 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.910
 strider with such a butt to handle this 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.340
 assignment 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.299
 by the way i can say that after 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.790
 knife but actually reborn that is 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.030
 was corrected with me suck which i 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.310
 so much annoyed by this gap name 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.310
 I just fell in love again with this knife 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.070
 no obvious shortcomings do not see it 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.060
 By the way, Chinese ports 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.800
 the whole uterus is more than three meters each 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.840
 of which are worth 6 plan dollars 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.410
 I ordered it on aliexpress 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.419
 Free shipping is not particularly Chinese 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.009
 stinks in general then honestly i'm with 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.190
 At first glance I do not see what this 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:39.550
 paracord would be different from some 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.350
 Well, let's say more prestigious or something 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.280
 american or someone else yes then 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.370
 there is the same 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.590
 that's so beautiful here when 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.539
 at last 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.539
 Thank you all for your attention. Good luck for now.
