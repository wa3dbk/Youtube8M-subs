00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello people now a short clan 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.750
 or clear war update because I'm on 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.500
 every case I have with my clear 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.039
 possibly entertained again and that 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.930
 So it was just ok 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.660
 happen that you really the also the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.390
 worse people in clan simply 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.130
 Actually, okay, here only says solid troupe 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.600
 So that's just really with 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.010
 equipped with really good troops 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.579
 they will not be that easy either 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.910
 can be overrun 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.700
 and that's what we're doing right now 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.350
 so I'm here as I said the awo 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:58.949
 Kita Maria and Peter were donated 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:02.489
 Of course, okay is obviously natural 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.140
 salzmann ten people in the plan not so good 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.880
 are and then of course bad 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.560
 troops get in the clear castle na 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:18.180
 yes of course, because mega fan is of course 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:28.729
 very nice out of here you look your best 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:28.729
 That's it, everybody's done 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.990
 so far, I think it's already great 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.700
 advantage if everyone really has that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.500
 what he wanted and then it is 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.500
 to melt new 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.610
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.119
 passat melt again are there 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:56.329
 rf the mario, too, that's right 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.329
 cool number okay 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:07.670
 fits so that's the trial 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.140
 simply with the small do not get more 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.910
 to replace so miserable 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:19.970
 because that's not really the way Bernese 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:22.310
 been head is that one is now 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.570
 not as the citizen or because one must 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.280
 can do something 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.470
 I mean , of course, here is one 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.730
 absolute hammer but really then 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.590
 it just loses makes it too 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:45.920
 absolutely as much fun as I had've got 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:48.100
 cool crate one more course, too 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:54.280
 my option 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.280
 okay that 's just this first
