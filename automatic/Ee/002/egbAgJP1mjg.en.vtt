00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.989
 hello with you video find syria and i 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:12.329
 Alexey Taranenko 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.799
 Today, our hero communicator nokia n97 mini 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.769
 some kind of bug fixes on the tracks 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.769
 97 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.699
 m 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.869
 and familiarity with 11 families 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.689
 immediately pay attention to more 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.210
 high quality of housing 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.890
 the machine has become smaller here a lot of metal in 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.710
 including back case 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.180
 build quality is much higher than that 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.510
 older model 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.550
 the closed state of the body seems 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.710
 monolithic 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.100
 slider mechanism works fine 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.260
 the entrance is clear but who are the extreme positions 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.430
 not 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.500
 the section of the apparatus but the standard 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.150
 it's three and a half million metros for 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.340
 headphone edge name avoid peripherals 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.840
 It is also used for charging, therefore 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.100
 perhaps charging the train 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.250
 on the front panel three keys 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.250
 mechanical menu 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.780
 call pick-up and call center 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.119
 in these keyboard compared to 97 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.090
 got rid of the navigation 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.870
 keys 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.890
 but so far no more 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.020
 many Russian letters have to enter 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.250
 through the bank 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.650
 keys are small on clear 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.280
 he work comfortably 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.600
 m 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.320
 in terms of design 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.280
 but through the rule all the faults 1 97 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 materials build quality appearance 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.820
 everything is much better 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.640
 if you continue comparing son 97 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.840
 I don't have a smaller display 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.910
 internal memory also 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.460
 decreased to 8 gigabyte screen 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.820
 remained resistive however included 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.820
 Sidorenko is no longer strong 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.880
 of the prizes we note another wired 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.410
 headset included it is more convenient 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.410
 has a remote control 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.780
 the communicator works on 7 9 4 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.890
 recent modifications if 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.120
 you kinetic scrolling in lists 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.390
 interface speed 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.060
 increased response to actions 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.509
 user it became faster 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.319
 built-in camera got rid of the curtain 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.959
 he himself has not changed 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.959
 m 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.499
 on line it will be less 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.109
 the older model has largely happened 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.689
 fixed all the flaws 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.319
 Change Elena absolutely for less there is no 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.129
 sense 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.930
 but choose when buying become 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.510
 the last
