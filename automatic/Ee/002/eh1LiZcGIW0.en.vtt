00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
talk about the side finder today and it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.939 
talk about the side finder today and it
does<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> monitor<00:00:27.750> component<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
does have a monitor component but we a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
does have a monitor component but we a
while<00:00:29.519> ago<00:00:29.760> two<00:00:29.820> years<00:00:30.090> ago<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.510> started

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
while ago two years ago we started

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.020 
while ago two years ago we started
trying<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.349> develop<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.550> affordable

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
trying to develop the really affordable

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.780 
trying to develop the really affordable
but<00:00:33.870> really<00:00:34.290> high<00:00:34.469> quality<00:00:34.550> viewfinder<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.670> I

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
but really high quality viewfinder and I

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.799 
but really high quality viewfinder and I
think<00:00:36.090> that's<00:00:36.239> what<00:00:36.329> we've<00:00:36.450> come<00:00:36.480> out<00:00:36.750> with

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
think that's what we've come out with

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.290 
think that's what we've come out with
today<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> 502<00:00:38.309> which<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
today and so the 502 which is the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.330 
today and so the 502 which is the
monitor<00:00:39.600> tomorrow's<00:00:39.960> five<00:00:40.379> inch<00:00:40.620> monitor

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
monitor tomorrow's five inch monitor

monitor tomorrow's five inch monitor
camera<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.270> use<00:00:42.390> your<00:00:42.510> by<00:00:42.660> itself

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
camera can use your by itself

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.959 
camera can use your by itself
correct<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.649> monitor<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.700> piece<00:00:44.940> of

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
correct the monitor is just a piece of

correct the monitor is just a piece of
the<00:00:45.360> side<00:00:45.629> finder<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> loop<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.070> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
can also buy it as a kit but this this

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
small screen again 1920 but it seems

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.170 
small screen again 1920 but it seems
really<00:01:14.939> sharp<00:01:15.210> sharper<00:01:15.600> than<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> iPhone<00:01:16.140> 6

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
really sharp sharper than the iPhone 6

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.810 
really sharp sharper than the iPhone 6
okay<00:01:18.560> let's<00:01:19.560> talk<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.159> side<00:01:20.430> finder

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
okay let's talk about the side finder

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
okay let's talk about the side finder
now<00:01:20.939> when<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.180> add<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.350> you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
now when you add it on right so you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.170 
now when you add it on right so you
dropped<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.280> product<00:01:23.700> into<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> side

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
dropped this product into the side

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.800 
dropped this product into the side
finder<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.740> becomes<00:01:26.100> an<00:01:26.280> EDF<00:01:26.640> again<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
finder and it becomes an EDF again this

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.140 
finder and it becomes an EDF again this
is<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> highest<00:01:28.740> resolution

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
is this is the highest resolution

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.300 
is this is the highest resolution
third-party<00:01:30.150> EVF<00:01:30.509> we're<00:01:31.170> no<00:01:31.320> longer<00:01:31.470> 1929

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
third-party EVF we're no longer 1929

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
third-party EVF we're no longer 1929
correct<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.000> using<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.329> smaller<00:01:33.600> section<00:01:33.900> of

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
correct it's using a smaller section of

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.630 
correct it's using a smaller section of
the<00:01:34.140> screen<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.860> loop<00:01:35.189> part<00:01:35.430> isn't

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the screen so that this loop part isn't

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.999 
the screen so that this loop part isn't
so<00:01:35.909> enormous<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.420> we're<00:01:36.990> using<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.650> 3-inch

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
so enormous so we're using just a 3-inch

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.670 
so enormous so we're using just a 3-inch
version<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> 5<00:01:38.850> inch<00:01:39.060> screen<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.960> when<00:01:40.590> we

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
version of the 5 inch screen but when we

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
version of the 5 inch screen but when we
want<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.310> flip<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.329> screen<00:01:42.600> out

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
want to we can flip the the screen out

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.749 
want to we can flip the the screen out
and<00:01:42.990> see<00:01:43.200> our<00:01:43.320> full<00:01:43.590> screen<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and see our full screen here it's a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.460 
and see our full screen here it's a
really<00:01:44.970> nice<00:01:45.149> feature<00:01:45.360> now<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
really nice feature now I see that the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.350 
really nice feature now I see that the
loop<00:01:46.680> I've<00:01:46.920> got<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> little<00:01:47.520> adjustment<00:01:48.210> knob

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
loop I've got a little adjustment knob

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.569 
loop I've got a little adjustment knob
here<00:01:48.540> correct<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.140> diopter<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.430> goes

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
here correct that's diopter so it goes

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.190 
here correct that's diopter so it goes
from<00:01:50.729> negative<00:01:50.850> 2<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.240> plus<00:01:51.540> 4<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
from negative 2 to plus 4 so it's a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.010 
from negative 2 to plus 4 so it's a
really<00:01:52.500> wide<00:01:52.710> range<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:54.090> good<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.479> us<00:01:54.780> when

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
really wide range it's good for us when

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
really wide range it's good for us when
we're<00:01:55.170> eyesight<00:01:56.009> begins<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> fail<00:01:56.640> guys

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
we're eyesight begins to fail guys

different like a host of features

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.050 
different like a host of features
they're<00:02:31.950> basically<00:02:32.250> like<00:02:32.400> presets<00:02:32.910> but

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
they're basically like presets but

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.250 
they're basically like presets but
they're<00:02:33.150> very<00:02:33.270> visual<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.050> just

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
they're very visual and you can just

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.170 
they're very visual and you can just
switch<00:02:34.440> between<00:02:34.650> them<00:02:35.040> using<00:02:35.670> left-right<00:02:36.060> on

the<00:02:36.270> joystick<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> really<00:02:37.110> cool

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the joystick it's a really cool

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.800 
the joystick it's a really cool
experience<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:38.090> nuts<00:02:39.090> are<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> great<00:02:39.510> example

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
experience and nuts are a great example

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.330 
experience and nuts are a great example
to<00:02:40.050> do<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.320> once<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.680> set<00:02:40.830> up<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.980> page<00:02:41.160> of

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
to do that once you can set up a page of

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.650 
to do that once you can set up a page of
the<00:02:41.370> LUT<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.150> set<00:02:42.330> up<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.510> different

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
the LUT and you can set up a different

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.240 
the LUT and you can set up a different
page<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.350> sends<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.710> exclusively

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
page that sends it exclusively

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.520 
page that sends it exclusively
downstream<00:02:44.850> with<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> different<00:02:45.480> block<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.110> I

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
downstream with a different block so I

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.350 
downstream with a different block so I
can<00:02:46.770> see<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.100> thing<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.550> can<00:02:47.700> send<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.090> video

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
can see one thing and I can send a video

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.880 
can see one thing and I can send a video
village<00:02:48.630> something<00:02:49.140> else<00:02:49.320> that's<00:02:49.500> exactly

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
village something else that's exactly

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.470 
village something else that's exactly
right<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.190> mentioned<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.610> joystick<00:02:51.150> that's

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
right you mentioned a joystick that's

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.420 
right you mentioned a joystick that's
right<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.140> joystick<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:53.190> user

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
right so the joystick is this user

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.770 
right so the joystick is this user
interface<00:02:53.640> right<00:02:53.970> here<00:02:54.390> it's<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.630> very

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
interface right here it's a very

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.510 
interface right here it's a very
simplified<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.950> joystick<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.370> a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
simplified it's just a joystick and a

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.310 
simplified it's just a joystick and a
back<00:02:56.700> button<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.750> reason<00:02:58.020> we've<00:02:58.170> done

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
back button and the reason we've done

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.480 
back button and the reason we've done
that<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.709> allows<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.250> switch<00:02:59.430> between

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
that is it allows you to switch between

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.699 
that is it allows you to switch between
your<00:02:59.880> pages<00:03:00.120> very<00:03:00.420> quickly<00:03:00.780> there's<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.410> flow

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
your pages very quickly there's a flow

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.800 
your pages very quickly there's a flow
to<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.950> menu<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.400> we've<00:03:02.880> transplanted<00:03:03.390> this

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
to the menu and we've transplanted this

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.780 
to the menu and we've transplanted this
onto<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> small<00:03:04.620> wireless<00:03:05.070> remote<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.550> can<00:03:05.700> be

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
onto a small wireless remote that can be

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.729 
onto a small wireless remote that can be
mounted<00:03:05.910> onto<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.360> tripod<00:03:06.870> or<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.200> race<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.709> I

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
mounted onto a tripod or a race so I

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.560 
mounted onto a tripod or a race so I
don't<00:03:08.010> have<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.340> reach<00:03:08.550> up<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.300> the

don't have to reach up and get the

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.180 
don't have to reach up and get the
viewfinder<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:10.140> touch<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.590> monitor<00:03:10.890> anymore
