desk and in this pianos case we didn't

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.539 
desk and in this pianos case we didn't
really<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.820> take<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.030> part<00:01:30.450> off<00:01:30.630> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
this part off this lid you can see down

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.679 
this part off this lid you can see down
in<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> piano<00:01:40.549> when<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> lid<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.909> closed<00:01:42.150> I'm

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.899 
in the piano when the lid is closed I'm
going<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.899> push<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> lid<00:01:43.380> back<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.790> see

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
going to push the lid back you can see

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.710 
going to push the lid back you can see
the<00:01:44.939> keys<00:01:45.829> when<00:01:46.829> I'm<00:01:46.920> servicing<00:01:47.399> pianos<00:01:47.820> often

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the keys when I'm servicing pianos often

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.270 
the keys when I'm servicing pianos often
will<00:01:48.840> take<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.170> whole<00:01:49.380> part<00:01:49.680> off<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.130> it's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
will take this whole part off but it's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.550 
will take this whole part off but it's
pretty<00:01:50.490> tricky<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.390> don't<00:01:51.750> suggest<00:01:52.170> that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
pretty tricky so I don't suggest that

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.039 
pretty tricky so I don't suggest that
you<00:01:52.680> take<00:01:52.920> anything<00:01:53.220> apart<00:01:53.689> that<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.810> don't

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
you take anything apart that you don't

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.499 
you take anything apart that you don't
have<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.250> down<00:01:56.460> into<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> Hammers<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
have to to see down into the Hammers and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.840 
have to to see down into the Hammers and
to<00:01:57.960> definitely<00:01:58.350> see<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.770> underneath<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
to definitely see up underneath the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.060 
to definitely see up underneath the
piano
