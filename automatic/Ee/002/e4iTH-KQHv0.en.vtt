00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 today we are going to prepare cream shells 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.980
 pastry and for this we are going to need 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.870
 plus the puff pastry and pastry cream os 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.519
 I remember that the two tutorials for 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.390
 make the puff pastry the cream 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.070
 you will find them in www punto 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.290
 what you read is the dotcom baker 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.750
 and we already have water and sugar for 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.120
 syrup and puff pastry and cream 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.460
 pastry first thing we're going to do 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.530
 it is to flourish our work bench and 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.170
 let's put the puff pastry and the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:41.780
 let's stretch for this recipe I'm going to 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.880
 use the Lékué troll cake kit 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.460
 that now we take the dough and we're going to 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.150
 put on the silicone tray that 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.150
 bring this kit 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.320
 now with the help of a roller we are going to 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.440
 knead a little until covering the largest 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.109
 surface we can tray now 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.210
 let's put the custard and with 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.009
 the help of the spatula let's go 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.009
 covering the whole mass 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.700
 once we have it still on deck 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.590
 let's go rolling the so we're going to 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.010
 take from one end and let's roll up 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.340
 but very little 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.760
 and now with the help of the role that we are going to go 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.180
 rolling little by little as you see is very 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.180
 easy 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.770
 Now we are going to cut the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.170
 slices of about one finger of 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.000
 thickness and we are going to put them on 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:46.910
 our cooking mat or paper 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:49.070
 vegetable and now we're going to bake it at 200 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:56.660
 degrees for 15 minutes with the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:59.210
 resistance down and elapsed this 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.950
 baking time we have 5 minutes to 200 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.950
 degrees with the resistance from above 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.429
 after the time we took it out of the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.950
 oven 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.859
 to prepare the syrup we are going to 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:20.750
 need 100 ml of water and 100 grams of 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:23.510
 sugar we put to heat the water in a 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.930
 bucket and when we see that it starts 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.060
 let's boil the sugar and let's go 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.060
 to be stirring so that it does not stick 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.010
 do not see that thickened we remove it 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.019
 of the fire once baked our 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.840
 conch we are going to add the syrup 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.879
 so that it is that nice shine like that 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.830
 that we take the conch and with the help of 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.830
 a brush we are going to paint them 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.490
 you 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.489
 and once they are all allowed to dry 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.000
 You can also replace this step 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.629
 for apple peach jam what 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.849
 that you like and we will have lists 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.819
