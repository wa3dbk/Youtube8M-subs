00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.990
 arc the chicken does not matter what 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.119
 others may think to say or do 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.390
 we need to seek our limits 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.880
 maximum not only to drift to the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.880
 taste of the current or unwillingness 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.660
 take a wave and let us take 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.649
 Beach 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.649
 we should not be home charles swindon 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.180
 one of the most beautiful words ever 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.850
 I took notice was told by James 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.480
 agre and reported by leonardo boff do 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.980
 book the eagle and the chicken counts water and 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.899
 Once upon a time there was a peasant 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.110
 forest to catch a bird to 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.630
 keep him in his house was able to catch the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.570
 eagle cub laid on the hen 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.040
 along with the chickens ate mille action 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.100
 suitable for chickens 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.990
 though the area was the king of 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.930
 all the birds 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.390
 after five years this man received 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.689
 the visit of a naturalist while 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.420
 strolled through the garden of this naturalist 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.170
 this bird there is not a chicken is a 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.790
 eagle 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.310
 indeed the peasant is here but I am 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.829
 I raised as a chicken she is not one more 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.520
 eagle became a chicken as the 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.740
 others 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.759
 despite the wings of almost three meters of 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.950
 extension has not revamped naturalistic it is and 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.500
 it will always be an area because it has a heart 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.149
 This heart will make a day of you. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.210
 back to heights 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.840
 no there was no peasant she turned 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.700
 chicken and will never fly like an eagle 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.430
 decided to take a test 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.000
 the naturalist took the eagle lifted to well 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.489
 high and challenging said already that in fact 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.870
 you are an eagle since you belong to 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.459
 heaven and earth 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.560
 so spread your wings and fly and the eagle 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.470
 landed on the extended arm of the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.019
 naturalist looked absently at the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.140
 around saw the chickens down there 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.400
 chipping the beans and jumped together 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.760
 from them 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.120
 the peasant commented I told him 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.450
 she turned a simple chicken did not make 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.879
 To be naturalistic, she is an eagle and 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.060
 an area will always be an eagle 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.950
 let's try again tomorrow 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.810
 next day the naturalist came up with the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.079
 eagle on the roof of the house 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.640
 whispered the eagle to him since you are a 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:58.680
 eagle spread its wings and fly but when the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.310
 The area saw the chickens 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.280
 floor jumped and went to 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.970
 the peasant smiled and returned to his charge 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.120
 had said she turned not chicken 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.730
 answered strongly naturalistic is eagle 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.280
 always have the eagle heart 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.810
 Let's try it one last time. 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.620
 tomorrow 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.930
 tomorrow I'll fly the next day the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.959
 naturalist and the peasant 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.930
 early arrived in the area 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.230
 out of the city away from the 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.169
 men on top of a mountain sun 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.410
 spring gilding the peaks of the mountains 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:43.769
 the naturalist raised the eagle high 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.980
 and commanded him eagle since you are a 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.599
 tree and since you belong to heaven and 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.139
 in the land 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.140
 spread your wings and flew ii 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.020
 ag around me 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:02.490
 trembled as if experiencing new life 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:05.910
 but I will not go then the naturalist held 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.830
 firmly toward the sun to 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.560
 that your eyes could fill with 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.720
 solar clarity and the vastness of 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.870
 horizon 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:19.470
 this time she opened her powerful 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:25.140
 nou gras wings with a typical whitewash of 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:29.550
 sovereign waters over and over and 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:32.310
 started to fly flying high up 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.360
 getting higher and higher 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.750
 fly flies until confused with the blue of the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.750
 firmament 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.100
 the parable of misery is really 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.530
 splendida evokes deep dimensions of 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.480
 indispensable for the process of 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.480
 of human achievement 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.580
 the feeling of self - esteem the ability 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.190
 to get back on top of the difficulties 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.710
 almost insurmountable 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.580
 each person has within him an eagle 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.860
 she wants to be born being called 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.010
 heights search the sun 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.400
 so we are constantly challenged 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.729
 to free the eagle that inhabits us 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.460
 area has within it the call of the 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.380
 infinite your heart feels the most peaks 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.930
 mountains high 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.190
 even though it is subject to conditions 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.460
 of slavery 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.620
 she will never stop listening to her own 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.699
 Eagle Nature 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.430
 who summon it to the sublime heights 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:37.639
 people who take up sublime flight are the 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.160
 who refuse to lie down to sigh and 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.949
 want things to change 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.590
 such people do not claim their luck and 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.320
 so little do they dream passively with some 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.590
 in biology 5 that comes in instead 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.680
 they visualize in their minds that they 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.350
 have given up, have not allowed 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.720
 circumstances of life push them there 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.610
 down and keeps them subdued 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:07.340
 like chickens 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.330
 I was going to win and take the place here 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.710
 it's yours 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.710
 on top of the cliff 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.740
 eagle likes to stop on heights above 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:23.449
 of the world not to see the people above 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:27.199
 but to stimulate them to look up 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.199
