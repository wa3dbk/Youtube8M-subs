and<00:00:29.070> something<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.179> didn't<00:00:30.390> know<00:00:30.480> before<00:00:30.920> was

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
and something I didn't know before was

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.450 
and something I didn't know before was
that<00:00:31.949> they<00:00:32.580> will<00:00:32.790> not<00:00:32.910> de-spawn<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.250> I've<00:00:35.250> now

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
that they will not de-spawn so I've now

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.880 
that they will not de-spawn so I've now
taken<00:00:35.519> that<00:00:35.850> into<00:00:35.910> consideration<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.890> turn

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
taken that into consideration and turn

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.579 
taken that into consideration and turn
on<00:00:38.160> displaying<00:00:38.640> spare<00:00:39.180> items<00:00:39.510> looks<00:00:40.500> very

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
on displaying spare items looks very

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.280 
on displaying spare items looks very
nice<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.059> all<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> wastes<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.690> these<00:00:42.960> are

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
nice and all the wastes of these are

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.680 
nice and all the wastes of these are
over<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.150> just<00:00:45.299> kill<00:00:45.600> them<00:00:46.010> but

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
over here and you can just kill them but

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:57.100 
over here and you can just kill them but
or<00:00:48.690> they<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.960> kill<00:00:49.110> us

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.369 

okay<00:00:58.110> that<00:00:58.350> seems<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.860> momentarily<00:00:59.730> fix<00:01:00.000> that

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
okay that seems to momentarily fix that

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.780 
okay that seems to momentarily fix that
so<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:01.950> to<00:01:02.040> get<00:01:02.220> your<00:01:02.340> items<00:01:02.640> back

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
so if you want to get your items back

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
so if you want to get your items back
you<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.059> simply<00:01:04.220> switch<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.430> lever<00:01:05.810> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you just simply switch on the lever it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.560 
you just simply switch on the lever it
will<00:01:06.990> kill<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.650> zombie<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.400> once<00:01:09.360> they're

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
will kill the zombie and once they're

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.670 
will kill the zombie and once they're
dead<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:10.050> will<00:01:10.170> drop<00:01:10.409> their<00:01:10.680> items<00:01:12.680> there

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
dead they will drop their items there

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.940 
dead they will drop their items there
you<00:01:13.800> go<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.810> pumpkins<00:01:16.200> too<00:01:16.380> as<00:01:16.500> well<00:01:16.650> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
you go and the pumpkins too as well of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.520 
you go and the pumpkins too as well of
course<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.909> pick<00:01:18.090> them<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:18.570> we

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
course and it just pick them up and we

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.999 
course and it just pick them up and we
can<00:01:19.680> wait<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.310> more<00:01:20.670> zombies<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.300> appear<00:01:22.009> this

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
can wait for more zombies to appear this

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.040 
can wait for more zombies to appear this
is<00:01:23.220> clearly<00:01:23.550> a<00:01:23.670> lot<00:01:23.880> more<00:01:24.030> complex<00:01:24.450> than<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
is clearly a lot more complex than the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.899 
is clearly a lot more complex than the
previous<00:01:25.440> design<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.100> reason<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:26.820> that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
previous design and the reason for that

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.430 
previous design and the reason for that
is<00:01:27.300> H<00:01:28.369> 2211<00:01:29.479> came<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.780> much<00:01:30.960> much

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
is H 2211 came up with a much much

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.320 
is H 2211 came up with a much much
better<00:01:31.680> way<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.039> actually<00:01:32.280> doing<00:01:32.550> it<00:01:32.789> and<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
better way of actually doing it and it

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.930 
better way of actually doing it and it
didn't<00:01:33.630> involve<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.860> Sun<00:01:35.160> so<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.640> could<00:01:35.789> do

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
didn't involve the Sun so you could do

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.889 
didn't involve the Sun so you could do
it<00:01:36.090> day<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.899> night<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:38.090> I've<00:01:39.090> sort<00:01:39.330> of<00:01:39.390> put<00:01:39.780> my

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
it day and night and I've sort of put my

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.290 
it day and night and I've sort of put my
own<00:01:39.960> twist<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.820> shall<00:01:42.119> show<00:01:42.270> you

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
own twist on that and I shall show you

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.600 
own twist on that and I shall show you
how<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.600> works<00:01:42.679> so<00:01:43.679> you<00:01:43.800> just<00:01:43.920> put<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.280> zombie

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
how that works so you just put a zombie

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.400 
how that works so you just put a zombie
here<00:01:45.950> if<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.190> are<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.700> hard<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:50.250> go<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:50.970> there

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
here if we are in hard you go in there

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.340 
here if we are in hard you go in there
pull<00:01:52.410> down<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.750> obviously<00:01:54.750> he's<00:01:55.080> one<00:01:55.229> that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
pull down and obviously he's one that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.749 
pull down and obviously he's one that
can<00:01:55.440> pick<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.100> he'll<00:01:56.250> fall<00:01:56.490> down<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
can pick one up so he'll fall down the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.669 
can pick one up so he'll fall down the
stream<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.899> let's<00:01:58.050> try<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.289> get<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
stream so let's try and get one that

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:07.809 
stream so let's try and get one that
doesn't<00:01:59.039> pick<00:01:59.190> one<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.460> Oh<00:02:04.340> getting<00:02:05.340> lucky

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.180 

yeah<00:02:08.819> Oh<00:02:12.230> are<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:13.290> doing<00:02:13.590> easy<00:02:13.680> let's<00:02:14.040> try

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
yeah Oh are we doing easy let's try

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.370 
yeah Oh are we doing easy let's try
again<00:02:15.290> listen<00:02:16.290> doesn't<00:02:16.500> pick<00:02:16.650> anything<00:02:16.860> up

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
again listen doesn't pick anything up

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.620 
again listen doesn't pick anything up
yeah<00:02:19.380> there's<00:02:19.770> not<00:02:19.890> one<00:02:20.010> he<00:02:20.069> looks<00:02:20.250> up<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:21.300> here

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
yeah there's not one he looks up so here

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.070 
yeah there's not one he looks up so here
you<00:02:21.930> will<00:02:22.170> go<00:02:22.890> there<00:02:23.450> lured<00:02:24.450> by<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.750> villager

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
you will go there lured by this villager

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.229 
you will go there lured by this villager
in<00:02:25.110> full<00:02:25.350> damage<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:25.800> stream<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.400> this

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
in full damage to this stream and this

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.380 
in full damage to this stream and this
leads<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.930> collection<00:02:28.770> zone<00:02:29.069> in<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.250> bed<00:02:29.430> so

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
leads to a collection zone in the bed so

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.120 
leads to a collection zone in the bed so
that's<00:02:30.569> not<00:02:31.020> really<00:02:31.140> going<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.410> try<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:31.830> begin

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
that's not really going to try and begin

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.680 
that's not really going to try and begin
to<00:02:32.250> explain<00:02:32.520> how<00:02:32.760> all<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.090> works<00:02:33.330> because<00:02:33.569> it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
to explain how all this works because it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.470 
to explain how all this works because it
would<00:02:33.810> take<00:02:33.840> too<00:02:34.019> long<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.530> it's<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.860> myself

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
would take too long and it's I myself
