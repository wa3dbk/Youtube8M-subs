00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
like that like raywilliamjohnson does

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.740 
like that like raywilliamjohnson does
that<00:03:49.859> but<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.220> some<00:03:51.150> people<00:03:51.269> do<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.510> more<00:03:51.720> than

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
that but and some people do it more than

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.000 
that but and some people do it more than
him<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.079> more<00:03:52.260> people<00:03:52.500> can<00:03:52.590> relate<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.859> him

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
him but more people can relate to him

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.160 
him but more people can relate to him
cuz<00:03:53.130> he's<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.310> big<00:03:53.459> youtuber<00:03:53.910> but<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:55.049> whole

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
cuz he's a big youtuber but the whole

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.569 
cuz he's a big youtuber but the whole
point<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.560> there's<00:03:55.739> no<00:03:55.829> natural<00:03:56.010> flow

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
point of that there's no natural flow

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.110 
point of that there's no natural flow
and<00:03:57.470> which<00:03:58.470> isn't<00:03:58.709> actually<00:03:58.950> like<00:03:59.489> funny<00:03:59.790> like

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
and which isn't actually like funny like

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.580 
and which isn't actually like funny like
you're<00:04:00.269> watching<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.720> for<00:04:00.900> content<00:04:01.350> you're

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
you're watching it for content you're

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.379 
you're watching it for content you're
watching<00:04:01.889> for<00:04:02.069> content<00:04:02.519> that<00:04:02.609> they<00:04:02.700> have<00:04:02.880> not

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
watching for content that they have not

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.410 
watching for content that they have not
how<00:04:03.600> funny<00:04:04.019> they<00:04:04.260> are<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:05.069> but<00:04:05.250> maybe<00:04:05.400> me<00:04:05.910> like

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
how funny they are so but maybe me like

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.140 
how funny they are so but maybe me like
when<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.840> my<00:04:07.500> blending<00:04:08.430> my<00:04:08.489> vlogs<00:04:08.760> they<00:04:09.000> are

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
when I my blending my vlogs they are

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.920 
when I my blending my vlogs they are
natural<00:04:09.660> but<00:04:10.440> it's<00:04:10.739> just<00:04:11.280> when<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:11.819> what<00:04:12.750> when

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
natural but it's just when you what when

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.020 
natural but it's just when you what when
I<00:04:12.959> cut<00:04:13.829> in<00:04:14.010> between<00:04:14.100> them<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.639> giving<00:04:14.940> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
I cut in between them is giving the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.029 
I cut in between them is giving the
illusion<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.450> they<00:04:15.840> could<00:04:16.139> not<00:04:16.320> be<00:04:16.620> natural

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
illusion that they could not be natural

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.509 
illusion that they could not be natural
they<00:04:17.160> could<00:04:17.400> actually<00:04:17.639> be<00:04:18.120> bigger<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.519> like

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
they could actually be bigger and like

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.399 
they could actually be bigger and like
like<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.209> can<00:04:21.359> be<00:04:21.479> filmed<00:04:21.720> like<00:04:21.840> hey<00:04:22.019> what's<00:04:22.229> up

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
like I can be filmed like hey what's up

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.140 
like I can be filmed like hey what's up
and<00:04:22.680> then<00:04:22.770> wait<00:04:22.950> like<00:04:23.130> 10<00:04:23.280> seconds<00:04:23.700> it

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
and then wait like 10 seconds it

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.880 
and then wait like 10 seconds it
actually<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.479> natural<00:04:25.110> one<00:04:25.320> kind<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.650> take

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
actually is natural one kind of take

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.690 
actually is natural one kind of take
