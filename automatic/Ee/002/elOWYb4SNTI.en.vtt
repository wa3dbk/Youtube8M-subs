investigation now it's just pretty much

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.300 
investigation now it's just pretty much
nearly<00:00:28.199> three<00:00:28.470> years<00:00:28.680> now<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.010> has<00:00:29.160> been

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
nearly three years now this has been

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.220 
nearly three years now this has been
going<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:30.570> always<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> come

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
going on and it was always going to come

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.260 
going on and it was always going to come
to<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> head<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.279> head<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.610> today<00:00:32.940> where

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
to a head and that head is today where

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.530 
to a head and that head is today where
you<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.290> been<00:00:34.440> released<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.540> it's

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
you know it's been released and it's

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630 
you know it's been released and it's
pretty<00:00:36.780> damning<00:00:37.110> stuff<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:38.160> effect<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.579> you

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
pretty damning stuff what effect do you

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.459 
pretty damning stuff what effect do you
think<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.910> will<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.510> Lance<00:00:39.960> Armstrong's

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
think it will have on Lance Armstrong's

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.709 
think it will have on Lance Armstrong's
reputation<00:00:41.190> both<00:00:41.489> inside<00:00:42.120> cycling<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
reputation both inside cycling and the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.779 
reputation both inside cycling and the
wider<00:00:43.290> world<00:00:43.379> well<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.370> there's<00:00:44.700> going

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
wider world well I think there's going

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.220 
wider world well I think there's going
to<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> mixture<00:00:45.360> really<00:00:45.600> there'll<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
to be a mixture really there'll be the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.770 
to be a mixture really there'll be the
the<00:00:46.620> via<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.430> lot<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.969> people<00:00:48.239> still<00:00:48.420> think<00:00:48.660> he's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the via a lot of people still think he's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.420 
the via a lot of people still think he's
innocent<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.350> what<00:00:49.680> he's<00:00:49.829> done<00:00:49.980> outside<00:00:50.370> of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
innocent and what he's done outside of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.670 
innocent and what he's done outside of
cycling<00:00:51.059> will<00:00:51.690> stand<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.199> more<00:00:52.350> than<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:52.620> he

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
cycling will stand for more than what he

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
cycling will stand for more than what he
did<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:52.949> cycling<00:00:53.460> nothing<00:00:54.329> there's<00:00:54.510> obviously

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
did in cycling nothing there's obviously

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.310 
did in cycling nothing there's obviously
a<00:00:54.870> half<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.199> he

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
a half the you know see see is what he

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.920 
a half the you know see see is what he
achieved<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:58.859> there's<00:00:59.280> nothing<00:00:59.640> anymore

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
achieved now there's nothing anymore

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
achieved now there's nothing anymore
so<00:01:01.590> there'll<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.949> mixture<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.670> obviously

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
so there'll be a mixture it is obviously

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.870 
so there'll be a mixture it is obviously
a<00:01:03.239> massive<00:01:03.619> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.650> reaction<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.519> in

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
a massive you know reaction to this in

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.210 
a massive you know reaction to this in
in<00:01:06.390> different<00:01:07.080> ways<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.740> them

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
in different ways in them

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.730 
in different ways in them
it's<00:01:09.180> how<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> spook<00:01:09.750> sport<00:01:10.229> sort<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.590> moves

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
it's how the spook sport sort of moves

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.320 
it's how the spook sport sort of moves
forward<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.250> which<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.000> more

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
forward now which is which is more

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.120 
forward now which is which is more
important<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:12.780> us<00:01:12.869> still<00:01:13.080> involved<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.680> do

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
important for us still involved in it do

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.950 
important for us still involved in it do
you<00:01:14.220> see<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.549> irrefutable<00:01:15.299> evidence

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you see it as irrefutable evidence

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.440 
you see it as irrefutable evidence
yeah<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.640> don't<00:01:18.030> think<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.330> know

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
yeah I think so I don't think you know

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.499 
yeah I think so I don't think you know
you<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.090> say<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.390> pretty

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you have to be it is I say it's pretty

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.749 
you have to be it is I say it's pretty
damning<00:01:21.960> stuff<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.500> Dave<00:01:23.040> described<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.610> yes

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
damning stuff as Dave described it yes

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.609 
damning stuff as Dave described it yes
is<00:01:23.909> pretty<00:01:24.150> jaw-dropping<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.500> lot

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
is pretty jaw-dropping and it's in a lot

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.920 
is pretty jaw-dropping and it's in a lot
of<00:01:25.650> detail<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.220> well<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.540> amount<00:01:27.810> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
of detail as well so and the amount of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.830 
of detail as well so and the amount of
people<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.290> testified<00:01:28.650> against<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.549> it's

people that testified against it it's
you<00:01:30.840> know<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.350> certainly<00:01:31.650> as<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.189> saw<00:01:32.369> some<00:01:32.579> of

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
you know it's certainly as I saw some of

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.280 
you know it's certainly as I saw some of
the<00:01:32.729> quotes<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> ticker<00:01:33.479> tapes<00:01:33.750> along<00:01:34.049> on

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
Sky News there that it's certainly not a

Sky News there that it's certainly not a
one-sided<00:01:37.380> hatchet<00:01:37.890> job<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> certainly<00:01:38.520> seems

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
one-sided hatchet job it certainly seems

already subsequently being gone I mean I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.540 
already subsequently being gone I mean I
think<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.050> was<00:02:43.140> one<00:02:43.290> report<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.770> 2003<00:02:44.520> that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
think it was one report in 2003 that

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.280 
think it was one report in 2003 that
have<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.880> go<00:02:44.970> down<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.270> fifth<00:02:45.510> place<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.990> award

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
have to go down to fifth place to award

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.530 
have to go down to fifth place to award
the<00:02:46.410> victory<00:02:46.740> too<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.790> there's<00:02:47.970> almost<00:02:48.120> it's

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
the victory too so there's almost it's

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.940 
the victory too so there's almost it's
the<00:02:48.630> most<00:02:48.810> irrelevant<00:02:49.020> now<00:02:49.410> really<00:02:49.710> there's<00:02:49.890> a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the most irrelevant now really there's a

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.370 
the most irrelevant now really there's a
void<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.550> those<00:02:51.210> seven<00:02:51.570> years<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.840> Lance<00:02:52.170> won

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
void in those seven years that Lance won

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.090 
void in those seven years that Lance won
the<00:02:52.500> Tour<00:02:52.710> so<00:02:53.990> it's<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.110> shame<00:02:55.320> in<00:02:55.530> cycling<00:02:55.980> that

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
the Tour so it's a shame in cycling that

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.190 
the Tour so it's a shame in cycling that
the<00:02:56.700> race<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> have<00:02:57.390> won<00:02:57.600> this<00:02:57.780> year<00:02:58.050> this

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
the race that I have won this year this

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.560 
the race that I have won this year this
historical<00:02:58.860> race<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.790> probably<00:03:00.210> now<00:03:00.330> going<00:03:00.510> to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
historical race is probably now going to

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.880 
historical race is probably now going to
be<00:03:00.660> without<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.960> winner<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.380> those<00:03:01.530> seven<00:03:01.860> years

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
be without a winner of those seven years

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.400 
be without a winner of those seven years
which<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.420> quite<00:03:03.420> sad<00:03:03.630> in<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.930> way<00:03:03.960> but<00:03:06.110> yes<00:03:07.110> it's

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
which is quite sad in a way but yes it's

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.660 
which is quite sad in a way but yes it's
kind<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.650> what<00:03:07.830> where<00:03:08.040> does<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.250> go<00:03:08.490> from

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
kind of what where does that go from

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.190 
kind of what where does that go from
there<00:03:08.910> really<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.210> mean<00:03:09.360> what<00:03:09.540> what<00:03:09.690> happens<00:03:10.050> to

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
there really I mean what what happens to

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.500 
there really I mean what what happens to
that<00:03:10.350> those<00:03:10.740> history<00:03:11.130> books<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.090> why

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
that those history books is that why

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.690 
that those history books is that why
some<00:03:13.050> cyclists<00:03:13.590> still<00:03:13.740> admire<00:03:14.280> him<00:03:14.460> because

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
some cyclists still admire him because

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.370 
some cyclists still admire him because
he<00:03:14.850> was<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.000> best<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.930> bunch<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.230> was<00:03:16.260> the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
he was the best of the bunch it was the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.570 
he was the best of the bunch it was the
best<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.770> Chiefs<00:03:17.010> there<00:03:17.190> were<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.430> many

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
best of the Chiefs there were so many

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.730 
best of the Chiefs there were so many
people<00:03:17.820> here<00:03:18.030> maybe<00:03:18.240> it<00:03:18.420> was<00:03:18.570> yeah<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.680> I

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
people here maybe it was yeah but I

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.010 
people here maybe it was yeah but I
think<00:03:19.800> his<00:03:20.070> well<00:03:20.310> from<00:03:21.000> what<00:03:21.210> you<00:03:21.720> know<00:03:21.870> he

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
think his well from what you know he

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.080 
think his well from what you know he
certainly<00:03:22.440> had<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.710> funding<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.460> to<00:03:23.820> be<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
certainly had the funding to to be the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.280 
certainly had the funding to to be the
best<00:03:24.300> at<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.660> mean<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:24.930> like<00:03:25.050> another

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
best at that I mean is like another

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.740 
best at that I mean is like another
sport<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.710> itself<00:03:25.980> really<00:03:26.270> so<00:03:29.000> yeah<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.600> not

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
sport in itself really so yeah it's not

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.390 
sport in itself really so yeah it's not
not<00:03:31.230> something<00:03:31.530> really<00:03:31.770> sort<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.040> should<00:03:32.250> get

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
not something really sort of should get

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.650 
not something really sort of should get
into<00:03:32.640> maybe<00:03:32.820> there's<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.090> best<00:03:33.300> of<00:03:33.510> that

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
into maybe there's the best of that

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.510 
into maybe there's the best of that
because<00:03:33.960> it's<00:03:34.140> kind<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.410> it's<00:03:34.860> gone<00:03:35.040> away<00:03:35.160> from

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
because it's kind of it's gone away from

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.220 
because it's kind of it's gone away from
sport<00:03:35.820> in<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.000> way<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:36.450> not<00:03:36.660> what<00:03:36.840> sport<00:03:37.140> is

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
sport in a way it's not what sport is

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.650 
sport in a way it's not what sport is
about<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.890> it's<00:03:38.790> certainly<00:03:39.060> not<00:03:39.120> why<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.420> do<00:03:39.540> it

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
about and it's certainly not why I do it

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.740 
about and it's certainly not why I do it
so<00:03:40.520> it's<00:03:41.520> quite<00:03:41.760> sad<00:03:42.000> talking<00:03:42.390> about<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.690> in

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
so it's quite sad talking about it in

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.410 
so it's quite sad talking about it in
those<00:03:42.870> terms<00:03:42.930> really
