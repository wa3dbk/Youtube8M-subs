00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:12.500
 Hello today we will show how to replace 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:15.290
 antenna on the roof and so antenna us 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.359
 mounted inside the ceiling to us 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.039
 so we have to lower 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.010
 a little ceiling to have access to 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.630
 nuts first remove the cover with 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.890
 let the glass go through the right side 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:34.850
 then right here on the right 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:38.059
 squeeze the latch down here with us 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.809
 We press the latch connector with us easily 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.730
 removed 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:47.809
 then we need to remove the visor and 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:59.510
 fastener visor and so visor with us 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:01:02.600
 it is attached the rings it is 20 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.880
 unscrew the screw we go down a little bit 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:15.229
 and then here is such a pulling 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:17.899
 latch and shoot and so now we shoot 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:22.429
 fastener visor is attached too 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.590
 Ksana 20 unscrew the screw to the maximum 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.409
 unscrew it but that we did not fall out 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.409
 since this fastener is arranged by type 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.840
 clips i.e. it is inserted into 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.799
 hole and when the screw is tightened with 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.909
 that side of the bar it goes down 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.919
 metal and disassemble plastic 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.189
 so we are cooler 

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:46.179
 to the maximum and that's such movements 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:49.179
 pressing down on the screw itself 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.179
 flat cake 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.850
 well here we are shooting down 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.759
 see the devices of this cake that is 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:08.819
 here is a metal bar 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:11.220
 even when dragged on, that is, to whom 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.180
 tightens the plank moves down and 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.220
 bursting with plastic that's all 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.970
 removing without damaging is difficult enough 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.450
 so be careful with the second 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.900
 side remove similarly and here we have 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.110
 there is access you can unscrew the nut 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.340
 delay the ceiling put something 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.920
 so that we had and then like this 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:47.069
 here's a key from the gimbal head 8 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:50.549
 unscrew the antenna mount here we are 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.359
 we see that we have laying there 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.040
 two rings on the antenna they dried up and we 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.730
 there is water here that is for sure 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.510
 antenna 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.859
 rusted with time if by car 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.570
 let's say for more than six or seven years it's kind 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.600
 everyone will have you can not even about this 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:15.709
 know on the water will be on the sly when 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:20.299
 come here unscrew the nut and now 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.299
 remove the antenna wire 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.569
 Of course it will be easier to push the antenna here 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:42.740
 this type which we see push 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:49.250
 out the antenna we fall out we see 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:55.700
 here everything is in the water everything is then pulled out 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:04:01.610
 int n here subtract the antenna here 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:05.030
 naturally everything in the water here we can 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.430
 we can see here two rings 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.519
 us and the antenna here here too 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.200
 clips here latches well when just 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.320
 push here to this pin it ie 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.419
 from the bottom up it is easy for you to come out either 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.419
 on sealant here here sealant all 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:25.720
 smear these two guides and myself 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.720
 screw or replace the antenna liters Kotka 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.190
 so we cleaned the surface 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:41.060
 caused a small amount of sealant and 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:41.720
 then just insert well and put all 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.419
 into place 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.419
 Naturally everything is drained here 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.730
 here before installation 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.130
 we straighten this holder 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:23.200
 baiting bolt insert also insert 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:29.920
 pushing on the floor myself and now pressing 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:32.910
 constantly tighten until we have 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.910
 tight hold 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:06:06.720
 Well, all now insert the visor here it is 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.720
 so here we have laid
