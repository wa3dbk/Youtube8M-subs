journey<00:01:11.240> we<00:01:12.050> first<00:01:12.320> needed<00:01:12.620> to<00:01:12.740> come<00:01:12.920> up<00:01:13.070> with

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
journey we first needed to come up with

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.490 
journey we first needed to come up with
a<00:01:13.760> location<00:01:14.150> which<00:01:14.510> was<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.780> bus<00:01:14.930> stop<00:01:15.200> and

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
a location which was the bus stop and

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.649 
a location which was the bus stop and
then<00:01:16.040> our<00:01:16.159> second<00:01:16.549> step<00:01:16.820> was<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.240> come<00:01:17.390> up<00:01:17.510> with

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
then our second step was to come up with

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.260 
then our second step was to come up with
a<00:01:17.690> theme<00:01:18.049> that<00:01:18.290> would<00:01:18.409> suit<00:01:18.830> that<00:01:19.100> area<00:01:19.549> we

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
a theme that would suit that area we

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.149 
a theme that would suit that area we
kind<00:01:20.540> of<00:01:20.720> tried<00:01:21.049> to<00:01:21.229> find<00:01:21.470> things<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:21.920> were

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
kind of tried to find things that were

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.060 
kind of tried to find things that were
similar<00:01:22.460> between<00:01:23.270> all<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:23.900> our<00:01:24.080> ideas<00:01:24.650> and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
similar between all of our ideas and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.280 
similar between all of our ideas and
then<00:01:25.340> we<00:01:25.370> landed<00:01:25.970> on<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.150> idea<00:01:26.510> of<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.080> like

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
then we landed on the idea of this like

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.680 
then we landed on the idea of this like
whimsical<00:01:27.890> garden<00:01:28.490> element<00:01:29.000> we<00:01:29.270> were<00:01:29.420> trying

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
whimsical garden element we were trying

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.539 
whimsical garden element we were trying
to<00:01:29.780> play<00:01:29.990> on<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.320> contrasts<00:01:30.770> of<00:01:30.920> summer<00:01:31.250> and

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
to play on the contrasts of summer and

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.180 
to play on the contrasts of summer and
winter<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.229> we<00:01:33.229> realized<00:01:33.650> that<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:33.920> would<00:01:34.040> be

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
winter and we realized that it would be

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.580 
winter and we realized that it would be
really<00:01:34.400> great<00:01:34.700> really<00:01:35.060> white<00:01:35.479> not<00:01:36.260> a<00:01:36.290> lot<00:01:36.560> of

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
really great really white not a lot of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.560 
really great really white not a lot of
color<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.070> greens<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:37.909> we<00:01:38.000> kind<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.299> wanted<00:01:38.540> to

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
color and greens so we kind of wanted to

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.020 
color and greens so we kind of wanted to
bring<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.960> back<00:01:39.200> into<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.619> space<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.729> with

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
bring that back into the space so with

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.789 
bring that back into the space so with
that<00:01:41.180> mentality<00:01:41.570> we<00:01:41.930> kind<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.260> forged<00:01:42.560> ahead

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
that mentality we kind of forged ahead

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.460 
that mentality we kind of forged ahead
and<00:01:43.570> kind<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.659> divided<00:01:45.049> into<00:01:45.320> groups

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
and kind of divided into groups

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.590

the<00:02:04.850> most<00:02:05.090> valuable<00:02:05.570> thing<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:06.320> will<00:02:06.860> take

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
the most valuable thing that I will take

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.949 
the most valuable thing that I will take
away<00:02:07.250> personally<00:02:07.729> from<00:02:07.909> this<00:02:08.179> will<00:02:08.539> be<00:02:08.810> the

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
away personally from this will be the

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.300 
away personally from this will be the
collaboration

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
collaboration

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.160 
collaboration
because<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:10.670> don't<00:02:10.940> get<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.569> chance<00:02:11.959> to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
because you don't get a chance to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.979 
because you don't get a chance to
collaborate<00:02:12.890> with<00:02:13.209> artists<00:02:14.209> most<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.930> the

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
collaborate with artists most of the

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.270 
collaborate with artists most of the
time<00:02:15.170> most<00:02:15.500> artists<00:02:16.040> work<00:02:16.220> individually<00:02:18.280> this

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
time most artists work individually this

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.570 
time most artists work individually this
is<00:02:19.459> really<00:02:20.209> great<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.599> we<00:02:20.660> can<00:02:21.020> take<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
is really great that we can take to the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.210 
is really great that we can take to the
schools<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.390> we<00:02:23.510> work<00:02:23.720> in<00:02:23.900> or<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.620> studios

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
schools that we work in or the studios

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.850 
schools that we work in or the studios
that<00:02:25.250> we<00:02:25.580> branch<00:02:26.390> out<00:02:26.599> into<00:02:26.840> after<00:02:27.410> graduation

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
that we branch out into after graduation

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.780 
that we branch out into after graduation
I<00:02:28.930> wanted<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.319> give<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.800> experience<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
I wanted to give the experience to the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.150 
I wanted to give the experience to the
students<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.450> seeing<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.560> steps<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.040> go

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
students of seeing the steps that go

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.449 
students of seeing the steps that go
into<00:02:34.430> creating<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:35.660> collaboration<00:02:36.170> between

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
into creating a collaboration between

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.330 
into creating a collaboration between
the<00:02:37.459> University<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.300> city<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:39.290> we

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
the University and the city so we

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.240 
the University and the city so we
approached<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:41.120> city<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.510> Greeley<00:02:41.959> and

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
approached the city of Greeley and

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.280 
approached the city of Greeley and
creative<00:02:43.250> arts<00:02:43.340> district<00:02:44.030> was<00:02:44.780> excited<00:02:45.200> about

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
creative arts district was excited about

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.130 
creative arts district was excited about
it<00:02:45.470> seems<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.370> be<00:02:46.519> a<00:02:46.940> win-win<00:02:47.420> for<00:02:47.600> everybody

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
it seems to be a win-win for everybody

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.650 
it seems to be a win-win for everybody
in<00:02:48.950> this<00:02:49.040> case<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.880> students<00:02:50.239> they<00:02:50.360> want<00:02:50.510> to

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
in this case the students they want to

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.890 
in this case the students they want to
really<00:02:51.049> be<00:02:51.260> stewards<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.860> our<00:02:52.160> town<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.540> we

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
really be stewards of our town and so we

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.870 
really be stewards of our town and so we
have<00:02:54.049> a<00:02:54.080> very<00:02:54.410> specific<00:02:54.680> date<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.640> it's

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
have a very specific date that it's

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.490 
have a very specific date that it's
going<00:02:56.090> up<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.540> specific<00:02:56.750> date<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.349> it's

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
going up and a specific date that it's

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.190 
going up and a specific date that it's
coming<00:02:57.709> down<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.940> makes<00:02:59.599> it<00:02:59.810> a<00:02:59.840> little<00:03:00.049> bit

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
coming down that makes it a little bit

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.509 
coming down that makes it a little bit
different<00:03:00.530> from<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.799> gorilla<00:03:01.720> yarn-bombing

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
different from the gorilla yarn-bombing

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.680 
different from the gorilla yarn-bombing
you<00:03:04.519> never<00:03:04.730> know<00:03:05.000> what<00:03:05.239> people's<00:03:05.630> reaction

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
you never know what people's reaction

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.750 
you never know what people's reaction
will<00:03:06.260> be<00:03:06.290> especially<00:03:06.860> when<00:03:07.250> you're<00:03:07.430> invading

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
will be especially when you're invading

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.199 
will be especially when you're invading
public<00:03:08.599> property<00:03:09.110> but<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.220> think<00:03:10.489> Arne<00:03:10.880> bombing

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
public property but I think Arne bombing

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.800 
public property but I think Arne bombing
is<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.630> relatively<00:03:12.670> respectful<00:03:13.670> street<00:03:14.600> art

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
is a relatively respectful street art

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.039 
is a relatively respectful street art
it's<00:03:15.170> not<00:03:15.579> harmful<00:03:16.579> it's<00:03:17.329> very<00:03:17.660> easily

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
it's not harmful it's very easily

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.620 
it's not harmful it's very easily
removed<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:19.250> it's<00:03:19.579> not<00:03:19.940> going<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.209> do<00:03:20.359> damage

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
removed so it's not going to do damage

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.400 
removed so it's not going to do damage
to<00:03:21.489> whatever<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:22.760> put<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.269> on<00:03:23.390> I'm<00:03:24.140> imagining

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
to whatever you put it on I'm imagining

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.240 
to whatever you put it on I'm imagining
there's<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:25.040> lot<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.519> people<00:03:26.239> who<00:03:26.600> are<00:03:27.250> seasoned

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
there's a lot of people who are seasoned

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.550 
there's a lot of people who are seasoned
crow<00:03:28.609> shares<00:03:28.940> who<00:03:29.420> live<00:03:29.660> in<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.109> community

and I would love to see more of a
collaboration<00:03:32.930> between<00:03:33.200> students<00:03:34.040> and

people in the community to maybe create

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.160 
people in the community to maybe create
something<00:03:36.920> much<00:03:37.549> grander<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.569> I<00:03:38.600> could<00:03:38.840> see<00:03:39.019> it

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
something much grander so I could see it
