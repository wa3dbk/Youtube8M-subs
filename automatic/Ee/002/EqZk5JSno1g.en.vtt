00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.220 
and I've installed bloom on the TouchWiz
side<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:26.700> what<00:02:27.700> should<00:02:28.120> happen<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:29.049> on

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
side and what should happen is the on

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.620 
side and what should happen is the on
the<00:02:29.349> Google<00:02:29.620> Play<00:02:29.769> so<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.069> now<00:02:30.390> bloom<00:02:31.390> should

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
the Google Play so it now bloom should

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.850 
the Google Play so it now bloom should
be<00:02:31.690> there<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.049> a<00:02:32.080> lot<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.290> data<00:02:32.470> should<00:02:32.739> be

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
be there and a lot of data should be

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.640 
be there and a lot of data should be
copied<00:02:33.130> across<00:02:35.220> we<00:02:36.220> just<00:02:36.459> get<00:02:36.670> there<00:02:37.560> hit<00:02:38.560> with

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
copied across we just get there hit with

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.120 
copied across we just get there hit with
a<00:02:38.739> plume<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.690> there<00:02:40.870> we<00:02:40.930> go<00:02:41.080> I've<00:02:41.620> not<00:02:41.830> set<00:02:42.040> it

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
a plume and there we go I've not set it

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.890 
a plume and there we go I've not set it
up<00:02:42.220> here<00:02:42.459> it's<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.180> automatic<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.690> pulled

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
up here it's just automatic you pulled

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.620 
up here it's just automatic you pulled
it<00:02:44.049> over<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.890> there's<00:02:45.579> that<00:02:45.849> shared<00:02:46.269> set<00:02:46.599> of

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
it over and there's that shared set of

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.900 
it over and there's that shared set of
data<00:02:46.959> which<00:02:47.709> is<00:02:47.860> what<00:02:47.890> makes<00:02:48.280> switch<00:02:48.670> so

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
data which is what makes switch so

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.270 
data which is what makes switch so
useful<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:50.099> then<00:02:51.099> again<00:02:52.769> there's<00:02:53.769> no<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:54.069> data

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
useful and then again there's no up data

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.280 
useful and then again there's no up data
here<00:02:54.640> because<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.450> updating<00:02:55.870> has<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.079> be<00:02:56.170> done

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290
