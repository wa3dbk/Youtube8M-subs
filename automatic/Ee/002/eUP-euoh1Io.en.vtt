00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
looks like a wave or waving so that's

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.469 
looks like a wave or waving so that's
why<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> cover<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.600> DVD<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:17.479> this

somewhat but once you know the basic

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.469 
somewhat but once you know the basic
structure<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.130> skeleton<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.119> dance

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
structure the skeleton of the dance

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.600 
structure the skeleton of the dance
response<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> isolation<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> waving

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
response the isolation of the waving

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.490 
response the isolation of the waving
it's<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.659> gonna<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> same<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it's all gonna be the same and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.620 
it's all gonna be the same and
everything's<00:01:46.920> could<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.579> easy<00:01:47.880> let's<00:01:48.420> say

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
everything's could be so easy let's say

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.450 
everything's could be so easy let's say
when<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.899> want<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> learn<00:01:49.320> from<00:01:49.530> our<00:01:49.710> more

the elite or other dvds combine waving

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.649 
the elite or other dvds combine waving
you<00:01:56.100> might<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.460> problem<00:01:56.820> doing<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.540> you

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
you might have problem doing that if you

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.719 
you might have problem doing that if you
don't<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> structure<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> wave<00:01:58.920> so

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
don't know the structure of the wave so

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.280 
don't know the structure of the wave so
this<00:02:00.000> DVD<00:02:00.360> will<00:02:00.390> definitely<00:02:01.140> break

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this DVD will definitely break

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
of course it's going to

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.740 
of course it's going to
practice<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:06.400> we're<00:02:07.400> going<00:02:07.550> to<00:02:07.640> go<00:02:07.820> over<00:02:07.850> the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
practice so we're going to go over the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.630 
practice so we're going to go over the
basic<00:02:09.140> clicks<00:02:09.470> which<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.190> structure<00:02:10.610> of

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640

cobra isolation we go do some ideas as

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.210 
cobra isolation we go do some ideas as
well<00:02:22.940> tracing<00:02:23.660> waves<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.260> we're<00:02:24.920> going<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.130> do

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
well tracing waves and we're going to do

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.990
