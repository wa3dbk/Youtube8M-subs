imagine a tree then we know it starts

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.940 
imagine a tree then we know it starts
with<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.549> base<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.570> base<00:01:35.720> mates<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:36.470> one

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
with a base and the base mates this one

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.050 
with a base and the base mates this one
one<00:01:37.250> one<00:01:37.659> that<00:01:38.659> was<00:01:38.750> stupid

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
modulation so I have a bit of luck this

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.020 
modulation so I have a bit of luck this
first<00:01:48.250> is<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.670> one<00:01:49.850> who<00:01:50.509> goes<00:01:50.720> here<00:01:51.320> but<00:01:52.119> I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
first is the one who goes here but I

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.109 
first is the one who goes here but I
notice<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:57.409> in<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.740> full<00:01:57.950> song<00:01:58.189> this<00:01:58.700> one

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
notice that in the full song this one

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.680 
notice that in the full song this one
one<00:01:59.390> one<00:01:59.689> is<00:01:59.930> repeated<00:02:00.500> more<00:02:00.830> than<00:02:00.890> once<00:02:01.069> so

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
one one is repeated more than once so

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:25.809 
one one is repeated more than once so
let<00:02:02.690> me<00:02:02.810> listen<00:02:02.960> again<00:02:20.769> and<00:02:24.310> some<00:02:25.310> five<00:02:25.549> times

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
let me listen again and some five times

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.220 
let me listen again and some five times
yeah<00:02:26.330> so<00:02:27.019> I<00:02:27.580> need<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.819> say<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:31.310> secret<00:02:31.700> that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
yeah so I need to say to the secret that

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.920 
yeah so I need to say to the secret that
this<00:02:33.230> base<00:02:33.950> needs<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.820> be<00:02:34.940> playing<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.390> five

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
this base needs to be playing it five

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.190 
this base needs to be playing it five
times<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.859> press<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.880> hold<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.359> select<00:02:38.840> it

times so I press and hold and select it
five<00:02:39.680> times<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.310> these<00:02:41.180> will<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.540> play<00:02:41.720> five

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
five times so these will you play five

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.440 
five times so these will you play five
times<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.500> think<00:02:43.070> it's<00:02:43.489> okay<00:02:44.299> right<00:02:44.480> now<00:02:45.190> so

times I think it's okay right now so
there's<00:02:47.450> only<00:02:47.660> another<00:02:48.320> yellow<00:02:48.739> shape<00:02:49.100> free

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
there's only another yellow shape free

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.720 
there's only another yellow shape free
this<00:02:49.880> is<00:02:50.030> our<00:02:50.180> relativity<00:02:51.160> level<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.519> game

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
this is our relativity level of the game

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:01.120 
this is our relativity level of the game
okay<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.660> we<00:02:53.930> need<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.739> put<00:02:56.920> four<00:03:00.130> great

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
circles in that places so let me go get

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:18.330 
circles in that places so let me go get
to<00:03:06.680> this<00:03:06.799> one

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.910 
remains is to listen to the person we
have<00:04:09.230> created<00:04:10.160> and<00:04:10.459> when<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.540> energy<00:04:11.920> reads

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
have created and when the energy reads

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.820 
have created and when the energy reads
the<00:04:13.640> end<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:14.569> will<00:04:14.780> check<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:15.260> will<00:04:15.560> tell

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
the end this will check and will tell

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.080 
the end this will check and will tell
you<00:04:15.980> if<00:04:16.220> we<00:04:16.459> do<00:04:16.609> it<00:04:17.109> in<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.290> right<00:04:18.470> way<00:04:18.919> or<00:04:19.700> in

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
you if we do it in the right way or in

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.390 
you if we do it in the right way or in
the<00:04:20.180> ground<00:04:20.329> way<00:04:20.540> if<00:04:20.750> we<00:04:21.019> add<00:04:21.169> if<00:04:21.919> we<00:04:22.070> do<00:04:22.190> in<00:04:22.280> the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
the ground way if we add if we do in the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.860 
the ground way if we add if we do in the
right<00:04:22.610> way<00:04:22.760> we<00:04:22.940> can<00:04:23.120> continue<00:04:23.480> to<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.630> next

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
right way we can continue to the next

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.219 
right way we can continue to the next
level<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.230> if<00:04:24.320> not<00:04:24.530> we<00:04:25.430> must<00:04:26.950> reorganize<00:04:29.229> the

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
level and if not we must reorganize the

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.920 
level and if not we must reorganize the
pieces<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.650> complete<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:31.040> song<00:04:31.190> so<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.930> think

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
pieces to complete the song so I think

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.330 
pieces to complete the song so I think
it's<00:04:33.910> well<00:04:34.910> done<00:04:35.060> so
