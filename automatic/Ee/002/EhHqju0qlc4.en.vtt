yellow<00:02:08.310> dot<00:02:08.929> indeed<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.110> headed<00:02:10.319> straight

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
yellow dot indeed it's headed straight

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.979 
yellow dot indeed it's headed straight
for<00:02:10.649> us<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.790> may<00:02:11.940> pass<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> little<00:02:12.629> bit<00:02:12.750> high

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
for us but it may pass a little bit high

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.880 
for us but it may pass a little bit high
and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.860 
and
possibly<00:02:14.160> only<00:02:14.730> grazed<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.480> northern

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
possibly only grazed the northern

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.990 
possibly only grazed the northern
hemisphere<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.410> our<00:02:16.620> magnetic<00:02:17.069> field<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.880> it

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
hemisphere of our magnetic field so it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.600 
hemisphere of our magnetic field so it
may<00:02:18.209> or<00:02:18.480> may<00:02:18.690> not<00:02:18.890> generate<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.069> large

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
may or may not generate a large

may or may not generate a large
geomagnetic<00:02:21.540> storm<00:02:22.580> but<00:02:23.580> it's<00:02:23.670> important<00:02:23.940> to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
geomagnetic storm but it's important to

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.180 
geomagnetic storm but it's important to
be<00:02:24.060> aware<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:25.080> coronal<00:02:26.069> mass

be aware that as this coronal mass

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.440 
be aware that as this coronal mass
ejection<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.670> headed<00:02:26.940> towards<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.270> earth

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
ejection is headed towards the earth

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.410 
ejection is headed towards the earth
right<00:02:28.440> now<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.680> very<00:02:28.950> large<00:02:29.250> unstable<00:02:30.090> storm

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
right now a very large unstable storm

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.330 
right now a very large unstable storm
system<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:30.959> forming<00:02:31.410> inside<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:32.010> Gulf<00:02:32.220> of

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
system is forming inside the Gulf of

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.600 
system is forming inside the Gulf of
Alaska<00:02:32.930> now<00:02:33.930> what<00:02:34.320> coronal<00:02:34.830> mass<00:02:35.040> ejections

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
Alaska now what coronal mass ejections

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.120 
Alaska now what coronal mass ejections
and<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:36.030> subsequent<00:02:36.660> geomagnetic<00:02:37.650> storms

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
and the subsequent geomagnetic storms

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.660 
and the subsequent geomagnetic storms
tend<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:39.780> not<00:02:40.709> only<00:02:41.040> send<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
tend to do is not just not only send the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.979 
tend to do is not just not only send the
northern<00:02:42.090> lights<00:02:42.270> down<00:02:42.510> into<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.840> lower

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
northern lights down into the lower

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.199 
northern lights down into the lower
latitudes<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.739> we<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:43.950> see<00:02:44.130> them<00:02:44.340> down<00:02:45.000> in

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
latitudes so we can see them down in

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.740 
latitudes so we can see them down in
Michigan<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.100> Arkansas<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:48.030> they<00:02:48.150> also<00:02:48.330> tend

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
Michigan and Arkansas but they also tend

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.009 
Michigan and Arkansas but they also tend
to<00:02:48.930> intensify<00:02:50.060> low-pressure<00:02:51.060> systems<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.959> the

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
to intensify low-pressure systems in the

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.070 
to intensify low-pressure systems in the
Gulf<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.709> Alaska<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.760> create<00:02:54.030> large<00:02:54.420> storms

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
Gulf of Alaska to create large storms

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.960 
Gulf of Alaska to create large storms
that<00:02:55.290> then<00:02:55.440> get<00:02:55.620> sent<00:02:55.950> down<00:02:56.040> into<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.790> lower

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
that then get sent down into the lower

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.050 
that then get sent down into the lower
48<00:02:57.480> states<00:02:58.519> so<00:02:59.519> as<00:02:59.820> we<00:03:00.690> exit<00:03:01.110> 2011<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.880> may

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
48 states so as we exit 2011 we may

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.900 
48 states so as we exit 2011 we may
indeed<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.570> inside<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:05.250> calm<00:03:05.519> before<00:03:05.700> the

indeed be inside of the calm before the
storm<00:03:07.190> thank<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.340> I'll<00:03:08.820> see<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.060> next<00:03:09.150> year
