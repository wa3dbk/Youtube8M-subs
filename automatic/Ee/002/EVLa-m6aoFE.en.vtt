00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
able to understand it better in terms of

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.100

sure that they can understand the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.380 
sure that they can understand the
English<00:03:16.959> but<00:03:17.959> it's<00:03:18.140> much<00:03:18.530> richer<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.400> more

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
English but it's much richer and more

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
fuller it's alright I'm only biased so

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.520 
fuller it's alright I'm only biased so
why<00:03:25.730> is<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:26.300> important<00:03:26.840> for<00:03:26.900> Marty<00:03:27.380> who

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
why is it so important for Marty who

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.380 
why is it so important for Marty who
largely<00:03:27.830> today<00:03:28.370> have<00:03:28.610> English<00:03:28.970> as<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.150> first

language to have the Bible in today
Amari<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:32.680> think<00:03:33.680> it's<00:03:33.860> just<00:03:35.590> because<00:03:36.590> it

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
Amari I think it's just because it

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.880 
Amari I think it's just because it
belongs<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.489> us<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:38.060> think<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:39.140> probably<00:03:39.650> the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
belongs to us I think that probably the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.390 
belongs to us I think that probably the
simplest<00:03:40.220> way<00:03:40.370> as<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.820> can<00:03:41.090> hey<00:03:41.630> Mari<00:03:42.530> humor<00:03:43.070> is

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
simplest way as I can hey Mari humor is

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.920 
simplest way as I can hey Mari humor is
kind<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.820> indifferent<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.880> it's<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.600> way

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
kind of indifferent to and it's the way

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.949 
kind of indifferent to and it's the way
that<00:03:48.590> language<00:03:49.130> expresses<00:03:49.610> our<00:03:50.209> feelings<00:03:50.780> I

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
that language expresses our feelings I

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.530 
that language expresses our feelings I
think<00:03:51.160> more<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:52.370> than<00:03:52.610> we're<00:03:53.420> always

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
think more so than we're always

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.449 
think more so than we're always
struggling<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.290> find<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.739> right<00:03:54.920> word<00:03:55.190> to
