different unique password and now if I
go<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.690> my<00:02:55.840> autoresponder<00:02:56.500> here<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.430> what

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
go to my autoresponder here this is what

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.370 
go to my autoresponder here this is what
drip<00:02:58.540> feeds<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.380> content<00:02:59.860> automatically<00:03:01.380> you

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
drip feeds the content automatically you

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.100 
drip feeds the content automatically you
can<00:03:02.560> see<00:03:02.739> that<00:03:02.980> messaged<00:03:03.700> one<00:03:04.060> interval<00:03:04.720> zero

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
can see that messaged one interval zero

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.340 
can see that messaged one interval zero
which<00:03:05.470> means<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.730> first<00:03:07.060> pack<00:03:07.690> goes<00:03:08.140> out

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
which means that the first pack goes out

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.460 
which means that the first pack goes out
right<00:03:08.680> away<00:03:08.830> after<00:03:09.730> they've<00:03:10.060> signed<00:03:10.390> up<00:03:10.660> and

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
right away after they've signed up and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.949 
right away after they've signed up and
of<00:03:11.590> course<00:03:11.890> after<00:03:12.370> they<00:03:12.640> have<00:03:13.090> purchased<00:03:13.570> they

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
of course after they have purchased they

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.460 
of course after they have purchased they
need<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.890> sign<00:03:15.100> up<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.579> autoresponder

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
need to sign up to the autoresponder

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.720 
need to sign up to the autoresponder
technically<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.680> an<00:03:17.829> autoresponder<00:03:18.130> but

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
technically it is an autoresponder but

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.530 
technically it is an autoresponder but
in<00:03:19.390> our<00:03:19.540> case<00:03:19.720> we<00:03:19.989> are<00:03:20.230> using<00:03:20.370> this

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
in our case we are using this

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.810 
in our case we are using this
autoresponder<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:23.019> sign<00:03:23.410> up<00:03:23.560> members<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:24.670> then

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
autoresponder to sign up members so then

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.729 
autoresponder to sign up members so then
they<00:03:24.940> can<00:03:25.000> automatically<00:03:25.570> receive<00:03:25.780> each

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
they can automatically receive each

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.949 
they can automatically receive each
module<00:03:27.280> for<00:03:27.640> each<00:03:27.790> pack<00:03:28.120> every<00:03:28.510> single<00:03:28.810> month

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
module for each pack every single month

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.800 
module for each pack every single month
now<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:29.799> can<00:03:29.920> see<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.310> next<00:03:31.090> few<00:03:31.390> messages

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
now you can see the next few messages

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.800 
now you can see the next few messages
message<00:03:32.470> two<00:03:32.799> goes<00:03:33.040> out<00:03:33.220> 30<00:03:33.610> days<00:03:33.880> after<00:03:34.329> the

most<00:04:24.200> people<00:04:24.440> will<00:04:24.590> fail<00:04:24.680> to<00:04:25.280> create<00:04:25.550> their

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
most people will fail to create their

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.310 
most people will fail to create their
own<00:04:25.820> membership<00:04:26.120> sites<00:04:26.480> because<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.900> seems<00:04:27.139> so

complicated that you pretty much need a
computer<00:04:30.350> degree<00:04:30.620> for<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.100> so<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:32.000> is<00:04:32.180> a

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
computer degree for it so this is a

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.080 
computer degree for it so this is a
really<00:04:32.690> easy<00:04:33.020> way<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.740> create<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.669> membership

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
really easy way to create a membership

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.830 
really easy way to create a membership
site<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:36.770> contained<00:04:37.250> in<00:04:37.430> each<00:04:37.730> message<00:04:38.030> is<00:04:38.480> the

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
site so contained in each message is the

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.060 
site so contained in each message is the
URL<00:04:39.169> for<00:04:39.650> each<00:04:40.250> of<00:04:40.430> these<00:04:40.520> packs<00:04:41.560> in<00:04:42.560> here<00:04:42.889> and
