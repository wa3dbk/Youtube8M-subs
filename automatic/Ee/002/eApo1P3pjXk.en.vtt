something I highly recommend is that you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.100 
something I highly recommend is that you
don't<00:01:13.340> double<00:01:14.180> up<00:01:14.240> on<00:01:14.390> fur<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:14.750> need<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:14.930> cut

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
out each piece individually the patch

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.600 
out each piece individually the patch
the<00:01:18.290> pattern<00:01:18.619> symmetrical<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.399> don't

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
the pattern symmetrical so you don't

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.480 
the pattern symmetrical so you don't
were<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:20.270> worry<00:01:20.450> about<00:01:21.100> flipping<00:01:22.100> over<00:01:22.369> the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
were to worry about flipping over the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.330 
were to worry about flipping over the
patterns<00:01:22.939> you<00:01:23.119> just<00:01:23.149> need<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.479> cut<00:01:23.659> out<00:01:23.810> two

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
patterns you just need to cut out two

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.969 
patterns you just need to cut out two
singly<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.909> fur<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.509> make<00:01:27.020> sure<00:01:27.289> that<00:01:27.799> the

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
singly of the fur and make sure that the

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.350 
singly of the fur and make sure that the
NAP<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.430> fur<00:01:28.579> is<00:01:28.729> going<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.180> same

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
NAP of the fur is going the same

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.810 
NAP of the fur is going the same
direction<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:30.079> like<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.350> have<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.820> going

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
direction and I like to have it going

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.230 
direction and I like to have it going
down<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.240> glove<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:32.719> you'll<00:01:33.200> just<00:01:33.289> kind<00:01:33.979> of

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
down the glove so you'll just kind of

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.490 
down the glove so you'll just kind of
pet<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.450> fur<00:01:35.630> if<00:01:35.689> you<00:01:35.899> will<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.229> see<00:01:36.350> what

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
pet the fur if you will and see what

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.170 
pet the fur if you will and see what
direction<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.070> lies<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:37.939> want<00:01:38.119> to

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
direction it lies and so you want to

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.969 
direction it lies and so you want to
have<00:01:38.299> it<00:01:38.479> lying<00:01:38.840> all<00:01:39.109> in<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.469> same<00:01:39.680> direction

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
have it lying all in the same direction

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.609 
have it lying all in the same direction
on<00:01:40.310> both<00:01:40.609> sides<00:01:41.329> of<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.600> cuff<00:01:41.780> when<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.109> put

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
on both sides of the cuff when you put

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.190 
on both sides of the cuff when you put
it<00:01:42.710> together<00:01:43.329> another<00:01:44.329> thing<00:01:44.570> is<00:01:44.719> is<00:01:44.899> that<00:01:45.049> you

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
it together another thing is is that you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.959 
it together another thing is is that you
really<00:01:45.500> want<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.799> cut<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.159> either<00:01:46.490> outside

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
or it when you're done cutting it inside

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.249 
or it when you're done cutting it inside
