00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:02.540 
so now I'm going to go ahead and use the

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.180 
so now I'm going to go ahead and use the
tube<00:00:03.540> form<00:00:03.780> figure<00:00:04.049> that<00:00:04.259> I've<00:00:04.799> established

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
tube form figure that I've established

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.040 
tube form figure that I've established
already<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.589> draw<00:00:07.700> some<00:00:08.700> perspective<00:00:09.210> so

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
already and and draw some perspective so

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.079 
already and and draw some perspective so
I've<00:00:10.230> got<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.559> figure<00:00:13.549> angled<00:00:14.549> towards<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
I've got this figure angled towards the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.630 
I've got this figure angled towards the
the<00:00:15.480> viewer<00:00:15.830> the<00:00:16.830> legs<00:00:17.039> extended<00:00:17.580> out

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
the viewer the legs extended out

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.910 
the viewer the legs extended out
backwards<00:00:19.460> and<00:00:20.630> now<00:00:21.630> for<00:00:22.260> shorten<00:00:22.560> port<00:00:22.769> on

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
backwards and now for shorten port on

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.540 
backwards and now for shorten port on
both<00:00:23.369> arms<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:24.560> longer<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> forearm<00:00:26.250> than

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
both arms out longer in the forearm than

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.080 
both arms out longer in the forearm than
the<00:00:26.699> back<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> arm<00:00:27.510> longer<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.140> hand

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
the back of the arm longer in the hand

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.359 
the back of the arm longer in the hand
his<00:00:30.090> other<00:00:30.300> arm<00:00:30.390> I'm<00:00:31.260> gonna<00:00:31.920> draw<00:00:32.160> actually

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
his other arm I'm gonna draw actually

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.400 
his other arm I'm gonna draw actually
much<00:00:32.669> shorter<00:00:32.700> than<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.840> arm<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.140> I've<00:00:34.230> just

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
much shorter than the arm that I've just

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.200 
much shorter than the arm that I've just
drawn<00:00:34.620> because<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.820> shorten<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
drawn because it's a it's for shorten a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.459 
drawn because it's a it's for shorten a
great<00:00:36.390> deal<00:00:36.540> more<00:00:36.780> because<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.260> coming

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
great deal more because it's coming

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.959 
great deal more because it's coming
directly<00:00:37.710> towards<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.550> opposed<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
directly towards you as opposed to the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.720 
directly towards you as opposed to the
other<00:00:39.090> arm<00:00:39.300> that's<00:00:39.540> actually<00:00:39.870> pointed<00:00:40.730> toward

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
other arm that's actually pointed toward

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:50.180 
other arm that's actually pointed toward
in<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.030> way<00:00:42.210> yeah<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:43.170> worth<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.800> away<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:49.190> think

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
in a way yeah it's worth it away I think

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.840 
in a way yeah it's worth it away I think
for<00:00:50.370> figure<00:00:50.610> drawing<00:00:51.649> this<00:00:52.649> stuff<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.730> I'm

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
for figure drawing this stuff that I'm

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.479 
for figure drawing this stuff that I'm
doing<00:00:53.969> right<00:00:54.239> now<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.680> far<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.340> way<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
doing right now is by far in a way the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.279 
doing right now is by far in a way the
most<00:00:56.789> important<00:00:57.449> thing<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.629> you'll<00:00:57.930> do

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
most important thing that you'll do

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.740 
most important thing that you'll do
everything<00:00:58.530> else<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.280> detail<00:00:59.640> even<00:01:00.539> the

everything else is just detail even the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.110 
everything else is just detail even the
anatomy<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> certain<00:01:01.710> extent<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.640> detail

something somebody diving into a
swimming<00:02:01.530> pool<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.770> could<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:03.170> without

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
swimming pool you could do that without

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.600 
swimming pool you could do that without
having<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.649> look<00:02:04.829> at<00:02:04.950> anything<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.490> that's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
having to look at anything and that's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.700 
having to look at anything and that's
really<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.969> whole<00:02:06.090> point<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.689> doing<00:02:07.079> this

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
really the whole point of doing this

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.710 
really the whole point of doing this
being<00:02:08.520> able<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.729> break<00:02:08.910> down<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.149> figure<00:02:09.539> it

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
being able to break down a figure it

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.190 
being able to break down a figure it
into<00:02:10.530> such<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> simple<00:02:11.160> form<00:02:11.430> that

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
into such a simple form that

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.050 
into such a simple form that
you<00:02:12.349> can<00:02:12.800> start<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:13.280> actually<00:02:13.430> play<00:02:13.760> with<00:02:13.790> that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
you can start to actually play with that

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.210 
you can start to actually play with that
figure<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.480> animate<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.050> in<00:02:15.140> your<00:02:15.319> mind<00:02:15.530> so

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
figure and animate it in your mind so

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.420 
figure and animate it in your mind so
now<00:02:16.250> I've<00:02:16.640> got<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.819> figure<00:02:17.030> sitting<00:02:17.300> down<00:02:21.430> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
now I've got a figure sitting down the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.910 
now I've got a figure sitting down the
foreground<00:02:22.819> leg<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.900> leg<00:02:24.110> coming<00:02:24.620> towards

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
foreground leg the leg coming towards

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.259 
foreground leg the leg coming towards
this<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.160> much<00:02:25.400> more<00:02:25.580> foreshortened<00:02:26.090> than<00:02:26.180> the

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
this is much more foreshortened than the

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:34.330 
this is much more foreshortened than the
other<00:02:26.390> one<00:02:26.569> and<00:02:31.599> these<00:02:32.599> take<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.890> little<00:02:34.190> time

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
other one and these take so little time

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.839 
other one and these take so little time
to<00:02:34.519> draw<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:36.370> once<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.459> start<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.730> get

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
to draw that once you start to get

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:38.830 
to draw that once you start to get
comfortable<00:02:38.120> with<00:02:38.239> them<00:02:38.390> yeah<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:38.630> think

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
comfortable with them yeah I think

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.509 
comfortable with them yeah I think
you'll<00:02:39.080> find<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.410> they're<00:02:39.620> very<00:02:39.860> relaxing

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
you'll find that they're very relaxing

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.180 
you'll find that they're very relaxing
to<00:02:40.670> do<00:02:40.849> they<00:02:41.390> can<00:02:42.080> be<00:02:42.170> kind<00:02:42.379> of<00:02:42.410> cathartic<00:02:42.769> you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
to do they can be kind of cathartic you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.259 
to do they can be kind of cathartic you
just<00:02:43.400> sit<00:02:43.549> down<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.910> fill<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.090> whole

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
just sit down and fill a whole

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.000 
just sit down and fill a whole
sketchbook<00:02:44.660> with<00:02:44.810> them<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.440> recommend

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
sketchbook with them and I recommend

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.180 
sketchbook with them and I recommend
that<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.220> do<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.610> because<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.709> what

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
that you do that because that is what

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.400 
that you do that because that is what
makes<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.459> difference<00:02:49.580> between<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.480> dynamic

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
makes the difference between a dynamic

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.979 
makes the difference between a dynamic
artist<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.239> an<00:02:53.239> artist<00:02:53.599> that<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.780> really

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
artist and an artist that it really

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.559 
artist and an artist that it really
isn't<00:02:54.110> quite<00:02:54.380> as<00:02:54.500> dynamic<00:02:55.690> just<00:02:58.569> really

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
isn't quite as dynamic just really

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.000 
isn't quite as dynamic just really
getting<00:02:59.720> comfortable<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.440> familiar<00:03:00.560> with

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
getting comfortable and familiar with

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.550 
getting comfortable and familiar with
the<00:03:01.190> way<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:02.060> body<00:03:02.390> moves<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.110> limits<00:03:03.440> of

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
the way the body moves and the limits of

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.979 
the way the body moves and the limits of
the<00:03:03.680> body<00:03:03.799> has<00:03:04.069> because<00:03:04.569> there's<00:03:05.569> only<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:05.959> far

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
the body has because there's only so far

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.110 
the body has because there's only so far
that<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:06.680> can<00:03:06.860> turn<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.250> chest<00:03:07.459> away<00:03:07.670> from

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
that you can turn the chest away from

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.809 
that you can turn the chest away from
the<00:03:08.299> pelvis<00:03:08.769> if<00:03:09.769> you<00:03:10.010> turn<00:03:10.310> one<00:03:10.340> way<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.790> other

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
the pelvis if you turn one way the other

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.150 
the pelvis if you turn one way the other
and<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.180> other<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.510> other<00:03:11.540> way<00:03:11.780> there's<00:03:12.019> only

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
and the other the other way there's only

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.460 
and the other the other way there's only
so<00:03:13.160> far<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.849> you<00:03:13.940> can<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.780> can<00:03:14.959> lift<00:03:15.260> your

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
so far that you can you can lift your

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.069 
so far that you can you can lift your
arm<00:03:15.650> directly<00:03:15.950> over<00:03:16.310> your<00:03:16.459> head<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.970> back<00:03:17.690> or

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
arm directly over your head and back or

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.699 
arm directly over your head and back or
you<00:03:18.799> can<00:03:18.920> turn<00:03:19.130> your<00:03:19.370> neck<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:21.200> if<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.500> push

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
you can turn your neck and if you push

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.220 
you can turn your neck and if you push
those<00:03:21.859> things<00:03:22.160> too<00:03:22.400> far<00:03:22.660> your<00:03:23.660> figures<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.079> can

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
those things too far your figures it can

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.289 
those things too far your figures it can
become<00:03:24.560> very<00:03:24.799> unnatural<00:03:25.160> looking<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:25.940> if<00:03:26.209> you

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
become very unnatural looking and if you

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.030 
become very unnatural looking and if you
don't<00:03:26.450> push<00:03:26.600> those<00:03:26.780> things<00:03:26.959> far<00:03:27.380> enough<00:03:27.680> your

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
don't push those things far enough your

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.670 
don't push those things far enough your
figures<00:03:28.340> could<00:03:28.549> be<00:03:28.609> very<00:03:29.269> stiff<00:03:29.600> looking<00:03:29.959> so

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
figures could be very stiff looking so

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.440 
figures could be very stiff looking so
it's<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.250> matter<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:33.880> learning<00:03:34.880> those<00:03:35.209> things

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
it's a matter of learning those things

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.000 
it's a matter of learning those things
well<00:03:35.780> enough<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:36.319> it<00:03:36.440> just<00:03:36.620> becomes<00:03:36.859> natural

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
well enough that it just becomes natural

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.960 
well enough that it just becomes natural
for<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:37.940> my<00:03:38.510> only<00:03:38.870> really<00:03:39.670> real<00:03:40.670> way<00:03:40.940> of

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
for you and my only really real way of

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.420 
for you and my only really real way of
knowing<00:03:41.329> how<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.480> do<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.900> is<00:03:42.109> to<00:03:42.290> just<00:03:42.430> keep

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
knowing how to do that is to just keep

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.120 
knowing how to do that is to just keep
drawing<00:03:43.730> these<00:03:44.000> things<00:03:44.470> I'm<00:03:45.470> just<00:03:45.889> making

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
drawing these things I'm just making

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.740 
drawing these things I'm just making
these<00:03:46.220> up<00:03:46.280> out<00:03:46.519> of<00:03:46.609> my<00:03:46.639> head<00:03:46.910> but<00:03:47.359> these<00:03:47.450> all

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
these up out of my head but these all

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.080 
these up out of my head but these all
really<00:03:48.079> come<00:03:48.290> from<00:03:48.560> my<00:03:48.799> background<00:03:49.090> my

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
really come from my background my

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.819 
really come from my background my
artistic<00:03:50.450> background<00:03:50.750> they're<00:03:51.230> all<00:03:51.350> figures

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
artistic background they're all figures

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.759 
artistic background they're all figures
that<00:03:52.160> have<00:03:52.639> become<00:03:53.329> comfortable<00:03:53.840> with<00:03:53.900> from

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
that have become comfortable with from

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.589 
that have become comfortable with from
looking<00:03:55.010> at<00:03:55.099> other<00:03:55.250> artists<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:56.180> looking<00:03:56.510> at

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
looking at other artists and looking at

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.780 
looking at other artists and looking at
life<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.250> frankly<00:03:58.250> looking<00:03:58.549> at<00:03:58.639> other

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
life and frankly looking at other

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.720 
life and frankly looking at other
artists<00:03:59.269> I<00:03:59.389> mean<00:03:59.950> I'm<00:04:00.950> really<00:04:01.190> not<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.519> sort

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
artists I mean I'm really not the sort

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.759 
artists I mean I'm really not the sort
of<00:04:01.790> artist<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.630> draws<00:04:03.019> life<00:04:03.440> it's<00:04:03.680> just

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
of artist that draws life it's just

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.569 
of artist that draws life it's just
really<00:04:04.069> not<00:04:04.280> what<00:04:05.269> I'm<00:04:05.389> about<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:06.579> think

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.170 
fantastic environment so what I want to
do<00:04:18.019> is<00:04:18.349> develop<00:04:19.039> a<00:04:19.250> figure<00:04:19.459> that's<00:04:19.700> effective

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
do is develop a figure that's effective

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.589 
do is develop a figure that's effective
enough<00:04:20.419> to<00:04:20.720> get<00:04:21.169> that<00:04:21.320> across<00:04:21.880> but<00:04:22.880> fantastic

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
enough to get that across but fantastic

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.040 
enough to get that across but fantastic
enough<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:24.080> still<00:04:24.289> make<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.590> interesting

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.740 

and<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.319> in<00:04:29.039> order<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.400> do<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.699> I've<00:04:30.479> looked

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
and so in order to do that I've looked

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.430 
and so in order to do that I've looked
at<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:30.900> lot<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.199> different<00:04:31.500> artists<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.639> I

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
at a lot of different artists and and I

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.409 
at a lot of different artists and and I
found<00:04:35.780> one<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.960> best<00:04:37.139> ways<00:04:37.349> to<00:04:38.220> really<00:04:39.210> get

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
found one of the best ways to really get

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.700 
found one of the best ways to really get
better<00:04:39.539> with<00:04:39.750> your<00:04:39.840> finger<00:04:40.110> drawing<00:04:40.380> is<00:04:40.590> to

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
better with your finger drawing is to

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.879 
better with your finger drawing is to
just<00:04:41.780> pick<00:04:42.780> an<00:04:42.900> artist<00:04:43.199> that<00:04:43.259> you<00:04:43.319> like<00:04:43.590> that

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
just pick an artist that you like that

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.620 
just pick an artist that you like that
you<00:04:44.009> know<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.370> feel<00:04:44.699> like<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.150> really<00:04:45.389> draws

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
you know you feel like it really draws

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.990 
you know you feel like it really draws
dynamic<00:04:46.229> figures<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:47.550> really<00:04:47.699> work

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
dynamic figures that that really work

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.400 
dynamic figures that that really work
for<00:04:48.030> you<00:04:48.419> and<00:04:48.530> represent<00:04:49.530> maybe<00:04:51.229> some<00:04:52.229> of<00:04:52.349> the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
for you and represent maybe some of the

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.779 
for you and represent maybe some of the
direction<00:04:52.770> that<00:04:52.889> you<00:04:52.979> want<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.250> go<00:04:53.340> in<00:04:53.550> and

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
direction that you want to go in and

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.850 
direction that you want to go in and
then<00:04:54.690> just<00:04:56.449> go<00:04:57.449> through<00:04:57.690> their<00:04:57.840> work<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.349> and

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
then just go through their work and and

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.189 
then just go through their work and and
copy<00:04:59.430> out<00:04:59.669> what<00:04:59.819> you<00:04:59.940> see<00:05:00.150> in<00:05:00.509> these<00:05:00.960> simple

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
copy out what you see in these simple

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.029 
copy out what you see in these simple
forms<00:05:02.840> panel<00:05:03.840> by<00:05:03.930> panel<00:05:04.110> if<00:05:04.349> it's<00:05:04.500> comic<00:05:04.860> book

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
forms panel by panel if it's comic book

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.680 
forms panel by panel if it's comic book
or<00:05:05.490> whatever<00:05:05.880> it<00:05:06.060> happens<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.449> be<00:05:06.569> but

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
or whatever it happens to be but

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.689 
or whatever it happens to be but
recommend<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.680> comic<00:05:07.979> book<00:05:08.009> really<00:05:09.860> if<00:05:10.860> you

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
recommend a comic book really if you

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.249 
recommend a comic book really if you
pick<00:05:11.880> an<00:05:11.970> artist<00:05:12.270> it's<00:05:12.419> very<00:05:12.630> dynamic<00:05:12.840> you'll

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
pick an artist it's very dynamic you'll

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.559 
pick an artist it's very dynamic you'll
start<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.620> pick<00:05:13.770> up<00:05:14.030> some<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.150> their<00:05:15.240> tricks

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
start to pick up some of their tricks

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.580 
start to pick up some of their tricks
and<00:05:15.949> if<00:05:16.949> you<00:05:17.069> do<00:05:17.280> this<00:05:17.520> enough<00:05:18.199> if<00:05:19.199> you<00:05:19.319> do<00:05:19.440> this

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
and if you do this enough if you do this

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.899 
and if you do this enough if you do this
for<00:05:19.770> months<00:05:20.009> and<00:05:20.159> fill<00:05:20.340> sketchbooks

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
for months and fill sketchbooks

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.990 
for months and fill sketchbooks
eventually<00:05:21.780> you<00:05:22.349> will<00:05:22.590> become<00:05:22.979> very<00:05:23.550> good<00:05:23.849> at

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
eventually you will become very good at

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.290 
eventually you will become very good at
drawing<00:05:24.240> dynamic<00:05:24.990> figures<00:05:25.340> it's<00:05:26.340> something<00:05:26.699> I

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
drawing dynamic figures it's something I

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.219 
drawing dynamic figures it's something I
think<00:05:28.520> every<00:05:29.520> single<00:05:29.669> artist<00:05:30.060> could<00:05:30.870> benefit

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
think every single artist could benefit

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.890 
think every single artist could benefit
from<00:05:31.310> and<00:05:32.310> far<00:05:32.880> more<00:05:33.060> important<00:05:33.479> than<00:05:33.509> being

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
from and far more important than being

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.700 
from and far more important than being
able<00:05:34.020> to<00:05:34.229> draw<00:05:36.770> nice<00:05:37.770> shadowing<00:05:38.250> or<00:05:38.460> rendering

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
able to draw nice shadowing or rendering

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.779 
able to draw nice shadowing or rendering
being<00:05:40.710> able<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:40.919> draw<00:05:41.130> figures<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.639> get<00:05:41.759> a

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
being able to draw figures that get a

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.029 
being able to draw figures that get a
motion<00:05:42.000> across<00:05:42.419> with<00:05:42.659> their<00:05:42.810> body<00:05:43.020> is<00:05:43.440> is<00:05:43.770> the

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
motion across with their body is is the

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.909 
motion across with their body is is the
most<00:05:44.219> important<00:05:44.729> thing
