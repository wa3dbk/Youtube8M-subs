00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:08.069
 hey here is channel and this is that 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.559
 asus from pet we had yesterday on the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.300
 asus event the possibility the apron 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.070
 ever we might unpack in 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.719
 Video has now got the chance 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.520
 the device will be a bit more accurate 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.680
 to look at and therefore wanted one 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.109
 small window for you to talk 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.510
 As you can see , the device sees the nexus 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.279
 Pretty much like that here 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.470
 next 7 this is the format though 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.260
 there are a few differences 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.480
 and in the bus from the field are a few 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.530
 features it in my eyes then 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.040
 but a little more interesting 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.680
 do 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.629
 as the next 7 I will come 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.140
 But first the technical 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.670
 specifications here 16 gigabyte 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.890
 internal memory there is a version 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.719
 with 8 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.340
 plus a gigabyte ram as well 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.670
 the Next them a 7 inches wide 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.649
 display has a resolution of 1280 x 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.100
 800 pixels 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.160
 in contrast to the next 7 where a tiger 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.460
 3 processor is found in the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.659
 base of cat an intel processor 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.189
 the first day with 1 2 gigahertz yes that 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.830
 is to play and that's enough 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.420
 of course absolutely out front is a 12 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.430
 megapixel camera is installed that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.110
 same as the nexus 7, I think 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.409
 yes thinks apple often leads such a anyway 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.780
 Thing 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.040
 and because the camera just drove for 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.140
 the video calling works that 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.400
 Of course you can also take pictures 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.689
 Video recording works too 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.310
 Of course you do not see that 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.189
 continued because the device of 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.020
 to take turns photo otherwise what 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.689
 that's just what matters 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.490
 more interesting is that here the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.470
 Possibility exists a micro sd card 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.180
 pack and a sim card 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.270
 that means you can also when traveling 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.310
 you have no connection wlan you can 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.530
 with the thing easily on the internet 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.450
 do not go with the next one 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.869
 and that is in my opinion also the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.210
 great strength from the small tablet here 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:04.020
 otherwise it is a bit different 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.509
 as the nexus love because here are up 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.250
 this page is the power button and the 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.410
 vip switch for the volume at 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.930
 nexus 7 it's easy on the other 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.150
 side grown 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.829
 also 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.140
 who the next 7 gummed this 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.610
 surface has so very pleasant in 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.849
 the hand lies as I think is that 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.120
 at the reforms pad this polycarbonate 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.439
 The sonar alu optics I think that 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.659
 the next seven a little bit nicer 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.900
 but even here is quite 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.730
 order and we took the here 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.920
 micro-usb connection and next to the 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.480
 Headphone jack the dimensions of the device 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:46.659
 amount to 196 4 x 120 x 10 4 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.349
 millimeter so that the device is a whole 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:55.810
 a little smaller than the next 7 that 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.790
 namely has dimensions of 198 5 x 120 x 10 5 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.430
 mm so really a marginal 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.069
 you really differentiated that 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.319
 first does not notice as already mentioned 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.540
 the resolution of the device is included 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.849
 1280 x 800 pixels 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.409
 that definitely looks good on the 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.329
 Of course, one more could resolve 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.370
 tick be higher but I am anyway 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.919
 that it looks really good here 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.569
 which I also very good at this 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:22.269
 device also likes that thing 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.829
 not the next is the following 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.040
 of course you are not now but is 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.299
 that that is holding up with one 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.590
 This is equipped with vibration module 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.470
 means one has also a haptic 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.579
 feedback when you type stuff there 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.419
 you have to go to the next seven unfortunately 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.790
 renounce it 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.319
 I think I am a habituation thing 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.329
 People do not need it but I like that 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.750
 just when I write that, too 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:46.799
 realized that what I type 1 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:51.370
 operating system is here on the device 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:53.530
 android 4.1 point 2 so that's jelly 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.799
 bean and pretty up to date 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:01.120
 Of course, very nice, too 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.949
 In any case, really chic 10 12 and me 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.449
 is for me the perfect size of 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.060
 partly very good transportable 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:09.220
 So here is the strength that one 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.430
 micro sim and a micro sd card 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.659
 can be installed 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.799
 We will do that in the next few days 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.709
 then one more detail 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:21.039
 try so far but first to hands-on 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:25.539
 I hope you enjoy everything and you 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:28.320
 ask then have questions and otherwise until 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.320
 the next one clearly
