00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.170

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.170
 cut a little 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.130
 let's cut for example fat 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.159
 we are going to use this type of iron 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.229
 how is a plate pierced the brand 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.190

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.909
 I was going to collect all the perfume of 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.630
 Ember is on 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.630
 with the cheese 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.450
 how to cross cut a little bit of tomato 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.450
 let's take nothing salty 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.470
 the nuts 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.360
 is based on the return a moment to the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.140
 stream 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.140
 look at everything 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.760
 directly 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.760
 to the salt here 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.290
 good 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:46.800
 and for what we are going to do is the mango 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.800
 it is also done 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.190
 and what we are going to do is 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.040
 the vinaigrette we had 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.040

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.579
 and always not always 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.720
 As you can see, not everything is pot sausage like 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.800
 I say you can always do things like 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.239
 a salad but we have caught on the 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.239
