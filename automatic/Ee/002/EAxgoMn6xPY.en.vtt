00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.180
 a while ago the mini soundlink 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.740
 from angry it tested as a reasonable 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.380
 small bluetooth speaker chen where 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.300
 the is also very impressed 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.070
 namely another soundlink of angry namely 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.900
 from large soundlink ii simply add them to the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.609
 third version on land and van 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.859
 cycling 3 and in this review it will 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.789
 discuss the speaker to her 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.599
 start with the design of it 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.999
 device 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.289
 it is made of metal so what that 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:29.689
 it just feels solid and good 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.440
 at the top is king 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.670
 somewhat rough rubbery plastic and 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.020
 muscle is well put together but it is 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.379
 It is striking that it is really pretty good 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.609
 is large and exchange is a heavy benefit 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.199
 of a bluetooth speaker is natural 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.940
 especially that you can take it easily everywhere 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.410
 going to be easy and takes 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.539
 can play music anywhere 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.359
 and that applies to this angry cycling 3 already 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.949
 much less where I use more 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.339
 for the speakers that is on in you 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.760
 living room or level in their room and that 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.440
 That 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.570
 yes sometimes it goes on vacation or so you 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.010
 then take me for that i think it is 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.030
 shame he had no wifi connection 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.610
 has a works only through 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.320
 Bluetooth or of course via cable and 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.549
 with that wifi connection that would 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.799
 just make sure that home one 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.060
 much more to its right and for 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.070
 along the way I really think the speak is normal 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.570
 just too big so that matter is he 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.909
 and works with you between two worlds 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.590
 also maybe not quite right what you like 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.149
 getting back for it is just yes pretty well 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.070
 good sound quality is of course 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.799
 large speaker therefore he has anyway 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.509
 already better sound quality and to the 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.549
 family were very impressed 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.740
 were sound quality and this is still 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.320
 100 euros more expensive costs 300 euros so if 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.189
 the best half your large amount for 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.009
 a bluetooth speaker 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.840
 but then you have a speaker that already 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.850
 simply delivers good sound quality 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.890
 angry customer for these cycling 3 and 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.420
 battery life of 14 hours that we 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.130
 unable to fully verify only 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.810
 at least we have indeed 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.310
 just long with the device music 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.409
 can play without being the only one 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.240
 problem was for the battery so yes that 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.289
 battery life is just primacy you can 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.850
 of course also expect from such 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.750
 big speaker where i just have a big one 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.640
 battery and so pi fits hard 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.250
 speaker delivers good sound and I play 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.899
 sometimes it's a bit full 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.710
 side the bastiat 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.619
 maybe calculate something 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.270
 fuller liked but apart from that for one 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.890
 he already has a bluetooth speaker 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.600
 really very well managed and can do that too 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.920
 just really hard is of course already 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.540
 for the if you want 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.360
 is a few control button on volume 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.010
 up down and mute and can choose 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.600
 between outs and bluetooth and to on and on 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.030
 switch off and that is of course one 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.190
 little bit at the back you will find an old one 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.650
 power and a service cable to it 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.360
 service dimples a usb cable and that 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.739
 USB cable cannot be used to on 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.030
 to load it was a pity there is 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.890
 to 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.390
 usb chargers you naturally have about it 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.190
 Generally, or at a number of places in 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.360
 home and would just be handy 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.750
 if you can also handle this speaker 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.250
 plugs 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.750
 one is therefore really purely for updates 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.470
 and and my computer too 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.060
 to link 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.440
 so that's a shame i'll just check the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.480
 sound quality of course 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.890
 I paired it more with a one plus 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.090
 one via bluetooth 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.489
 then linking is generally possible 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.170
 just fine and we sometimes just a little bit 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.750
 also had problems with nfc 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.610
 that is unfortunate but there is little else there 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.200
 to criticize 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:12.000
 and if music turns on for a moment then too 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:14.360
 hear that in drowning and also whole 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.360
 very long 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.379
 now well i hope i don't soon 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.400
 is blown up 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.200
 sound quality is therefore 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.340
 impressive only her for me I think 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.260
 a bit on this device 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.510
 it falls one between the cracks 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.860
 bluetooth speaker from 300 euros well that 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.230
 course anyway awful lot 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.420
 In addition, you are just very heavy and 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.769
 quite big because of that he comes more 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.629
 to its right in for example correct 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.430
 room but as your speaker in you 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.810
 you want and have your living room again 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.549
 rather he just connected to WiFi 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.280
 is that your airplay 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.709
 before going and you can connect 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.870
 therefore just a little more freedom and 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.989
 more have within your home network 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.519
 so yes in that sense I would rather than if 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.530
 you just want to use it for home 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.900
 go for an airplay speaker where angry 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.750
 also has great models 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.370
 for around 300 euros because with 300 euros 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.900
 is of course just a lot of 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.459
 bluetooth speaker on the side if you have one 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.049
 want bluetooth speaker then i would rather 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.700
 for the stink in the mini that pass 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.610
 You have also reviewed it whole 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.430
 good sound costs 100 euros less piece 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.229
 smaller and much more portable so yes that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.570
 would rather be my choices and this one 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.530
 bose link 3, the sound is not in itself a 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.020
 bad speaker 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.810
 but you have to be very specific use 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.310
 think about snaijer for that thing too 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.060
 really those 300 euros the go out too 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.060
 really I think
