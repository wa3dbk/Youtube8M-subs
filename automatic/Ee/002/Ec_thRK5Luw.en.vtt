solution<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:22.530> by<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.280> time<00:04:23.400> it's<00:04:23.820> ready<00:04:24.030> to

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
solution and by the time it's ready to

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.050 
solution and by the time it's ready to
pour<00:04:24.480> it<00:04:24.870> actually<00:04:25.230> looks<00:04:25.860> like<00:04:26.100> hot<00:04:26.400> whiskey

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060

and I can just open the valve at the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.940 
and I can just open the valve at the
bottom<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.360> pull<00:04:30.690> into<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.110> various<00:04:31.410> molds
