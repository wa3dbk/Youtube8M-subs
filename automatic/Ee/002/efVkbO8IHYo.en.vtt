00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
following the email from mother railway

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.160 
following the email from mother railway
scenery<00:00:04.830> calm<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.549> that<00:00:06.330> Paul<00:00:06.600> had

scenery calm and that Paul had
introduced<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.919> very<00:00:08.130> simple<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.849> novel<00:00:09.210> idea

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
introduced a very simple and novel idea

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.870 
introduced a very simple and novel idea
for<00:00:09.719> track<00:00:10.080> cleaning<00:00:10.500> using<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.980> Pico<00:00:11.190> rubber

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
for track cleaning using the Pico rubber

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.970 
for track cleaning using the Pico rubber
I<00:00:11.910> also<00:00:12.809> took<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.950> idea<00:00:14.309> up<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.440> whilst<00:00:16.440> with

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
I also took this idea up and whilst with

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.279 
I also took this idea up and whilst with
my<00:00:17.160> horn<00:00:17.400> be<00:00:17.580> Regan<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.060> had<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.539> cut<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.810> pique

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
my horn be Regan I had to cut the pique

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.370 
my horn be Regan I had to cut the pique
rubber<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.710> half<00:00:19.980> as<00:00:20.220> well<00:00:20.400> as<00:00:20.960> cut<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> sides

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
rubber in half as well as cut the sides

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.070 
rubber in half as well as cut the sides
he<00:00:23.220> has<00:00:23.490> worked<00:00:23.789> as<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.359> see<00:00:24.600> from<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
he has worked as you can see from the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.689 
he has worked as you can see from the
video<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:27.349> if<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.560> should<00:00:28.619> show<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
video and if I should show you the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:50.430 
video and if I should show you the
action<00:00:30.269> I'll<00:00:30.480> start<00:00:31.349> up<00:00:31.590> my<00:00:31.830> class<00:00:32.390> 25

ah

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.490 

you<00:01:04.440> can<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> pulls<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.260> wagon<00:01:07.260> very

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
you can see that it pulls the wagon very

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.810 
you can see that it pulls the wagon very
smoothly

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.539 

it<00:01:22.630> should<00:01:22.810> make<00:01:22.960> life<00:01:23.229> much<00:01:23.469> easier<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:24.130> clean

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549

I<00:02:36.060> also<00:02:36.239> suggest<00:02:36.720> where<00:02:37.470> you've<00:02:37.680> actually

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
I also suggest where you've actually

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.660 
I also suggest where you've actually
bent<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.760> glue<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.780> back<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.170> as<00:02:40.349> well<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.890> that

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
bent it glue the back on as well so that

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.750 
bent it glue the back on as well so that
it<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.269> be<00:02:42.510> used<00:02:43.049> at<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.980> angle<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.489> you

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
it can be used at the angle that you

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.809 
it can be used at the angle that you
want<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.299> without<00:02:45.630> fear<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.079> it<00:02:46.200> snapping

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
want it to without fear of it snapping

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.940 
want it to without fear of it snapping
the<00:02:47.819> other<00:02:47.970> device<00:02:48.299> was<00:02:48.660> using<00:02:49.639> what<00:02:50.639> are

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
the other device was using what are

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.460 
the other device was using what are
basically<00:02:54.139> pointed<00:02:55.139> timber<00:02:56.090> sticks<00:02:57.470> and

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
basically pointed timber sticks and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.830 
basically pointed timber sticks and
where<00:02:59.250> I've<00:02:59.459> taken<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.269> pointed<00:03:00.630> end

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
where I've taken that the pointed end

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.979 
where I've taken that the pointed end
and<00:03:01.319> actually<00:03:01.859> glued<00:03:02.160> on<00:03:02.400> some<00:03:02.430> cork<00:03:03.000> exactly

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
this was actually in the moulding I

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.089 
this was actually in the moulding I
think<00:05:58.789> it<00:05:58.909> was<00:05:59.029> from<00:05:59.360> either<00:05:59.990> an<00:06:00.589> Easter<00:06:00.949> egg

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
think it was from either an Easter egg

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:03.309 
think it was from either an Easter egg
carton<00:06:01.610> or<00:06:01.819> a<00:06:01.849> chocolate<00:06:02.300> garden<00:06:02.960> where<00:06:03.139> there

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.760 
was clear plastic covering it's quite
thick<00:06:05.779> and<00:06:07.240> but<00:06:08.240> it<00:06:08.360> does<00:06:08.539> the<00:06:08.689> trick<00:06:08.770> insofar

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
thick and but it does the trick insofar

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.279 
thick and but it does the trick insofar
as<00:06:10.249> the<00:06:11.089> couplings<00:06:11.599> will<00:06:11.779> ride<00:06:12.110> over<00:06:12.580> the<00:06:14.289> the

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
as the couplings will ride over the the

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.149 
as the couplings will ride over the the
curve<00:06:16.689> if<00:06:17.689> anything<00:06:18.169> other<00:06:18.319> than<00:06:18.529> a<00:06:18.620> slow<00:06:18.830> pace

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:22.189 
but if you land exactly on it then both

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.929
