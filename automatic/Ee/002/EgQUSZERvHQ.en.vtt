00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 the program is supported by the company 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.030
 your full-cycle fitness club protein 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.710
 Spa Division in the next exercise 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.619
 we will be twisting on the obliques 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.000
 abdominals lying on the bench 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.490
 how important is it to make oblique muscles 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.199
 a good press pro actually like 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.730
 important for what they emphasize 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.680
 relief eliyev turns out not only 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.800
 rectus abdominals but also 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.670
 skew that gives this enough 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.880
 visual beautiful effect 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.890
 ok right away the question here is dry beautiful 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.350
 press mesh how to achieve this effect 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.090
 when you walk along the beach and see every 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.930
 cube even plays tic-tac-toe 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.309
 I consider this effect achieved 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.500
 monstrous drying of the body that is you 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.870
 need to get rid altogether completely of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.539
 fat that has accumulated on your body 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.370
 because men most often have fat in 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.559
 the very last comes exactly from the bottom 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.719
 belly that is, you have no where 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.449
 no fat you are already so dry and triceps 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.879
 why are you all beautiful and here a little more 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.250
 fats and therefore it is necessary to even direct it 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.170
 that Misha rightly said in 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.850
 First of all, we want to 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.640
 this or not, the fatty tissue goes away 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.020
 from all places and most often yes in men 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.450
 this is a centralized location 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.640
 the fatty tissue is therefore precisely tank and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.470
 and the belly goes last and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.040
 many probably your fans will 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.210
 I wonder how much you start drying 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.700
 before the competition 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.070
 about it is 14 weeks because it 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.159
 quite a long period is very smooth and 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.570
 in the process of this period already somewhere 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.770
 four weeks you should already 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.770
 look good 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.969
 lift when the sides y are in 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.979
 opposite knee go away and just 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.539
 elbow touches the knee that is already the same 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.789
 the exercise itself is only added 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.920
 twist yes really to zone already 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.929
 loads were transferred to the side 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.030
 look again as we said 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.280
 earlier when you are completely curling 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.990
 cervical and thoracic and lumbar body 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.390
 body approximate maximum point 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.909
 cuts becomes under 45 50 degrees 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.069
 50 degrees yes when you already rise 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.650
 completely to the feet further works already 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.019
 muscles of the pelvis and legs and, accordingly, leads 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.390
 load from the abdominal muscles well the world 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.640
 we are all ready for you to start me 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.310
 I know that with this exercise is very 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.170
 the lumbar muscles are strengthened up here 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.610
 actually works the whole complex we 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.680
 walked only superficial but also 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.290
 deep layer of muscle body it becomes 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.660
 in general as a whole is much denser here 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.579
 You can perform already 3 to 5 approaches 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.970
 correspondingly frequency intervals 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.500
 repetition somewhere persists within 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.970
 20-40 repetitions here look at 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.989
 twisting there is some particular 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.700
 the corner here is no Misha at all 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.040
 does everything right accordingly 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.750
 We are guided here as we have 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.609
 arms on chest i mean let's say left 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.799
 the elbow goes to the right of the Urals and Karelin 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.090
 before the touch, we just have a corner 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.670
 rises maximum reduction 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.410
 here is muscle and so we go out 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.600
 I have a starting position before 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.389
 there was a stoop explained to me that this 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.670
 me the tip of the press like this 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.760
 It was the press that was so downloaded 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.280
 that wholly my shoulders and here 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.349
 here it can take place up to 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.209
 in fact , as if there appears in 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.859
 many reasons before the stages that is 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.239
 at first the man slouches at the expense of 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.670
 due to the fact that it grows very quickly 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.340
 back muscles do not have time to form 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.680
 get stronger here due to this as they 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.590
 can not cope yes man starts 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.720
 slouch hunch and muscles already 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.910
 abdominals directly they already 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.290
 have a second stage of development when 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.239
 takes on themselves the load they 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.700
 become static with optical 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.680
 tension to keep body weight as 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.900
 you asked me what why 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.910
 it is the abdominals but no matter how 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.500
 It would seem strange to keep our body 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.420
 indeed our body is fixed 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.340
 constantly muscle stabilizers in 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.349
 inner layer of muscle and so on here 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.000
 therefore stoop and when already muscles 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.120
 spasmodic abdominals this already 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.220
 enough debts such stages of entry 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.830
 in court ulab states let's friends 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.630
 find out together what people do 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.200
 can't bear to press the press no 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.090
 less need to get it yes yes I would 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.069
 probably advised complex some 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.120
 exercise where it is involved but 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.760
 directly 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.169
 there is no load of concentration on him 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.450
 this is what and this next topic see 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.160
 subscribe stay on the look well 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.840
 guys come to the next exercise 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.870
 this we will have leg lifts lying on 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.460
 bench 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.900
