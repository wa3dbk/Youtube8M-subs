00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.070
 the battle 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.239

 rhythmic pattern that is first 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.770
 make one movement from top to bottom 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.590
 strongly in accent and sound should be 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.549
 long 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.189
 then a quick upward movement after 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.310
 bringing down again strong motions 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.329
 in accent 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.329
 it turns out so 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.050
 and finally make two quick 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.540
 motions a top down and bottom up 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:46.710
 both on the lower strings after which 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:51.200
 turn on the map and it turns out so on 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.200
 Cord e lose the same 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.160

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.820
 and here on chords fa 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.880
 and the guitar fight changes here on 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.740
 falgrim the first movement is the same from above 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.740
 down in accent and zing 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.560
 then two quick moves from top to bottom 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.160
 and bottom up on the lower strings 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:29.260
 it turns out so then go to 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.820
 chord g and here we do five movements 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.220
 the first goes strong in accent but not 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.610
 zing is obtained from the top down 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.810
 first then bottom up then again 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.830
 top down and bottom up conclusion 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.830
 it turns out so 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.439
 and repeat all the very beginning now 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.439
 slow 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.470
 Well 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.460
 from the very beginning 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.470
 so we beat the whole song on it all 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.220
