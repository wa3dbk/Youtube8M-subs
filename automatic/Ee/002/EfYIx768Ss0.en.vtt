00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.809
 It is 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:15.990
 It has an oval course of 500m 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:19.910
 We will beat our body and the fastest will come 50 Today we manipulate the bite during the speed of the diameter 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.910
 Auto race to compete in the standings 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:29.780
 438 teachers from now 20 years old to budget bonds are very c 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.230
 This world competes regardless of age gender 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.640
 So one of the six of the girls players fight it 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.640
 I am using Sato Makoto 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.449
 Women's day run in the 44th year in 2011 If you take a quick glance at Sajin 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.030
 Two years later, it was the first ever in a female tracer history to achieve an environment of winning 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:02.170
 This time, I try to infiltrate the back of the Kyoto race that I have never seen a day before Sato and Teves 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.170
 Was 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.430
 Masafumi Sato went to a building like a fortress a day before the event 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.930
 cocoa 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.300
 It will be the day to accept the previous right and accept it today 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.050
 Say is ho suck 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:28.650
 To re-principle not take the report you spent in that individual quarters 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:33.560
 In addition, you are not allowed to bring in your cell phone or any device that has lost contact with the outside 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.560
 It has been confiscated until the race on the last day ends 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.420
 It's fine, or hundreds of dozens of houses 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:47.550
 Sato who got dressed in the jersey went for 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.550
 Finally the locker of the player where the car is placed 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.670
 Another good bike 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.710
 Oh yeah 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.710
 Do it myself 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:03.490
 From what is good 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:08.300
 Yes, the auto racer is also a rider mechanic 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.770
 Raising competitors from alive and polishing new tires 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.770
 Do from miev 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.480
 Competitors made by such players are completely different from those on the market 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.480
 is 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.610
 I do not have a brake 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.980
 Not found 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.740
 Hey I players multiplied by the sudden braking 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.830
 I can not catch up with this 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.830
 Because it will be such an accident that it will be thrust into 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.380
 While driving to spread the intense course and Lee at an average speed of 100 km / h 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.750

 Highest 3 minutes in the morning 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.760
 Snow removed 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:07.640
 Of course, the race is held even on rainy days, so the politics are in a unified position 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.300
 It is said that it depends on the outcome 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.300
