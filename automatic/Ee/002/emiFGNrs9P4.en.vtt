00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.650
 hello to all and all these world green 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.939
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.519
 new video this time I you 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.840
 presents the same on mac kindley during 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.520
 this video i'm going to talk to you about the 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.989
 relationship between publishers and 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.489
 developers but before that small 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.930
 accuracy this video will be fine as 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.550
 sent to africa that i like you 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.350
 may have noticed after 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.360
 the introduction then to rush a little 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.559
 speed there at the beginning I calm down and good I 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.820
 do not do it just because that's it 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.320
 I do not have much time video 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.300
 lasts about seven minutes if I get 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.150
 I'm crazy even well yeah that's seven minutes 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.829
 and it's true that when we look at 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.000
 a subject there under the eyes that is when 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.520
 same complex and I really want to 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.020
 deal with you subscribe you I have and 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.149
 I really want you to give me 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.039
 your opinion on a small mistake sometimes 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.090
 this relationship between publishers and 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.000
 developers 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.560
 so already before that I had bruises 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.240
 developed three axes already for me there are 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.970
 three kinds of publisher there are the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.500
 Publishers who work with 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.390
 developers ie the 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.380
 developers have come up with an idea in 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.229
 showing a storyboard an idea a demo 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.530
 technical maybe the finite game of the less 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.660
 a beta of the game again and they're going 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.910
 give his publishers he will have to find 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.920
 of the potential in there and if so there 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.110
 finds potential will have to finance this 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.790
 given game maybe your material and 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.920
 will have to do the advertising campaign 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.110
 all that is marketing brief 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.960
 and it's true that these are editors 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.790
 who in the end will make the sale of the game 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.260
 since 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.730
 remind you that the publisher in your pocket 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.500
 about 80% a damage and joker touches 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.000
 about 20 bump like on a series 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.000
 like call of duty 20% it's still 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.619
 here at 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.840
 it shows that filming is 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.010
 the publisher who has the power on the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.960
 developer simply it's 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.930
 the publisher who before six or and in his 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.850
 technical means to really make the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.540
 game but it also shows that the publisher 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.959
 can listen to the developer and make him 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.319
 trust 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.760
 his earth play happened windows this 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.489
 windows a game very much besides a 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.380
 just gta like that was edited 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.739
 by square enix is made by united 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.580
 front games and frankly I'm not going 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.760
 play sublet I strongly advise you 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.450
 that's it really shows 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.580
 the publisher to him 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.580
 not authors and publishers 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.069
 it's giving the means for this idea 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.659
 on the best possible and that's where 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.950
 we really see that a job that 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.049
 is different call of duty 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.599
 because the publisher can also ask 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.159
 to simplify the game for example we had 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.189
 code 4 places and a coffee games when 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.000
 even a little hard and we will say very 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.760
 nice to play 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.709
 I had very good but it's true that 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.659
 they are said we want more sales 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.920
 do not have this month we should facilitate 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.189
 game so that everyone can 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.049
 play and she w2a been created and for me 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.760
 this is from there that the publisher 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.470
 start to be wrong is that at 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.370
 final is what we ask us it's 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.069
 not an easy game 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.599
 it's a nice game on Thursday is good and 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.319
 for his found his rare pearl must 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.239
 take risks 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.109
 that's where for example Quranic this 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.730
 did everything since the ex beatles took 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.439
 risks for example our studio which 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.569
 took risks it's simply 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.510
 useful bethesda for example with 10 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.090
 honored took the risk of financing his 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.030
 Thu 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.379
 and it's in a French box the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.480
 arcane studio if you do not know 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.830
 it's frankly a good studio 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.349
 series as the designers and their first 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.349
 blockbuster is frankly no one 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.090
 waited for him no one saw him go out and 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.549
 when he came out everyone is holding 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.020
 these words by an advertising campaign 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:54.260
 because I had good arguments 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.480
 and because the publisher has trusted 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.450
 now let's talk about the second 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.550
 peter who wants the skin they saw by 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.730
 example 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.730
 hopper did two good three games 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.730
 a few 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.470
 interesting or rather ways versed 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.340
 for example and bought a studio that 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.470
 did internet development 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.800
 facebook others and that's right it's 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.720
 the creation to the finals where they 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.990
 are not at home that they buy everything 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.260
 just the studio is said 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:35.919
 now you are attached to sport or 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.229
 dieye free to play that because I you 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.060
 recalls that yann in the process of 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.270
 all video games formats 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.419
 dematerialized internet games free to 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.229
 play everything short and that's where we see 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.229
 that they knew 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.820
 really it's because I chose the 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.790
 studios they buy 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.360
 they can order a little studio enough 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.889
 1 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.419
 to do things they would not have 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.349
 not mounted eg battlefield a has 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.270
 not been redeemed by as long as 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.580
 battlefield they are edited game so 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.050
 we are the same I do not know if 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.780
 it's a place that is attached 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.490
 directly to yei I do not inquire 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.159
 sure of me with my heart if you know 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.689
 but frankly when we see what 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:23.369
 dice may have done 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.739
 would not have done battlefield done everything 

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:29.129
 full of things like that they 

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:31.589
 have done just then this is 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:34.659
 true it's there to see 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:36.580
 that the publisher has the stranglehold on the series 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.529
 it is he who decides this life which 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.219
 choose coffee from this saga 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:44.819
 and if it does not pay taxes 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:46.930
 poppers bah too bad I still believe 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.150
 until then from the moment when the 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.520
 studio and to the publisher a poor one 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.070
 third and it's true that it may be 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.870
 a little pity for example after we have 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.110
 bio to save himself like that for example 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:04.400
 hiding you are in the queue 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.380
 saint too '1,4 in abandonment is this a 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.020
 barter was redeemed on Thursday plus by which 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.610
 park to the editor here I am no longer 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.020
 at any rate the studio that the 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.820
 did was redeemed that I find 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.460
 it is a very good thing since cnce 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.220
 euros it's really quality you 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.300
 to say it's really very interesting 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.960
 it really was I used to 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.270
 many people 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.190
 and it would be a pity I lose it so 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.410
 then now we're going to talk about 3rd 4th 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.450
 and 3rd categories are these very theories 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.460
 quick it's just for example 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.080
 koranic then his first the first 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.310
 that comes to my mind 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.480
 maybe both publisher and some 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.330
 other then what do I mean 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.090
 by that it's just square enix done 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.520
 Games must be final dragon quest 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.090
 fantasy for example the two series ferry 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.860
 lighthouses and elites and develops them into 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.510
 same time it's the same box that makes 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.730
 both of them that saves you money 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.650
 of time it allows you no 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.510
 web delay surprise it's really 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.460
 everything that is taken into account and that's where 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.780
 we see that a strength 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.030
 so it's really very smart 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.740
 to have done that so on this I hope that 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.360
 this video will please you - anyway 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.810
 it was a pleasure to comment 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.650
 on this good video good end of the day 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.650
 and has more
