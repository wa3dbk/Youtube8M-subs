00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
thing that impresses me about this group

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.930 
thing that impresses me about this group
is<00:00:10.740> when<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.040> challenge<00:00:11.460> him<00:00:11.550> with<00:00:11.610> something

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
is when you challenge him with something

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.020 
is when you challenge him with something
they<00:00:12.929> respond<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.740> when<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.580> went<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.910> looked
