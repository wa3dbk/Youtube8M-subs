his opinion on things clearly let's

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.930 
his opinion on things clearly let's
start<00:00:10.170> with<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> new<00:00:10.679> trek<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.219> Monda<00:00:11.670> it's

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
start with the new trek in Monda it's

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.730 
start with the new trek in Monda it's
the<00:00:12.030> lightest<00:00:12.420> production<00:00:12.900> bike<00:00:13.139> that's<00:00:13.559> not

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
the lightest production bike that's not

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.110 
the lightest production bike that's not
too<00:00:14.009> much<00:00:14.040> use<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.519> seems<00:00:14.730> else<00:00:14.910> because

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
too much use that seems else because

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.460 
too much use that seems else because
they're<00:00:15.269> hamstrung<00:00:15.719> by<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.929> weight<00:00:16.170> limit

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
they're hamstrung by the weight limit

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.810 
they're hamstrung by the weight limit
but<00:00:16.859> what<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.220> make<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.580> have<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.760> seen

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
but what do you make of it have you seen

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.849 
but what do you make of it have you seen
have<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.300> seen<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.660> there<00:00:18.810> over<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> track<00:00:19.410> yeah

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
have you seen it there over a track yeah

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.980 
have you seen it there over a track yeah
yeah<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.250> checked<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.550> out<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.910> got<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.270> four<00:00:21.869> and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
yeah we checked it out I got a four and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.540 
yeah we checked it out I got a four and
a<00:00:22.020> half<00:00:22.050> hour<00:00:22.289> ride<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.859> treks<00:00:23.189> gonna<00:00:23.400> be

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
a half hour ride on it treks gonna be

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.679 
a half hour ride on it treks gonna be
building<00:00:23.820> these<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.150> sort<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> same

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
building these it's sort of the same

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.060 
building these it's sort of the same
level<00:00:25.019> they<00:00:25.080> build<00:00:25.230> everything<00:00:25.410> else<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
level they build everything else and and

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.320 
level they build everything else and and
the<00:00:26.250> fact<00:00:26.460> they<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:26.730> hit<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> weight<00:00:27.060> like<00:00:27.180> that

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the fact they can hit a weight like that

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.570 
the fact they can hit a weight like that
is<00:00:27.510> super<00:00:27.900> impressive<00:00:28.230> rides<00:00:28.920> really<00:00:29.369> really

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
is super impressive rides really really

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.209 
is super impressive rides really really
well<00:00:30.080> I've<00:00:31.080> compared<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.679> Cannondale

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
well I've compared it to a Cannondale

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.130 
well I've compared it to a Cannondale
Evo<00:00:32.610> which<00:00:32.850> I'm<00:00:33.030> sure<00:00:33.180> Trek<00:00:33.450> doesn't<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:33.870> but

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
Evo which I'm sure Trek doesn't like but

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.470 
Evo which I'm sure Trek doesn't like but
it's<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.559> my<00:00:34.680> favorite<00:00:34.920> bikes<00:00:35.040> ever<00:00:35.480> so

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it's one of my favorite bikes ever so

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.720 
it's one of my favorite bikes ever so
it's<00:00:36.630> actually<00:00:36.780> high<00:00:37.050> praise<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.920> guys

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it's actually high praise and the guys

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.430 
it's actually high praise and the guys
it<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.090> let's<00:00:39.239> say<00:00:39.360> Andy<00:00:39.660> Schleck<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.260> this

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
it so let's say Andy Schleck is on this

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.020 
it so let's say Andy Schleck is on this
this<00:00:40.739> new<00:00:40.920> Honda<00:00:41.309> he's<00:00:41.760> gonna<00:00:41.879> have

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
this new Honda he's gonna have

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.240 
this new Honda he's gonna have
potentially<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> kilo<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> weight<00:00:43.410> added<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
potentially a kilo of weight added to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.670 
potentially a kilo of weight added to
his<00:00:44.340> bike<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.910> what<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> bottom<00:00:46.050> bracket<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
his bike on what the bottom bracket the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.229 
his bike on what the bottom bracket the
debacle<00:00:47.039> cages<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.670> were<00:00:47.730> sent<00:00:47.969> there's<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
debacle cages they were sent there's a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.069 
debacle cages they were sent there's a
whole<00:00:48.360> bunch<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> different<00:00:48.660> things<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.050> can

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
whole bunch of different things they can

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.080 
whole bunch of different things they can
do<00:00:49.320> generally<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.920> replacing<00:00:50.520> carbon<00:00:50.879> bits

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
do generally just replacing carbon bits

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.330 
do generally just replacing carbon bits
with<00:00:51.420> metal<00:00:52.020> bits<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.469> don't<00:00:52.829> I'm<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.100> sure

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
with metal bits I don't I'm not sure

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.189 
with metal bits I don't I'm not sure
that<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.030> 6.8<00:00:54.510> limit<00:00:54.809> will<00:00:54.930> stick<00:00:55.110> around

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
that the the 6.8 limit will stick around

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.350 
that the the 6.8 limit will stick around
all<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.500> much<00:00:55.559> longer<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:56.219> be<00:00:56.340> honest<00:00:56.640> I

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
all that much longer to be honest I

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.330 
all that much longer to be honest I
think<00:00:58.140> part<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> reason<00:00:58.739> why<00:00:59.129> we're

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
think part of the reason why we're

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.650 
think part of the reason why we're
seeing<00:00:59.370> some<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> these<00:01:00.000> lightweight<00:01:00.329> bikes

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
seeing some of these lightweight bikes

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.330 
seeing some of these lightweight bikes
from<00:01:00.899> companies<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.289> Trek<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
from companies like Trek is because the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.090 
from companies like Trek is because the
UCI<00:01:02.460> has<00:01:02.730> been<00:01:03.149> discussing<00:01:03.780> either<00:01:04.589> lowering

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
UCI has been discussing either lowering

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.340 
UCI has been discussing either lowering
that<00:01:05.250> six<00:01:05.489> point<00:01:05.700> eight<00:01:05.729> limit<00:01:06.090> or

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
that six point eight limit or

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.109 
that six point eight limit or
eliminating<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.409> entirely<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.850> they've<00:01:09.000> been

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
eliminating it entirely and they've been

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.580 
eliminating it entirely and they've been
discussing<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.750> about<00:01:09.960> two<00:01:10.260> years<00:01:10.290> now

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
discussing that for about two years now

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.670 
discussing that for about two years now
but<00:01:11.510> there's<00:01:12.510> some<00:01:12.689> new<00:01:12.720> folks<00:01:13.110> over<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
but there's some new folks over in the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
but there's some new folks over in the
tech<00:01:14.100> side<00:01:14.310> at<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.640> UCI<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.450> may<00:01:15.630> actually

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
tech side at the UCI and we may actually

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.030 
tech side at the UCI and we may actually
see<00:01:16.020> some<00:01:16.170> movement<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.590> pretty<00:01:16.860> soon

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
see some movement on that pretty soon

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.950 
see some movement on that pretty soon
does<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.939> mean<00:01:18.060> no<00:01:18.150> one's<00:01:18.299> told<00:01:18.450> specialize

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
does that mean no one's told specialize

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.260 
does that mean no one's told specialize

so I cannot attest that however the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.420 
so I cannot attest that however the
previous<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.049> SL<00:01:40.290> 4<00:01:40.530> was<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> phenomenal<00:01:41.280> bike

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
previous the SL 4 was a phenomenal bike

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.620 
previous the SL 4 was a phenomenal bike
yeah<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> can't<00:01:42.210> imagine<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.689> got<00:01:42.899> any<00:01:43.110> worse<00:01:43.610> so

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
yeah I can't imagine it got any worse so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.160 
yeah I can't imagine it got any worse so
maybe<00:01:45.630> they're<00:01:45.840> right

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
maybe they're right

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.469 
maybe they're right
that<00:01:46.380> half<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.649> pound<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.430> important<00:01:48.210> but

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that half a pound is is important but

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.660 
that half a pound is is important but
it's<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.140> gonna<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:50.040> not<00:01:50.130> gonna<00:01:50.340> keep<00:01:50.520> them

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it's not gonna it's not gonna keep them

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.910 
it's not gonna it's not gonna keep them
over<00:01:50.939> say<00:01:51.659> six<00:01:51.899> kilos<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.409> they<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:52.680> wanted

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
over say six kilos if they really wanted

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.560 
over say six kilos if they really wanted
to<00:01:53.009> get<00:01:53.100> there<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> one<00:01:53.880> hand<00:01:53.939> we've

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
to get there so on the one hand we've

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.060 
to get there so on the one hand we've
got<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> trekker<00:01:55.079> mondo<00:01:55.470> which<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.740> super

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
got the trekker mondo which is super

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.469 
got the trekker mondo which is super
light<00:01:56.219> breaking<00:01:56.579> your<00:01:56.820> ground<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> other

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
light breaking your ground on the other

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.240 
light breaking your ground on the other
hand<00:01:57.780> Canyon<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.530> released<00:01:58.950> their<00:01:59.070> new

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
hand Canyon have just released their new

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.600 
hand Canyon have just released their new
air<00:01:59.430> road<00:01:59.670> which<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.799> obviously<00:02:01.799> aerodynamic

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
air road which is obviously aerodynamic

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.249 
air road which is obviously aerodynamic
and<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.090> seems<00:02:03.509> funny<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.780> we've<00:02:03.960> got<00:02:04.110> these

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
and it seems funny that we've got these

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.560 
and it seems funny that we've got these
two<00:02:04.500> sides<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> same<00:02:05.130> coin<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.610> riders

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
two sides of the same coin and riders

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.449 
two sides of the same coin and riders
riding<00:02:06.840> either<00:02:07.140> one<00:02:07.469> or<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.740> other<00:02:07.890> seemingly

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
riding either one or the other seemingly

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.190 
riding either one or the other seemingly
not<00:02:08.759> switching<00:02:09.090> between<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.420> two<00:02:09.629> what's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
not switching between the two what's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.610 
not switching between the two what's
what's<00:02:10.500> your<00:02:10.560> impression<00:02:10.709> initially<00:02:11.430> of

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
what's your impression initially of

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.699 
what's your impression initially of
new<00:02:11.830> Canyon<00:02:12.239> well<00:02:13.239> it's<00:02:13.989> it's<00:02:14.319> more<00:02:14.530> air<00:02:14.680> than

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
new Canyon well it's it's more air than

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.770 
new Canyon well it's it's more air than
last<00:02:15.099> one<00:02:15.310> they<00:02:15.430> say<00:02:15.730> again<00:02:16.480> we<00:02:16.629> haven't

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
last one they say again we haven't

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.119 
last one they say again we haven't
actually<00:02:17.110> put<00:02:17.379> it<00:02:17.500> in<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.620> wind<00:02:17.799> tunnel<00:02:18.040> for

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
actually put it in the wind tunnel for

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.920 
actually put it in the wind tunnel for
ourselves<00:02:18.580> yet<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:18.940> all<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.629> all<00:02:19.780> these

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
ourselves yet so all that all these

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.830 
ourselves yet so all that all these
claims<00:02:20.200> are<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.890> their<00:02:21.069> claims

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
claims are just that their claims

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.990 
claims are just that their claims
they've<00:02:22.840> moved<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.739> truncated<00:02:24.400> aerofoil

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
they've moved to a truncated aerofoil

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.720 
they've moved to a truncated aerofoil
style<00:02:25.810> tube<00:02:26.650> shape<00:02:26.920> which<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.250> something<00:02:27.519> that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
style tube shape which is something that

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.780 
style tube shape which is something that
the<00:02:27.940> Scot<00:02:28.420> foil<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.200> truck<00:02:29.409> Madone

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
the Scot foil and the truck Madone

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.580 
the Scot foil and the truck Madone
already<00:02:30.790> use<00:02:30.970> among<00:02:31.360> many<00:02:31.780> many<00:02:31.930> others<00:02:32.230> and

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
already use among many many others and

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.660 
already use among many many others and
it<00:02:32.739> allows<00:02:32.890> them<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.190> make<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.400> little<00:02:33.519> bit

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
it allows them to make a little bit

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.550 
it allows them to make a little bit
faster<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.480> lighter<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.049> stiffer<00:02:35.230> and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
faster and and lighter and stiffer and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.949 
faster and and lighter and stiffer and
it's<00:02:36.340> like<00:02:36.459> like<00:02:36.700> bikes<00:02:36.940> keep<00:02:37.150> going<00:02:37.390> hmm

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
it's like like bikes keep going hmm

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.569 
it's like like bikes keep going hmm
because<00:02:38.319> we're<00:02:38.470> two<00:02:38.590> things<00:02:38.799> that<00:02:38.950> we<00:02:39.310> really

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
because we're two things that we really

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.309 
because we're two things that we really
noticed<00:02:39.909> actually<00:02:40.180> there<00:02:40.329> we<00:02:40.420> were<00:02:40.510> at<00:02:40.629> most

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
noticed actually there we were at most

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.890 
noticed actually there we were at most
uh<00:02:41.560> moose<00:02:42.280> or<00:02:42.459> Hosea<00:02:43.269> quacking<00:02:43.569> row<00:02:43.720> houses

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
uh moose or Hosea quacking row houses

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.479 
uh moose or Hosea quacking row houses
bike<00:02:44.260> they've<00:02:44.620> got<00:02:44.769> direct<00:02:45.099> mount<00:02:45.280> break

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
bike they've got direct mount break

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.240 
bike they've got direct mount break
something<00:02:45.879> that<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.299> canyon<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.250> Campagnolo

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
something that the canyon and Campagnolo

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.309 
something that the canyon and Campagnolo
don't<00:02:48.730> make<00:02:48.879> direct<00:02:49.209> mount<00:02:49.390> breaks<00:02:49.660> yet<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.140> he

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
don't make direct mount breaks yet so he

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.330 
don't make direct mount breaks yet so he
had<00:02:50.590> voice<00:02:51.340> breaks<00:02:51.640> yes<00:02:52.620> he<00:02:53.620> had<00:02:53.769> looked

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
had voice breaks yes he had looked

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.610 
had voice breaks yes he had looked
suspiciously<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:55.329> Shimano<00:02:56.079> brakes<00:02:56.440> on

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
suspiciously like Shimano brakes on

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.860 
suspiciously like Shimano brakes on
there<00:02:57.060> now<00:02:58.060> that's<00:02:58.239> quite<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.480> novel

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
there now that's quite a novel

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.330

with<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.959> yeah<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.290> have<00:03:02.590> been<00:03:02.739> really<00:03:02.980> really

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
with it yeah I have been really really

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.069 
with it yeah I have been really really
impressed<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:03.760> think<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.120> design<00:03:04.359> has<00:03:04.629> a<00:03:04.659> lot

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
impressed I think the design has a lot

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.020 
impressed I think the design has a lot
of<00:03:05.109> potential<00:03:05.470> it's<00:03:05.739> it's<00:03:06.129> lighter<00:03:06.430> those

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
of potential it's it's lighter those

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.520 
of potential it's it's lighter those
want<00:03:07.269> trigger<00:03:07.420> brakes<00:03:07.629> named<00:03:07.810> under<00:03:07.989> 105

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
want trigger brakes named under 105

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.649 
want trigger brakes named under 105
grams<00:03:08.890> which<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.519> lighter<00:03:10.060> than<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.329> derice

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
grams which is lighter than a derice

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.580 
grams which is lighter than a derice

they<00:03:15.010> actually<00:03:15.370> they<00:03:15.549> dramatically<00:03:16.329> improved

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
they actually they dramatically improved

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.000 
they actually they dramatically improved

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
a 28 29 30 millimeter tire on that's

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.940 
a 28 29 30 millimeter tire on that's
very<00:03:28.450> cool<00:03:28.660> because<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:29.109> those<00:03:29.319> brakes<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:29.889> if

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
very cool because of those brakes and if

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.460 
very cool because of those brakes and if
you<00:03:30.069> ran<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.340> traditional<00:03:31.180> derp<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.750> scalper<00:03:32.319> for

you ran a traditional derp a scalper for

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.750 
you ran a traditional derp a scalper for
example<00:03:32.799> you<00:03:32.919> can't<00:03:33.160> get<00:03:33.310> much<00:03:33.489> more<00:03:33.519> than

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
example you can't get much more than

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.610 
example you can't get much more than
about<00:03:33.849> 27<00:03:34.450> on<00:03:34.569> there<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:35.079> would<00:03:35.230> not<00:03:35.440> surprise

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
about 27 on there it would not surprise

about 27 on there it would not surprise

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
me if this sort of the single bolt

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.349 
me if this sort of the single bolt
traditional<00:03:39.250> brake<00:03:39.489> is<00:03:39.700> sort<00:03:39.879> of<00:03:39.910> phased<00:03:40.180> out

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
traditional brake is sort of phased out

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.189 
traditional brake is sort of phased out
of<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.660> next<00:03:40.930> five<00:03:41.500> six<00:03:41.739> years<00:03:42.010> or<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:43.169> get<00:03:44.169> a

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
of the next five six years or so get a

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:48.860 
of the next five six years or so get a
little<00:03:44.290> dry

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.629 

the<00:03:49.870> one<00:03:50.019> final<00:03:50.379> thing<00:03:50.499> I<00:03:50.620> see<00:03:50.799> therefore<00:03:51.489> is

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
the one final thing I see therefore is

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.640 
the one final thing I see therefore is
the<00:03:51.879> is<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.239> Giro<00:03:52.450> synth<00:03:52.870> helmet<00:03:53.290> which<00:03:53.469> i

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
the is the Giro synth helmet which i

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.890 
the is the Giro synth helmet which i
think<00:03:53.709> is<00:03:54.040> pretty<00:03:54.700> noteworthy<00:03:55.180> because<00:03:55.569> of

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
think is pretty noteworthy because of

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.899 
think is pretty noteworthy because of
the<00:03:55.959> claims<00:03:56.230> they've<00:03:56.469> made<00:03:56.680> now<00:03:57.040> presumably

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
the claims they've made now presumably

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.160 
the claims they've made now presumably
we<00:03:58.090> can't<00:03:58.299> test<00:03:58.540> these<00:03:58.719> because<00:03:58.989> their

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
we can't test these because their

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.140 
we can't test these because their
aerodynamic<00:03:59.439> claims<00:03:59.950> but<00:04:00.219> they<00:04:00.459> say<00:04:01.120> that

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
aerodynamic claims but they say that

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.330 
aerodynamic claims but they say that
their<00:04:01.450> new<00:04:01.659> vented<00:04:02.230> helmet<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:02.799> as

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
their new vented helmet is as

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.640 
their new vented helmet is as
aerodynamic<00:04:04.079> essentially<00:04:05.079> as<00:04:05.260> their

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
aerodynamic essentially as their

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.979 
aerodynamic essentially as their
aerodynamic<00:04:06.579> helmet<00:04:06.909> which<00:04:07.389> has<00:04:07.750> virtually

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
aerodynamic helmet which has virtually

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.839 
aerodynamic helmet which has virtually
no<00:04:08.319> vents<00:04:08.590> in<00:04:08.769> it<00:04:08.889> so<00:04:09.069> what<00:04:09.250> what's<00:04:09.579> going<00:04:09.730> on

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
no vents in it so what what's going on

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.819 
no vents in it so what what's going on
there<00:04:09.969> k<00:04:10.150> are<00:04:10.299> they<00:04:10.420> they<00:04:11.079> essentially<00:04:11.409> taken

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
there k are they they essentially taken

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.530 
there k are they they essentially taken
two<00:04:12.010> helmets<00:04:12.219> and<00:04:12.579> now<00:04:13.000> they're<00:04:13.209> just<00:04:13.239> gonna

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
two helmets and now they're just gonna

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.020 
two helmets and now they're just gonna
sell<00:04:13.750> one<00:04:13.989> yeah<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.370> was<00:04:15.489> actually<00:04:15.609> at<00:04:15.879> the

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
sell one yeah so I was actually at the

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.150 
sell one yeah so I was actually at the
launch<00:04:16.209> of<00:04:16.449> the<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.900> Giro<00:04:17.139> Cynthia's<00:04:17.949> ona

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
launch of the of the Giro Cynthia's ona

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.580 
launch of the of the Giro Cynthia's ona
the<00:04:18.639> American<00:04:19.000> launched<00:04:19.180> about<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:20.019> week<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.560> a

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
the American launched about a week and a

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.830 
the American launched about a week and a
half<00:04:20.620> ago<00:04:20.889> and<00:04:21.190> got<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.940> whole<00:04:22.060> spiel<00:04:22.389> and<00:04:22.690> I

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
half ago and got the whole spiel and I

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.670 
half ago and got the whole spiel and I
think<00:04:23.020> they've<00:04:23.110> actually<00:04:23.349> shot<00:04:23.500> themselves

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
think they've actually shot themselves

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.870 
think they've actually shot themselves
in<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:23.949> foot<00:04:24.009> a<00:04:24.160> little<00:04:24.340> bit<00:04:24.430> because<00:04:24.580> why

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
in the foot a little bit because why

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.950 
in the foot a little bit because why
would<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.240> buy<00:04:25.449> an<00:04:25.960> A<00:04:26.320> on<00:04:26.349> if<00:04:27.120> if<00:04:28.120> this<00:04:28.539> new

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
would you buy an A on if if this new

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.290 
would you buy an A on if if this new
helmet<00:04:29.259> is<00:04:29.380> supposedly<00:04:29.740> just<00:04:30.070> as<00:04:30.250> cools<00:04:30.970> just

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
helmet is supposedly just as cools just

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.850 
helmet is supposedly just as cools just
as<00:04:31.449> well<00:04:31.599> and<00:04:31.870> why<00:04:32.320> would<00:04:32.470> you<00:04:32.500> buy<00:04:32.650> an<00:04:32.740> air

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
as well and why would you buy an air

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.800 
as well and why would you buy an air
attack<00:04:32.949> if<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:34.030> new<00:04:34.150> helmet<00:04:34.419> is<00:04:34.509> actually

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
attack if the new helmet is actually

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.409 
attack if the new helmet is actually
faster<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.830> synth<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:36.610> faster<00:04:37.090> with<00:04:37.300> your

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
of when you're riding in the hoods or

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.870 
of when you're riding in the hoods or
even<00:04:44.710> in<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.889> drops<00:04:45.130> kind<00:04:45.430> of<00:04:45.490> with<00:04:45.580> your<00:04:45.699> head

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
even in the drops kind of with your head

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.600 
even in the drops kind of with your head
up<00:04:46.120> so<00:04:46.630> you're<00:04:46.750> looking<00:04:46.840> straight<00:04:47.199> ahead

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
up so you're looking straight ahead

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.909 
up so you're looking straight ahead
that's<00:04:48.610> a<00:04:48.789> 30<00:04:49.060> degree<00:04:49.240> ish<00:04:49.660> head<00:04:50.110> angle<00:04:50.440> the

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
that's a 30 degree ish head angle the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.249 
that's a 30 degree ish head angle the
air<00:04:51.340> attack<00:04:51.639> is<00:04:51.909> still<00:04:52.270> faster<00:04:52.840> significantly

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
air attack is still faster significantly

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.580 
air attack is still faster significantly
faster<00:04:53.889> if<00:04:54.580> you<00:04:54.729> put<00:04:54.880> your<00:04:54.970> head<00:04:55.120> down<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.930> if

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
faster if you put your head down so if

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.310 
faster if you put your head down so if
you<00:04:56.860> sprint<00:04:57.370> like<00:04:57.849> Cavendish<00:04:58.780> does<00:04:58.990> with<00:04:59.229> his

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
you sprint like Cavendish does with his

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.800 
you sprint like Cavendish does with his
head<00:04:59.530> kind<00:04:59.740> of<00:04:59.830> tucked<00:05:00.070> in<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:01.419> air<00:05:01.539> attacks

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
head kind of tucked in the air attacks

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.469 
head kind of tucked in the air attacks
still<00:05:02.080> know<00:05:02.169> me<00:05:02.259> faster<00:05:02.650> or<00:05:02.830> if<00:05:03.370> you<00:05:03.520> are<00:05:03.729> using

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
still know me faster or if you are using

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.089 
still know me faster or if you are using
it<00:05:04.630> in<00:05:04.690> time<00:05:04.900> trials<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.560> you're<00:05:05.680> gonna<00:05:05.800> sort

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
it in time trials and you're gonna sort

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.430 
it in time trials and you're gonna sort
of<00:05:06.190> like<00:05:06.280> look<00:05:06.490> down<00:05:06.669> at<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:06.940> road<00:05:07.120> for<00:05:07.570> 30

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
of like look down at the road for 30

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.379 
of like look down at the road for 30
seconds<00:05:08.740> of<00:05:08.860> time<00:05:08.979> peak<00:05:09.370> up<00:05:09.550> look<00:05:09.909> down<00:05:09.940> peak

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
seconds of time peak up look down peak

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:11.939 
seconds of time peak up look down peak
up<00:05:10.570> then<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.139> air<00:05:11.259> attacks<00:05:11.530> still<00:05:11.740> get<00:05:11.860> me

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
up then the air attacks still get me

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.249 
up then the air attacks still get me
faster<00:05:12.280> but<00:05:12.490> for<00:05:13.150> most<00:05:13.270> people<00:05:13.690> most<00:05:13.870> of<00:05:14.169> the

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
faster but for most people most of the

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:15.689 
faster but for most people most of the
time<00:05:14.320> we<00:05:14.889> ride<00:05:15.070> with<00:05:15.220> our<00:05:15.250> heads<00:05:15.460> up<00:05:15.639> because

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
time we ride with our heads up because

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:16.800 
time we ride with our heads up because
we're<00:05:15.940> looking<00:05:16.150> where<00:05:16.270> we're<00:05:16.360> going<00:05:16.630> and

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
we're looking where we're going and

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.939 
we're looking where we're going and
they're<00:05:16.960> saying<00:05:17.139> that<00:05:17.229> the<00:05:17.380> new<00:05:17.500> anyway<00:05:17.889> I'll

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
they're saying that the new anyway I'll

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.140 
they're saying that the new anyway I'll
might<00:05:18.099> seem<00:05:18.280> difficult<00:05:18.340> faster<00:05:18.880> with<00:05:19.000> that

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
might seem difficult faster with that

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.820 
might seem difficult faster with that
head<00:05:19.389> position<00:05:19.780> okay<00:05:20.020> thanks<00:05:20.320> very<00:05:20.440> much<00:05:20.620> I

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
head position okay thanks very much I

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.230 
head position okay thanks very much I
think<00:05:21.220> for<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.490> start<00:05:21.820> of<00:05:21.909> the<00:05:21.970> Tour<00:05:22.150> de

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
think for the start of the Tour de

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.820 
think for the start of the Tour de
France<00:05:22.479> we'll<00:05:22.990> leave<00:05:23.139> it<00:05:23.229> that<00:05:23.349> I<00:05:23.380> think<00:05:23.650> over

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
France we'll leave it that I think over

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.960 
France we'll leave it that I think over
the<00:05:23.919> course<00:05:24.159> of<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.370> streaks<00:05:24.669> we're<00:05:24.820> probably

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
the course of the streaks we're probably

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.689 
the course of the streaks we're probably
gonna<00:05:25.180> see<00:05:25.270> a<00:05:25.449> few<00:05:25.750> new<00:05:25.780> bits<00:05:26.080> and<00:05:26.259> bobs

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
gonna see a few new bits and bobs

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.740 
gonna see a few new bits and bobs
potentially<00:05:27.699> something<00:05:27.970> from<00:05:28.120> SRAM<00:05:28.509> which

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
potentially something from SRAM which

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.270 
potentially something from SRAM which
will<00:05:29.349> keep<00:05:29.440> our<00:05:29.590> fingers<00:05:29.620> crossed<00:05:29.889> that<00:05:30.099> that

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
will keep our fingers crossed that that

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.499 
will keep our fingers crossed that that
makes<00:05:30.430> an<00:05:30.520> appearance<00:05:30.759> but<00:05:31.000> we<00:05:31.060> don't<00:05:31.300> know

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
makes an appearance but we don't know

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.560 
makes an appearance but we don't know
but<00:05:32.500> but<00:05:32.949> yeah<00:05:33.130> tune<00:05:33.550> in<00:05:33.699> for<00:05:33.909> more<00:05:34.210> tech<00:05:34.539> news

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
but but yeah tune in for more tech news

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.560 
but but yeah tune in for more tech news
