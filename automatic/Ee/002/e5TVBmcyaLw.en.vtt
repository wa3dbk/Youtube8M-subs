00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
tetanus is brilliant so that these are

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:13.640 
tetanus is brilliant so that these are
the<00:01:01.829> foods<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.309> many<00:01:02.520> years<00:01:09.799> oh<00:01:12.170> yes<00:01:13.170> tilting

the foods I many years oh yes tilting
I'm<00:01:13.890> obviously<00:01:14.250> i<00:01:14.460> use<00:01:14.670> teleport<00:01:15.150> with

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
I'm obviously i use teleport with

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.870 
I'm obviously i use teleport with
children<00:01:16.110> s<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:17.700> run

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
children s and you can see and they run

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.290 
children s and you can see and they run
away<00:01:18.000> no<00:01:18.869> problem

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
away no problem

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.510 
away no problem
it's<00:01:21.230> very<00:01:21.410> hard<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:21.740> dodge<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:21.980> because

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
it's very hard to dodge that because

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.040 
it's very hard to dodge that because
they<00:01:22.640> don't<00:01:22.850> know<00:01:22.940> when<00:01:23.210> you're<00:01:23.420> chillin<00:01:23.870> f

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
they don't know when you're chillin f

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.150 
they don't know when you're chillin f
will<00:01:24.320> finish<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:26.530> maybe<00:01:27.530> they<00:01:27.770> might<00:01:27.950> get

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
will finish so maybe they might get

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.880 
will finish so maybe they might get
lucky<00:01:28.370> but<00:01:29.150> most<00:01:29.450> of<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.600> time<00:01:29.810> you'll<00:01:30.680> get

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
lucky but most of the time you'll get

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.910 
lucky but most of the time you'll get
them<00:01:31.900> missed<00:01:32.900> forms<00:01:33.230> brilliant<00:01:33.650> for<00:01:33.770> all

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
them missed forms brilliant for all

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.280 
them missed forms brilliant for all
occasions<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.670> know<00:01:34.790> I<00:01:35.000> mean<00:01:35.450> three<00:01:35.720> seconds

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
occasions you know I mean three seconds

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.280 
occasions you know I mean three seconds
of<00:01:36.560> invulnerability<00:01:37.370> they<00:01:38.360> can't<00:01:38.630> hit<00:01:39.080> you

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
of invulnerability they can't hit you

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.980 
of invulnerability they can't hit you
Stan<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.710> or<00:01:39.860> ever<00:01:40.070> but<00:01:40.850> if<00:01:41.480> you<00:01:41.630> look<00:01:41.750> at<00:01:41.900> my

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
Stan you or ever but if you look at my

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.240 
Stan you or ever but if you look at my
free<00:01:42.170> video<00:01:42.590> i<00:01:43.180> mostly<00:01:44.180> use<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.480> to<00:01:45.250> finish

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
free video i mostly use it to finish

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.220 
free video i mostly use it to finish
someone<00:01:46.670> off<00:01:46.820> if<00:01:47.090> it's<00:01:47.270> like<00:01:47.480> another<00:01:47.990> enemy

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
someone off if it's like another enemy

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.670 
someone off if it's like another enemy
around<00:01:48.740> because<00:01:49.730> obviously<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:51.200> one<00:01:51.380> down

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
around because obviously the one down

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.620 
around because obviously the one down
could<00:01:52.130> interrupt<00:01:52.580> you<00:01:52.790> all<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.150> other<00:01:53.300> person

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
could interrupt you all the other person

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.240 
could interrupt you all the other person
could<00:01:53.810> interrupt<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.320> in<00:01:54.500> any<00:01:54.740> way<00:01:54.770> back<00:01:55.100> up

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
could interrupt you in any way back up

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.480 
could interrupt you in any way back up
and<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.520> bigamist<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:57.010> usually<00:01:58.010> I<00:01:58.070> use<00:01:58.100> miss

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
and a bigamist so usually I use miss

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.660 
and a bigamist so usually I use miss
form<00:01:58.790> and<00:01:59.000> finish<00:01:59.270> them<00:01:59.450> I<00:02:00.280> was<00:02:01.280> Lee<00:02:01.430> doesn't

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
form and finish them I was Lee doesn't

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.340 
form and finish them I was Lee doesn't
work<00:02:01.880> on<00:02:02.000> all<00:02:02.150> classes<00:02:02.630> like<00:02:02.840> for<00:02:03.260> example

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
work on all classes like for example

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.070 
work on all classes like for example
FIFA<00:02:04.010> mesma<00:02:04.430> they<00:02:05.090> can<00:02:05.360> teleport<00:02:05.900> away

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
FIFA mesma they can teleport away

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.980 
FIFA mesma they can teleport away
therefore<00:02:07.070> you'll<00:02:07.270> waste<00:02:08.270> your<00:02:08.450> missed<00:02:08.720> form

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
therefore you'll waste your missed form

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.560 
therefore you'll waste your missed form
so<00:02:09.619> why<00:02:09.770> usually<00:02:10.190> do<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.520> try<00:02:10.790> to<00:02:10.850> down<00:02:11.270> them

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
so why usually do is try to down them

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.630 
so why usually do is try to down them
with<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.750> dummy<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.380> then<00:02:12.920> when<00:02:13.070> they<00:02:13.100> teleport

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
with a dummy and then when they teleport

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.370 
with a dummy and then when they teleport
away<00:02:13.760> your<00:02:14.000> stuff<00:02:14.210> away<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.900> quickly<00:02:15.140> go

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
away your stuff away then I quickly go

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.710 
away your stuff away then I quickly go
