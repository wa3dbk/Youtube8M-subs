00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
did the record rotation kit we refer to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.070 
did the record rotation kit we refer to
as<00:01:26.100> Bruin<00:01:26.939> shovel<00:01:27.240> holder<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> garbage

cans<00:01:28.460> also<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.030> driver's<00:01:30.390> side<00:01:30.540> toolbox

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
cans also in the driver's side toolbox

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.399 
cans also in the driver's side toolbox
we<00:01:31.320> did<00:01:31.530> an<00:01:31.619> air<00:01:31.770> compressor<00:01:32.509> we<00:01:33.509> put<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> shelf

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
we did an air compressor we put a shelf

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.830 
we did an air compressor we put a shelf
cover<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.920> there<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:36.180> still<00:01:36.450> uses

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
cover on there so I think still uses

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.960 
cover on there so I think still uses
toolbox<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.619> keep<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> compressor<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:38.850> of

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
toolbox but keep the compressor out of

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.090 
toolbox but keep the compressor out of
the<00:01:39.060> weather<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> kind<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> an

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the weather this is a kind of an

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.790 
the weather this is a kind of an
upgraded<00:01:41.430> version

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
upgraded version

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.600 
upgraded version
a<00:01:43.240> little<00:01:44.240> nicer<00:01:44.510> compressor<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:45.410> higher<00:01:45.920> CFM

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
a little nicer compressor so higher CFM

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.850 
a little nicer compressor so higher CFM
but<00:01:47.330> that<00:01:47.570> has<00:01:47.780> an<00:01:47.960> on/off<00:01:48.290> switch<00:01:48.320> access

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860
