outfit<00:00:43.010> for<00:00:44.010> Michael<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.329> quite<00:00:45.539> funny

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
outfit for Michael now it's quite funny

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.319 
outfit for Michael now it's quite funny
because<00:00:46.140> Michael's<00:00:46.800> obviously<00:00:47.280> gained<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
because Michael's obviously gained a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.350 
because Michael's obviously gained a
little<00:00:48.600> bit<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.809> weight<00:00:48.989> recently<00:00:50.239> it's<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
little bit of weight recently it's a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.209 
little bit of weight recently it's a
little<00:00:51.600> bit<00:00:51.750> pudgy<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.440> imagine<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
little bit pudgy I imagine this is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.709 
little bit pudgy I imagine this is
pretty<00:00:53.640> much<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.000> would<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.420> in

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
pretty much what I would look like in

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.150 
pretty much what I would look like in
one<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.989> these<00:00:55.110> seats<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.829> go

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
one of these seats but there we go

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.590 
one of these seats but there we go
so<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> first<00:00:57.449> mod<00:00:57.719> these<00:00:58.440> skin

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
so that's the first mod these skin

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.360 
so that's the first mod these skin

someone<00:02:20.060> should<00:02:20.240> totally<00:02:20.660> invent<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.460> little

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
someone should totally invent a little

mining<00:02:23.950> mod<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:25.280> for<00:02:25.460> this<00:02:25.520> area<00:02:25.790> not<00:02:26.000> the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
mining mod just for this area not the

whole<00:02:26.270> map<00:02:26.510> because<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.840> would<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.080> be

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
whole map because that would just be

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.470 
whole map because that would just be
ridiculous<00:02:27.710> but<00:02:27.740> maybe<00:02:28.310> if<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.940> hit<00:02:29.240> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
ridiculous but maybe if you hit the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.420 
ridiculous but maybe if you hit the
walls<00:02:29.690> here<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.170> get<00:02:30.290> like<00:02:30.500> items<00:02:30.890> coming<00:02:31.280> out

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
walls here you get like items coming out

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.730 
walls here you get like items coming out
that<00:02:31.790> would<00:02:31.910> be<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.270> awesome<00:02:32.450> anyway<00:02:33.200> so

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
that would be so awesome anyway so

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.110 
that would be so awesome anyway so
there's<00:02:34.220> another<00:02:34.430> idea<00:02:34.640> for<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:34.970> mana

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
there's another idea for the mana

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.380 
there's another idea for the mana
