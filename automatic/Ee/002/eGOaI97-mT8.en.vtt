just one single panel with the brazilian
nationalteam<00:02:48.740> crest<00:02:49.250> other<00:02:49.820> than<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.060> it's

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
nationalteam crest other than that it's

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.000 
nationalteam crest other than that it's
just<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:50.630> pattern<00:02:51.020> all<00:02:51.350> over<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.830> ball

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
just this pattern all over the ball

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.830 
just this pattern all over the ball
there's<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.340> look<00:02:52.550> at<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.760> valve<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.360> again<00:02:53.750> it

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
there's a look at the valve and again it

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.240 
there's a look at the valve and again it
just<00:02:53.870> gives<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.320> Nike<00:02:54.590> ordem<00:02:54.800> which<00:02:55.070> i<00:02:55.190> think

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
just gives the Nike ordem which i think

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.040 
just gives the Nike ordem which i think
is<00:02:55.490> already<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:55.940> very<00:02:56.150> unique<00:02:56.510> looking<00:02:56.810> soccer

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
is already a very unique looking soccer

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.110 
is already a very unique looking soccer
ball<00:02:57.350> even<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.220> much<00:02:58.400> more<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:58.730> a

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
ball even that much more of a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.630 
ball even that much more of a
distinctive<00:02:59.780> look<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.830> again<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.340> just<00:03:01.490> a

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
distinctive look so again this is just a

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.880 
distinctive look so again this is just a
standard<00:03:01.880> Nike<00:03:02.420> ordem<00:03:02.630> there's<00:03:03.560> really<00:03:03.710> no

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
standard Nike ordem there's really no

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.350 
standard Nike ordem there's really no

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.270 
actually pretty excited to have my hands

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
on one of them

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.500 
on one of them
so<00:03:28.700> let's<00:03:28.820> pretty<00:03:29.000> much<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.209> for<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.390> video

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
so let's pretty much it for the video

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.510 
so let's pretty much it for the video
guys<00:03:29.840> again<00:03:30.500> as<00:03:30.620> far<00:03:30.770> as<00:03:30.860> availability<00:03:31.250> is

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
guys again as far as availability is

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.130 
guys again as far as availability is
concerned<00:03:31.880> as<00:03:32.060> far<00:03:32.120> as<00:03:32.270> I<00:03:32.450> know<00:03:32.510> they're

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
concerned as far as I know they're

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.660 
concerned as far as I know they're
pretty<00:03:33.290> much<00:03:33.470> sold<00:03:33.530> out<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.130> can't<00:03:34.340> get<00:03:34.520> them

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
pretty much sold out you can't get them

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.240 
pretty much sold out you can't get them
anymore<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:35.360> I<00:03:36.050> guess<00:03:36.200> eBay<00:03:36.740> would<00:03:36.950> be<00:03:37.100> your

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
anymore so I guess eBay would be your

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.040 
anymore so I guess eBay would be your
best<00:03:37.459> bet<00:03:37.670> if<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:37.910> are<00:03:38.150> interested<00:03:38.750> in<00:03:38.840> one

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
best bet if you are interested in one

best bet if you are interested in one
other<00:03:39.740> than<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.100> though<00:03:40.310> if<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.550> have<00:03:40.640> any
