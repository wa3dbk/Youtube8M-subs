first thing you need to remember is that
we're<00:00:56.610> dealing<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:57.059> two<00:00:57.239> different<00:00:57.270> time

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
we're dealing with two different time

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.950 
we're dealing with two different time
loops<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.550> were<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> look<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.510> Nazi

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
loops if we were to look at the Nazi

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.319 
loops if we were to look at the Nazi
zombies<00:01:01.350> storyline<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> linear<00:01:02.579> time<00:01:03.000> line

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
zombies storyline as a linear time line

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
zombies storyline as a linear time line

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
then we would need to when your

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.210 
then we would need to when your
timelines<00:01:06.030> running<00:01:06.650> simultaneously<00:01:07.650> one

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
timelines running simultaneously one

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
timelines running simultaneously one
that<00:01:08.430> begins<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:08.970> origins<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.350> other

that begins with not these are two

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.270 
that begins with not these are two
different<00:01:13.020> time<00:01:13.229> continues<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.010> don't

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
different time continues that don't

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.340 
different time continues that don't
interact<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:15.030> each<00:01:15.210> other<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.720> far<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:16.170> we

interact with each other as far as we

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.469 
interact with each other as far as we
know<00:01:16.560> they<00:01:16.830> function<00:01:17.280> very<00:01:17.549> similarly<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
know they function very similarly to the

then we saw in the case of Gersh where

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.130 
then we saw in the case of Gersh where
we<00:03:59.370> actually<00:03:59.880> released<00:04:00.269> him<00:04:00.510> from<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.900> aether

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
we actually released him from the aether

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.680 
we actually released him from the aether
but<00:04:01.890> we<00:04:02.010> don't<00:04:02.340> know<00:04:02.609> where<00:04:02.940> he<00:04:03.150> went<00:04:03.390> after

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
but we don't know where he went after

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.559 
but we don't know where he went after
that<00:04:03.900> his<00:04:04.380> soul<00:04:04.769> may<00:04:04.799> have<00:04:05.459> entered<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:06.180> Nirvana

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
that his soul may have entered a Nirvana

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.599 
that his soul may have entered a Nirvana
type<00:04:06.959> state<00:04:07.260> where<00:04:07.500> he<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.799> completed<00:04:08.430> and

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
type state where he is completed and

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.699 
type state where he is completed and
that<00:04:08.639> is<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.450> formed<00:04:09.840> with<00:04:09.959> his<00:04:10.139> soul<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.650> his

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
that is it formed with his soul and his

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.680 
that is it formed with his soul and his
body<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.130> done<00:04:11.340> but<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.609> course<00:04:11.819> this<00:04:12.329> is<00:04:12.540> all

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
body is done but of course this is all

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.080
