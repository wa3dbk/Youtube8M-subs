but this is as close as I have to doing

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.109 
but this is as close as I have to doing
brush<00:01:44.620> so<00:01:45.250> I<00:01:45.310> just<00:01:45.460> used<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.940> brush

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
brush so I just used that to brush

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.249 
brush so I just used that to brush
through<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.390> curls<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:46.900> this<00:01:47.020> really

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
through the curls and this really

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.230 
through the curls and this really
defines<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.860> curls<00:01:48.100> I'm<00:01:48.670> gonna<00:01:48.850> show<00:01:49.030> you<00:01:49.090> in

this<00:01:49.330> clip<00:01:49.540> how<00:01:49.720> much<00:01:49.930> define<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.500> curls<00:01:50.710> are

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.760 
this clip how much define the curls are
as<00:01:51.759> opposed<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.150> using<00:01:52.300> a<00:01:52.660> comb<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.560> brush

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
as opposed to using a comb the brush

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.020 
as opposed to using a comb the brush
really<00:01:54.070> helps<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.880> colors<00:01:55.119> come<00:01:55.300> out<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:01.000> I

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.380 
bit quicker and to do that I'm using my
diffuser<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.200> I<00:03:30.620> did<00:03:30.860> set<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.340> settings<00:03:32.210> on<00:03:32.360> a

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
diffuser and I did set the settings on a

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.000 
diffuser and I did set the settings on a
low<00:03:32.660> heat<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:33.760> cool<00:03:34.760> air<00:03:35.060> so<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.260> air<00:03:36.980> is

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
low heat and cool air so the air is

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.560 
low heat and cool air so the air is
really<00:03:37.430> cold<00:03:37.670> so<00:03:37.970> my<00:03:38.120> hair<00:03:38.270> doesn't<00:03:38.420> get

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
really cold so my hair doesn't get

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.900 
really cold so my hair doesn't get
damaged<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:40.010> lay<00:03:40.160> my<00:03:40.310> edges<00:03:40.460> down<00:03:40.730> I'm

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
damaged and to lay my edges down I'm

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.550 
damaged and to lay my edges down I'm
using<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.270> organic<00:03:41.390> root<00:03:41.810> stimulator<00:03:42.080> edge

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
using the organic root stimulator edge

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.470 
using the organic root stimulator edge
control<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.760> put<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:43.970> little<00:03:44.210> bit<00:03:44.330> of<00:03:44.390> water

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
control and I put a little bit of water

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.180 
control and I put a little bit of water
on<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.780> so<00:03:44.960> my<00:03:45.080> hair<00:03:45.230> doesn't<00:03:45.380> get<00:03:45.530> flaky<00:03:45.800> and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
on it so my hair doesn't get flaky and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.270 
on it so my hair doesn't get flaky and
add<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:46.700> my<00:03:46.730> edges<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.360> brush<00:03:47.570> it<00:03:47.720> down

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
add that to my edges and brush it down

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.160 
add that to my edges and brush it down
so<00:03:49.280> that's<00:03:49.460> what<00:03:49.550> I'm<00:03:49.640> doing<00:03:49.670> right<00:03:49.940> here<00:03:53.170> and

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170
