life<00:00:05.810> at<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.020> point<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.500> don't<00:00:07.649> think<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.670> any

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
life at this point I don't think in any

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.720 
life at this point I don't think in any
stretch<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.230> imagination<00:00:10.400> that<00:00:11.400> urban

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
stretch of the imagination that urban

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.089 
stretch of the imagination that urban
farming<00:00:12.120> can<00:00:12.420> feed<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> city<00:00:13.019> like<00:00:13.320> Portland<00:00:13.860> I

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
farming can feed a city like Portland I

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.890 
farming can feed a city like Portland I
think<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.880> there's<00:00:15.059> probably<00:00:15.150> other<00:00:15.509> cities

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
think that there's probably other cities

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.380 
think that there's probably other cities
that<00:00:16.109> are<00:00:16.430> waste<00:00:17.430> more<00:00:17.940> sparsely<00:00:18.359> populated

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
that are waste more sparsely populated

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.900 
that are waste more sparsely populated
that<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.199> more<00:00:19.470> open<00:00:19.770> space<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.789> would

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
that have more open space that it would

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.620 
that have more open space that it would
make<00:00:21.090> sense<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.890> don't<00:00:22.890> think<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.189> need<00:00:23.310> to

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
make sense in I don't think we need to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
make sense in I don't think we need to
run<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.810> experiment<00:00:25.320> entirely<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:26.340> in

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
run the experiment entirely here in

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.700 
run the experiment entirely here in
Portland<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> see<00:00:27.269> what's<00:00:27.510> possible<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.260> think

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
Portland to see what's possible I think

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.859 
Portland to see what's possible I think
if<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.859> look<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> global<00:00:29.519> South<00:00:29.730> which<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
agriculture movement doesn't do quite

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.540 
agriculture movement doesn't do quite
often<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.860> look<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.129> global<00:00:38.399> south

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
often if you look in the global south

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.280 
often if you look in the global south
and<00:00:38.790> see<00:00:39.090> how<00:00:39.180> people<00:00:39.480> use<00:00:39.600> their<00:00:39.809> cities<00:00:40.079> down

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and see how people use their cities down

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.080 
and see how people use their cities down
there<00:00:40.530> there's<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.070> lot<00:00:41.280> more<00:00:41.430> food<00:00:41.640> production

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
there there's a lot more food production

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.979 
there there's a lot more food production
going<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:43.010> however<00:00:44.510> there's<00:00:45.510> still<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.780> huge

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
going on however there's still a huge

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
going on however there's still a huge
amount<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.379> dependency<00:00:47.280> people<00:00:47.610> are<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
amount of dependency people are going to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.330 
amount of dependency people are going to
want<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> eat<00:00:48.629> grains<00:00:49.440> people<00:00:49.980> are<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
want to eat grains people are going to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.520 
want to eat grains people are going to
want<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.700> eat<00:00:51.079> meat

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
want to eat meat

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.410 
want to eat meat
we<00:00:53.399> should<00:00:53.550> probably<00:00:53.640> eat<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> little<00:00:54.090> bit<00:00:54.270> less

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
we should probably eat a little bit less

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.000 
we should probably eat a little bit less
of<00:00:54.449> both<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.930> those<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.440> still<00:00:55.710> people<00:00:55.860> are

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
of both of those but still people are

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
of both of those but still people are
gonna<00:00:56.100> want<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> eat<00:00:56.430> them<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
gonna want to eat them and that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.319 
gonna want to eat them and that
production<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> city<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:59.090> just<00:01:00.090> not

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
production in the city is just just not

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.900 
production in the city is just just not
possible<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.989> think<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.469> were<00:01:01.559> growing<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
possible I think if we were growing and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
possible I think if we were growing and
eating<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.510> percent<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:05.600> all<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> food

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
eating one percent of all the food

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
eating one percent of all the food
consumed<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.470> Portland<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.640> grown

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
consumed in Portland if that was grown

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.370 
consumed in Portland if that was grown
if<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:09.360> percent<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.049> grown<00:01:10.229> in

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
if one percent of it was grown in

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.020 
if one percent of it was grown in
Portland<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:10.979> that'd<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.100> fantastic<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
Portland I think that'd be fantastic and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.580 
Portland I think that'd be fantastic and
that<00:01:12.119> would<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.390> that'd<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.810> amazing<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.500> it

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that would be that'd be amazing and it

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
that would be that'd be amazing and it
would<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.340> much<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.760> food<00:01:14.939> being

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
would just be so much more food being

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.969 
would just be so much more food being
grown<00:01:15.509> than<00:01:15.930> currently<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.729> right<00:01:17.729> now<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
grown than currently is right now the

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.170 
grown than currently is right now the
reasoning<00:01:19.979> behind<00:01:20.130> growing<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> food<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
reasoning behind growing the food in the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.910 
reasoning behind growing the food in the
city<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:22.340> it's<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.880> good<00:01:24.030> thing<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
city is it's it's a good thing to do and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.249 
city is it's it's a good thing to do and
that<00:01:25.920> sounds<00:01:26.250> kind<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.520> trite<00:01:26.930> however<00:01:27.930> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
that sounds kind of trite however it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.289 
that sounds kind of trite however it
it's<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.400> fine<00:01:29.610> thing<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.210> your

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
it's it's a fine thing to do with your

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.399 
it's it's a fine thing to do with your
time

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409

it's fun it's it's rewarding and it's an

everything is drained down through
different<00:02:02.610> things<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.210> think<00:02:03.509> about<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
different things and you think about the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.719 
different things and you think about the
resource<00:02:04.079> economics<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.189> even<00:02:05.610> if

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
resource economics of that and even if

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.709 
resource economics of that and even if
that<00:02:05.909> means<00:02:06.149> you're<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.540> able<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
that means you're going to be able to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.210 
that means you're going to be able to
produce<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:07.110> little<00:02:07.320> bit<00:02:07.469> more<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> town

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
produce a little bit more in the town

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.479 
produce a little bit more in the town
how<00:02:08.459> how<00:02:09.030> does<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.390> pay<00:02:09.539> for<00:02:09.599> itself<00:02:10.080> to

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
how how does that pay for itself to

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.500 
how how does that pay for itself to
produce<00:02:11.489> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
produce that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.199 
produce that
it's<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:13.140> fun<00:02:13.530> it's<00:02:13.770> techie<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.489> imagine<00:02:15.120> all

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
it's it's fun it's techie to imagine all

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.089 
it's it's fun it's techie to imagine all
these<00:02:15.330> things<00:02:15.660> but<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.440> most<00:02:16.560> effective<00:02:16.769> way

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
these things but the most effective way

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.850 
these things but the most effective way
to<00:02:17.310> feed<00:02:17.910> people<00:02:18.150> which<00:02:18.599> we<00:02:18.989> find<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.530> growing

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
to feed people which we find is growing

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.780 
to feed people which we find is growing
food<00:02:20.099> in<00:02:20.280> good<00:02:20.489> soil<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.000> part<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.930> that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
food in good soil and part of that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.479 
food in good soil and part of that
rather<00:02:23.790> than<00:02:24.000> thinking<00:02:24.269> about<00:02:24.360> how<00:02:24.660> do<00:02:24.720> we

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
rather than thinking about how do we

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.850 
rather than thinking about how do we
become<00:02:26.489> entirely<00:02:26.790> independent<00:02:27.599> as<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.989> city<00:02:28.379> we

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
become entirely independent as a city we

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.160 
become entirely independent as a city we
can<00:02:29.040> lift<00:02:29.190> towards<00:02:29.480> repairing<00:02:30.480> our<00:02:30.630> urban

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
can lift towards repairing our urban

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.160 
can lift towards repairing our urban
rural<00:02:31.319> relations<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.720> making<00:02:33.720> sure<00:02:33.870> that

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
rural relations and making sure that

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.630 
rural relations and making sure that
it's<00:02:34.349> less<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.769> parasitic<00:02:35.220> relationship

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
it's less of a parasitic relationship

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.630 
it's less of a parasitic relationship
between<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.840> city<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:38.130> country<00:02:38.519> and

between the the city and the country and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.180 
between the the city and the country and
one<00:02:38.760> way<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:38.989> ensure<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.650> expose

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
one way to ensure that is to expose

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.309 
one way to ensure that is to expose
people<00:02:41.549> in<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.090> city<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.569> what<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> reality

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
people in the city to what the reality

people in the city to what the reality
of<00:02:43.349> growing<00:02:43.860> food<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.580> people<00:02:44.730> maybe<00:02:45.000> have

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
of growing food is so people maybe have

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.530 
of growing food is so people maybe have
a<00:02:45.690> bit<00:02:45.900> more<00:02:45.930> appreciation<00:02:46.500> for<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
a bit more appreciation for that and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.150 
a bit more appreciation for that and
