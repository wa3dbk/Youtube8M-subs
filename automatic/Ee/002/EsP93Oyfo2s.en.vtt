00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.770
 Marius ... I finally found it. 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.820
 Tullyel! Yes, it is. Now I know, you ... 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.520
 Why did not you think that I would hide my figure? 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.900
 They ... they are always watching! 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.860
 I've been looking for you for a long time, Marius. 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.360
 I just wanted to see if you were going to hide. 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.190
 Oh, forgive me, Tariel. Please ... It was not my fault. 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.190
 It's not your fault? Marius, how was it not your fault? 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:15.520
 Wanderer ... Yes, it's because of the wanderer. 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.190
 I feel like a time when I lived in a city of thieves. 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.900
 I wanted to live with other bums and run away from memory. 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.270
 Beyond the east gate, in the high mountains. 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.190
 Do you need anything? 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.570
 this... 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.150
 Oh, I've been fighting sleep for days. 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.770
 I remember when I dreamed ... 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:11.170
 The memory of the fortress ... and the memory of evil that took control of it. 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.750
 Dream ... memories ... I can not distinguish between them. 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:32.900
 Was the evil in my dream following me? 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.020
 How did I know I was here? 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:46.740
 The only one who could not afford the weight of his knife 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.650
 How did he become a burning fear and chased me here? 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:18.610
 He was struggling with his own devil. 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.610
 I was losing ... 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:05:01.690
 Let's look at the scene ... I really wanted to be crazy. 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.900
 That fear, its destruction 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:12.610
 The evil I saw ... how would you explain otherwise? 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.610
 Did these demons pop out of my dreams? 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.820
 Was he born in a wanderer? 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.860
 Marius 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:43.690
 Why did you follow him? I do not know why my dream job actually happens? 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:51.270
 All I know is that he called ... I had to follow. 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:07:00.860
 We went out together. To the east ... all the way east.
