00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
little bit easier to spread but I'm not

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.780 
little bit easier to spread but I'm not
going<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:41.990> do<00:02:42.110> that<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:43.100> spread<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.370> over<00:02:43.580> as

going to do that so spread it over as

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.520 
going to do that so spread it over as
evenly<00:02:44.180> as<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.480> can<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.990> next<00:02:45.230> thing<00:02:45.410> you

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
evenly as you can and the next thing you

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.199 
evenly as you can and the next thing you
are<00:02:45.620> going<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.860> do<00:02:46.010> is<00:02:46.280> sprinkle<00:02:46.640> over<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
are going to do is sprinkle over the

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.320 
are going to do is sprinkle over the
brown<00:02:47.480> sugar<00:02:47.920> now<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:48.950> am<00:02:49.370> using<00:02:49.580> dark<00:02:50.209> brown

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
brown sugar now I am using dark brown

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.220 
brown sugar now I am using dark brown
sugar<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.080> like<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:52.130> way<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:53.150> tastes<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.959> think

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
sugar I like the way it tastes I think

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.740 
sugar I like the way it tastes I think
that<00:02:54.380> brown<00:02:54.560> sugar<00:02:54.590> since<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.250> still<00:02:55.459> has<00:02:55.819> the

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
that brown sugar since it still has the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.580 
that brown sugar since it still has the
molasses<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:57.500> other<00:02:58.090> impurities<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.870> then

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
molasses and other impurities in it then

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.080 
molasses and other impurities in it then
it<00:03:00.860> gives<00:03:01.070> it<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.310> little<00:03:01.459> bit<00:03:01.550> more<00:03:01.760> character

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
it gives it a little bit more character

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.690 
it gives it a little bit more character
and<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.360> little<00:03:02.540> bit<00:03:02.660> more<00:03:02.810> flavor<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:03.700> that's

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
and a little bit more flavor so that's

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.449 
and a little bit more flavor so that's
why<00:03:04.880> dark<00:03:05.150> brown<00:03:05.390> sugar<00:03:05.600> is<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:07.040> one<00:03:07.250> that's

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
why dark brown sugar is the one that's

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.000 
why dark brown sugar is the one that's
in<00:03:07.640> my<00:03:07.760> kitchen<00:03:08.080> sprinkle<00:03:09.080> this<00:03:09.200> over<00:03:09.680> as

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
in my kitchen sprinkle this over as

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.070 
in my kitchen sprinkle this over as
evenly<00:03:10.489> as<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:10.730> can<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.780> next<00:03:11.989> thing
