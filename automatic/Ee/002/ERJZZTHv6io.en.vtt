00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.760 
black bar right there
it's<00:01:56.159> holding<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.820> place<00:01:57.409> you've<00:01:58.409> got<00:01:58.649> to

it's holding that in place you've got to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.709 
it's holding that in place you've got to
move<00:01:58.890> your<00:01:58.950> actuator<00:01:59.759> underneath<00:02:00.450> there

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
move your actuator underneath there

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.749 
move your actuator underneath there
that's<00:02:01.229> how<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.409> ended<00:02:01.740> up<00:02:01.860> doing<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.549> once

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759

there what you'll do is you'll take a

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.020 
there what you'll do is you'll take a
screwdriver<00:02:26.410> you'll<00:02:27.100> lift<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.490> clip<00:02:27.790> in<00:02:27.940> the

screwdriver you'll lift that clip in the
up<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.660> upwards<00:02:29.110> position<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:30.460> will<00:02:30.640> go

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
up to the upwards position this will go

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.540 
up to the upwards position this will go
up<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.530> you'll<00:02:32.680> take<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:32.860> pair<00:02:33.070> of<00:02:33.100> pliers<00:02:33.190> and

up and you'll take a pair of pliers and
pull<00:02:33.880> straight<00:02:34.360> back<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.230> found<00:02:35.650> it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
pull straight back on that I found it

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.920 
pull straight back on that I found it
easier<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.220> do<00:02:36.370> once<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.730> had<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> actuator

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
easier to do once I had the actuator

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.699 
easier to do once I had the actuator
actually<00:02:38.320> unbolt<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.830> on<00:02:38.980> everything<00:02:39.250> so

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
actually unbolt it on everything so

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.600 
actually unbolt it on everything so
those<00:02:41.709> are<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.950> main<00:02:42.130> things<00:02:42.310> you're<00:02:42.520> going

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
to end up dealing with on this mine's

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.750 
to end up dealing with on this mine's
working<00:02:45.640> good<00:02:45.970> now<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.770> had<00:02:48.130> no<00:02:48.370> issues

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760

run<00:03:18.100> in<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:19.209> I'll<00:03:19.930> mine<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:21.160> actual<00:03:21.489> cables

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
run in and I'll mine the actual cables

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.070 
run in and I'll mine the actual cables
were<00:03:22.390> reversed

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
were reversed

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.199 
were reversed
once<00:03:24.040> they<00:03:24.190> ran<00:03:24.400> in<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:24.670> don't<00:03:24.760> know<00:03:24.880> why<00:03:25.060> they

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
once they ran in I don't know why they

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.430 
once they ran in I don't know why they
just<00:03:25.330> couldn't<00:03:25.570> run<00:03:25.720> them<00:03:25.840> straight<00:03:25.930> but<00:03:26.290> they

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
just couldn't run them straight but they

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.090 
just couldn't run them straight but they
they<00:03:27.280> come<00:03:27.519> in<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.030> then<00:03:28.180> they<00:03:28.300> reverse<00:03:29.100> you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
they come in and then they reverse you

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:38.490 
they come in and then they reverse you
got<00:03:30.250> one<00:03:30.459> on<00:03:30.489> top<00:03:31.769> and

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.310

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
there just make sure you double check

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.240 
there just make sure you double check
before<00:03:51.550> you<00:03:51.760> take<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.000> off<00:03:53.010> got<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.100> right

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
before you take it off got it right

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
there and then it'll clip right there

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.130 
there and then it'll clip right there
there's<00:03:57.970> two<00:03:58.060> screws<00:03:58.360> that<00:03:58.630> hold<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:58.930> on
