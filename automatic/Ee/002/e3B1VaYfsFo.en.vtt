the block and do what's called proofing
the<00:00:05.700> block<00:00:06.319> how<00:00:07.319> are<00:00:07.560> we<00:00:07.710> applying<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.370> the

surface of the block and bulletproof a
proof<00:00:12.950> really<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.509> proof

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
proof really is just that it is proof

let's<00:00:19.470> discuss<00:00:19.619> paper

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
let's discuss paper

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.700 
let's discuss paper
there<00:00:21.660> are<00:00:21.720> several<00:00:21.869> papers<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.529> can

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
there are several papers that you can

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.609 
there are several papers that you can
choose<00:00:23.160> as<00:00:23.519> an<00:00:23.640> artist<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.840> print<00:00:25.230> maker<00:00:25.410> as

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
choose as an artist and a print maker as

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.939 
choose as an artist and a print maker as
well<00:00:26.869> most<00:00:27.869> importantly<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.500> want<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.769> use<00:00:28.859> an

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
well most importantly we want to use an

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.930 
well most importantly we want to use an
acid-free<00:00:29.340> paper<00:00:31.130> for<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> longevity<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
acid-free paper for the longevity of the

acid-free paper for the longevity of the
artwork<00:00:33.780> itself<00:00:34.309> something<00:00:35.309> like<00:00:35.460> newspaper

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
artwork itself something like newspaper

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.569 
artwork itself something like newspaper
it's<00:00:36.239> fine<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.840> pull<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> proof<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.070> or<00:00:38.340> even

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
it's fine to pull a proof on or even

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.549 
it's fine to pull a proof on or even

stripes for instance something like this
could<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.810> interesting<00:01:16.939> I<00:01:18.860> would<00:01:19.860> probably

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
could be interesting I would probably

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.490 
could be interesting I would probably
not<00:01:20.640> choose<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> paper<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.509> has<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> lei<00:01:22.049> or<00:01:22.409> a

not choose a paper that has a lei or a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.090 
not choose a paper that has a lei or a
tooth<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.490> which<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.439> actually<00:01:25.439> occurs<00:01:25.799> in

tooth to it which is actually occurs in

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.920 
tooth to it which is actually occurs in
the<00:01:26.189> process<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> paper<00:01:27.030> being<00:01:27.299> created

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the process of the paper being created

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.649 
the process of the paper being created
the<00:01:28.829> screen<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.460> which<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.790> pulp<00:01:30.030> falls<00:01:30.390> on

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the screen for which the pulp falls on

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.760 
the screen for which the pulp falls on
will<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> texture<00:01:32.369> or<00:01:32.400> surface<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.299> it

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
will have a texture or surface to it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.109 
will have a texture or surface to it
these<00:01:34.770> are<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> lot<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> handmade<00:01:35.520> papers<00:01:35.939> are

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
these are a lot of handmade papers are

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.499 
these are a lot of handmade papers are
like<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:37.130> actually<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.850> best<00:01:39.119> choice

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
like this actually the the best choice

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.390 
like this actually the the best choice
right<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.350> something<00:01:40.650> called<00:01:40.829> hosho

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
right now is something called hosho

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.590 
right now is something called hosho
which<00:01:42.299> has<00:01:42.479> two<00:01:42.720> sides<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.380> it
