shows<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.540> how<00:00:16.500> interaction<00:00:17.400> could<00:00:17.640> be<00:00:17.940> much

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
shows you how interaction could be much

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.630 
shows you how interaction could be much
more<00:00:18.449> natural<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:20.000> intuitive<00:00:21.140> by<00:00:22.640> bending

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
more natural and intuitive by bending

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.290 
more natural and intuitive by bending
and<00:00:24.199> twisting<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.710> device<00:00:26.099> dieter<00:00:26.880> Rams

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
and twisting the device dieter Rams

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.650 
and twisting the device dieter Rams
always<00:00:27.840> use<00:00:28.080> form<00:00:28.529> follows<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> function<00:00:29.849> but

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
always use form follows the function but

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.170 
always use form follows the function but
how<00:00:31.560> many<00:00:31.619> products<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.610> seen<00:00:32.910> that

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
how many products you have seen that

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.690 
how many products you have seen that
really<00:00:33.600> follows<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.260> function<00:00:34.800> first<00:00:35.309> time<00:00:35.670> I

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
really follows the function first time I

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.970 
really follows the function first time I
have<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.510> device<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.140> my<00:00:37.170> hand<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:38.840> literally

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
have a device in my hand that literally

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.610 
have a device in my hand that literally
follows<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.340> function<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.570> small<00:00:42.989> movement

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
follows the function so small movement

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.270 
follows the function so small movement
triggers<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.940> result<00:00:45.750> also<00:00:46.320> uncoming<00:00:47.100> from

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
triggers a result also uncoming from

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.700 
triggers a result also uncoming from
