00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
I think I almost got like 30 canine

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.920 
I think I almost got like 30 canine
units<00:05:21.760> in<00:05:21.910> this<00:05:21.970> whole<00:05:22.180> game<00:05:22.330> I<00:05:22.540> really<00:05:22.810> like

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
units in this whole game I really like

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.620 
units in this whole game I really like
the<00:05:23.050> canine<00:05:23.350> unit<00:05:23.380> I<00:05:24.240> haven't<00:05:25.240> done<00:05:25.300> like<00:05:25.510> the

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
I finally got the custom thumbnails I've

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.050 
I finally got the custom thumbnails I've
been<00:06:32.410> wanting<00:06:32.680> that<00:06:32.800> for<00:06:33.070> like<00:06:33.220> so<00:06:33.610> long<00:06:33.640> I've

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
been wanting that for like so long I've

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.810 
been wanting that for like so long I've
been<00:06:34.090> on<00:06:34.300> YouTube<00:06:34.480> since<00:06:34.660> like<00:06:34.960> 2010<00:06:35.919> and<00:06:36.280> I've

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
been on YouTube since like 2010 and I've

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.550 
been on YouTube since like 2010 and I've
been<00:06:37.000> trying<00:06:37.300> to<00:06:37.360> get<00:06:37.570> these<00:06:37.750> thumbnails

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
been trying to get these thumbnails

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.890 
been trying to get these thumbnails
just<00:06:38.680> because<00:06:38.980> I<00:06:39.070> went<00:06:39.280> it's<00:06:39.850> just<00:06:40.060> a<00:06:40.389> lot<00:06:40.870> more

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
just because I went it's just a lot more

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.930 
just because I went it's just a lot more
easier<00:06:41.530> to<00:06:41.680> use<00:06:41.800> those<00:06:41.980> thumbnails<00:06:42.460> and<00:06:42.730> just

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
easier to use those thumbnails and just

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.420 
easier to use those thumbnails and just
because<00:06:43.389> like<00:06:43.720> in<00:06:43.900> my<00:06:43.990> last<00:06:44.230> I<00:06:44.620> don't<00:06:45.040> know<00:06:45.160> 10

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
because like in my last I don't know 10

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.970 
because like in my last I don't know 10
videos<00:06:45.880> or<00:06:46.060> so<00:06:46.240> I<00:06:46.450> figured<00:06:47.410> out<00:06:47.530> if<00:06:47.680> you<00:06:47.800> just

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
videos or so I figured out if you just

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.430 
videos or so I figured out if you just
put<00:06:48.250> like<00:06:48.370> an<00:06:48.639> image<00:06:49.330> for<00:06:49.600> two<00:06:49.810> minutes<00:06:50.169> at<00:06:50.350> the

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
put like an image for two minutes at the

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.110 
put like an image for two minutes at the
end<00:06:50.590> of<00:06:50.710> each<00:06:50.860> video<00:06:51.160> you<00:06:51.790> will<00:06:51.940> get<00:06:52.000> that

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
end of each video you will get that

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.840 
end of each video you will get that
thumbnail<00:06:52.450> because<00:06:53.050> it<00:06:53.200> like<00:06:53.700> thinks<00:06:54.700> that's

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
thumbnail because it like thinks that's

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.159 
thumbnail because it like thinks that's
part<00:06:55.120> of<00:06:55.150> the<00:06:55.270> video<00:06:55.510> you<00:06:55.600> know<00:06:55.750> what<00:06:55.780> I<00:06:55.900> mean
