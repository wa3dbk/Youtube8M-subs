now<00:00:27.689> couple<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.680> things<00:00:28.830> were<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:29.189> really

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
now couple of things were going really

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.569 
now couple of things were going really
quick<00:00:29.580> make<00:00:30.150> sure<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.579> Minecraft

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
quick make sure you have the Minecraft

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.400 
quick make sure you have the Minecraft
version<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.940> has<00:00:32.969> java<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:34.320> I'm

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
version that has java in it what I'm

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.990 
version that has java in it what I'm
finding<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.640> there's<00:00:35.820> two

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
finding out is that there's two

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.850 
finding out is that there's two
different<00:00:36.149> kinds<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.570> Minecraft<00:00:36.930> now<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.350> guess

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
different kinds of Minecraft now I guess

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.000 
different kinds of Minecraft now I guess
Microsoft<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> when<00:00:39.960> they<00:00:40.050> took<00:00:40.230> over<00:00:40.440> or

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
Microsoft so when they took over or

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.950 
Microsoft so when they took over or
maybe<00:00:41.730> unless<00:00:41.969> mojang<00:00:42.480> had<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
maybe unless mojang had this and it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.740 
maybe unless mojang had this and it
works<00:00:43.140> they<00:00:43.770> took<00:00:43.950> something<00:00:44.370> off<00:00:44.629> they<00:00:45.629> took

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
works they took something off they took

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
works they took something off they took
Java<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.649> situation<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.460> can

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
Java out of the situation so you can

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.049 
Java out of the situation so you can
what<00:00:48.450> minecraft<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.260> computers<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.520> aren't

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
what minecraft on computers that aren't

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.119 
what minecraft on computers that aren't
like<00:00:51.300> more<00:00:51.600> powerful<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.680> if<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.829> download

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129

77 those files they they help transfer

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010 
77 those files they they help transfer
large<00:01:20.220> files<00:01:20.340> make<00:01:20.880> them<00:01:21.000> small<00:01:21.270> files<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
large files make them small files and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.179 
large files make them small files and
sometimes<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.500> need<00:01:22.590> them<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> move<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.159> of

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189

instead<00:05:34.979> so<00:05:35.979> dot<00:05:36.250> minecraft<00:05:36.669> right<00:05:36.910> and

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
instead so dot minecraft right and

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.750 
instead so dot minecraft right and
double<00:05:37.960> click<00:05:38.020> on<00:05:38.200> that<00:05:38.430> put<00:05:39.430> that<00:05:39.460> to<00:05:39.729> the

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
double click on that put that to the

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.130 
double click on that put that to the
side<00:05:40.950> open<00:05:41.950> up<00:05:42.039> your<00:05:42.190> minecraft<00:05:42.660> now<00:05:43.660> you<00:05:43.720> can

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
side open up your minecraft now you can

type<00:05:44.380> in<00:05:44.590> this<00:05:44.740> manually<00:05:45.310> but<00:05:45.490> I<00:05:45.550> think<00:05:45.760> it's

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
type in this manually but I think it's

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.790 
type in this manually but I think it's
easier<00:05:46.210> if<00:05:46.300> it<00:05:46.419> just<00:05:46.570> goes<00:05:46.720> in<00:05:46.900> there<00:05:47.050> so<00:05:47.740> you

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
easier if it just goes in there so you

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.310
