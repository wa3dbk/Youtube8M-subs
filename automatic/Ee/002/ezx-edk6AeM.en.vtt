it'll<00:00:45.420> begin<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.780> effervesce<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.590> the

it'll begin to effervesce and the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.180 
it'll begin to effervesce and the
chemical<00:00:47.340> reacts<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> crystal<00:00:48.870> and

chemical reacts with the crystal and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.640

now since chemical only works on what it
can<00:01:20.940> touch<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.510> let<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:25.020> dwell

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
on here a little bit and maybe we need

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.440 
on here a little bit and maybe we need
to<00:01:27.960> use<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:30.260> brown<00:01:31.260> or<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.680> white<00:01:32.369> scuff<00:01:32.760> pad<00:01:35.450> to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
working with HSR 100 is as it warms up

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.950 
working with HSR 100 is as it warms up
it<00:02:36.310> gets<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.520> little<00:02:36.700> bit<00:02:36.910> tacky<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.600> skin

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:59.260 
lubricant you can actually add some
water<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:50.740> surface

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.970 

okay

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:18.480 

then<00:03:04.879> go<00:03:05.000> ahead<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.300> wash<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.659> off<00:03:05.900> now

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.980 

and<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:18.970> think<00:03:19.210> you'll<00:03:19.330> be<00:03:19.450> pretty<00:03:19.660> pleased

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
and I think you'll be pretty pleased

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.280 
and I think you'll be pretty pleased
with<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.260> results<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.770> this<00:03:21.450> all<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.780> hard

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
with the results of this all that hard

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.450 
with the results of this all that hard
water<00:03:23.590> scale<00:03:24.810> should<00:03:25.810> be<00:03:25.960> gone<00:03:29.130> take<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.160> dry

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
water scale should be gone take a dry

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:53.040 
water scale should be gone take a dry
towel

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.050 

now<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.680> little<00:03:53.980> bit<00:03:54.160> of<00:03:54.280> this<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.520> still<00:03:54.790> stuck

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
now a little bit of this is still stuck

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.480 
now a little bit of this is still stuck
on<00:03:55.210> here<00:03:55.450> from<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:55.750> chemicals<00:03:56.260> -<00:03:56.440> we'll<00:03:56.620> get

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
on here from the chemicals - we'll get

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.020 
on here from the chemicals - we'll get
that<00:03:57.730> off<00:03:57.940> too

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
that off too

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.370 
that off too
a<00:04:00.350> bit<00:04:01.350> more<00:04:01.530> freshwater<00:04:02.870> but<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:03.990> can<00:04:04.110> see<00:04:04.290> it

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
a bit more freshwater but you can see it

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.840 
a bit more freshwater but you can see it
doesn't<00:04:04.560> take<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.860> long<00:04:05.069> in<00:04:05.610> most

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
doesn't take that long in most

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.260 
doesn't take that long in most
situations<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:07.680> remove<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.190> water<00:04:08.700> scaling

stuck<00:05:24.190> restored<00:05:24.669> and<00:05:24.970> enhanced<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:27.250> I<00:05:27.280> think

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
stuck restored and enhanced so I think

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.920 
stuck restored and enhanced so I think
that's<00:05:27.550> a<00:05:27.610> pretty<00:05:27.759> compelling<00:05:27.940> demonstration

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
that's a pretty compelling demonstration
