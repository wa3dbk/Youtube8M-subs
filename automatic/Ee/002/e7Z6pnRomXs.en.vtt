00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
exactly as advertised now as far as the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.210 
exactly as advertised now as far as the
taste<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:04.780> texture<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.470> eggs<00:02:05.650> it<00:02:06.010> tastes

fried on the stove but with no butter or
grease<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:11.710> guess<00:02:12.430> it's<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.850> little<00:02:13.120> healthier

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
grease I guess it's a little healthier

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.660 
grease I guess it's a little healthier
than<00:02:14.020> frying<00:02:14.380> on<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.710> stove<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.220> one<00:02:15.430> thing

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
than frying on the stove the one thing

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.310 
than frying on the stove the one thing
that's<00:02:15.910> worth<00:02:16.060> mentioning<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.140> isn't

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
that's worth mentioning is this isn't

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.970 
that's worth mentioning is this isn't
exactly<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:18.160> new<00:02:18.250> idea<00:02:19.030> as<00:02:19.440> ceramic<00:02:20.440> bowls<00:02:20.680> have

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
existed for a long time I guess this is

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.750
