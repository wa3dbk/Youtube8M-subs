00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.720
 my get that crooked what the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.849
 coffee on one side over the edge of it 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.099
 and that you risk that morning 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.929
 wakes up such a familiar head 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:19.410
 wrong side I put you 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.970
 No matter what your level is a 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.640
 curve can be horizontal in two directions 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.099
 stand in the width direction 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.080
 and always start in the longitudinal direction 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.080
 straightening in the width direction 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.719
 have just seen that this is the low 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.790
 side of the caravan 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.820
 means that this should go up here that 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.260
 you can do it by driving it here 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.640
 this is weighing are special 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.039
 made 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.350
 worming this side with wanting one 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.390
 level up 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.949
 never use the swivel supports on the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.469
 sit in the right-hand side of the caravan 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.910
 because they are not in fact you 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.300
 causes great tensions in that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.489
 builders you are going to try well that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.719
 up here so you can do the mover 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.850
 use 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.920
 but suppose I have your heijboer and there 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.049
 is not enough room for the caravan full 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.430
 car pulling up 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.600
 there is another trick where are you 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.500
 can do 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.040
 how you are with 2 people are nobody 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.250
 that can is blocked with two wicher 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.250
 pattje more wide and draw towards you 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.550
 then the parking brake and then this would be 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.110
 the leveling 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.570
 disadvantage quite pricey and heavy in weight 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.210
 while a road in light in weight and 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.220
 not so expensive 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.900
 your tv stress disadvantage often with his 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.440
 the two must have just been around 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.140
 keep him in place and with this 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.119
 can already be used with wax queer power 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.630
 will always be on the cross 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.630
 stand handbrake 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.120
 now it's a matter of turning to you 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.500
 at the correct height is about 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.130
 provably work even when standing 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.130
 if it really is not 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:21.099
 still this type and wheel key 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.099
 I remember doing so 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.890
 the best place for the spirit level is on the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.320
 The floor of the caravan has the out of the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.890
 only places you can be sure of 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.930
 that flat is good caravan 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.730
 you level it lengthwise 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.700
 with the nose wheel 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.190
 to the right in such a low sum is up 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.020
 In this case , young people should be with 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.590
 two are the question that your partner of the 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.620
 print 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.610
 the spirit level is okay 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.610
 and then you will have to do it yourself 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.769
 ok we are horizontal in width 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.780
 and horizontally level 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.769
 now we will print the supports so that 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.250
 the caravan 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.250
 not wobbling 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.370
 turning out the support is no 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.900
 nice job 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.420
 you have to bend over the thickers 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.800
 our drive like all of these were there too 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.650
 cordless drill 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.910
 a handy alternative once again this 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.440
 accessories simply in the caravan trade 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.840
 obtainable disadvantage of it 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.370
 especially the powerful ones below 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.230
 the cordless drills that you put in the caravan 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.700
 too much on tilt 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.590
 therefore some tension in that 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.100
 entails building 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:53.240
 therefore turn it all the way to the ground and 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:55.040
 then the last two strokes it in hand 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.190
 was a processed 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.190
 this is how we started now we are so loose
