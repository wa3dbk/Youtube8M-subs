00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
armies are basically the same tree

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.850 
armies are basically the same tree
didn't<00:00:12.809> know<00:00:12.929> all<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> maps<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
didn't know all the maps in the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.070 
didn't know all the maps in the
tiebreaker<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.240> he<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:15.420> suggested<00:00:15.929> rice

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
tiebreaker and so he just suggested rice

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.990 
tiebreaker and so he just suggested rice
fields<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.710> Prince<00:00:17.369> was<00:00:17.520> ok<00:00:17.699> with<00:00:17.820> that

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
fields and Prince was ok with that

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.700 
fields and Prince was ok with that
so<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.330> guess<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.990> know<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.289> don't<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:19.560> care

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
so I guess you know I don't really care

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.830 
so I guess you know I don't really care
I<00:00:19.770> guess<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.070> don't<00:00:20.250> care<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.580> too<00:00:20.760> so

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
I guess I don't care of that too so

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
I guess I don't care of that too so
whatever<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.199> would<00:00:22.830> rather<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.310> be<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
whatever I would rather it be the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.179 
whatever I would rather it be the
choices<00:00:24.449> from<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.630> mass<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.109> again<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.010> don't

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
choices from the mass but again I don't

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.910 
choices from the mass but again I don't
really<00:00:26.670> care<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:26.880> much<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.449> anyway<00:00:27.960> tree<00:00:28.650> has

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
really care that much so anyway tree has

with the new da cheese and the katanas
and<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> big<00:00:33.540> Calvary<00:00:33.930> component<00:00:34.410> while

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and a big Calvary component while

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.250

wall<00:00:37.410> again<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.640> pretty<00:00:39.300> much<00:00:39.480> exactly

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
wall again and it's pretty much exactly

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.229 
wall again and it's pretty much exactly
the<00:00:40.079> same<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> was<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.010> think<00:00:41.610> he<00:00:41.850> might<00:00:42.090> only

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the same as it was I think he might only

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.420 
the same as it was I think he might only
have<00:00:42.480> one<00:00:42.989> match<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.649> time<00:00:44.070> instead<00:00:44.309> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
have one match like this time instead of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.660 
have one match like this time instead of
two<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.930> basically<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> same<00:00:46.670> trees

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
two but it's basically the same trees

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.490 
two but it's basically the same trees
armies<00:00:47.940> basically<00:00:48.270> same<00:00:48.450> as<00:00:48.570> well<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.960> another

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
armies basically same as well so another

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920 
armies basically same as well so another
gonna<00:00:49.710> wasting<00:00:49.980> time<00:00:50.070> there<00:00:50.340> oh<00:00:50.840> there's<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
gonna wasting time there oh there's the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.360 
gonna wasting time there oh there's the
second<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.680> probably<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.070> pretty<00:00:53.250> much

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
second one so it probably is pretty much

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.729 
second one so it probably is pretty much
the<00:00:53.520> same<00:00:53.640> army<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.930> time<00:00:55.140> pressure

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the same army but this time pressure

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.290 
the same army but this time pressure
prince<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.129> moving<00:00:56.430> out<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> middle<00:00:57.030> so

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
prince is moving out to the middle so

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.250 
prince is moving out to the middle so
