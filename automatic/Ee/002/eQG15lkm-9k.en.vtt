 communities to do regulation 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.719
 world arms trade 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.370
 The contract concerns the export of ordinary 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.059
 weapons including reactive 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.860

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.080
 warships tanks as well 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.180
 small arms but the document is not 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.100
 enforcement mechanism is established 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.900
 how well will he act 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.720
 depends on the will of the main world 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.789
 exporters here is their list for us 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.699
 accounting for 30 percent of the global market 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.030

 to germany france china 76 and five 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.899
 percent respectively numbers 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.760
 represented by the Stockholm international 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.770
 World Studies Institute 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.320
 This is data for the last four years. 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.719
 It is worth noting that the total world 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.020
 arms market 70 billion dollars 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.670
 and 4 of the world's 5 largest exporters 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.160
 permanent members of the un security council 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.410
 two of them abstained from voting 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.120
 this is russia and china they celebrate 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.370
 lack of clarity of language 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.590
 contract in the part where it says 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.750
 that before selling weapons must be 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.270
 an assessment of risks and situations 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.010
 human rights are supposed to bind 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.080
 selling weapons from reputable countries 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.790
 human rights buyers what 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.040
 may seem like a good idea 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.720
 but then the question is 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.640
 whether for example bahrain or 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.250
 immaculate reputation of saudi arabia 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.960
 in human rights this way 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.430
 the contract leaves a lot of room for 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.320
 different interpretations 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.570
 Russia which, in principle, supports 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.080
 the desire to regulate the trading market 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.270
 weapons 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.159
 stated that she abstained from voting 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.829
 under the contract because it is not registered 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.119
 ban on the sale of weapons 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.369
 non-state subject and appeals 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.530
 did not find many states 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.570
 repelling the arms ban 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.240
 unauthorized non-state 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.130
 subject is a large system gap 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.729
 which will inevitably affect 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.590
 performance efficiency mdt 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.780
 although the United States supported the treaty 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.280
 Congress made it clear that it would not allow 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.380
 indicate to whom they can sell 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.420
 weapon a similar situation 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.619
 sometime with the Kiev protocol which 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.200
 imposes on developed countries 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.600
 greenhouse gas emission restrictions 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.069
 the united states also signed it but 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.259
 never ratified 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.140
 weapon manufacturers such as forehead 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.000
 hit martin or northrop groomman 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.860
 holds on the capitol hill a whole 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.600
 army of lobbyists to be sure that 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.250
 no one can limit them 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.680
 ability to sell weapons and 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.560
 receive from this income however thomas 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.640
 countryman assistant us secretary of state 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.800
 headed the American delegation on 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.900
 the negotiations made the defense of the contract 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.150
 noting that he will allow American 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.980
 weapons manufacturers quote become 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.730
 more competitive in the world 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.070
 the market 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.989
 possibly speaking for this contract 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.750
 the us government is trying in this way 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.520
 help their arms manufacturers in 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.890
 anyway the international community 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.900
 seems to agree on one thing 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.060
 do something with the unrelenting flow 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.450
 sales in the world but the devil as they say 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.019
 lies in the details of the grinevich ocean rt
