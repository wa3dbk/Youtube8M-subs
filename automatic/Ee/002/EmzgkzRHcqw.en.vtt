00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.760

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.050

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.020
 that my parents the truth because they have 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.690
 supported much from the beginning and I started 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.220
 doing castings with 13 years and I 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.570
 jumped the cole could do castings 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.979
 but they told me thousands if you take the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.229
 notes that you have to take out and work in 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.940
 the school can do what you want and I 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.530
 They have always supported me and when they had me 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.690
 to take to such a site because he could not 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.640
