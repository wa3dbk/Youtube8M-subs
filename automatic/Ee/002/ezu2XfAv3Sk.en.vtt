00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.204
MARY MURPHY: I don't think
there's anybody out of the Top

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:04.870
20 that we'd like
to see go home.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.300
We just had to make
some decisions.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.980
I definitely think the second
dance in this type of format

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.030
enables us to make a good
decision because we're making

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.350
these decisions in a short
period of time,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.520
you know what I mean?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.540
So that really helped us.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.750
I think, as we go along, though,
we're definitely going

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.920
to have to see people dance for
their life because I think

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.200
it's going to get tighter and
tighter, and more difficult

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.330
for all of us to agree,
unless somebody has a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.830
super bad night dancing.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.500
ADAM SHANKMAN: Every week
somebody's got to go.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.230
And so you have to look at what
America did, see what the

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.280
choreographers said, see who's
performing in rehearsal, and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.600
really take into account
what every vote means.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.480
NIGEL LYTHGOE: It isn't a
question of America didn't

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.480
connect with you.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.190
It is the choreographers, the
judges, all believe that you

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.780
are a fantastic dancer.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.870
That's what they should take
home in their hearts.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.680
DANIEL BAKER: We knew four
people were going home, but I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.610
tried to shut that
out of my mind.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.960
NICK BLOXSOM-CARTER: Luckily,
the judges told us who were in

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.750
the bottom three after we danced
because it was before,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.800
that would have been terrible.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.545
We all knew there was going to
be four leaving, but like

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:13.915
Daniel said, you just got to
keep that in the back of your

00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:15.700
mind and you've gotta
just bring it.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.860
You always have to bring
it the best you can

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.750
with what you have.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.100
ALEXA ANDERSON: We go through
the whole entire thing not

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.225
really knowing right up to the
very end if we're going to do

00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:25.100
a solo or not, if we're getting
voted off or not.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.850
I think everybody was kind
of nervous about that.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.380
But I wouldn't say that it
affected our performance too

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.610
much just because you have to
take one thing at the time.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.020
JANAYA FRENCH: I definitely made
sure, at the beginning of

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.990
the show, I wasn't focused on
the end because in between

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.240
there I had to do a performance
and it had to be

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.160
good in case I was safe.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.750
And people are voting on that.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.630
So I took it like this half
and then after that.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.920
I was kind of relaxed, though,
because I felt I did good.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.950
And I was just happy.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.920
And then they put you on stage
and it's back to reality.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.880
I don't think it affected our
performance, but it's been on

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.360
everybody's mind all day long.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.150
DANIEL BAKER: The judges didn't
feel a connection

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.660
between us.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.860
That's something maybe we
need to work on, but I

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.420
gave it my best shot.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.539
I put everything
I had in to it.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.400
NICK BLOXSOM-CARTER: I had
ballroom both weeks, and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.550
honestly, I think it hurt me
a little bit just because I

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.630
wanted to get out in
my other styles.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.090
And what set me apart from the
other ballroom dancers in

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.600
Vegas, which they did show, I
excelled in the other styles

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.320
and that's what separated me.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.360
So I was really looking forward
to do other styles on

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.830
the show, but I wasn't
able to.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.770
ALEXA ANDERSON: In this show,
you're put through so much,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.880
and you really learn how strong
you really are and just

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.160
how much you can
push yourself.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.100
And I think I just learned to
just kind of be a little bit

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.060
more fearless and just go for
things and just see what

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.660
happens and just really put
yourself out there.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.410
JANAYA FRENCH: I don't regret
anything that I did or

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.990
anything that happened because
it was all meant to be part of

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.950
the experience.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.490
So it's not worth dwelling on
what you think could have

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.050
changed because it's just
gonna eat at us.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.700
Now it's just in America's
hands, and it's really out of

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.530
our control.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.350
We give everything we can, and
it's just up to other people

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.370
to decide the outcome.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.650
TABITHA DUMO: Everybody there
is very, very talented.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.640
And it's just the circumstances
of the week,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.530
it's the circumstances of
the style that you got.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.730
If say, they were dealt a
different card it could have

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.120
fallen into a different place.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.450
So if you beat yourself up too
much about it, you tear

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.780
yourself down, and then you
can't take the next battle.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.000
You got to be ready for
the next battle.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.270
NAPOLEON DUMO: And it's not the
end of the world for them

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.170
dancing professionally.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.220
I mean, look how many dancers
that have never won, Twitch

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.070
didn't win that was on tonight,
Kayla, Jason, Tony.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.740
Tony was in our number got
kicked out the first week.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.820
He's doing really good.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.570
Catherine did not win.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.650
I mean, there's a ton of them.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.610
TWITCH: No matter what,
you have to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.090
hit the ground running.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.250
No matter when you're
eliminated, you have to use

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.510
everything that's come to you as
a platform, even if you're

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.270
one week on the show, that's
one week of being on So You

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.620
Think You Can Dance.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.920
You have to keep your focus up,
and you have to hit the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.490
ground running and continue
to create

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.050
opportunities for yourself.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.380
Nothing's going to be brought
to you just because

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.070
you're on the show.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.740
What's going on?

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.290
This is Stephen "Twitch" Boss
and you are watching DanceOn.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.510
Don't watch anything else.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.630
But if you do, just come back
and watch DanceOn some more.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.530
That's it.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.303
