release<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.640> come<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.060> if<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.780> don't<00:02:04.110> do<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
release and come up if you don't do the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.700 
release and come up if you don't do the
release<00:02:04.860> part<00:02:05.310> you'll<00:02:05.640> end<00:02:05.850> up<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.680> not<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
release part you'll end up with not a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.790 
release part you'll end up with not a
star<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.640> sort<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.360> point<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.470> want<00:02:10.709> to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
star but sort of a point so you want to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.590 
star but sort of a point so you want to
make<00:02:11.099> sure

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
make sure

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.720 
make sure
that<00:02:11.780> before<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.530> lift<00:02:12.830> your<00:02:13.130> bag<00:02:13.310> off<00:02:13.670> of

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
that before you lift your bag off of

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.180 
that before you lift your bag off of
that<00:02:14.330> paper<00:02:14.630> you've<00:02:15.170> released<00:02:15.710> all<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
that paper you've released all the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.930 
that paper you've released all the
pressure<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.760> come<00:02:17.480> up<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.110> squeeze<00:02:18.940> release

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
pressure and come up so squeeze release

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.250 
pressure and come up so squeeze release
and<00:02:20.300> up<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.940> then<00:02:22.940> what<00:02:23.300> we<00:02:23.420> want<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.690> do<00:02:23.900> is

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
and up and then what we want to do is

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.420 
and up and then what we want to do is
just<00:02:24.740> get<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.640> row<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:27.080> stars<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:27.980> are<00:02:28.190> all

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
just get a row of stars that are all

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.180 
just get a row of stars that are all
about<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.910> same<00:02:29.120> size<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.840> all<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.950> same

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
about the same size and all the same

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.610 
about the same size and all the same
shape<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:32.300> just<00:02:32.600> go<00:02:32.750> ahead<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.140> practice<00:02:33.590> that

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
shape so just go ahead and practice that

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.070 
shape so just go ahead and practice that
and<00:02:34.190> then<00:02:34.850> we'll<00:02:35.060> go<00:02:35.210> and<00:02:35.390> decorate<00:02:35.600> our

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
and then we'll go and decorate our

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.160 
and then we'll go and decorate our
cupcakes

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.509 

we<00:02:44.170> have<00:02:44.319> our<00:02:44.470> cupcakes<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.220> we're<00:02:45.370> going<00:02:45.489> to

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
we have our cupcakes and we're going to

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.149 
we have our cupcakes and we're going to
utilize<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.420> exact<00:02:46.870> same<00:02:47.230> method<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:48.040> we

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
utilize that exact same method that we

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.160 
utilize that exact same method that we
just<00:02:48.190> did<00:02:48.610> for<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:48.940> stars<00:02:49.239> but<00:02:49.959> we're<00:02:50.080> going

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
just did for the stars but we're going

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.830 
just did for the stars but we're going
to<00:02:50.230> do<00:02:50.379> a<00:02:50.409> continuous<00:02:51.209> rope<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
to do a continuous rope of the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.470 
to do a continuous rope of the
buttercream<00:02:53.349> around<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.370> top<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.640> our

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
buttercream around the top of our

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.080 
buttercream around the top of our
cupcakes<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:56.920> we're<00:02:57.010> going<00:02:57.099> to<00:02:57.220> start<00:02:57.640> at<00:02:57.940> the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
cupcakes so we're going to start at the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.670 
cupcakes so we're going to start at the
edge<00:02:58.269> here<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:59.019> we're<00:02:59.200> going<00:02:59.319> to<00:02:59.349> do<00:02:59.560> the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
edge here and we're going to do the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.789 
edge here and we're going to do the
pressure<00:03:00.069> all<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.459> way<00:03:01.299> around<00:03:01.799> keep

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
pressure all the way around keep

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.449 
pressure all the way around keep
applying<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.580> pressure<00:03:04.799> don't<00:03:05.799> let<00:03:06.190> up<00:03:06.340> on

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
applying that pressure don't let up on

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.339 
applying that pressure don't let up on
the<00:03:06.580> pressure<00:03:06.610> until<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.510> get<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.049> center

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
the pressure until you get to the center

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.610 
the pressure until you get to the center
and<00:03:08.860> then<00:03:09.670> we<00:03:09.879> release<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.390> pressure<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.230> up

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
and then we release the pressure and up

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.250 
and then we release the pressure and up
and<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.549> gives<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.909> a<00:03:12.940> really<00:03:13.510> nice<00:03:13.750> smooth

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
and that gives you a really nice smooth

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.759 
and that gives you a really nice smooth
coating<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.579> buttercream<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.360> go<00:03:17.170> all<00:03:17.410> the

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
coating of the buttercream so go all the

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:18.479 
coating of the buttercream so go all the
way<00:03:17.860> around

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
way around

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.059 
way around
I'm<00:03:18.819> using<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.329> fairly<00:03:19.690> small<00:03:20.260> star<00:03:20.680> tip<00:03:20.890> you

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
I'm using a fairly small star tip you

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.460 
I'm using a fairly small star tip you
could<00:03:21.220> use<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> much<00:03:21.849> larger<00:03:22.209> star<00:03:22.810> tip<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.290> do

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
could use a much larger star tip to do

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.960 
could use a much larger star tip to do
this<00:03:23.620> as<00:03:23.859> well<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:26.040> that's<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.310> that's<00:03:27.609> how

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
this as well and that's it that's how

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.610 
this as well and that's it that's how
we're<00:03:28.150> going<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.299> get<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.750> really<00:03:29.500> nice<00:03:29.769> base<00:03:30.310> of

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
we're going to get a really nice base of

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.099 
we're going to get a really nice base of
buttercream<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:32.950> then<00:03:33.670> we<00:03:33.819> could<00:03:34.120> leave<00:03:34.959> it

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
buttercream and then we could leave it

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.400 
buttercream and then we could leave it
at<00:03:35.260> this<00:03:35.500> or<00:03:35.859> put<00:03:36.069> sprinkles<00:03:36.430> on<00:03:36.790> here<00:03:37.180> or<00:03:37.410> even

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
at this or put sprinkles on here or even

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.339 
at this or put sprinkles on here or even
add<00:03:38.760> icing<00:03:39.760> rose<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.989> top<00:03:41.230> of<00:03:41.470> this<00:03:43.349> and

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
add icing rose to the top of this and

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.309 
add icing rose to the top of this and
that's<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.859> just<00:03:45.099> keep<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:46.420> pressure<00:03:46.720> really

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
that's it just keep the pressure really

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.800 
that's it just keep the pressure really
nice<00:03:47.889> and<00:03:48.250> even<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.060> then<00:03:49.440> at<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.560> very<00:03:50.590> end

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
nice and even and then at the very end

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.809 
nice and even and then at the very end
release<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:53.139> pressure<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.859> I'm<00:03:54.549> not

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
release that pressure and I'm not

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.569 
release that pressure and I'm not
squeezing<00:03:55.599> this<00:03:55.930> bag<00:03:56.169> I<00:03:56.470> just<00:03:56.889> actually<00:03:57.160> have

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
squeezing this bag I just actually have

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.110 
squeezing this bag I just actually have
my<00:03:57.819> fingertips<00:03:58.540> on<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.250> tip<00:04:00.250> on<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.669> bag<00:04:00.819> here

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
my fingertips on the tip on the bag here

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:09.910 
my fingertips on the tip on the bag here
just<00:04:01.389> to<00:04:01.569> steady<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:02.049> as<00:04:02.380> I<00:04:02.530> go<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:07.510> that's<00:04:07.569> it

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.479 

one<00:04:10.580> last<00:04:10.910> done<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:11.630> we're<00:04:11.810> all<00:04:12.050> set<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:15.489> so

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.990 
one last done and we're all set and so
you<00:04:16.549> have<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:16.790> very<00:04:17.209> nice<00:04:17.660> clean<00:04:18.760> cupcake<00:04:19.760> to

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
you have a very nice clean cupcake to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.729 
you have a very nice clean cupcake to
work<00:04:20.180> with<00:04:20.420> and<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:20.959> can<00:04:21.109> either<00:04:21.230> leave<00:04:21.560> it

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
work with and you can either leave it

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.470 
work with and you can either leave it
like<00:04:21.920> that<00:04:21.950> or<00:04:22.430> now<00:04:22.730> we<00:04:22.790> can<00:04:23.000> go<00:04:23.120> ahead<00:04:23.210> and

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
like that or now we can go ahead and

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.000 
like that or now we can go ahead and
