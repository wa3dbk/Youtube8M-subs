major<00:05:25.240> B<00:05:26.730> flat<00:05:27.730> major<00:05:28.450> I<00:05:33.840> kind<00:05:34.840> of<00:05:34.900> like<00:05:35.140> this

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
major B flat major I kind of like this

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:44.300 
major B flat major I kind of like this
sound<00:05:36.540> cuz<00:05:37.540> it's<00:05:37.720> a<00:05:37.810> little<00:05:37.840> more<00:05:38.440> snappy

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.470 

you<00:05:45.310> could<00:05:45.520> also<00:05:46.470> take<00:05:47.470> the<00:05:47.530> F<00:05:47.890> minor<00:05:48.250> here<00:05:49.210> if

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
you could also take the F minor here if

00:05:49.480 --> 00:06:06.090 
you could also take the F minor here if
you<00:05:49.690> wanted<00:05:49.930> to<00:05:50.080> with<00:05:50.200> the<00:05:50.320> fifth<00:05:50.590> string<00:06:05.100> the

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
you wanted to with the fifth string the

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.230 
you wanted to with the fifth string the
same<00:06:06.370> thing<00:06:06.700> with<00:06:06.880> that<00:06:07.060> second<00:06:07.720> verse<00:06:09.000> the<00:06:10.000> C

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
same thing with that second verse the C

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.120 
same thing with that second verse the C
B<00:06:10.870> flat<00:06:11.850> D<00:06:12.870> but<00:06:13.870> this<00:06:13.990> would<00:06:14.140> be<00:06:14.290> you<00:06:14.800> think<00:06:14.830> of

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
B flat D but this would be you think of

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:21.860 
B flat D but this would be you think of
it<00:06:15.250> as<00:06:15.400> eight<00:06:17.520> 610<00:06:18.520> okay<00:06:19.300> and<00:06:19.890> then<00:06:20.890> for<00:06:21.700> the

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
it as eight 610 okay and then for the

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.200 
it as eight 610 okay and then for the
bridge<00:06:22.870> its<00:06:23.500> F<00:06:23.860> minor

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.839 

and<00:06:27.210> then<00:06:27.629> to<00:06:27.810> e-flat<00:06:28.319> so<00:06:29.280> same<00:06:29.490> thing<00:06:29.520> you

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
and then to e-flat so same thing you

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.330 
and then to e-flat so same thing you
take<00:06:30.120> that<00:06:30.750> half<00:06:31.020> minor<00:06:31.349> get<00:06:31.949> on<00:06:32.129> the<00:06:32.190> way

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
take that half minor get on the way

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.040 
take that half minor get on the way
string<00:06:32.759> you<00:06:33.330> take<00:06:33.599> that<00:06:33.810> half<00:06:33.990> minor<00:06:34.259> here<00:06:34.940> and

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
string you take that half minor here and

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.860 
string you take that half minor here and
then<00:06:37.050> the<00:06:37.110> he<00:06:37.289> flat<00:06:37.590> here<00:06:38.069> if<00:06:38.909> you<00:06:39.300> want<00:06:39.629> a

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
then the he flat here if you want a

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.240 
then the he flat here if you want a
