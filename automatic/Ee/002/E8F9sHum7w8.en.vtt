hey YouTube to external max here they've

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.960 
hey YouTube to external max here they've
been<00:00:04.890> getting<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.130> lot<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.279> questions<00:00:05.730> asking

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
been getting a lot of questions asking

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.280 
been getting a lot of questions asking
me<00:00:06.299> about<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.930> exhaust<00:00:07.319> camp<00:00:09.019> some<00:00:10.019> people

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
me about the exhaust camp some people

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.320 
me about the exhaust camp some people
have<00:00:10.440> been<00:00:10.559> doing<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.920> cam<00:00:11.160> mod<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:12.179> have

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
have been doing the cam mod and have

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.640 
have been doing the cam mod and have
been<00:00:12.450> wondering<00:00:12.840> what<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.110> little<00:00:13.320> ball

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
been wondering what this little ball

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.990 
been wondering what this little ball
well<00:00:14.639> ball<00:00:14.910> bearing<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.929> their<00:00:16.440> camp<00:00:17.000> well

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
well ball bearing is in their camp well

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.029 
well ball bearing is in their camp well
so<00:00:18.180> ball<00:00:18.390> bearing<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.840> actually<00:00:19.470> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
so ball bearing is actually the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.250 
so ball bearing is actually the
decompression<00:00:20.810> when<00:00:21.810> you're<00:00:21.960> trying<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
decompression when you're trying to

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.120 
decompression when you're trying to
start<00:00:22.500> your<00:00:22.650> four-wheeler<00:00:23.510> as<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:25.439> rolls<00:00:25.680> past

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
start your four-wheeler as it rolls past

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.910 
start your four-wheeler as it rolls past
the<00:00:27.260> valve<00:00:28.260> cap<00:00:29.240> if<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:31.109> it's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the valve cap if you see here it's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.900 
the valve cap if you see here it's
slightly<00:00:33.559> sticking<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:34.710> more<00:00:35.100> than<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
slightly sticking out more than the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.720 
slightly sticking out more than the
actual<00:00:36.180> cam<00:00:36.480> lobe<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.950> causes<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.520> valve

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
actual cam lobe and it causes the valve

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.910 
actual cam lobe and it causes the valve
to<00:00:38.940> open<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.360> little<00:00:39.570> bit<00:00:39.690> releasing<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.440> little

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
to open a little bit releasing a little

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.510 
to open a little bit releasing a little
bit<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:42.030> compression<00:00:43.070> while<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.250> trying

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
bit of the compression while it's trying

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.139 
bit of the compression while it's trying
to<00:00:44.579> start<00:00:45.469> people<00:00:46.469> been<00:00:46.739> asking<00:00:46.890> well<00:00:47.640> they

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
to start people been asking well they

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.959 
to start people been asking well they
don't<00:00:48.420> move<00:00:48.829> when<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> push<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.820> move

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
don't move when I push on it don't move

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.439 
don't move when I push on it don't move
it's<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.960> going<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.649> move<00:00:52.890> until<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:54.180> cam

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it's not going to move until this cam

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's not going to move until this cam
starts<00:00:54.960> spinning<00:00:55.879> once<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> cam<00:00:57.270> starts

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
starts spinning once the cam starts

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.439 
starts spinning once the cam starts
spinning<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.410> your<00:00:59.039> engines<00:00:59.399> running<00:00:59.730> what

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
spinning and your engines running what

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.160 
spinning and your engines running what
happens<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.199> arm<00:01:01.500> pushes<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:03.170> causing

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
happens is this arm pushes out causing

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.520 
happens is this arm pushes out causing
the<00:01:04.619> bearing<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.339> go<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.170> here

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the bearing to go in so as you see here

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.030 
the bearing to go in so as you see here
if<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.890> release<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.400> arm<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.270> comes<00:01:09.479> back<00:01:10.040> push

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
if I release the arm it comes back push

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.660 
if I release the arm it comes back push
the<00:01:11.189> arm<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.640> goes<00:01:11.820> down<00:01:13.340> that's<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.610> you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the arm and goes down that's how you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.060 
the arm and goes down that's how you
tell<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.290> working<00:01:16.619> properly

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
tell if it's you know working properly

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.850 
tell if it's you know working properly
also<00:01:17.520> because<00:01:17.880> uh<00:01:18.049> one<00:01:19.049> person<00:01:19.229> has<00:01:19.530> asked<00:01:19.770> me

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
also because uh one person has asked me

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.810 
also because uh one person has asked me
while<00:01:20.580> mine<00:01:20.820> don't<00:01:21.060> move<00:01:21.240> at<00:01:21.420> all<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.700> how

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
while mine don't move at all this is how

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600 
while mine don't move at all this is how
you<00:01:23.880> check<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.170> works<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:26.310> move

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
you check to see if it works just move

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.999 
you check to see if it works just move
this<00:01:26.820> arm<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.900> should<00:01:28.200> fall<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.680> should<00:01:28.829> go

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
this arm out it should fall it should go

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.730 
this arm out it should fall it should go
right<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.659> release<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.930> should<00:01:31.560> come<00:01:31.710> right

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
right in release it should come right

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.050 
right in release it should come right
back<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:33.229> as<00:01:34.229> long<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.280> bearing<00:01:35.729> moves

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
back out as long as that bearing moves

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.219 
back out as long as that bearing moves
when<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.570> arm<00:01:36.810> moves<00:01:37.110> your<00:01:37.979> cams<00:01:38.280> are<00:01:38.579> right

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
when this arm moves your cams are right

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.740 
when this arm moves your cams are right
what<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.799> centrifugal<00:01:41.280> force<00:01:41.750> spins

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
what it is it's centrifugal force spins

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.850 
what it is it's centrifugal force spins
the<00:01:42.990> weight<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.460> arm<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:45.590> causing<00:01:46.590> that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the weight of this arm out causing that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.580 
the weight of this arm out causing that
to<00:01:46.920> go<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.729> causing<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.229> run<00:01:49.409> normally

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
to go in and causing it to run normally

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.499 
to go in and causing it to run normally
now<00:01:51.159> I<00:01:51.189> hope<00:01:51.430> this<00:01:51.579> answer<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.030> question<00:01:52.360> is

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
now I hope this answer the question is

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.800 
now I hope this answer the question is
for<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.020> people<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.530> we're<00:01:53.829> asking<00:01:54.810> again

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
for the people that we're asking again

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.920 
for the people that we're asking again
if<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:56.380> does<00:01:56.799> not<00:01:57.040> move<00:01:57.460> or<00:01:58.119> this<00:01:58.360> arm<00:01:58.630> does

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
if this does not move or this arm does

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.139 
if this does not move or this arm does
not<00:01:59.110> move<00:01:59.549> you<00:02:00.549> need<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.850> replace<00:02:01.060> your

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
not move you need to replace your

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.310 
not move you need to replace your
exhaust<00:02:01.720> camp

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
exhaust camp

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.410 
exhaust camp
that<00:02:03.039> means<00:02:03.250> there's<00:02:03.549> something<00:02:03.970> wrong<00:02:04.180> with

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
that means there's something wrong with

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.020 
that means there's something wrong with
the<00:02:04.539> mechanism<00:02:04.689> in<00:02:05.229> here<00:02:05.590> there's<00:02:06.580> no<00:02:06.759> real

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
the mechanism in here there's no real

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.759 
the mechanism in here there's no real
way<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.299> repair<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:10.530> basically<00:02:11.530> when<00:02:11.739> it

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
way to repair it basically when it

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.650 
way to repair it basically when it
happens<00:02:12.340> it's<00:02:12.610> it's<00:02:12.970> junk

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
happens it's it's junk

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.940 
happens it's it's junk
so<00:02:15.120> again<00:02:16.120> just<00:02:16.870> move<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:17.319> back<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.830> forth

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
so again just move this back and forth

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.710 
so again just move this back and forth
you<00:02:18.340> should<00:02:18.580> see<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.940> bearing<00:02:19.239> move<00:02:19.480> when

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
you should see the bearing move when

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.100 
you should see the bearing move when
you're<00:02:19.840> doing<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.209> doesn't<00:02:22.660> move<00:02:22.840> or

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
you're doing that if it doesn't move or

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.840 
you're doing that if it doesn't move or
this<00:02:23.290> arm<00:02:23.530> doesn't<00:02:23.890> move<00:02:24.069> you<00:02:24.519> have<00:02:24.700> to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
this arm doesn't move you have to

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.660 
this arm doesn't move you have to
replace<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.269> your<00:02:25.780> camp<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:27.130> this<00:02:27.280> actually

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
replace you your camp but this actually

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.660 
replace you your camp but this actually
shows<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.120> what<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.769> what<00:02:29.769> that's<00:02:29.920> for<00:02:30.400> and

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
shows you what that what that's for and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.960 
shows you what that what that's for and
again<00:02:31.630> this<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:31.959> basically<00:02:32.200> just<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.970> release

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
again this is basically just to release

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.520 
again this is basically just to release
a<00:02:34.000> little<00:02:34.299> bit<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.720> compression<00:02:35.170> and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
a little bit of the compression and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.890 
a little bit of the compression and
there<00:02:35.709> when<00:02:35.860> it's<00:02:36.010> trying<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.370> start<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:36.940> hope

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
there when it's trying to start I hope

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.199 
there when it's trying to start I hope
