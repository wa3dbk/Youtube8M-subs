00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.960
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.220
 I am sorry that I haven’t filmed for a while. 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.220
 Because I have been too busy 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
 No time to take a movie 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.820
 I want to share my college life with you today. 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.180
 Next month, my university will hold a cultural season! 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.500
 Because it is an international university 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.260
 So there are international students from all over the world. 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.720
 The school said that I should prepare some traditional Canadian food. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 But... Canada 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.700
 No traditional cuisine... 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.080
 Canadians mostly come from European immigrants. 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.640
 For example, my family is from Hungary and the Netherlands 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.940
 Mainly eating Hungarian dishes at home 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.500
 and so... 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.500
 No traditional cuisine in Canada 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.120
 What should I do? 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.160
 but 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 I decided to do hot dog XD 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.320
 Although not a Canadian cuisine 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.600
 But it should sell well. We also eat it very often in Canada, so that's it! 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.220
 As for the money earned, all... 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.540
 I don't know how to use Japanese, so I changed to English, sorry. &lt; 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.660
 Earn money, all 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.740
 Will donate 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.680
 We will donate money to the Northeast 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.900
 Helping reconstruction after the earthquake 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.620
 Make a contribution to the people of the Northeast 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.480
 I will work hard 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.740
 In addition 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.180
 I bought a new textbook. 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.100
 This is this 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.540
 "Japanese Language Proficiency Test Policy N2 Grammar" 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820
 This is a book specifically for the N2 exam. 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.040
 There are many kinds, this is a grammar 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.900
 This is a single word 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.240
 Also...reading and Chinese characters 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.680
 I also booked the two books, but I haven’t come yet. 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.280
 I will probably arrive next week. 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.280
 This is better than the previous one 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.800
 So much! 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.880
 The explanation is very easy to understand 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:04.920
 In typesetting, each grammar focus will be accompanied by an example sentence description. 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.340
 I like it very much! 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.780
 Not only the N2 exam, but also everyday life. 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.640
 I am full of this book! 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.500
 Oh, I bought very handsome shoes in Tokyo. 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.180
 I like leopard prints very much, so happy ^0^ 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.180
 It is this pair! 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.820
 Handsome? 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.320
 And very cheap, around seven or eight thousand yen 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.340
 When I saw this pair, I didn't have my size, only the size of the queen. 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:52.700
 So I booked a pair and received ^0^ within a week. 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.340
 Leverse is a Converse 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.160
 I only saw this at ABC Mart. 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.580
 Share it here today, see you next time!
