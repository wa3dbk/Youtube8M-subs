tires and I'm gonna get these babies
mounted<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.380> my<00:00:13.500> car<00:00:13.820> so<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.940> get<00:00:15.030> started<00:00:15.179> what

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
mounted on my car so to get started what

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.570 
mounted on my car so to get started what
we<00:00:15.599> need<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.230> tire<00:00:16.500> pressure<00:00:16.710> sensor<00:00:17.160> you

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
we need is a tire pressure sensor you

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.040 
we need is a tire pressure sensor you
need<00:00:17.730> one<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> these<00:00:18.150> for<00:00:18.449> each<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.930> your

need one of these for each one of your

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.010 
need one of these for each one of your
wheels<00:00:19.340> so<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.550> consists<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
wheels so what it consists of is the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.580 
wheels so what it consists of is the
actual<00:00:22.380> sensor<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.910> washer<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.689> then

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
actual sensor you have a washer and then

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.390 
actual sensor you have a washer and then
you<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> nut

you have a nut
so<00:00:27.090> most<00:00:27.330> stock<00:00:27.539> wheels<00:00:27.810> nowadays<00:00:28.170> all<00:00:28.380> they

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
so most stock wheels nowadays all they

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.919 
so most stock wheels nowadays all they
have<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.429> these<00:00:29.609> tire<00:00:29.910> valves<00:00:30.240> now

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
have is one of these tire valves now

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.389 
have is one of these tire valves now
what<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.009> where<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.219> put<00:00:32.340> your

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
what this is this is where you put your

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.880 
what this is this is where you put your
air<00:00:32.640> inside<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:32.969> tire<00:00:33.320> now<00:00:34.320> most<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> time

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
air inside the tire now most of the time

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.290 
air inside the tire now most of the time
you'll<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.430> tire<00:00:35.610> pressure<00:00:35.880> sensor

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
you'll have the tire pressure sensor

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.990 
you'll have the tire pressure sensor
built<00:00:36.540> into<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:37.340> now<00:00:38.340> that's<00:00:38.579> different<00:00:38.820> for

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
built into this now that's different for

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.139 
built into this now that's different for
aftermarket<00:00:39.300> rims<00:00:40.100> because<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.340> has<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> 90

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
aftermarket rims because this has a 90

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.040 
aftermarket rims because this has a 90
degree<00:00:42.420> angle<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:44.190> valve<00:00:44.399> itself<00:00:45.050> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
degree angle in the valve itself you

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.479 
degree angle in the valve itself you
can't<00:00:46.260> put<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> tire<00:00:46.680> pressure<00:00:46.920> sensor<00:00:47.340> there

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
can't put a tire pressure sensor there

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.639 
can't put a tire pressure sensor there
and<00:00:47.700> make<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.000> look<00:00:48.210> at<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.510> same<00:00:48.690> time<00:00:48.899> so

sorry that where you mount your entire

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.479 
sorry that where you mount your entire
pressure<00:01:00.149> sensor<00:01:00.949> now<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.340> that

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
pressure sensor now you can see that

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.160 
pressure sensor now you can see that
there's<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> valve<00:01:02.910> right<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.989> top

is going to be installing one of these

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.920 
is going to be installing one of these
on<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.530> other<00:01:11.130> wheel<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> first<00:01:12.750> thing

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
on my other wheel so the first thing

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.730 
on my other wheel so the first thing
we're<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> we're<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.969 
we're going to do is we're going to
stall<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> little<00:01:14.070> mesh<00:01:14.580> mesh<00:01:15.240> cover<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.689> top<00:01:15.979> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
stall a little mesh mesh cover on top to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.350 
stall a little mesh mesh cover on top to
protect<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> chrome<00:01:17.700> lip<00:01:17.909> from<00:01:18.150> being

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
protect the chrome lip from being

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.820 
protect the chrome lip from being
scratched<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.869> when<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.229> flip<00:01:19.380> over<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> wheel

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
scratched up when we flip over the wheel

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.390 
scratched up when we flip over the wheel
you<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:20.790> your<00:01:20.939> rim<00:01:21.979> flip<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> over<00:01:23.220> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
you can get your rim flip it over and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.719 
you can get your rim flip it over and
position<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.439> access<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.189> this

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
position it so you have access to this

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.120 
position it so you have access to this
little<00:01:27.000> plug<00:01:27.240> core<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.110> they<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.409> built

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
little plug core that they have built

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.950 
little plug core that they have built
into<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> wheel<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.479> we're<00:01:30.630> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> grab

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
into the wheel do is we're going to grab

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.260 
into the wheel do is we're going to grab
a<00:01:30.990> 12<00:01:31.350> millett<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.220> we're<00:01:32.850> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> start

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
a 12 millett and we're going to start

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
a 12 millett and we're going to start
taking<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.750> soap

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.440 

so<00:01:48.290> basically<00:01:48.680> what<00:01:48.890> this<00:01:49.040> plug<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:52.120> a<00:01:53.120> cap

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
so basically what this plug is is a cap

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.450 
so basically what this plug is is a cap
and<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:56.240> screw<00:01:56.510> with<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.750> seal<00:01:57.050> on<00:01:57.080> it<00:01:57.460> nobody's

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
and a screw with a seal on it nobody's

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.710 
and a screw with a seal on it nobody's
going<00:01:58.580> what<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.760> does<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.000> just<00:01:59.180> holds<00:01:59.480> the<00:01:59.570> air

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
going what it does is just holds the air

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.170 
going what it does is just holds the air
inside<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.470> tire<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.010> it<00:02:01.640> doesn't<00:02:01.880> allow<00:02:02.000> air

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
inside the tire and it doesn't allow air

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.550 
inside the tire and it doesn't allow air
to<00:02:02.210> come<00:02:02.390> out<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:02.930> we're<00:02:03.050> going<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.230> replace

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
to come out so we're going to replace

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.140 
to come out so we're going to replace
this<00:02:03.950> with<00:02:05.740> one<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.830> these<00:02:06.920> sensors<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:11.030> we're

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
this with one of these sensors so we're

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.600 
this with one of these sensors so we're
going<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.330> put<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.540> nut<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:13.100> stem<00:02:13.310> aside

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
going to put the nut and the stem aside

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.520 
going to put the nut and the stem aside
but<00:02:13.790> what<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.090> need<00:02:14.270> from<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.990> this

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
but what we need from this is this

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.200 
but what we need from this is this
little<00:02:15.680> seal<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.640> we're<00:02:16.730> going<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.880> take<00:02:17.030> that

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
little seal so we're going to take that

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.990 
little seal so we're going to take that
off<00:02:17.420> we're<00:02:18.260> going<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.440> save<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.010> we're

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
off we're going to save this and we're

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.280 
off we're going to save this and we're
going<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.150> use<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:20.510> with<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.900> tire<00:02:21.050> pressure

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
going to use this with the tire pressure

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.200 
going to use this with the tire pressure
sensor<00:02:21.680> now<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.400> very<00:02:22.610> crucial<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:23.030> keep

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
sensor now it's very crucial to keep

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.440 
sensor now it's very crucial to keep
this<00:02:23.420> seal<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.830> tire<00:02:25.070> can<00:02:26.060> hold<00:02:26.330> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
this seal so the tire can hold the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.210 
this seal so the tire can hold the
pressure<00:02:26.690> once<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.170> put<00:02:27.350> air<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.100> what

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
pressure once you put air in it so what

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.020 
pressure once you put air in it so what
we're<00:02:28.310> going<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.460> do<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.640> we're<00:02:28.730> going<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.910> grab

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
we're going to do is we're going to grab

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.900 
we're going to do is we're going to grab
this<00:02:29.210> put<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.930> back<00:02:30.080> side<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:33.910> then

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
this put it on the back side and then

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.530 
this put it on the back side and then
start<00:02:35.180> taking<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:35.570> apart<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.000> got<00:02:38.450> to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
start taking this apart so you got to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.440 
start taking this apart so you got to
take<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.780> cap<00:02:39.290> off<00:02:40.870> take<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.990> washer<00:02:42.320> off<00:02:42.440> and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
take the cap off take the washer off and

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.210 
take the cap off take the washer off and
then<00:02:44.450> you're<00:02:44.570> going<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.750> position<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:46.010> tire

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
then you're going to position the tire

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.960 
then you're going to position the tire
pressure<00:02:46.490> sensor<00:02:46.880> inside<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.570> wheel<00:02:48.970> so

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
pressure sensor inside the wheel so

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.640 
pressure sensor inside the wheel so
you're<00:02:50.060> going<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.209> position<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.750> slide<00:02:51.500> it

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
you're going to position it and slide it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.690 
you're going to position it and slide it
right<00:02:51.680> through<00:02:52.209> like<00:02:53.209> this<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:54.580> then<00:02:55.580> you're

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
right through like this and then you're

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.460 
right through like this and then you're
going<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.850> put<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.060> washer<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:57.080> cap<00:02:57.260> back

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
going to put the washer and the cap back

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.780 
going to put the washer and the cap back
on<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:57.950> what<00:02:58.100> this<00:02:58.190> looks<00:02:58.370> like<00:02:58.459> from<00:02:58.670> a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
on so what this looks like from a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.820 
on so what this looks like from a
different<00:02:58.940> angle<00:02:59.180> is<00:02:59.420> the<00:03:00.410> tire<00:03:00.590> pressure

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
different angle is the tire pressure

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.990 
different angle is the tire pressure
sensor<00:03:01.160> here<00:03:01.370> you're<00:03:01.670> just<00:03:01.850> going<00:03:01.970> to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
sensor here you're just going to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.860 
sensor here you're just going to
basically<00:03:02.120> find<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.780> hole<00:03:04.480> put<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.600> in<00:03:05.690> and

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
basically find the hole put it in and

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.750 
basically find the hole put it in and
you're<00:03:06.020> going<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.170> get<00:03:06.320> your<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:07.160> washer<00:03:07.580> and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
you're going to get your the washer and

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.790 
you're going to get your the washer and
the<00:03:08.450> cap<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:08.900> you're<00:03:09.080> going<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.260> put<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:09.440> and

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
the cap and you're going to put that and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.220 
the cap and you're going to put that and
screw<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.130> on<00:03:10.190> on<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:10.430> side<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:11.870> get<00:03:12.110> the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
screw it on on this side so you get the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.490 
screw it on on this side so you get the
washer<00:03:13.510> slide<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.660> on<00:03:14.780> there<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:16.280> got<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.580> cap

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
washer slide it on there you got the cap

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.180 
washer slide it on there you got the cap
put<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.620> on

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.660 

and<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.910> start<00:03:22.090> tightening<00:03:23.460> so<00:03:24.460> you<00:03:24.520> don't

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
and you start tightening so you don't

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.610 
and you start tightening so you don't
want<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.850> tighten<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.180> too<00:03:25.330> tight<00:03:25.570> all<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.260> F

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
want to tighten it too tight all the F

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.190 
want to tighten it too tight all the F
to<00:03:26.800> make<00:03:26.980> sure<00:03:27.130> is<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.090> seal<00:03:28.360> doesn't

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
to make sure is that the seal doesn't

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.710 
to make sure is that the seal doesn't
let<00:03:29.470> air<00:03:29.650> pass<00:03:29.680> by<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:31.120> just<00:03:31.300> make<00:03:31.450> sure<00:03:31.600> that

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
let air pass by so just make sure that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.240 
let air pass by so just make sure that
you<00:03:31.870> know<00:03:31.960> tight<00:03:32.200> enough<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:35.130> then<00:03:36.130> you're

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
you know tight enough and then you're

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.700 
you know tight enough and then you're
done<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.660> once<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.870> guys<00:03:37.960> have<00:03:38.230> these<00:03:38.380> sensors

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
done so once you guys have these sensors

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.470 
done so once you guys have these sensors
mounted<00:03:38.860> on<00:03:39.190> each<00:03:39.370> wheel<00:03:39.610> what<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.240> can<00:03:40.390> do

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
mounted on each wheel what you can do

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.850 
mounted on each wheel what you can do
then<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.900> can<00:03:41.140> mount<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.380> wheels<00:03:41.590> with

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
then is you can mount the wheels with

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.280 
then is you can mount the wheels with
the<00:03:41.950> tires<00:03:42.160> onto<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:42.970> car<00:03:43.120> now<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:43.960> depends<00:03:44.200> on

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
the tires onto the car now it depends on

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.600 
the tires onto the car now it depends on
the<00:03:44.380> kind<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.650> system<00:03:45.010> you're<00:03:45.190> working<00:03:45.280> with

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
the kind of system you're working with

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.210 
the kind of system you're working with
but<00:03:45.850> for<00:03:46.000> my<00:03:46.240> car<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.230> computer<00:03:47.980> has<00:03:48.100> to

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
but for my car the the computer has to

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.420 
but for my car the the computer has to
relearn<00:03:48.550> each<00:03:48.850> sense

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.979 

so<00:03:53.970> guys<00:03:54.150> what<00:03:54.330> we're<00:03:54.420> going<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.569> be<00:03:54.659> doing<00:03:54.870> now

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
so guys what we're going to be doing now

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.449 
so guys what we're going to be doing now
is<00:03:55.260> we're<00:03:55.440> going<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.590> be<00:03:55.680> going<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:55.980> Honda<00:03:56.310> and

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
is we're going to be going to Honda and

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.039 
is we're going to be going to Honda and
we're<00:03:56.819> gonna<00:03:56.909> get<00:03:57.060> them<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.299> program<00:03:57.810> and

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
we're gonna get them the program and

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.229 
we're gonna get them the program and
learn<00:03:58.230> my<00:03:58.830> new<00:03:59.069> tire<00:03:59.280> pressure<00:03:59.549> sensors<00:04:00.060> on

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
learn my new tire pressure sensors on

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.050 
learn my new tire pressure sensors on
these<00:04:00.720> wheels<00:04:00.989> right<00:04:01.799> now<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.040> TPMS<00:04:02.730> light<00:04:02.940> on

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
these wheels right now the TPMS light on

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.820 
these wheels right now the TPMS light on
my<00:04:03.150> dash<00:04:03.330> is<00:04:03.569> on<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.290> i'm<00:04:04.409> going<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.560> get<00:04:04.650> them

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
my dash is on and i'm going to get them

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.309 
my dash is on and i'm going to get them
to<00:04:04.920> change<00:04:05.159> that<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.390> car<00:04:06.629> is<00:04:06.840> going<00:04:07.260> to

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
to change that so the car is going to

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.990 
to change that so the car is going to
read<00:04:07.470> these<00:04:07.650> wheels<00:04:07.950> instead<00:04:08.580> of<00:04:08.700> my<00:04:08.790> old

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
read these wheels instead of my old

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.640 
read these wheels instead of my old
winter<00:04:09.330> setup<00:04:09.659> it's<00:04:10.049> not<00:04:10.170> going<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.349> take<00:04:10.500> too

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
winter setup it's not going to take too

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
winter setup it's not going to take too
long<00:04:10.680> what<00:04:11.069> they're<00:04:11.159> gonna<00:04:11.280> do<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.549> we're

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
long what they're gonna do is we're

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.009 
long what they're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:04:11.730> get<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:11.970> little<00:04:12.239> computer<00:04:12.450> they're

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
gonna get a little computer they're

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.270 
gonna get a little computer they're
gonna<00:04:13.140> hook<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.409> up<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.680> they're<00:04:14.040> going<00:04:14.129> to<00:04:14.220> go

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
gonna hook it up and they're going to go

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.310 
gonna hook it up and they're going to go
right<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.489> each<00:04:14.730> sensor<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.269> it's<00:04:16.139> going<00:04:16.260> to

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
right to each sensor and it's going to

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.379 
right to each sensor and it's going to
program<00:04:16.829> each<00:04:17.190> one<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.639> these<00:04:17.729> sensors<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.269> the

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
program each one of these sensors on the

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.819 
program each one of these sensors on the
car<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.780> it's<00:04:19.260> going<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.410> get<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:19.739> the

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
car and it's going to get it so the

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.409 
car and it's going to get it so the
computer<00:04:20.220> will<00:04:20.459> read<00:04:20.669> each<00:04:20.880> one<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.150> these<00:04:21.239> and

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
computer will read each one of these and

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.300 
computer will read each one of these and
get<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.630> tire<00:04:21.810> pressure<00:04:22.109> sensor<00:04:22.470> off<00:04:23.070> of

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
get the tire pressure sensor off of

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.770 
get the tire pressure sensor off of
there<00:04:23.430> so<00:04:23.880> as<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.090> said<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.300> have<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.600> light<00:04:24.750> on

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
there so as I said I have the light on

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.870 
there so as I said I have the light on
in<00:04:24.960> my<00:04:25.050> car<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.800> after<00:04:26.039> we're<00:04:26.370> done<00:04:26.490> working

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
in my car and after we're done working

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.400 
in my car and after we're done working
on<00:04:26.940> my<00:04:27.060> car<00:04:27.330> I'm<00:04:27.840> gonna<00:04:28.050> go<00:04:28.139> for<00:04:28.289> a<00:04:28.350> little

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
on my car I'm gonna go for a little

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.170 
on my car I'm gonna go for a little
Drive<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:29.010> hopefully<00:04:29.610> if<00:04:29.729> everything<00:04:29.820> goes

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
Drive and hopefully if everything goes

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.270 
Drive and hopefully if everything goes
well<00:04:30.449> the<00:04:30.840> lights<00:04:31.020> going<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.199> turn<00:04:31.350> out<00:04:31.500> so

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
well the lights going to turn out so

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.129 
well the lights going to turn out so
good<00:04:32.520> news<00:04:32.699> I<00:04:32.880> just<00:04:32.910> got<00:04:33.120> back<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.419> my<00:04:33.539> car<00:04:33.750> I'm

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
good news I just got back to my car I'm

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.310 
good news I just got back to my car I'm
at<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.500> Honda<00:04:34.680> dealership<00:04:35.160> right<00:04:35.190> now

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
at the Honda dealership right now

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.750 
at the Honda dealership right now
they<00:04:37.320> just<00:04:37.560> reprogram<00:04:37.860> my<00:04:38.280> tire<00:04:38.490> pressure

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
they just reprogram my tire pressure

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.610 
they just reprogram my tire pressure
sensors<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.479> as<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.930> can<00:04:40.050> see<00:04:40.260> there's<00:04:40.470> no

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
sensors and as you can see there's no

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.010 
sensors and as you can see there's no
more<00:04:40.650> light<00:04:41.039> the<00:04:41.970> tire<00:04:42.210> pressure<00:04:42.510> sensors

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
more light the tire pressure sensors

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.750 
more light the tire pressure sensors
that<00:04:43.169> we<00:04:43.260> just<00:04:43.440> mounted<00:04:43.800> what<00:04:44.340> they<00:04:44.490> do<00:04:44.550> is

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
that we just mounted what they do is

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.279 
that we just mounted what they do is
they<00:04:44.880> monitor<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.389> tire<00:04:45.570> pressure<00:04:45.870> inside

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
they monitor the tire pressure inside

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.920 
they monitor the tire pressure inside
each<00:04:46.590> wheel<00:04:46.970> now<00:04:47.970> they<00:04:48.090> talk<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.449> a<00:04:48.479> computer

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
each wheel now they talk to a computer

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.230 
each wheel now they talk to a computer
that's<00:04:49.050> inside<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:49.979> vehicle<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.490> if<00:04:50.970> one<00:04:51.150> of

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
that's inside the vehicle and if one of

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.350 
that's inside the vehicle and if one of
the<00:04:51.300> tires<00:04:51.510> is<00:04:51.750> low<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.580> TPMS<00:04:53.580> light<00:04:53.820> will

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
the tires is low the TPMS light will

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.390 
the tires is low the TPMS light will
illuminate<00:04:54.860> now<00:04:55.860> if<00:04:55.949> you<00:04:56.039> don't<00:04:56.190> have<00:04:56.310> these

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
illuminate now if you don't have these

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.640 
illuminate now if you don't have these
sensors<00:04:56.729> inside<00:04:57.060> your<00:04:57.210> wheels<00:04:57.389> the<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.380> light

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
sensors inside your wheels the the light

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.560 
sensors inside your wheels the the light
will<00:04:58.950> illuminate<00:04:59.099> as<00:04:59.550> well<00:04:59.700> because<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.389> won't

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
will illuminate as well because it won't

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.420 
will illuminate as well because it won't
be<00:05:00.599> able<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:00.810> read<00:05:00.990> any<00:05:01.139> sensors<00:05:01.530> another

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
be able to read any sensors another

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.740 
be able to read any sensors another
thing<00:05:02.669> to<00:05:02.789> note<00:05:02.940> is<00:05:03.090> that<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.360> batteries

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
thing to note is that the batteries

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.510 
thing to note is that the batteries
inside<00:05:04.050> these<00:05:04.229> things<00:05:04.289> don't<00:05:05.010> last<00:05:05.130> too<00:05:05.490> long

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
inside these things don't last too long

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.760 
inside these things don't last too long
now<00:05:06.389> if<00:05:06.539> you<00:05:06.630> guys<00:05:06.750> ever<00:05:06.960> replace<00:05:07.380> your<00:05:07.560> tire

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
now if you guys ever replace your tire

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.350 
now if you guys ever replace your tire
because<00:05:08.190> it's<00:05:08.370> you<00:05:08.520> know<00:05:08.550> run<00:05:08.880> out<00:05:09.000> of<00:05:09.030> tread

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
because it's you know run out of tread

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.120 
because it's you know run out of tread
it's<00:05:09.900> getting<00:05:10.200> too<00:05:10.320> low<00:05:10.500> or<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.860> have<00:05:10.950> any

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
it's getting too low or you have any

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.760 
it's getting too low or you have any
problem<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.610> would<00:05:12.210> recommend<00:05:12.690> replacing<00:05:13.560> the

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
problem I would recommend replacing the

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.310 
problem I would recommend replacing the
batteries<00:05:14.160> inside<00:05:14.460> these<00:05:14.789> TPMS<00:05:15.419> sensors<00:05:15.780> now

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
batteries inside these TPMS sensors now

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.600 
batteries inside these TPMS sensors now
the<00:05:16.380> reason<00:05:16.710> why<00:05:16.800> you<00:05:16.860> do<00:05:17.010> this<00:05:17.160> is<00:05:17.340> because

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
the reason why you do this is because

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.390 
the reason why you do this is because
it's<00:05:18.120> easier<00:05:18.479> to<00:05:18.630> do<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.750> now<00:05:19.020> then<00:05:19.889> taking<00:05:20.310> the

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400
