 west of Hamburg on the edge of schleswig-holstein is the Wesermarsch

 Beside the five excursionists gladly used earth criticism as Salzburger

 The data diked here landscape becomes new through this took project 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.140
 Providing life it offers lift to the meeting coming from the spot 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.499
 Protected area an ideal habitat for over one hundred 60 bird species 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.710
 The Carl Zeiss Bird Station offers special visitors special 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.180
 Insights without disturbing 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.760
 Here in the Villa March several thousand migratory birds find an optimal

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.550
 tactically returned to Windhoek areas 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.600
 the western railway Ganis pulsed earlier exclusively on the Russian

 Reissner coast 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.480
 Since the seventies it has also sealed the Baltic Sea area and counts 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.030
 Meanwhile, she is still among the top ten Brinke with her low point 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.080
 however, overwhelmingly a winter guest in May this year were at the county as 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.850
 Station to observe up to 2600 copies of this ratio

 he slips into life lived in coastal waters in shallow waters reaches a size 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.439
 of up to 30 centimeters and is up to 17 years old 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.060
 his menu includes insect worms and snails and others

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.889
 outside the breeding season one can in the larger collections here and in 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.889
 other areas of the Wadden Sea

 2010 was chosen by the name bird of the year 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.189
 The Cormorants are found on almost every continent 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.150
 Many cormorant species colonize areas near the water and go to 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.109
 Foraging then into the water 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.529
 However, unlike many other waterfowl people do not 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:51.299
 Furthermore, on the water, the cormorants prefer to be raised in the countryside 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.779
 Squares probably the most distinctive feature of this winter dark is probably the long

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.120
 The protests mostly and open terrain keep on living in them 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.250
