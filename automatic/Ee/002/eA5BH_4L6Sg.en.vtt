00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
was right I go look at my recipe didn't

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.760 
was right I go look at my recipe didn't
come<00:05:31.110> from<00:05:31.350> milk<00:05:32.040> anything<00:05:32.700> so<00:05:33.120> this<00:05:33.990> these<00:05:34.500> do

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
come from milk anything so this these do

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.159 
come from milk anything so this these do
look<00:05:35.010> a<00:05:35.160> little<00:05:35.370> dry<00:05:35.760> but<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:39.750> way<00:05:39.900> I<00:05:39.930> always

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
look a little dry but the way I always

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:50.380 
look a little dry but the way I always
fix<00:05:40.620> them<00:05:40.860> so<00:05:43.520> hope<00:05:44.520> that<00:05:44.550> they're<00:05:44.970> okay<00:05:45.390> I

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
guess once the sausage starts cooking

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.790 
guess once the sausage starts cooking
them<00:05:54.740> you<00:05:55.740> go<00:05:55.950> together<00:05:56.100> meld<00:05:56.640> together<00:05:56.850> more

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800
