colors reds green and then like almost a
yellowy<00:02:03.119> green<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.930> that's<00:02:04.290> what's<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.770> on

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
yellowy green so that's what's going on

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.429 
yellowy green so that's what's going on
with<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.780> what<00:02:06.780> else<00:02:06.899> we<00:02:07.079> got
