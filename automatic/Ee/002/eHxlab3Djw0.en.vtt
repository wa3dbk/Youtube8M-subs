from<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.339> block<00:00:51.579> I've<00:00:52.539> rolled<00:00:52.899> a<00:00:53.050> slab<00:00:53.379> of

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
from the block I've rolled a slab of

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.000 
from the block I've rolled a slab of
clay<00:00:53.800> about<00:00:54.399> a<00:00:54.609> quarter<00:00:54.969> inch<00:00:55.120> thick<00:00:55.239> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
clay about a quarter inch thick a

clay about a quarter inch thick a
thickness<00:00:57.010> strip<00:00:57.699> on<00:00:57.940> each<00:00:58.420> side<00:00:58.719> of<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.019> slab

thickness strip on each side of the slab

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.610 
thickness strip on each side of the slab
helps<00:01:00.789> to<00:01:00.940> keep<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.390> slab<00:01:01.659> even<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.379> you<00:01:02.469> want

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
helps to keep the slab even and you want

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.149 
helps to keep the slab even and you want
to<00:01:02.710> roll<00:01:02.969> both<00:01:03.969> ways<00:01:04.269> across<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.930> slab<00:01:05.170> to

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
to roll both ways across the slab to

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.280 
to roll both ways across the slab to
align<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.670> clay<00:01:06.820> particles<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.630> reduce<00:01:08.110> your

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
align the clay particles and reduce your

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.760 
align the clay particles and reduce your
chances<00:01:08.740> of<00:01:08.799> warping<00:01:09.280> later<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:11.290> slab<00:01:11.530> is

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
chances of warping later the slab is

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.429 
chances of warping later the slab is
just<00:01:11.979> slightly<00:01:12.369> larger<00:01:13.000> than<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.990> image<00:01:14.259> I'm

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
just slightly larger than the image I'm

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:20.010 
just slightly larger than the image I'm
going<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.740> use<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.729> have<00:01:19.180> your<00:01:19.450> students

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
going to use so have your students

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.139 
going to use so have your students
decide<00:01:20.530> which<00:01:21.009> features<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.700> photograph

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
decide which features of the photograph

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
effective simplified line drawing I'm

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.240 
effective simplified line drawing I'm
going<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:28.420> use<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.630> gel<00:01:29.110> pen<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.860> go<00:01:30.009> over<00:01:30.159> the

going to use a gel pen to go over the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.980 
going to use a gel pen to go over the
lines<00:01:30.399> of<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:30.640> photo<00:01:30.909> then<00:01:31.600> I'm<00:01:31.719> going<00:01:31.930> to

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
lines of the photo then I'm going to

00:01:31.990 --> 00:02:16.070 
lines of the photo then I'm going to
transfer<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.070> clay
