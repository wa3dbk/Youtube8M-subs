bit dirty it's a lot of earwax in it so

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.260 
bit dirty it's a lot of earwax in it so
we're<00:00:15.839> going<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.170> try<00:00:16.590> two<00:00:17.400> ways<00:00:18.350> with<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.619> flat

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
we're going to try two ways with a flat

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.560 
we're going to try two ways with a flat
toothpick<00:00:21.270> or<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:22.080> sharp<00:00:22.380> toothpick<00:00:23.570> so

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
toothpick or the sharp toothpick so

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.089 
toothpick or the sharp toothpick so
first<00:00:24.990> we're<00:00:25.170> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> try<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> flat

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
first we're going to try the flat

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.560 
first we're going to try the flat
toothpick<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:27.689> course<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.410> won't<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.800> able<00:00:29.010> to

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
toothpick of course you won't be able to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.359 
toothpick of course you won't be able to
do<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> whole<00:00:31.050> time<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.590> need<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> get<00:00:32.219> in

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
do it the whole time you need to get in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:41.810 
do it the whole time you need to get in
the<00:00:32.460> corners<00:00:32.880> also<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:38.030> that's<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.559> soy<00:00:40.820> with

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the corners also so that's just soy with

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
the corners also so that's just soy with
a<00:00:41.850> flat<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.300> first<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:50.640> by<00:00:51.570> cleaning<00:00:52.320> your

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
a flat one first so by cleaning your

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.910 
a flat one first so by cleaning your
Airport<00:00:54.379> from<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:56.809> earwax<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.530> sound

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
Airport from the earwax the sound

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:10.950 
Airport from the earwax the sound
quality<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.850> get<00:01:00.120> better

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.950 

and<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.620> bass<00:01:11.860> can<00:01:12.220> get<00:01:12.430> better<00:01:12.750> too

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
and the bass can get better too

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.100 
and the bass can get better too
because<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.640> bass<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.750> air<00:01:16.990> from<00:01:17.350> for<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.310> I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
because the bass the air from for the I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.719 
because the bass the air from for the I
call<00:01:20.110> itself<00:01:20.470> over<00:01:20.830> goes<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:24.280> for<00:01:24.640> the

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
call itself over goes here this for the

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.680 
call itself over goes here this for the
sharp<00:01:25.060> sound<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.890> just<00:01:27.190> for<00:01:27.310> extra

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
sharp sound and this just for extra

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:38.010 
sharp sound and this just for extra
background<00:01:28.690> sound<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.770> Airport<00:01:33.580> is<00:01:37.020> C

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
background sound so this Airport is C

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.880 
background sound so this Airport is C
not<00:01:38.380> very<00:01:38.890> clean<00:01:40.320> because<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:43.240> not<00:01:43.509> very

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
not very clean because it's not very

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.469 
not very clean because it's not very
clean<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.380> think<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:49.149> doesn't

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
clean because I think that this doesn't

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
clean because I think that this doesn't
work<00:01:49.869> too<00:01:50.290> well<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.970> does<00:01:51.970> contain<00:01:52.420> some

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
work too well it does contain some

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.670 
work too well it does contain some
earwax<00:01:54.369> as<00:01:55.330> you<00:01:55.450> can<00:01:55.570> see<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.780> little<00:01:56.020> bit<00:01:56.229> green

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
earwax as you can see a little bit green

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.660 
earwax as you can see a little bit green
tip<00:01:58.770> right<00:01:59.770> there<00:02:01.229> little<00:02:02.229> green<00:02:02.680> tip<00:02:03.009> on<00:02:03.520> the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
tip right there little green tip on the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.200 
tip right there little green tip on the
edge<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.560> now<00:02:05.800> we're<00:02:06.100> trying<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.580> with<00:02:06.790> short

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
edge so now we're trying it with short

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.300 
edge so now we're trying it with short
one<00:02:07.450> on<00:02:08.080> my<00:02:08.979> left<00:02:09.369> ear<00:02:09.640> port<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.670> let's<00:02:12.940> focus

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
one on my left ear port so let's focus

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.400 
one on my left ear port so let's focus
all<00:02:15.310> right<00:02:17.519> as<00:02:18.519> you<00:02:19.000> can<00:02:19.150> see<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.140> going

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
all right as you can see this is going

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:30.000 
all right as you can see this is going
much<00:02:20.920> better<00:02:27.150> but<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.450> need<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.900> be<00:02:29.049> careful

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
much better but you need to be careful

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.350 
much better but you need to be careful
not<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.690> damage<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:32.310> housing<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.970> can<00:02:37.120> see

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
not to damage the housing you can see

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.410 
not to damage the housing you can see
ear<00:02:37.630> wax<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:41.440> it's<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.769> lot<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:41.980> ear<00:02:42.250> wax<00:02:42.420> that's

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
ear wax and it's a lot of ear wax that's

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.729 
ear wax and it's a lot of ear wax that's
here<00:02:47.400> that's<00:02:48.400> ear<00:02:48.730> wax

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
here that's ear wax

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:58.009 
here that's ear wax
so<00:02:50.739> let's<00:02:51.580> continue<00:02:51.850> with<00:02:52.420> clean<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.320> airport

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:06.180 

all<00:02:59.019> right<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.799> think<00:03:03.090> it's<00:03:04.090> pretty<00:03:04.450> much<00:03:05.190> done

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
all right I think it's pretty much done

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:16.340 
all right I think it's pretty much done
out<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:07.170> little<00:03:08.170> bit<00:03:08.380> here<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:14.079> edges

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
out a little bit here and in the edges

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.509 
out a little bit here and in the edges
so<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:19.660> was<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.290> sharp<00:03:20.650> toothpick<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.340> now

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
so this was the sharp toothpick and now

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:41.660 
so this was the sharp toothpick and now
let's<00:03:22.090> compare<00:03:22.540> them<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:28.769> wait<00:03:30.780> just<00:03:31.780> remove

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.520 

don't<00:03:42.670> blow<00:03:42.940> too<00:03:42.970> hard<00:03:43.390> because<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:44.080> air<00:03:44.230> can

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
don't blow too hard because the air can

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:53.610 
don't blow too hard because the air can
go<00:03:44.790> into<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:47.460> airport<00:03:48.460> itself<00:03:49.890> but<00:03:52.620> as

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
go into the the airport itself but as

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.830 
go into the the airport itself but as
you<00:03:53.890> can<00:03:54.070> see<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:56.170> airport<00:03:56.710> on<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:58.060> right<00:03:58.270> is

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
you can see the airport on the right is

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.860 
you can see the airport on the right is
cleaner<00:03:59.290> than<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.370> air<00:04:00.460> put<00:04:00.700> on<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.060> left<00:04:01.270> so

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
cleaner than the air put on the left so

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.610 
cleaner than the air put on the left so
if<00:04:02.830> you<00:04:02.890> can<00:04:03.220> choose<00:04:03.850> from<00:04:04.480> those<00:04:05.440> two

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
if you can choose from those two

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.490 
if you can choose from those two
toothpicks<00:04:08.620> we<00:04:09.250> would<00:04:09.430> recommend<00:04:09.730> this<00:04:10.240> one

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
toothpicks we would recommend this one

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.800 
toothpicks we would recommend this one
