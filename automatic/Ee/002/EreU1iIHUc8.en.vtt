00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.650
 how about a warm greeting for all 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.930
 our friends from telemundo 51 puntocom 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.059
 also to those who follow us and are 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.720
 our friends across networks 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.340
 social 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.290
 we are talking a little about the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.109
 hurricane sando and if sandy continues as 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.610
 a category 1 hurricane with 80 miles per 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.460
 time in the last bulletin of the center 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.560
 national hurricane issued at 8 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.539
 the morning we noticed that dry air envelops 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.760
 to that storm and that's what he's done 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.340
 that this storm is expanding further 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.140
 circle of the center of this storm 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 expanding so the winds 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.889
 will continue to be strong enough to 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.469
 throughout our entire peninsula and 

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:39.929
 now also towards the region of the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.089
 carolinas we noticed that most of 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.859
 the convection of sandy good is maintained 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.929
 over waters of the Atlantic and in fact already 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.309
 it has been divided into two zones one envelope 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.920
 waters of the Atlantic and another that 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.469
 they stayed days hovering around the northern portion 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.079
 of the group of the Bahamian islands and this 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.760
 same area will continue to leave us these 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.760
 rain bands during the course 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.879
 Today's Friday we noticed that good sandy 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.280
 continues as a category 1 hurricane with 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.560
 winds of 80 miles per hour 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.830
 towards the northwest reason of 10 miles by 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.630
 hour and continues the hurricane warning for 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.640
 the northern sector of the group of islands 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.979
 bahamenses and us here in the south of 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.130
 the florida we continue under a notice of 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.810
 tropical storm is worth saying that also 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.140
 there is a tropical storm watch 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.119
 for the entire coast of the Carolinas 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.700
 including also the northern end of 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.530
 our state since sandy will continue 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.299
 over waters of the Atlantic but still 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.700
 is going to be getting very close to the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.550
 portion of the carolinas elevating the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.350
 tides also the strong wind already 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.179
 to start next week 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.640
 when we have to be very 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.560
 earrings to sandy in fact already during 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.690
 the end of this weekend is worth the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.190
 redundancy we have to be very 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.950
 pending what will be 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.869
 happening with sandy since most 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.420
 of the models now indicate that they're going 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.670
 to be moving towards the northeast of 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.460
 the American nation entering 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.500
 mostly in the delmarva peninsula 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.360
 what does that mean that the greatest 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.450
 part of the activity is going to stay 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.790
 focused on portions of the state tri 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.319
 new york- also from the web, you have to 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.269
 exercise many precautions you have to 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.060
 be very attentive to what will be 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.010
 going through this cyclone during the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.500
 the course of the weekend is not for 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.870
 alarming us but you have to be very 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.250
 attentive to all this situation towards 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.540
 our region good here the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.510
 conditions are going to start to improve 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.880
 gradually over the weekend 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.099
 we have one day of instability 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.660
 we currently have some bands of 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.160
 rain that were affecting great 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.230
 part of the metropolitan portion 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.510
 during the early hours of the morning 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.790
 but nothing compared to what 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.069
 we had yesterday in these same 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.900
 rain accumulated hours are not 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.220
 as impressive as we had 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.660
 yesterday yesterday once 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.000
 they were very impressive but yes 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.340
 they were a little higher in the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.340
 we had so far this Friday 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.930
 and we continue under a warning of 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.370
 strong winds I think that's what 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.980
 what else is going to have a focus during 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.690
 this weekend the warning of 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.450
 strong winds continues to be 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.160
 You can say all of South Florida 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.510
 tropical storm surveillance towards 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.040
 the coasts 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.110
 as the rains are closing 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.120
 little by little throughout the region the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.480
 winds will continue to dominate in our 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.209
 zone 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.069
 in fact the maximum temperature for today 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.390
 just at about 81 degrees because it's 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.310
 because the cloudiness is going to look good 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.900
 planted throughout the region also 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.150
 the wind is going to be blowing from the 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.950
 north providing the conditions a bit 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.959
 drier just in time for this purpose 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.819
 of a week precaution for bathers 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.040
 there will be many hangover currents 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.170
 also for small boats 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.620
 the wind in the maritime sector will be 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.920
 leaving from the northwest between 31 to 37 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.620
 knots and can rise to 50 knots towards 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.200
 the open sea the sea with a swell of 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.540
 11 to 13 feet and open sea can get 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.120
 up to 20 feet the bay quite moved to 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.069
 this time of the morning and it will continue like this 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.170
 for this Friday I do not have a band 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.060
 frontal that is entering right towards the 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.859
 portion of the ohio valley 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.859
 this frontal band is going to bring a mass 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.659
 of very cold air indeed work 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.359
 lots of snowfall during the beginning 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.130
 of the week this week towards the 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.609
 Pacific Northwest sector 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.990
 mountains waterfalls rocky mountains 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.110
 a lot of rainfall also towards 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.759
 the 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.800
 from california rainfall 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.050
 liquid and precipitation in the form of 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.990
 snow and this front band will be 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.699
 moving to the east the mass of air 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.560
 cold will start to seep along 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.780
 of the region after the passage of this band 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.270
 front for the beginning of the next 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.620
 work week but when exactly 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.020
 that have the extended forecast to 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.229
 temperatures this weekend in the 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.520
 low range of 80 degrees the maximum 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.930
 pass the front band is a band 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.419
 front dry so we're not 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.150
 expecting rain for Monday 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.310
 passes the front band and temperatures 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.340
 will descend they notice the maximum for the 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.129
 Tuesday 76 degrees but how much 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.590
 we will wake up at 58 degrees so 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.840
 take out those coats and those boots if it's 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.389
 that you will need them and the wind 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.419
 that will continue to dominate a large part 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.879
 of the next work week also they 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.620
 I wish a very happy Friday afternoon 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:21.810
 continue navigating through our
