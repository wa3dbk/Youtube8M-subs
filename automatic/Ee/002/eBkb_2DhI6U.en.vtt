00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
off those rooted bits off and then put a

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.350 
off those rooted bits off and then put a
seat<00:01:44.810> round<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:46.280> just<00:01:46.520> looks<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.090> much

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
seat round that just looks so much
