hardware tour of the LG through 4g on

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.879 
hardware tour of the LG through 4g on
AT&amp;T<00:00:08.880> it's<00:00:09.630> very<00:00:09.780> similar<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> LG<00:00:10.860> optimus

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
AT&amp;T it's very similar to the LG optimus
