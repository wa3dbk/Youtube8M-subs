 the quality is of the photo if you who who hall 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:07.780

 secondly that in these 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.580
 the camera where we set the entire 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.750
 camera where we can do the cleaning 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.220
 shutter among other functions which 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.960
 we found a playback mode 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.210
 where we can see the photos 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:37.270
 available on the camera is that we can 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.510
 in this color speed module 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.000
 we can adjust iso the balance in 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.290
 white is a meter 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.930
 in addition to the flash compensation focus between 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.950
 several other effects here are effects of 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:59.290
 image effects here 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:04.330
 there are several effects here and this is 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.570
 camera is very good and I recommend it is 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.209
 for anyone who is either quality 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.459
 image and ease in the 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.959
 take some photos 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:19.690
 besides it is very good indeed and is a 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.150
 camera is light 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.750
 taking into account the size of the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:30.489
 next sensor 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.770
 then the only negative point of this 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.180
 The camera here was that at the time I 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.050
 I bought it did not come with a 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.760
 memory 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.800
 I do not think it will come either when 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.870
 you buy then you should 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.560
 camera with a memory card. 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.330
 memory and also 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.010
 One thing I did not like was the time I 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.980
 It takes time to charge the battery. 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.690
 more than four hours to recharge 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.840
 the right battery 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.760
 these are the only negative points that 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.160
 I did not like this camera 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:05.510
 lacked speak here something to you one 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.510
 This camera's judgment goes from 200 ok 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:20.190
 16,200 up to 16,000 a very good camera and 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:22.169
 with exceptional qualities and I will leave 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.300
 Here is the link for you to see 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.110
 video and some photos that were taken 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.350
 with this victory was worth and until the next 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.350
 video
