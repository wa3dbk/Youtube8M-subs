always for the betterment I think of
some<00:00:31.669> of<00:00:31.699> the<00:00:31.849> pieces<00:00:32.060> on<00:00:32.360> there<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:32.689> I'll<00:00:33.260> do<00:00:33.410> a

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
some of the pieces on there so I'll do a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.470 
some of the pieces on there so I'll do a
very<00:00:33.590> simple<00:00:33.950> study<00:00:34.790> it<00:00:35.120> doesn't<00:00:35.390> really

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
very simple study it doesn't really

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.790 
very simple study it doesn't really
matter<00:00:35.690> too<00:00:35.870> much<00:00:35.900> on<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.320> pain<00:00:36.620> well<00:00:36.739> I'm

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
matter too much on the pain well I'm

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.770 
matter too much on the pain well I'm
gonna<00:00:36.920> do<00:00:37.420> black<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:38.450> white

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
gonna do black and white

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.650 
gonna do black and white
and<00:00:40.390> just<00:00:41.390> put<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:41.540> block<00:00:41.810> of<00:00:41.990> quick<00:00:43.660> concept

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
and just put a block of quick concept

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.790 
and just put a block of quick concept
painting<00:00:44.900> but<00:00:44.990> we<00:00:45.080> have<00:00:45.200> to<00:00:45.290> think<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.590> it<00:00:45.710> as

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
painting but we have to think of it as

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.860 
painting but we have to think of it as
the<00:00:45.920> painting<00:00:46.480> everything<00:00:47.480> you<00:00:47.540> have<00:00:47.630> to<00:00:47.720> work

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
the painting everything you have to work

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.710 
the painting everything you have to work
into<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.500> drawing<00:00:48.890> an<00:00:49.040> anatomy<00:00:49.640> of<00:00:49.670> it<00:00:49.880> you

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
into the drawing an anatomy of it you

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.300 
into the drawing an anatomy of it you
put<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:50.900> wash<00:00:51.080> over<00:00:51.290> it<00:00:51.410> or<00:00:51.620> not<00:00:51.650> using<00:00:51.950> opaque

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
put a wash over it or not using opaque

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.980 
put a wash over it or not using opaque
so<00:00:52.610> whatever<00:00:53.150> is<00:00:53.240> on<00:00:53.360> there<00:00:53.540> is<00:00:53.600> gonna<00:00:53.750> be<00:00:53.870> on

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
so whatever is on there is gonna be on

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.660 
so whatever is on there is gonna be on
this<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:54.380> I<00:00:54.620> just<00:00:54.860> come<00:00:55.130> and<00:00:55.250> put<00:00:55.460> maybe<00:00:55.580> a

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
this so I just come and put maybe a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.540 
this so I just come and put maybe a
light<00:00:55.970> a<00:00:56.620> variation<00:00:57.620> of<00:00:57.710> sky<00:01:00.340> that<00:01:01.340> really

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.520 
painting it's on a piece of cardboard
which<00:01:20.149> is<00:01:20.780> not<00:01:20.960> necessarily<00:01:21.319> bad<00:01:21.469> for

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
which is not necessarily bad for

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.590 
which is not necessarily bad for
practice<00:01:22.069> but<00:01:22.280> I<00:01:22.340> remember<00:01:22.700> giving<00:01:23.149> a<00:01:23.390> couple

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
practice but I remember giving a couple

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.389 
practice but I remember giving a couple
way<00:01:23.780> my<00:01:23.929> students<00:01:24.350> one<00:01:24.679> of<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.859> paintings<00:01:25.249> is

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
way my students one of the paintings is

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.739 
way my students one of the paintings is
how<00:01:25.520> they<00:01:25.640> liked<00:01:25.850> it<00:01:25.999> and<00:01:26.119> they<00:01:26.210> ended<00:01:26.630> up

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:26.749 
how they liked it and they ended up

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:28.840 
how they liked it and they ended up
having<00:01:26.810> framed<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.710> get<00:01:28.429> the<00:01:28.549> idea<00:01:28.789> of

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
having framed and get the idea of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.029 
having framed and get the idea of
framing<00:01:28.999> one<00:01:29.299> car<00:01:30.170> for<00:01:30.380> wood<00:01:30.590> back<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.890> what<00:01:31.009> I

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
framing one car for wood back to what I

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.599 
framing one car for wood back to what I
wanted

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
wanted

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.270 
wanted
okay<00:01:32.240> I'm<00:01:32.299> just<00:01:32.479> looking<00:01:32.780> at<00:01:33.039> most<00:01:34.039> of<00:01:34.189> you

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
okay I'm just looking at most of you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.039

have<00:01:34.369> never<00:01:34.490> seen<00:01:34.670> me<00:01:34.759> paint<00:01:35.030> live<00:01:35.270> or<00:01:35.539> there

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
have never seen me paint live or there

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.300 
have never seen me paint live or there
was<00:01:36.139> any<00:01:36.319> paint<00:01:36.530> but<00:01:36.649> I<00:01:36.740> do<00:01:36.799> a<00:01:36.920> lot<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.100> swimming

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
was any paint but I do a lot of swimming

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.859 
was any paint but I do a lot of swimming
and<00:01:37.700> maybe<00:01:37.819> you<00:01:37.969> do<00:01:38.119> too<00:01:38.149> because<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.689> really

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
and maybe you do too because it really

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.389 
and maybe you do too because it really
does<00:01:39.020> help<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.439> see<00:01:39.590> things<00:01:39.799> differently

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
does help to see things differently

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.940 
does help to see things differently
I'm<00:01:40.819> percent<00:01:41.450> colorblind<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.079> I<00:01:42.409> see<00:01:42.859> the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
looking at some gray through here grades

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.710 
looking at some gray through here grades
may<00:02:28.950> not<00:02:29.130> be<00:02:29.280> great<00:02:29.490> when<00:02:29.700> whatever<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.420> put<00:02:30.570> in

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
may not be great when whatever we put in

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.200 
may not be great when whatever we put in
is<00:02:30.960> washes<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.560> great<00:02:31.800> or<00:02:32.010> blues<00:02:32.250> or<00:02:32.580> greens<00:02:32.880> I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
and like almost all my demos so when I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.910 
and like almost all my demos so when I
paint<00:02:39.720> live<00:02:39.930> I'm<00:02:40.170> not<00:02:40.350> painting<00:02:40.560> from<00:02:40.770> any

particular<00:02:41.880> painting<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:43.430> when<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.520> paint

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
particular painting and when you paint

particular painting and when you paint
often<00:02:45.480> as<00:02:45.570> many<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.080> do<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.410> hard<00:02:46.590> part<00:02:46.620> is

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
often as many of you do the hard part is

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.860 
often as many of you do the hard part is
you<00:02:47.190> know<00:02:47.400> making<00:02:47.970> something<00:02:48.180> fresh<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.750> not

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
you know making something fresh and not

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.140 
you know making something fresh and not
always<00:02:49.020> in<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.920> same<00:02:50.160> old<00:02:50.520> thing<00:02:50.820> over<00:02:50.970> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
always in the same old thing over and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.970 
always in the same old thing over and
over<00:02:51.210> like<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.020> little<00:02:52.230> coat<00:02:52.500> down<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.860> here

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
over like that little coat down in here

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.610 
over like that little coat down in here
so<00:02:53.130> we're<00:02:53.250> gonna<00:02:53.640> treat<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:53.880> as<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.620> completed

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
so we're gonna treat it as a completed

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.170 
so we're gonna treat it as a completed
painting

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
painting

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.840 
painting
basically<00:02:57.180> most<00:02:57.360> like<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> drawing<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.670> I'll

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
basically most like a drawing and I'll

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.310 
basically most like a drawing and I'll
just<00:03:00.000> take<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.300> edge<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.420> maybe<00:03:00.720> put<00:03:00.960> a<00:03:00.990> you

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
just take the edge and maybe put a you

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.110 
just take the edge and maybe put a you
know<00:03:01.380> some<00:03:01.650> trees<00:03:01.950> back<00:03:02.220> here<00:03:02.280> soften<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.940> up<00:03:03.000> a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
know some trees back here soften it up a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.020 
know some trees back here soften it up a
little<00:03:03.950> almost<00:03:04.950> look<00:03:05.070> like<00:03:05.100> more<00:03:05.489> Danish<00:03:05.760> back

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
little almost look like more Danish back

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.080 
little almost look like more Danish back
there<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.480> may<00:03:06.810> end<00:03:07.110> up<00:03:07.550> when<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:08.580> block<00:03:08.880> this

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
there so I may end up when I block this

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.040 
there so I may end up when I block this
in<00:03:10.700> think<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.790> morning<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.690> when<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> talk

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
in think of morning and when I talk

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.540 
in think of morning and when I talk
about<00:03:13.110> scoyne<00:03:13.470> II<00:03:13.560> when<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.739> do<00:03:13.800> demonstration

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
about scoyne II when I do demonstration

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.710 
about scoyne II when I do demonstration
sometimes<00:03:14.910> people<00:03:15.120> set<00:03:15.270> aside<00:03:15.540> there

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
sometimes people set aside there

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.650 
sometimes people set aside there
especially<00:03:16.020> in<00:03:16.290> school<00:03:16.560> because<00:03:17.400> they<00:03:17.970> do<00:03:18.570> you

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
especially in school because they do you

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.830 
especially in school because they do you
know<00:03:18.780> you're<00:03:18.930> squinting<00:03:19.459> yeah<00:03:20.459> it's<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.090> cuz

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
know you're squinting yeah it's like cuz

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.970 
know you're squinting yeah it's like cuz
they<00:03:21.930> don't<00:03:22.050> understand<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.500> because<00:03:22.770> they

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
they don't understand that because they

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.140 
they don't understand that because they
would<00:03:23.070> think<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.340> let's<00:03:23.790> have<00:03:23.910> your<00:03:24.000> eyes<00:03:24.120> wide

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
would think of let's have your eyes wide

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.479 
would think of let's have your eyes wide
open<00:03:24.600> when<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.780> see<00:03:24.900> things<00:03:25.280> okay<00:03:26.280> that's

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
open when you see things okay that's

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.880 
open when you see things okay that's
gives<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.880> nice<00:03:27.060> little<00:03:27.410> know<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.440> might<00:03:28.860> just

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
gives a nice little know I might just

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.770 
gives a nice little know I might just
show<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.430> some<00:03:29.640> some<00:03:29.880> waters<00:03:30.209> if<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.450> do<00:03:30.510> may

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
show this some some waters if I do may

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.300 
show this some some waters if I do may
just<00:03:30.989> for<00:03:31.110> hidden<00:03:31.880> Wilson<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.000> straight<00:03:33.269> down

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
just for hidden Wilson is straight down

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.040 
just for hidden Wilson is straight down
and<00:03:34.700> we<00:03:34.910> just<00:03:35.030> use<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.270> little<00:03:35.390> I'm<00:03:35.810> actually

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
and we just use a little I'm actually

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.130 
and we just use a little I'm actually
using<00:03:36.319> black<00:03:37.310> gesso<00:03:38.240> and<00:03:38.270> white<00:03:38.690> gesso<00:03:38.959> a

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
using black gesso and white gesso a

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.850 
using black gesso and white gesso a
little<00:03:39.380> bit<00:03:39.470> quicker<00:03:39.940> then<00:03:41.650> acrylic<00:03:42.650> paint

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
little bit quicker then acrylic paint

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.309 
little bit quicker then acrylic paint
straight<00:03:43.640> acrylic<00:03:44.060> flows<00:03:45.020> a<00:03:45.050> little<00:03:45.140> bit

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
straight acrylic flows a little bit

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.390 
straight acrylic flows a little bit
better<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:48.380> again<00:03:48.800> I<00:03:48.830> probably<00:03:49.010> just<00:03:49.250> make

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
better and again I probably just make

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.420 
better and again I probably just make
this<00:03:49.490> very<00:03:49.700> simple<00:03:50.540> composition<00:03:51.069> not<00:03:52.069> a<00:03:52.100> lot

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
this very simple composition not a lot

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.180 
this very simple composition not a lot
of<00:03:53.800> foreground<00:03:54.800> paint<00:03:56.770> now<00:03:57.770> I<00:03:57.800> might<00:03:58.010> come

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
of foreground paint now I might come

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.080 
of foreground paint now I might come
back<00:03:58.310> and<00:03:58.580> put<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.730> little<00:03:58.819> bit<00:03:59.000> more

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
back and put a little bit more

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.510 
back and put a little bit more
reflection<00:03:59.750> across<00:04:00.350> here<00:04:00.680> whatever<00:04:01.160> is<00:04:01.340> going

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
reflection across here whatever is going

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.020 
reflection across here whatever is going
maybe<00:04:01.670> be<00:04:01.880> water<00:04:02.260> darkness<00:04:03.260> down<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.470> little

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
maybe be water darkness down a little

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.370 
maybe be water darkness down a little
bit<00:04:05.030> top<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:06.709> like<00:04:07.070> in<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.730> oil<00:04:08.360> as<00:04:08.989> long<00:04:09.230> this

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
bit top and like in the oil as long this

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.440 
bit top and like in the oil as long this
is<00:04:09.590> wet<00:04:09.800> and<00:04:10.100> come<00:04:10.489> here<00:04:10.580> scrape<00:04:11.000> some<00:04:11.150> little

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
is wet and come here scrape some little

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.860 
is wet and come here scrape some little
trees<00:04:12.140> out<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.350> here<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:17.510> we'll<00:04:17.660> pull<00:04:17.840> a

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
trees out of here and we'll pull a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.599 
trees out of here and we'll pull a
reflection<00:04:18.500> out<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:18.859> we'll<00:04:19.220> think<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.519> a

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
reflection out so we'll think of a

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.849 
reflection out so we'll think of a
reflection<00:04:20.090> of<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.269> trees<00:04:20.570> gonna<00:04:21.410> fall<00:04:21.590> in

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
reflection of the trees gonna fall in

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:32.100 
reflection of the trees gonna fall in
that<00:04:21.950> same<00:04:22.280> format

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.320 

and<00:04:32.500> I'll<00:04:32.889> very<00:04:33.189> likely<00:04:33.460> maybe<00:04:33.729> take<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.030> little

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
and I'll very likely maybe take a little

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.240 
and I'll very likely maybe take a little
bit<00:04:34.419> of<00:04:34.539> light<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:34.810> separate<00:04:35.470> us<00:04:35.500> land<00:04:35.979> and

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
bit of light to separate us land and

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.339 
bit of light to separate us land and
water<00:04:36.430> back<00:04:36.669> here<00:04:36.909> kind<00:04:37.780> of<00:04:37.840> got<00:04:37.990> early

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
water back here kind of got early

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.950 
water back here kind of got early
morning<00:04:38.710> misty<00:04:40.080> little<00:04:41.080> lake<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:43.449> since<00:04:43.900> I

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
morning misty little lake and since I

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.619 
morning misty little lake and since I
like<00:04:44.139> fishing<00:04:44.409> a<00:04:44.620> lot<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:44.979> love<00:04:45.189> fishing

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
like fishing a lot I love fishing

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.240 
like fishing a lot I love fishing

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.610 
that Lakes wherever I'm painting the
fish<00:04:52.300> are<00:04:52.449> always<00:04:52.539> on<00:04:52.719> the<00:04:52.870> other<00:04:52.990> side<00:04:53.289> or

the other side probably if I'm painting

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.619 
the other side probably if I'm painting
they<00:04:57.729> would<00:04:57.849> be<00:04:57.969> there<00:04:58.180> but<00:04:58.300> it<00:04:58.389> wouldn't<00:04:58.539> be

00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:58.629 
they would be there but it wouldn't be

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:00.719 
they would be there but it wouldn't be
able<00:04:58.689> to<00:04:58.780> do<00:04:58.930> it<00:04:59.039> okay<00:05:00.039> you<00:05:00.099> should<00:05:00.520> be<00:05:00.550> will

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
able to do it okay you should be will

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.189 
able to do it okay you should be will
see<00:05:00.849> that<00:05:01.000> on<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.300> in<00:05:01.360> fact<00:05:01.509> what<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:01.780> might<00:05:01.990> do

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
see that on the in fact what I might do

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.559 
see that on the in fact what I might do
is<00:05:02.740> come<00:05:02.949> back<00:05:03.039> in<00:05:03.219> here<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:04.060> create<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.449> little

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 
is come back in here and create a little

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.930 
is come back in here and create a little
bit<00:05:04.659> of<00:05:04.780> mist<00:05:05.259> to<00:05:05.979> separate<00:05:06.370> these<00:05:06.490> two<00:05:06.699> banks

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
bit of mist to separate these two banks

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.360 
bit of mist to separate these two banks
and<00:05:07.270> actually<00:05:07.569> make<00:05:07.719> them<00:05:08.009> almost<00:05:09.009> another

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
and actually make them almost another

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.170 
and actually make them almost another
bank<00:05:09.729> behind<00:05:10.150> that<00:05:10.599> one<00:05:10.810> oh<00:05:12.000> that's<00:05:13.000> kind<00:05:13.150> of

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
bank behind that one oh that's kind of

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.779 
bank behind that one oh that's kind of
cool<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:13.990> let's<00:05:14.979> go<00:05:15.099> back<00:05:15.280> maybe<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.610> little

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
cool and let's go back maybe a little

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.129 
cool and let's go back maybe a little
bit<00:05:15.909> farther<00:05:16.150> back<00:05:16.270> here<00:05:16.599> and<00:05:16.719> create<00:05:16.900> another

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
bit farther back here and create another

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.920 
bit farther back here and create another
little<00:05:19.080> land<00:05:20.080> behind<00:05:21.210> running<00:05:22.210> behind<00:05:22.539> and

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
little land behind running behind and

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.180 
little land behind running behind and
they'll<00:05:23.080> come<00:05:23.319> in<00:05:23.440> here<00:05:23.560> make<00:05:23.740> this<00:05:23.889> one<00:05:24.069> just

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
they'll come in here make this one just

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.790 
they'll come in here make this one just
a<00:05:24.279> little<00:05:24.460> darker<00:05:25.229> yeah<00:05:26.229> and<00:05:26.319> I<00:05:26.349> won't<00:05:26.500> get<00:05:26.620> too

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
a little darker yeah and I won't get too

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.589 
a little darker yeah and I won't get too
much<00:05:26.979> detail<00:05:27.669> and<00:05:27.909> again<00:05:28.000> this<00:05:28.180> is<00:05:28.360> just<00:05:28.479> a

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
much detail and again this is just a

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.170 
much detail and again this is just a
study<00:05:28.840> so<00:05:29.080> we<00:05:29.110> can<00:05:29.349> see<00:05:29.469> on<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.680> next<00:05:30.180> episode

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
study so we can see on the next episode

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.300 
study so we can see on the next episode
here<00:05:31.560> but<00:05:32.560> you<00:05:32.680> should<00:05:32.710> be<00:05:32.979> able<00:05:33.039> to<00:05:33.159> see<00:05:33.219> your

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
here but you should be able to see your

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.320

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
simple little to contrast or to edge

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.030 
simple little to contrast or to edge
composition<00:06:11.200> to<00:06:11.290> here<00:06:11.410> are<00:06:11.470> some<00:06:11.590> lights<00:06:11.830> in

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
composition to here are some lights in

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.980 
composition to here are some lights in
there<00:06:12.250> so<00:06:12.400> basically<00:06:12.820> let<00:06:13.210> this<00:06:13.330> dry<00:06:13.570> up<00:06:13.780> and

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
there so basically let this dry up and

then the next episode we'll come back
and<00:06:16.270> put<00:06:16.360> a<00:06:16.390> wash<00:06:16.540> on<00:06:16.720> top<00:06:16.930> of<00:06:17.080> it

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
and put a wash on top of it

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.940
