imprinted against the side of the rock

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.969 
imprinted against the side of the rock
which<00:01:18.509> means<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:18.990> been<00:01:19.170> around<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.799> long

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
which means it's been around for so long

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.499 
which means it's been around for so long
that<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.400> tectonic<00:01:20.909> plates<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.390> the
