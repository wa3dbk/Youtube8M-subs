00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.219 

and<00:04:52.400> because<00:04:52.880> this<00:04:53.630> trap<00:04:54.020> is<00:04:54.230> smaller

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.260 

see<00:04:57.800> here<00:04:58.069> at<00:04:58.189> the<00:04:58.310> end<00:05:00.249> the<00:05:01.249> oil<00:05:01.490> reservoir<00:05:01.789> is

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
see here at the end the oil reservoir is

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.959 
see here at the end the oil reservoir is
small<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:03.319> fairly<00:05:03.740> deep<00:05:04.129> so<00:05:04.460> you<00:05:04.490> don't<00:05:04.849> need

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:04.969 
small and fairly deep so you don't need

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:13.439 
small and fairly deep so you don't need
to<00:05:06.219> worry<00:05:07.219> about<00:05:07.310> keeping<00:05:07.819> the<00:05:07.939> high<00:05:08.090> level

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.689 

one<00:05:14.449> of<00:05:14.479> them<00:05:14.689> goes<00:05:14.870> right<00:05:15.139> in<00:05:15.460> without<00:05:16.460> any

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
one of them goes right in without any

one of them goes right in without any
help<00:05:16.969> from<00:05:17.029> the<00:05:17.330> bees<00:05:17.539> you<00:05:17.900> know<00:05:18.620> that<00:05:18.770> one

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
help from the bees you know that one

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.619 
help from the bees you know that one
kind<00:05:19.129> of<00:05:19.219> gets<00:05:19.509> pushed<00:05:20.509> in<00:05:20.749> right<00:05:21.229> there<00:05:22.629> where

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629 
kind of gets pushed in right there where

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:30.150 
kind of gets pushed in right there where
do<00:05:23.960> they<00:05:24.169> go

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.890 

they<00:05:30.430> go<00:05:30.640> yeah<00:05:31.590> where<00:05:32.590> they<00:05:32.830> go

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.719 

and<00:05:36.900> that<00:05:37.080> small<00:05:37.410> reservoir<00:05:37.979> slides<00:05:38.310> right<00:05:38.550> in

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
and that small reservoir slides right in

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.060 
and that small reservoir slides right in
and<00:05:38.759> slides<00:05:39.180> out<00:05:39.449> very<00:05:39.780> easily<00:05:40.040> you<00:05:41.040> don't

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
and slides out very easily you don't

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.100 
and slides out very easily you don't
need<00:05:41.280> to<00:05:41.460> go<00:05:41.580> into<00:05:41.790> high<00:05:42.060> or<00:05:42.419> disparate<00:05:42.930> the

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
need to go into high or disparate the

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.980 
need to go into high or disparate the
bees

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.970 

and<00:05:49.990> this<00:05:50.290> is<00:05:50.470> I<00:05:51.010> believe<00:05:51.370> four<00:05:51.940> days<00:05:52.180> later

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
and this is I believe four days later

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.680 
and this is I believe four days later
see<00:05:53.980> how<00:05:54.010> many<00:05:54.340> bees<00:05:54.520> they've<00:05:54.820> got<00:05:55.090> how<00:05:55.630> many

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
see how many bees they've got how many

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:04.400 
see how many bees they've got how many
beetles<00:05:59.310> there's<00:06:00.310> a<00:06:00.400> few<00:06:00.640> more

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:11.000 

see<00:06:05.280> that<00:06:06.650> there<00:06:07.650> are<00:06:07.680> some

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010
