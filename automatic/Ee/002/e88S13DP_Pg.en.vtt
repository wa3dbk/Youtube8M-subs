I'll do the Joker's first and then I'll
get<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> court<00:02:16.860> cards<00:02:17.160> The<00:02:18.060> Joker's<00:02:18.590> if<00:02:19.590> I

can find them here we go
it<00:02:22.320> comes<00:02:22.590> with<00:02:22.800> two<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:22.980> them<00:02:24.110> like<00:02:25.110> any<00:02:25.320> other

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
it comes with two of them like any other

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.360 
it comes with two of them like any other
standard<00:02:26.010> bicycle<00:02:26.190> deck<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:27.600> these<00:02:27.810> are<00:02:28.370> one

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
standard bicycle deck but these are one

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.940 
standard bicycle deck but these are one
is<00:02:29.520> different<00:02:29.880> from<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.150> other<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:31.350> have<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
is different from the other you have the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.010 
is different from the other you have the
one<00:02:32.670> with<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.940> white<00:02:33.120> background<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
one with the white background in the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.320 
one with the white background in the
blue<00:02:34.400> Joker<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:35.940> has<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> blue

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
blue Joker and this one has the blue

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.090 
blue Joker and this one has the blue
background<00:02:36.930> with<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.440> white<00:02:37.620> Joker

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
background with the white Joker

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.470 
background with the white Joker
so<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.550> Joker's<00:02:38.940> are<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.090> little<00:02:39.270> bit

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
so the Joker's are a little bit

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.620 
so the Joker's are a little bit
different<00:02:39.870> kind<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.230> cool<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:43.680> court<00:02:44.010> cards

different kind of cool the court cards

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.040 
different kind of cool the court cards
unlike<00:02:45.630> your<00:02:46.530> regular<00:02:46.920> cards<00:02:47.600> actually<00:02:48.600> have

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
unlike your regular cards actually have

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.810 
unlike your regular cards actually have
a<00:02:49.080> face<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.650> center<00:02:49.920> I'll<00:02:50.310> show<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.640> the

kehna this is the king the hard sphere

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.350 
kehna this is the king the hard sphere
there's<00:02:53.100> actually<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.490> face<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:53.970> center<00:02:54.300> of

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
there's actually a face in the center of

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.040 
there's actually a face in the center of
it<00:02:55.400> once<00:02:56.400> again<00:02:56.520> with<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.030> pips<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:57.959> the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
corners with the letter and then this

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.190 
corners with the letter and then this
the<00:02:59.970> soup<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.780> on<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.080> other

the soup it's on the on the other
corners<00:03:01.590> there<00:03:01.800> so<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.209> your<00:03:03.420> face<00:03:03.810> cards

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120

these<00:03:06.120> cards<00:03:07.010> do<00:03:08.010> not<00:03:08.190> fan<00:03:08.490> as<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.270> can<00:03:09.390> see

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
these cards do not fan as you can see

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.170 
these cards do not fan as you can see
good<00:03:10.470> luck<00:03:10.650> with<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:11.280> don't<00:03:11.940> know<00:03:12.060> if

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
good luck with that I don't know if

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.370 
good luck with that I don't know if
Fanning<00:03:12.480> powder<00:03:12.600> would<00:03:12.870> help<00:03:13.020> them<00:03:13.170> or<00:03:13.260> not

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
Fanning powder would help them or not

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.590 
Fanning powder would help them or not
but<00:03:13.650> they<00:03:13.800> just<00:03:14.070> they<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:14.640> stick<00:03:15.420> together

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
but they just they just stick together

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.000 
but they just they just stick together
when<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.080> try<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.320> fan<00:03:16.620> them<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.890> it's

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
when you try to fan them and it's

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.340 
when you try to fan them and it's
probably<00:03:17.459> because<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.910> ink<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.840> there

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
probably because of the ink on there

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.620 
probably because of the ink on there
there's<00:03:19.560> really<00:03:19.769> no<00:03:19.980> finish<00:03:20.430> over<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.420> top<00:03:21.600> of

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
there's really no finish over the top of

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.979 
there's really no finish over the top of
the<00:03:21.840> ink<00:03:22.160> spreading<00:03:23.160> them<00:03:23.280> if<00:03:23.489> you're<00:03:23.670> really

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
the ink spreading them if you're really

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.479 
the ink spreading them if you're really
gentle<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.470> really<00:03:25.739> take<00:03:25.950> your<00:03:26.070> time<00:03:26.130> you

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
gentle and you really take your time you

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.120 
gentle and you really take your time you
can<00:03:26.610> get<00:03:26.730> them<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.970> spread<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.390> little<00:03:27.510> bit<00:03:28.130> not

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
can get them to spread a little bit not

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.380 
can get them to spread a little bit not
the<00:03:29.310> best

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
the best

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.540 
the best
I<00:03:30.420> definitely<00:03:31.080> probably<00:03:32.070> wouldn't<00:03:32.370> suggest

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
I definitely probably wouldn't suggest

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.910 
I definitely probably wouldn't suggest
these<00:03:32.940> for<00:03:33.209> magic<00:03:33.570> at<00:03:33.720> all<00:03:33.810> just<00:03:34.620> because

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
these for magic at all just because

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.130 
these for magic at all just because
they're<00:03:35.330> because<00:03:36.330> they<00:03:36.450> do<00:03:36.510> stick<00:03:36.989> together

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
they're because they do stick together

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.350 
they're because they do stick together
like<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.709> when<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:37.950> try<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.160> fan<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.940> do

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
like that when you try to fan and do

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.650 
like that when you try to fan and do
stuff<00:03:39.540> like<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:40.130> ferrule<00:03:41.130> shuffling<00:03:41.660> you

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
stuff like that ferrule shuffling you

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.330 
stuff like that ferrule shuffling you
can<00:03:42.780> mess<00:03:43.290> around<00:03:43.320> with<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.890> little<00:03:44.160> bit

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
can mess around with that a little bit

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.039 
can mess around with that a little bit
they<00:03:44.519> do<00:03:44.580> ferrule<00:03:45.060> pretty<00:03:45.299> well<00:03:45.510> they<00:03:45.810> just

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
they do ferrule pretty well they just

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.199 
they do ferrule pretty well they just
kind<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.260> slide<00:03:46.530> together<00:03:46.890> nice<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.730> easy

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209
