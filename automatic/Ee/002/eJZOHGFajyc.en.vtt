00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.899
 hello on 01 photo takes today we will do a little tactical exercise 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:07.830
 Winter that consists of sticking 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.260
 to a banner on a wall like that their screams that is not very 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.219
 beautiful 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:14.350
 and we can stick 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.460
 as an exercise the banner of my blog the stairs 01 photo porque I 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.400
 manufactured not long ago 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.560
 I will go to recover 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.289
 in my computer and I will prevail 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.519
 obviously 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.399
 sure 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.630
 of this dessert 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.970
 thomas computor 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.320
 this is my way 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.150
 I will be quiet 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.920
 then the vida mans 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.120
 the same banner is there but like that eleven not very pretty we leave we did not 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.870
 not the impression that it is stuck to the wall 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.670
 so we will use a tool 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.990
 killer the little circuit any shape side all the time 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.250
 selected our banner 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.330
 we must be careful that we are well selected on the last 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.320
 chopped off 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.550
 which also had under seal the photo 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.700
 while sectioned the banner sent home here points in the six 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.650
 because I was leaning on 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.850
 unstable chesne 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.159
 so the p I'm programmed three points on the water 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.030
 advanced teams on the right so what does that mean 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.600
 that means I can now when I could have put more than five 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.150
 it is completed heading to the side of the classes that interests me 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.590
 is that on that side then what's the point now that I can 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.680
 one of the points 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.110
 and then put it 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.110
 adapt it to the wall 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.000
 as if summer 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.320
 if the way was 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.320
 furlong saumur 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.310
 we will try to do that with a perspective 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.520
 and say that lille 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.110
 here are not necessarily straight parallel stratford haste jacqueline 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.970
 of the cop who is going to be on the right to make a kind of 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.290
 nice perspective 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.869
 the query grew yesterday since the recipe closer 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.209
 Let's go 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.359
 that's about 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.930
 put the way pretty nicely my head to head 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.439
 put some right like saffron have made injured 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.099
 to grow a little further retirement followed 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.509
 too much 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.439
 since I think we are here we have a little too tight on the side so 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:30.909
 we go 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.379
 africa 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.379
 but I ended up unsuited my way 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:37.780
 surely 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.409
 the wall stick to them a little too showy 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.669
 I'm already going to pity I'm going to apply the transformation 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.669
 the koalas petrov haillan I can 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.020
 act on the basis the opacity of the first 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.020
 the first that accelerated case where is 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.829
 to make it look more serene than 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.149
 according to the numbers that the original and here I am finished 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.249
 I have more than 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.609
 it's a theme that I have here I have more than flatten the image to celebrate 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.819
 melnyk in any case they emit on a single image 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:15.590
 and I finished 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.539
 so we recruited him a little 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.869
 parent terrible courses that could have been tweaking a little more on the body of the 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.789
 groove box and still a small assembly 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:28.289
 and you're old enough to finish and I only have to frangy street the file 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:31.809
 it's all bad that the club 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.740
 I have three versions I will save it in gp2 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.649
 what you say fictitious 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.489
 it was not definitive 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.899
 I would not change years 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:40.760
 soumahoro 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.359
 and I want to make a compression of 70 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.579
 that's enough to insert in a block 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.639
 but that's it 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.479
 01 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:53.009
 this is the end of the world 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.049
 the tutorial world on 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.539
 inserting a banner into a message 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.099
 see you soon
