00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
at this moment and I thought I could

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.810 
at this moment and I thought I could
have<00:03:18.630> maybe<00:03:18.810> gone<00:03:19.350> on<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.650> win<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:20.010> but<00:03:20.549> maybe

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
have maybe gone on to win this but maybe

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.630 
have maybe gone on to win this but maybe
then<00:03:21.209> maybe<00:03:21.510> didn't<00:03:21.989> but<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:23.160> problem<00:03:23.519> was

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
then maybe didn't but the problem was

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.460 
then maybe didn't but the problem was
now<00:03:23.820> he<00:03:24.239> just<00:03:24.360> completely<00:03:24.750> annihilated<00:03:25.440> my

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
now he just completely annihilated my

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.560 
now he just completely annihilated my
entire<00:03:25.890> defensive<00:03:26.370> ronaldinho<00:03:26.970> i<00:03:27.060> will<00:03:27.390> take

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
the blame for that i did just completely

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.370

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
theme by a couple of years in the team

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.610 
theme by a couple of years in the team
and<00:04:22.520> yeah<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:23.880> we<00:04:24.449> did<00:04:24.660> start<00:04:24.930> off<00:04:25.139> with<00:04:25.590> the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
and yeah so we did start off with the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.650 
and yeah so we did start off with the
chance<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:26.310> of<00:04:26.460> course<00:04:26.490> he<00:04:27.000> would<00:04:27.120> score<00:04:27.389> it's

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
chance and of course he would score it's

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.210 
chance and of course he would score it's
because<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.320> is<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.530> way<00:04:28.560> ultimate<00:04:28.919> team<00:04:29.040> is

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
because that is the way ultimate team is

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.860 
because that is the way ultimate team is
South<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.580> second<00:04:29.970> time<00:04:30.120> in<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.300> row<00:04:30.330> I<00:04:30.600> did<00:04:30.780> go

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
South the second time in a row I did go

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.200 
South the second time in a row I did go
1-nil<00:04:31.350> down<00:04:31.410> so<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.340> was<00:04:32.550> thinking<00:04:32.699> this<00:04:32.970> could

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
1-nil down so I was thinking this could

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.689 
1-nil down so I was thinking this could
be<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.360> really<00:04:33.600> bad<00:04:33.900> year<00:04:34.139> for<00:04:34.199> FIFA<00:04:34.620> 15<00:04:34.770> but

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
be a really bad year for FIFA 15 but

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.460 
be a really bad year for FIFA 15 but
Shane<00:04:35.970> Long<00:04:36.180> he<00:04:36.360> was<00:04:36.510> there<00:04:36.720> again<00:04:36.960> he<00:04:37.050> gets<00:04:37.289> to

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
Shane Long he was there again he gets to

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.830 
Shane Long he was there again he gets to
on<00:04:37.590> goal<00:04:37.800> could<00:04:38.370> he<00:04:38.460> score<00:04:38.760> no<00:04:39.449> he<00:04:39.600> couldn't

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
on goal could he score no he couldn't

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.020 
on goal could he score no he couldn't

what he has missed so many in this video
so<00:04:44.580> far<00:04:44.850> but<00:04:45.810> hopefully<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.830> can<00:04:46.949> pick

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
so far but hopefully you can pick

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.219 
so far but hopefully you can pick
himself<00:04:47.280> up<00:04:47.550> for<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:47.729> future<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.240> hopefully

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
himself up for the future and hopefully

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.779 
himself up for the future and hopefully
can<00:04:49.530> grab<00:04:49.740> quite<00:04:49.949> a<00:04:49.979> few<00:04:50.160> more<00:04:50.280> goals<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.729> as

can grab quite a few more goals and as

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.189 
can grab quite a few more goals and as
you<00:04:50.880> can<00:04:50.970> see<00:04:51.000> a<00:04:51.060> geography<00:04:51.810> from<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:51.990> great

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
you can see a geography from a great

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.409 
you can see a geography from a great
ball<00:04:52.380> from<00:04:52.530> barclay<00:04:52.949> and<00:04:53.130> then<00:04:53.789> he'll<00:04:54.210> put<00:04:54.389> it

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
ball from barclay and then he'll put it

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.510 
ball from barclay and then he'll put it
away<00:04:54.630> obviously<00:04:54.960> cuz<00:04:55.710> etter<00:04:55.919> was<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.160> business

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
you know you guys we thinking how all i

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.790 
you know you guys we thinking how all i
do<00:05:02.669> is<00:05:02.820> just<00:05:03.150> say<00:05:03.930> bad<00:05:04.139> things<00:05:04.169> about<00:05:04.470> shane

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
do is just say bad things about shane

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.439 
do is just say bad things about shane
long<00:05:05.010> but<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.490> as<00:05:05.610> mr.<00:05:05.910> watch<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.330> learn

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
long but the as mr. watch and learn

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.029 
long but the as mr. watch and learn
oxlade-chamberlain<00:05:06.930> next<00:05:07.830> with<00:05:07.949> the

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
oxlade-chamberlain next with the

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.439 
oxlade-chamberlain next with the
transport<00:05:08.520> is<00:05:08.580> another<00:05:08.789> great<00:05:08.940> save<00:05:09.270> by<00:05:09.300> the

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
transport is another great save by the

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.390 
transport is another great save by the
keeper<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:10.080> then<00:05:10.530> i<00:05:10.560> guess<00:05:10.770> another<00:05:11.010> chance

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
keeper and then i guess another chance

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.250 
keeper and then i guess another chance
with<00:05:11.490> corker<00:05:12.090> but<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:12.600> keeper<00:05:12.750> saves<00:05:13.110> it

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
with corker but the keeper saves it

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.900 
with corker but the keeper saves it

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.460 
again this was kind of a game where
their<00:05:15.120> goalie<00:05:15.360> was<00:05:15.690> just<00:05:16.110> going<00:05:16.229> to<00:05:16.260> be<00:05:16.350> the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
their goalie was just going to be the

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.159 
their goalie was just going to be the
savior<00:05:16.650> for<00:05:16.979> their<00:05:17.130> team<00:05:17.340> which<00:05:18.080> pretty<00:05:19.080> much

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
savior for their team which pretty much
