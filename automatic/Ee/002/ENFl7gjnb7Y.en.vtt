00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.010
 bianchi 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.010
 it is 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.240
 matthias notes so i think that 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.860
 Shimano usually has a development like that 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.290
 as he naturally does things in the world 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.510
 a leading test and professional 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.310
 then convert into the consumer area 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.690
 Of course that was not the case in the case 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.130
 possible because the countless 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.560
 disc brakes hydraulic not 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.780
 has not yet admitted 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.430
 nevertheless, shimano is or are we from it 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.110
 convinced that, of course, for a whole 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.240
 row of drivers in different 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.320
 scenarios brings great benefits 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.869
 For example, you can use carbon rims Granny 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.140
 in principle just when he is his 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.130
 difficult 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.600
 braking force development it is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.140
 disc brakes are much better too 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.030
 to solve 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.890
 there are tracks with very long ones 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.170
 Departures to a consistently high 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.759
 brems performance prefers with 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.439
 achieve hydraulic disc brakes 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.700
 can 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.799
 especially in bad weather in winter 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.149
 Of course, this is an extreme system 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.459
 reliable and at a high level 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.770
 working so we were either us 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.200
 time the hydraulic disc brakes in 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.630
 certain operational areas in the rat 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.950
 area are meaningful and therefore have 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.049
 we made the development that way 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.299
 you can also see that the first system that 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.540
 We now offer at the politician level 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:20.360
 at the moment is still on the old diego 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.920
 because hydraulics still have a lot of room 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.120
 it requires impulses because the mechanics 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.650
 To accommodate would be very much 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.060
 difficult that can be with the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.490
 solve age-free 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.240
 the scan rena 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.960
 i think i'm a pope 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.990
 really important topic 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.530
 of not just now fort de france 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.720
 to start 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.840
 that was very easy because of that 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.720
 a trend 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.440
 technology why the drivers mark 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.459
 can offer 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.450
 why should not I too 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.930
 use 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.430
 in the year 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.920
 can be on the road for us 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.520
 now also normal in the net 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.430
 full day because of that was the net 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.110
 together 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.530
 especially 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.530
 standard racer is not oriented 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.810
 behind on the bike further to the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.770
 work or because he works with 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:23.020
 His buddies are not the supersports 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.020
 with her who often is 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.900
 missing in every weather 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.500
 for the maximum performance on 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.510
 therefore chances 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.660
 that's why my personal attitude 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.819
 on the subject area seems to everyone 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.950
 case 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.770
 in future business, whether it's after 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.200
 Emerging viruses will show the future 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.740
 but I personally think 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.820
 that we do that 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.820
 should pick up the topic 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:57.920
 either the theme is yes that is 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.710
 something of the market rental problem is 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.380
 just never that 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.870
 the areas of games operations driver made 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.830
 and our door 20 parties asked what 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.819
 you want more of a pension 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.189
 wanted to orient 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.370
 he should be in the American kreml 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:16.650
 area go in all shine anymore 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.259
 or all couleur real race so 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.239
 in the field and here was the trend 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:25.050
 very clear that the majority for it 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.970
 has pronounced neither in comfort 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.250
 make area and a road bike 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.940
 area that culture as the classic 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.280
 Euro 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.380
 ready as a comfort with ex-banker 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.540
 control short with more comfort in the 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.770
 frames at night arise here as 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.380
 conceptless series a already stated 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.680
 thanks with the geometry 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.680
 ready 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:54.340
 but slow down 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.340
 space for aprons and travel to 28 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.639
 look at the fair for the feedback 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.639
 that 's our little one deleted 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.230
 the part because for spring 15 as a motive
