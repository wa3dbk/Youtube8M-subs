00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.690
 very good all people I am claudio and today 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.869
 wants to sound a rne de cevallos a de brix 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.330
 play ya lucas castle is worth a good 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.919
 Once only these people are going to teach what 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.590
 what am I going to do now and it's worth today 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.960
 thought you can do the supernova against 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.240
 the energy pumps to see which is more 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.000
 powerful already you know that we are not going 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.190
 Freeze the freezer when it's ours 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.470
 teacher will give us on the last mission 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.780
 ok and the super rumba of energy is 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.390
 get in the first dlc of this game 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.230
 ok you know it 's a mission 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.200
 you have to defeat upson which 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.870
 good the nights that no 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.800
 I 'm always giving in our 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.320
 lessons 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.350
 these videos to see if I go to the mission 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.380
 number 15 I do not know if you like it if it's okay 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.710
 or not but I think it's a good fight 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.350
 to test them because we did not get to 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.000
 kill the fitr and we see pretty good 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.000
 we see the life that we dedicate to him 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.979
 Well now I tell you that I have put on 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.109
 sink to sink already know that with that 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.570
 mass is we start with everything equals and 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:22.290
 a perfect to do this kind of 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.300
 missions 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.030
 and well let's start with the others 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.350
 new we are going to add with your 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.350
 own technique worth 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.979
 and as you can see we have removed it almost 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.890
 all life not all but in almost all 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.530
 we have lowered it quite drunk alcohol 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.360
 let's try it superman in the ejido 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.310
 see which of the two it hits over his 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.210
 defects that they have if they have and 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.210
 well let's go there we go 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.340
 we could make a verdict let's see 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.340
 If so, no no 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.490
 buzz 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.080
 I would say they are more or less more or 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.670
 less have the same games hit a 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.050
 little bit more the day can be and arrived 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.250
 a little bit more the supernova than now 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.100
 won it will become people 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.370
 well let's try the supernova in addition 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.750
 there is a good thing now I am going to tell you 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.460
 the things that we like the other ships 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.800
 which was better because the fastest of 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.440
 the others with bad energy but having 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.840
 in account fear gave to the sector of 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.650
 energy but good is better best action 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.650
 You can try something else 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.950
 ok we are giving you an energy 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.830
 while we are giving we make another 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.110
 worth 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.810
 well this is an advantage of making 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.880
 energy while we are eating 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.370
 the damage but not energy we can 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.709
 get to throw another vale 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.209
 is the author is not going let's try to see 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.530
 if you can because I think the others 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.720
 new sticks a little bit more worth nothing almost 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.959
 nothing more but good something yes that 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.959
 note 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.120
 well now we can make another 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.110
 good and the mondiale has just done the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.780
 bathroom all the sites that we and with 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.270
 the ball but well I think it's better 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.640
 the others the supernova I also think that 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.650
 load much faster than the supreme 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.730
 of energy so for me channel sugar 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.000
 novales good 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.040
 Now I would like you to comment on us 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.730
 which ones you liked the most but do not go to waves 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.110
 autonomous energy but now it touches the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.940
 final duel I'm going to change the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.159
 superwoman energy because for me I think 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.140
 that wins the others nothing and I'm going to 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:01.720
 change 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.720
 for the super evanescent ball worth 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.650
 here is super bowl teenager I think 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.880
 they 're going to the superbowl dawn because 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.750
 well my stability I like very much 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.390
 you already know it is very very very powerful and 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.049
 good is that you have your rivals have 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.049
 exit of the ball 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:30.650
 well these would be the three more balls 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.390
 powerful of the game although there is one that 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.910
 it's his 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.070
 of the mirabal in which he also got 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.040
 in the second of which is also a 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.740
 ball and they are big but I think that 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.120
 it's not so nice oil good we already know 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.530
 what hits the others does not go so 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.530
 let's make the superbowl to know 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.619
 well then we will be opening the whole 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.069
 but I would say that they are also very very 

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:57.069
 Wall 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.650
 let's prove to us it's not going 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.520
 and well let's try then define 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.520
 which it is better AlbalÃ¡ 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:21.719
 I would say that it is more or less the same 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.409
 and good is not the time of us but 

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:29.539
 well I think that I am staying with 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.089
 the teen superbowl that is not going for you 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.719
 little bit faster when loading 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:34.719
 OK 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.860
 to what you think is best 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.040
 we do not go but good people or 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.320
 the super energy pump I give me 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.840
 by the evanescent superbowl I do not know 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.310
 tip you so well you know 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.810
 that you can leave your comments 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:57.030
 with your good with usher you believe 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.380
 you who is better already know that 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.540
 you can also donate it to that 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.800
 because the video and good people I hope that 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.270
 you liked it and see you in the 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.270
 next until after
