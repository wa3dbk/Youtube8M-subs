of<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> dewy<00:01:14.040> finish<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.850> perfect<00:01:15.330> for

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
of a dewy finish so it is perfect for

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.960 
of a dewy finish so it is perfect for
everyday<00:01:15.750> because<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> does<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.130> SPF<00:01:17.580> 40

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.969 
everyday because it does have SPF 40
it's<00:01:18.119> probably<00:01:18.600> not<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.140> best<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.650> photos

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it's probably not the best for photos

it's probably not the best for photos
just<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.610> some<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> oxides<00:01:21.619> titanium

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
just because some of the oxides titanium

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.410 
just because some of the oxides titanium
dioxide<00:01:22.740> zinc<00:01:23.159> oxide<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.970> gives<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> sun

protection<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:25.229> flash<00:01:25.530> back<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:26.040> bit

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
protection can flash back a little bit

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.249 
protection can flash back a little bit
white<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.479> perfect<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.049> everyday

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259

liquidy foundation I believe quote me if
I'm<00:05:45.190> wrong<00:05:45.340> but<00:05:45.490> I<00:05:45.580> believe<00:05:45.610> it<00:05:46.000> is<00:05:46.120> oil<00:05:46.390> and

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
I'm wrong but I believe it is oil and

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.580 
I'm wrong but I believe it is oil and
water<00:05:46.960> free<00:05:47.410> it<00:05:48.280> is<00:05:48.340> made<00:05:48.700> of<00:05:49.030> a<00:05:49.300> what<00:05:50.050> base<00:05:50.290> is

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
water free it is made of a what base is

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.750 
water free it is made of a what base is
it<00:05:50.740> you<00:05:50.860> know<00:05:50.950> what<00:05:51.070> I'm<00:05:51.190> gonna<00:05:51.310> have<00:05:51.460> to<00:05:51.580> check

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
it you know what I'm gonna have to check

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.220 
it you know what I'm gonna have to check
and<00:05:51.940> I'll<00:05:52.000> write<00:05:52.150> it<00:05:52.240> right<00:05:52.270> here<00:05:52.390> but<00:05:53.140> I'm

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
and I'll write it right here but I'm

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.690 
and I'll write it right here but I'm
pretty<00:05:53.410> sure<00:05:53.620> it's<00:05:53.770> oil<00:05:53.950> and<00:05:54.130> water<00:05:54.220> free<00:05:54.520> it

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
pretty sure it's oil and water free it

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.940 
pretty sure it's oil and water free it
comes<00:05:54.790> kind<00:05:55.120> of<00:05:55.180> in<00:05:55.270> a<00:05:55.330> dropper<00:05:55.750> top<00:05:56.020> um<00:05:56.320> so<00:05:56.830> it

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
comes kind of in a dropper top um so it

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.500 
comes kind of in a dropper top um so it
is<00:05:57.040> very<00:05:57.250> very<00:05:57.400> liquidy<00:05:57.850> when<00:05:58.000> you<00:05:58.090> apply<00:05:58.450> it

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
is very very liquidy when you apply it

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.540 
is very very liquidy when you apply it
and<00:05:59.350> it<00:05:59.410> does<00:05:59.620> dry<00:05:59.830> pretty<00:06:00.040> quickly<00:06:00.310> but

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
and it does dry pretty quickly but

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.960 
and it does dry pretty quickly but
what's<00:06:00.730> amazing<00:06:01.030> is<00:06:01.360> that<00:06:01.419> this<00:06:01.720> is<00:06:01.990> so<00:06:02.970> light

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
what's amazing is that this is so light

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.860 
what's amazing is that this is so light
like<00:06:04.300> it's<00:06:04.600> so<00:06:05.140> sheer<00:06:05.830> it<00:06:06.340> covers<00:06:06.880> well<00:06:07.150> but<00:06:07.780> it

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
like it's so sheer it covers well but it

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.870 
like it's so sheer it covers well but it
feels<00:06:08.140> so<00:06:08.470> sheer<00:06:09.190> when<00:06:09.370> you<00:06:09.460> put<00:06:09.640> it<00:06:09.730> on

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
feels so sheer when you put it on

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.880 
feels so sheer when you put it on
because<00:06:10.780> it<00:06:10.900> literally<00:06:11.140> just<00:06:11.260> blends<00:06:11.680> into

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
because it literally just blends into

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.470 
because it literally just blends into
