00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.630
 hello how about very good guys 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:08.799
 Welcome to this new gameplay of 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:11.589
 young golden go harry potter 14 years like this 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.599
 that we are with a new video and I hope 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.849
 I wish you like it 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:20.000
 you know that the ghost will not guide us 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:23.869
 all the places where you may have to go 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.360
 to read let's go ahead of us since 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.380
 we also have some arrows 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.840
 those giants up there on the door 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.100
 so we have to follow them and it's worth 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.739
 so take what I'm going to find 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.739
 Well, I think we have some kind of 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.070
 i 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.780
 ah 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.250
 It's very good, guys, we're here 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.370
 again and what we have to do 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.610
 I know they are coming out 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.450
 those three doors about 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.330
 skeletons or something like that of wood or what 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.420
 be but good, we have to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.130
 stop them 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.490
 very well 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.700
 worth Harry Potter has to stop at 5 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.700
 very well and there is the perfect fifth 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.390
 Now you have to do the same roaming 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.380
 before the red lines arrive 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.990
 it's perfect 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:49.200
 we lack dogmas for the blue coin 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.200
 and there is the last perfect very well 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.890
 to see what else and now what happens 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.830
 and everyone 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.920
 nothing 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.260
 ok guys, it seems that now 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.500
 we have to get into the duel or something 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.850
 so with my 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.580
 our companion abc 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.190
 it's worth seeing, we have to throw him 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.220
 spells with our wand and make it 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.220
 arrive 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.239
 He is right we have taken away 2 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.879
 so it moves 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.990
 and this the fourth and there is the fifth 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.990
 perfect very well 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.750

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:03.610

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.610

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.830
 Y 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.379
