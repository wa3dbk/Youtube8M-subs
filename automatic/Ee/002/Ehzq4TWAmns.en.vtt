unboxing but then I don't I have I have

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.359 
unboxing but then I don't I have I have
accidentally<00:00:24.269> opened<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> box<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.590> I'll<00:00:26.130> just

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
accidentally opened the box so I'll just

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.370 
accidentally opened the box so I'll just
do<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> quick<00:00:27.269> overview<00:00:27.449> about<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.109> product

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
do a quick overview about this product

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.980 
do a quick overview about this product
and<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.550> show<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.970> actual<00:00:30.119> image<00:00:30.630> or

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
and just to show you the actual image or

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.090 
and just to show you the actual image or
actual<00:00:31.410> picture<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:33.770> fully<00:00:34.770> modular

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
actual picture of these fully modular

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.780 
actual picture of these fully modular
power<00:00:35.640> supply<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.390> only<00:00:37.309> 3000<00:00:38.309> pages<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
power supply that is only 3000 pages and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:47.060 
power supply that is only 3000 pages and
below<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:40.879> C<00:00:41.879> Sonic<00:00:42.329> evil<00:00:44.750> 521<00:00:45.750> 80<00:00:46.559> %

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
below so it's C Sonic evil 521 80 %

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.260 
below so it's C Sonic evil 521 80 %
bronze<00:00:48.440> power<00:00:49.440> supply<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.129> only<00:00:50.370> 3<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.969> think

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
bronze power supply with only 3 I think

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.760 
bronze power supply with only 3 I think
it's<00:00:51.449> three<00:00:51.780> thousand<00:00:52.230> two<00:00:52.350> hundred<00:00:52.379> fifty

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it's three thousand two hundred fifty

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.810 
it's three thousand two hundred fifty
I'm<00:00:53.070> sorry<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.520> that

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I'm sorry for that

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.660 
I'm sorry for that
okay<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.550> 3,250<00:00:57.469> okay<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.859> let's<00:00:59.399> take<00:00:59.609> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
okay it's a 3,250 okay so let's take a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.760 
okay it's a 3,250 okay so let's take a
look<00:00:59.910> at<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> Box<00:01:00.239> first

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
look at the Box first

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.939 
look at the Box first
the<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:02.129> sonic<00:01:02.399> box<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:03.780> says<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.379> here<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.739> 80

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the see sonic box it says in here the 80

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.080 
the see sonic box it says in here the 80
plus<00:01:05.309> bronze

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
plus bronze

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.109 
plus bronze
so<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> means<00:01:06.689> 80%<00:01:07.049> efficiency<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
so it means 80% efficiency and then the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.929 
so it means 80% efficiency and then the
Japanese<00:01:09.960> solid<00:01:10.530> capacitors<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.700> can

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
Japanese solid capacitors that can

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.640 
Japanese solid capacitors that can
sustain<00:01:12.119> an<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.110> 105<00:01:13.890> degree<00:01:14.280> Celsius<00:01:15.650> PCIe

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
sustain an up to 105 degree Celsius PCIe

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.249 
sustain an up to 105 degree Celsius PCIe
so<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.360> two<00:01:18.600> PCI<00:01:18.930> CLE<00:01:19.880> connectors<00:01:20.880> or

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
so there are two PCI CLE connectors or

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.170 
so there are two PCI CLE connectors or
that<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.400> included<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that you can that is included in the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.359 
that you can that is included in the
cables<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:25.350> should<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.920> included<00:01:26.009> in

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
cables this should not be included in

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.120 
cables this should not be included in
here<00:01:26.580> anymore

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
here anymore

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.749 
here anymore
alright<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> model<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.000> am<00:01:30.479> 12<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.799> 5<00:01:32.310> 20

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
alright and the model is am 12 to 5 20

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.510 
alright and the model is am 12 to 5 20

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
to 99% see Sonic's mostly known when it

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.960

comes to silent fan and good cooling

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.450 
comes to silent fan and good cooling
system<00:01:54.450> they<00:01:55.110> didn't<00:01:55.409> sacrifice<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.280> good

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
system they didn't sacrifice the good

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.209

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.940 
power cord that you will plug it down
okay<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:49.080> will<00:04:49.230> plug<00:04:49.470> all<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.800> these

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
okay so you will plug all of these

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.700 
okay so you will plug all of these
cables<00:04:50.370> it's<00:04:50.640> six<00:04:50.910> pins<00:04:51.210> so<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.110> can<00:04:52.260> plug<00:04:52.560> it

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
cables it's six pins so you can plug it

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.280 
cables it's six pins so you can plug it
here<00:04:55.100> alright

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
here alright

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.180 
here alright
yes<00:04:58.290> you<00:04:58.950> can<00:04:59.130> plug<00:04:59.340> it<00:04:59.490> here<00:05:00.260> these<00:05:01.260> cables

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
yes you can plug it here these cables

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.770 
yes you can plug it here these cables
any<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:05.070> depends<00:05:05.610> on<00:05:05.700> your<00:05:05.820> design<00:05:06.000> or<00:05:06.330> what<00:05:06.600> do

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
any it depends on your design or what do

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.800 
any it depends on your design or what do
you<00:05:06.810> need<00:05:07.020> if<00:05:07.380> you<00:05:07.560> need<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.950> 8<00:05:08.760> pins<00:05:09.090> then<00:05:09.390> you

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
you need if you need the 8 pins then you

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.020 
you need if you need the 8 pins then you
plug<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.200> 8<00:05:10.350> pins

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
plug the 8 pins

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.730 
plug the 8 pins
so<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.090> course<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:13.020> your<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:16.140> will<00:05:16.260> only<00:05:16.530> plug

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
so of course you your you will only plug

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.320 
so of course you your you will only plug
but<00:05:16.950> you<00:05:17.100> need<00:05:17.280> that<00:05:17.520> is<00:05:17.610> why<00:05:17.730> you<00:05:17.790> buy<00:05:18.030> it<00:05:18.090> you

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
but you need that is why you buy it you

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.960 
but you need that is why you buy it you
buy<00:05:18.570> modular<00:05:19.260> Keeler<00:05:20.190> power<00:05:20.370> supplies<00:05:20.790> so

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
buy modular Keeler power supplies so

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.390 
buy modular Keeler power supplies so
that<00:05:21.120> you<00:05:21.480> will<00:05:21.600> minimize<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.800> cables<00:05:23.220> that

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
that you will minimize the cables that
