00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
judgment of this keyboard is actually a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.650 
judgment of this keyboard is actually a

different<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> das<00:01:05.040> keyboard<00:01:05.479> that<00:01:06.479> was

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
different to the das keyboard that was

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.679 
different to the das keyboard that was
my<00:01:06.810> last<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.790> keyboard<00:01:09.240> even<00:01:09.540> though
