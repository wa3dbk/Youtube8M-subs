00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
well he blundered this piece which is

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.570 
well he blundered this piece which is
which<00:05:12.639> put<00:05:12.909> in<00:05:13.000> a<00:05:13.180> quick<00:05:13.659> son<00:05:14.139> end<00:05:14.409> to<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.680> game

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
which put in a quick son end to the game

which put in a quick son end to the game
um<00:05:15.669> I'm<00:05:16.210> not<00:05:16.389> sure<00:05:16.449> if<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:17.020> if<00:05:17.289> you<00:05:17.409> really

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
um I'm not sure if you if you really

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.149 
um I'm not sure if you if you really
want<00:05:17.949> to<00:05:18.099> go<00:05:18.280> on<00:05:18.550> if<00:05:18.849> you<00:05:19.300> want<00:05:19.539> to<00:05:19.659> go<00:05:19.949> h3<00:05:20.949> here

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
want to go on if you want to go h3 here

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.170 
want to go on if you want to go h3 here
in<00:05:21.310> response<00:05:21.819> to<00:05:22.060> a<00:05:22.090> six<00:05:22.569> I<00:05:24.060> think<00:05:25.060> it's

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
in response to a six I think it's

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.059 
in response to a six I think it's
actually<00:05:25.360> not<00:05:25.689> a<00:05:25.750> bad<00:05:25.840> idea<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.319> go<00:05:26.620> away<00:05:26.770> for

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
actually not a bad idea to go away for

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.350 
actually not a bad idea to go away for
just<00:05:27.280> just<00:05:28.060> stop<00:05:28.330> just<00:05:28.599> stop<00:05:28.990> the<00:05:29.379> b5<00:05:29.770> IDM

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
just just stop just stop the b5 IDM

just just stop just stop the b5 IDM
beehive<00:05:31.360> is<00:05:31.599> a<00:05:31.629> is<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.110> move<00:05:32.409> that<00:05:32.620> is<00:05:32.860> some<00:05:33.550> yeah

beehive is a is a move that is some yeah

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.240 
beehive is a is a move that is some yeah
its<00:05:34.509> ambitious<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:35.259> quite<00:05:35.740> often<00:05:36.009> actually

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
its ambitious and quite often actually

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.010 
its ambitious and quite often actually
good<00:05:37.180> for<00:05:37.360> black<00:05:37.599> as<00:05:37.810> long<00:05:37.870> as<00:05:38.319> the<00:05:39.099> queenside

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
good for black as long as the queenside

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.990 
good for black as long as the queenside
weaknesses<00:05:41.020> cannot<00:05:41.650> be<00:05:41.860> exploited<00:05:42.550> quickly

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
weaknesses cannot be exploited quickly

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.330 
weaknesses cannot be exploited quickly
and<00:05:43.180> a<00:05:43.389> force<00:05:43.750> a<00:05:43.900> way<00:05:44.409> to<00:05:44.469> stop<00:05:44.889> b5<00:05:45.629> sometimes

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
and a force a way to stop b5 sometimes

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.119 
and a force a way to stop b5 sometimes
sometimes<00:05:48.340> if<00:05:48.789> we<00:05:49.300> go<00:05:49.629> back<00:05:49.840> it's<00:05:50.500> about<00:05:50.650> move

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
sometimes if we go back it's about move

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.430 
sometimes if we go back it's about move
orders<00:05:51.520> here<00:05:51.699> but<00:05:51.940> let's<00:05:52.659> say<00:05:52.870> here<00:05:53.169> here<00:05:53.409> a

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
orders here but let's say here here a

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.909 
orders here but let's say here here a
six<00:05:53.860> is<00:05:54.069> not<00:05:54.250> good<00:05:54.520> or<00:05:55.419> anything<00:05:55.960> okay<00:05:56.469> you<00:05:56.740> can

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
six is not good or anything okay you can

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.540 
six is not good or anything okay you can
play<00:05:57.159> that<00:05:57.340> but<00:05:58.139> c4<00:05:59.139> is<00:05:59.259> coming<00:05:59.590> and<00:05:59.740> then<00:05:59.949> be

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
play that but c4 is coming and then be

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.959 
play that but c4 is coming and then be
five<00:06:00.789> is<00:06:01.030> completely<00:06:01.569> impossible<00:06:02.370> or<00:06:03.370> there

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
five is completely impossible or there

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:07.080 
five is completely impossible or there
are<00:06:04.090> also<00:06:04.270> sometimes<00:06:04.659> ideas<00:06:05.729> like<00:06:06.729> let's<00:06:07.000> say

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
are also sometimes ideas like let's say

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.570 
are also sometimes ideas like let's say
here<00:06:07.479> and<00:06:07.629> now<00:06:07.690> be<00:06:08.529> five<00:06:08.770> can<00:06:09.039> be<00:06:09.190> answered

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
here and now be five can be answered

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.089 
here and now be five can be answered
with<00:06:09.729> a<00:06:09.759> four<00:06:10.240> there's<00:06:10.629> no<00:06:10.930> knight<00:06:11.199> on<00:06:11.500> c3<00:06:11.710> that

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
with a four there's no knight on c3 that

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.610 
with a four there's no knight on c3 that
can<00:06:12.310> be<00:06:12.460> attacked<00:06:12.810> but<00:06:13.810> whenever<00:06:14.110> there<00:06:14.469> is<00:06:14.500> a

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
can be attacked but whenever there is a

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.610 
can be attacked but whenever there is a
knight<00:06:14.919> on<00:06:15.099> c3<00:06:15.340> b5<00:06:16.000> gains<00:06:16.719> billion<00:06:17.199> strength

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
knight on c3 b5 gains billion strength

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.200 
knight on c3 b5 gains billion strength
and<00:06:17.949> I<00:06:18.129> think<00:06:18.460> you<00:06:18.580> really<00:06:18.849> should<00:06:19.060> consider

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
and I think you really should consider

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.649 
and I think you really should consider
to<00:06:19.690> go<00:06:19.840> be<00:06:20.050> five<00:06:20.289> at<00:06:20.560> go<00:06:20.830> to<00:06:20.979> Goa<00:06:21.159> form

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:21.659 
to go be five at go to Goa form

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.450 
to go be five at go to Goa form
something<00:06:22.659> like<00:06:22.960> that<00:06:23.259> it's<00:06:24.190> also

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
something like that it's also

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.969 
something like that it's also
interesting<00:06:24.789> just<00:06:25.449> going<00:06:26.169> for<00:06:26.379> development

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
interesting just going for development

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:29.249 
interesting just going for development
because<00:06:27.669> it's<00:06:27.909> not<00:06:28.120> clear<00:06:28.419> this<00:06:28.690> is<00:06:28.870> actually

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259 
because it's not clear this is actually

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.920 
because it's not clear this is actually
possible<00:06:29.469> yeah<00:06:29.979> this<00:06:30.430> is<00:06:30.580> attacking<00:06:31.029> upon<00:06:31.690> and

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
possible yeah this is attacking upon and

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.680 
possible yeah this is attacking upon and
I<00:06:32.529> have<00:06:32.710> nothing<00:06:33.190> developed<00:06:33.849> as<00:06:33.969> black<00:06:34.240> so<00:06:34.479> I

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
I have nothing developed as black so I

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.010 
I have nothing developed as black so I
might<00:06:35.680> have<00:06:35.919> to<00:06:35.949> to<00:06:36.819> continue<00:06:37.360> like<00:06:37.509> that<00:06:37.539> and

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
might have to to continue like that and

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.769 
might have to to continue like that and
yeah<00:06:38.229> well<00:06:38.379> you<00:06:38.500> know<00:06:38.680> maybe<00:06:39.279> e5<00:06:39.940> on<00:06:40.300> some<00:06:40.539> some

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:40.779 
yeah well you know maybe e5 on some some

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:43.320 
yeah well you know maybe e5 on some some
other<00:06:40.960> idea<00:06:41.319> just<00:06:42.099> play<00:06:42.310> a<00:06:42.339> bit<00:06:42.580> more<00:06:42.759> dynamic

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
other idea just play a bit more dynamic

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.350 
other idea just play a bit more dynamic
than<00:06:43.539> dynamically<00:06:44.440> then<00:06:44.740> with<00:06:44.919> a<00:06:44.949> three<00:06:45.370> okay

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
than dynamically then with a three okay

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.169 
than dynamically then with a three okay
well<00:06:46.539> thanks<00:06:47.020> for<00:06:47.139> watching
