very<00:01:03.390> poorly<00:01:03.870> designed<00:01:04.159> when<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.309> extend<00:01:05.580> it

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
very poorly designed when you extend it

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.270 
very poorly designed when you extend it
you<00:01:07.229> don't<00:01:07.470> know<00:01:07.590> anything<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> router

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
you don't know anything about the router

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.109 
you don't know anything about the router
even<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.479> series<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.869> expendable<00:01:10.770> rod<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
even in a series of expendable rod and

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.240 
even in a series of expendable rod and
then<00:01:13.520> this<00:01:14.520> part<00:01:14.790> flips<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:15.450> into<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:17.100> that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
then this part flips out into like that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.030 
then this part flips out into like that
little<00:01:17.460> tricorder<00:01:18.270> thing<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.290> make<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
little tricorder thing to make the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.940 
little tricorder thing to make the
corruption<00:01:20.549> bolt<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.600> clover<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.710> i'll

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
corruption bolt or the clover and i'll

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.530 
corruption bolt or the clover and i'll
show<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> right<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.450> can

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
show it to you right now so as you can

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.719 
show it to you right now so as you can
see<00:01:27.810> from<00:01:28.130> when<00:01:29.130> i<00:01:29.159> opened<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.290> these<00:01:31.290> bounce

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
see from when i opened it these bounce

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.090 
see from when i opened it these bounce
they<00:01:32.729> don't<00:01:32.909> walk<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.299> at<00:01:33.420> all<00:01:33.619> which<00:01:34.619> i<00:01:34.920> feel

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
they don't walk in at all which i feel

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.300 
they don't walk in at all which i feel
is<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.579> bad<00:01:35.759> design<00:01:36.119> flaw<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:37.310> don't

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
is a really bad design flaw I don't

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.800 
is a really bad design flaw I don't
understand<00:01:38.700> why<00:01:38.820> they<00:01:39.000> couldn't<00:01:39.210> have

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
understand why they couldn't have

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.649 
understand why they couldn't have
included<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.470> locking<00:01:40.860> mechanism<00:01:41.360> TP<00:01:42.360> from

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
included a locking mechanism TP from

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.780 
included a locking mechanism TP from
doing<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:45.079> if<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.140> close<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.790> they're

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
doing this if you close it they're

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.210 
doing this if you close it they're
locked<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.630> bit<00:01:48.720> better<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.470> not<00:01:50.070> by

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
locked in a little bit better but not by

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.429 
locked in a little bit better but not by
much<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.659> reason<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.409> because

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
much and the reason for that is because

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.380 
much and the reason for that is because
when<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.950> close<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.579> has<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.939> mechanism

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
when you close it it has the mechanism

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.200 
when you close it it has the mechanism
in<00:01:54.450> under<00:01:54.630> lock<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.110> place<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:56.210> so

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
in under lock it in place like this so

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.780 
in under lock it in place like this so
overall<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:58.469> really<00:01:59.130> bad<00:01:59.369> design

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
overall it's a really really bad design

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.380 
overall it's a really really bad design
flaw<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:01.070> probably<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.030> one

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
flaw and that's probably one the one

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.160 
flaw and that's probably one the one
thing<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.780> really

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
thing I really

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.370 
thing I really
room<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.710> store<00:02:05.450> other<00:02:06.450> than<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:07.080> allowed

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
room to store other than that be allowed

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.199 
room to store other than that be allowed
to<00:02:07.530> what<00:02:07.680> seems<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.160> garden<00:02:08.489> rouser<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:09.060> the

with<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.380> undercards<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:03.220> find<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.490> most

with the undercards I find that the most

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.310 
with the undercards I find that the most
accurate<00:03:04.880> way<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.240> keep<00:03:05.570> these<00:03:05.720> in<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.020> holder

accurate way to keep these in the holder

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.020 
accurate way to keep these in the holder
is<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:08.540> face<00:03:08.780> towards<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.560> body<00:03:09.740> with<00:03:10.730> the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
pretty much that other than that doesn't

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.580 
pretty much that other than that doesn't
really<00:03:55.820> have<00:03:56.090> any<00:03:56.630> other<00:03:56.810> features<00:03:57.230> except

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
really have any other features except

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.550 
really have any other features except
for<00:03:57.800> the<00:03:58.150> standard<00:03:59.150> weapons<00:03:59.720> found<00:04:00.140> that<00:04:00.440> it

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
for the standard weapons found that it

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.670

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
comes with which is this weird little

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:13.570 
comes with which is this weird little
squishing<00:04:04.060> pack<00:04:05.060> sound<00:04:11.740> so<00:04:12.740> I<00:04:12.920> guess<00:04:13.100> sounds

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
squishing pack sound so I guess sounds

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.320 
squishing pack sound so I guess sounds
close<00:04:14.210> enough<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:15.070> attack<00:04:16.070> with<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.340> broad

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
close enough to attack with a broad

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:23.410 
close enough to attack with a broad
bladed<00:04:18.140> broad<00:04:18.620> weapon<00:04:19.160> thing<00:04:22.060> like<00:04:23.060> i<00:04:23.180> said
