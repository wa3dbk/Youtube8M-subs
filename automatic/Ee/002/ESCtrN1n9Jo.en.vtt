architecture<00:05:42.069> they<00:05:42.849> know<00:05:43.120> how<00:05:43.750> to<00:05:43.779> program

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.469

for<00:05:44.889> it<00:05:45.039> so<00:05:45.610> I<00:05:45.909> just<00:05:46.629> don't<00:05:46.899> it<00:05:47.259> concerns<00:05:47.919> me

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
for it so I just don't it concerns me

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.659 
for it so I just don't it concerns me
like<00:05:48.939> I've<00:05:49.120> said<00:05:49.149> time<00:05:49.779> and<00:05:50.169> time<00:05:50.259> again<00:05:50.889> yes

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
like I've said time and time again yes

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.300 
like I've said time and time again yes
cinema<00:05:52.149> blend<00:05:52.300> is<00:05:52.569> right<00:05:52.810> these<00:05:53.589> systems<00:05:54.099> are

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
cinema blend is right these systems are

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.490 
cinema blend is right these systems are
going<00:05:54.639> to<00:05:54.729> scale<00:05:55.029> well<00:05:55.300> because<00:05:55.750> developers

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
going to scale well because developers

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.290 
going to scale well because developers
already<00:05:56.800> know<00:05:56.949> what<00:05:57.129> they're<00:05:57.310> doing<00:05:57.669> so<00:05:58.180> if

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
already know what they're doing so if

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.939 
already know what they're doing so if
anything<00:05:58.629> it's<00:05:59.110> not<00:05:59.500> they're<00:05:59.710> going<00:05:59.889> to

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
anything it's not they're going to

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.070 
anything it's not they're going to
unlock<00:06:00.310> things<00:06:00.659> developers<00:06:01.659> are<00:06:01.689> good<00:06:01.899> it's

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
unlock things developers are good it's

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.809

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:03.819 
going to be the exact opposite they're

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.639

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:07.559 
going to feel even more limited by the
hardware<00:06:06.069> because<00:06:06.639> they've<00:06:06.879> already<00:06:07.060> maxed

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
hardware because they've already maxed

down<00:06:10.569> the<00:06:10.779> line<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:11.680> ps4<00:06:12.129> and<00:06:12.610> xbox<00:06:13.120> one<00:06:13.240> are

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
down the line the ps4 and xbox one are

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.629 
down the line the ps4 and xbox one are
going<00:06:14.349> to<00:06:14.409> be<00:06:14.529> even<00:06:14.710> as<00:06:14.919> sooner<00:06:15.310> than<00:06:15.460> that

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
going to be even as sooner than that

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.519 
going to be even as sooner than that
they're<00:06:15.879> going<00:06:16.029> to<00:06:16.120> be<00:06:16.240> complete<00:06:16.750> dogs<00:06:17.110> and

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
they're going to be complete dogs and

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.399 
they're going to be complete dogs and
developers<00:06:18.460> are<00:06:18.610> going<00:06:18.789> to<00:06:18.849> be<00:06:19.029> limited<00:06:19.599> by

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
developers are going to be limited by

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:22.559 
developers are going to be limited by
the<00:06:20.889> eighth<00:06:21.039> generation<00:06:21.370> of<00:06:21.849> hardware<00:06:22.300> and

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569 
the eighth generation of hardware and

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.719 
the eighth generation of hardware and
i'm<00:06:22.990> not<00:06:23.020> talking<00:06:23.199> about<00:06:23.649> resolutions<00:06:24.189> when

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
i'm not talking about resolutions when

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:25.889 
i'm not talking about resolutions when
they're<00:06:24.879> trying<00:06:25.180> it<00:06:25.360> maybe<00:06:25.539> they're<00:06:25.689> trying

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:25.899 
they're trying it maybe they're trying

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:27.899 
they're trying it maybe they're trying
to<00:06:26.050> create<00:06:26.319> an<00:06:26.439> engine<00:06:26.830> that<00:06:27.009> has<00:06:27.460> a<00:06:27.490> certain

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909 
to create an engine that has a certain

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.179 
to create an engine that has a certain

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:30.189 
kind of artificial intelligence in it or

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:31.589 
kind of artificial intelligence in it or
yeah<00:06:30.399> maybe<00:06:30.639> graphics<00:06:31.240> they're<00:06:31.419> going<00:06:31.539> to

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
yeah maybe graphics they're going to

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.050 
yeah maybe graphics they're going to
have<00:06:31.750> some<00:06:31.960> kind<00:06:32.080> of<00:06:32.199> certain<00:06:33.060> environment

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
have some kind of certain environment

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.159 
have some kind of certain environment
they're<00:06:34.180> going<00:06:34.330> to<00:06:34.389> want<00:06:34.479> to<00:06:34.569> implement<00:06:34.899> and

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
they're going to want to implement and

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:36.920 
they're going to want to implement and
because<00:06:35.860> of<00:06:35.889> the<00:06:36.159> limited

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930
