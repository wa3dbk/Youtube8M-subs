but<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> don't<00:00:43.950> think<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.219> too<00:00:44.340> much<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
but I don't think it's too much of a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.209 
but I don't think it's too much of a
loss<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:45.270> by<00:00:45.510> far<00:00:45.870> Wonder<00:00:46.620> Woman<00:00:46.860> has<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
loss because by far Wonder Woman has the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.720 
loss because by far Wonder Woman has the
finest<00:00:47.730> scope<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.780> entire<00:00:49.079> box<00:00:49.500> set<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:50.550> we

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
finest scope in the entire box set as we

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.400 
finest scope in the entire box set as we
can<00:00:50.850> see<00:00:51.030> she<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.270> maybe<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.870> only<00:00:52.199> figure

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
can see she is maybe the only figure

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.970 
can see she is maybe the only figure
that<00:00:52.890> possesses<00:00:53.399> new<00:00:53.610> 52<00:00:54.300> specific<00:00:55.140> sculpting

need<00:02:34.360> one<00:02:34.739> as<00:02:35.739> much<00:02:35.920> as<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.130> would<00:02:36.220> like<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.400> head

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
need one as much as I would like to head

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.449 
need one as much as I would like to head
to<00:02:36.670> turn<00:02:36.959> because<00:02:37.959> her<00:02:38.230> hair<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.470> pretty<00:02:39.100> stiff

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
to turn because her hair is pretty stiff

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.900 
to turn because her hair is pretty stiff
and<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.880> really<00:02:40.120> limits<00:02:40.390> her<00:02:40.690> she<00:02:41.020> can't<00:02:41.260> earn

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
and it really limits her she can't earn

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.890 
and it really limits her she can't earn
less<00:02:42.910> than<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.180> half<00:02:43.420> an<00:02:43.540> inch<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.810> either

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
less than a half an inch in either

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.900 
less than a half an inch in either
direction<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.560> just<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:44.890> little<00:02:45.100> bit<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.790> at

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
direction so just a little bit and at

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.960 
direction so just a little bit and at
least<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.239> there<00:02:46.890> she<00:02:47.890> has<00:02:48.010> cuts<00:02:48.310> at<00:02:48.850> the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
least it's there she has cuts at the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.449 
least it's there she has cuts at the
shoulders<00:02:49.360> hinges<00:02:50.350> at<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.709> elbows<00:02:51.040> which<00:02:51.340> I

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
shoulders hinges at the elbows which I

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.520 
shoulders hinges at the elbows which I
actually<00:02:51.640> didn't<00:02:52.000> expect<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.720> saw<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.140> first

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
actually didn't expect I I saw the first

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.830 
actually didn't expect I I saw the first
image<00:02:54.489> of<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.700> set<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.120> package<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.690> I

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
image of the set in the package and I

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.509 
image of the set in the package and I
thought<00:02:56.410> for<00:02:56.620> sure<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.830> they<00:02:57.160> would<00:02:57.310> just<00:02:57.430> be

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
thought for sure that they would just be

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.340 
thought for sure that they would just be
straight<00:02:57.790> arms<00:02:58.060> they<00:02:58.269> would<00:02:58.390> cut<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.630> elbow

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
straight arms they would cut the elbow

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.440 
straight arms they would cut the elbow
articulation<00:03:00.040> because<00:03:00.400> her<00:03:00.489> arms<00:03:01.180> were<00:03:01.239> quite

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
articulation because her arms were quite

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.420 
articulation because her arms were quite
a<00:03:01.480> bit<00:03:01.630> smaller<00:03:01.750> but<00:03:02.140> no<00:03:02.319> they<00:03:02.500> did<00:03:03.069> it's<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.280> big

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
a bit smaller but no they did it's a big

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.759 
a bit smaller but no they did it's a big
favor<00:03:03.610> there<00:03:03.930> there's<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:05.019> cut<00:03:05.350> at<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.500> waist

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
close to that style it's just a little

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.410 
close to that style it's just a little
bit<00:04:08.620> of<00:04:08.859> an<00:04:09.010> issue<00:04:09.100> but<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.489> would<00:04:09.670> still<00:04:09.940> give

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
bit of an issue but I would still give

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.599 
bit of an issue but I would still give
her<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.810> score<00:04:11.680> of<00:04:11.859> four<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:12.160> a<00:04:12.250> half<00:04:12.280> out<00:04:12.549> of

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
five stars just very strong for me

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.500

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
because of all the news sculpting

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.909 
because of all the news sculpting
elements<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:16.959> how<00:04:17.019> much<00:04:17.140> extra<00:04:17.410> effort<00:04:17.739> went

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
elements and how much extra effort went

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.009

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
five out of five stars because even the

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.940 
five out of five stars because even the
other<00:04:22.210> figures<00:04:22.599> that<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.020> was<00:04:23.409> giving<00:04:23.680> four<00:04:23.830> and

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
heavily reused a lot of elements but

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.740 
heavily reused a lot of elements but
