give you some operating tips on the
Trenchard<00:00:20.390> frame<00:00:20.740> no<00:00:21.740> matter<00:00:21.920> how<00:00:22.070> long

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
Trenchard frame no matter how long

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.040 
Trenchard frame no matter how long
you've<00:00:22.430> been<00:00:22.460> great<00:00:22.880> men<00:00:23.180> how<00:00:23.630> long<00:00:23.869> you've

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
you've been great men how long you've

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.100 
you've been great men how long you've
been<00:00:24.080> working<00:00:24.200> on<00:00:24.710> escalators<00:00:25.610> this<00:00:26.599> bucket

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
been working on escalators this bucket

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.720 
been working on escalators this bucket
works<00:00:27.320> like<00:00:27.529> a<00:00:27.560> dozer<00:00:28.029> not<00:00:29.029> a<00:00:29.360> track<00:00:30.020> loader

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
works like a dozer not a track loader

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.000 
works like a dozer not a track loader
the<00:00:31.730> difference<00:00:32.149> is<00:00:32.329> that<00:00:32.620> when<00:00:33.620> you<00:00:33.710> use<00:00:33.770> this

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
the difference is that when you use this

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.270 
the difference is that when you use this
bucket<00:00:34.489> you're<00:00:35.329> not<00:00:35.540> carrying<00:00:36.110> dirt<00:00:36.530> in<00:00:36.800> the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
bucket you're not carrying dirt in the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.240 
bucket you're not carrying dirt in the
bucket<00:00:37.610> you're<00:00:37.670> not<00:00:37.820> relieving<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:38.660> ditch

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
bucket you're not relieving the ditch

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.440 
bucket you're not relieving the ditch
into<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.340> bucket<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:40.850> loading<00:00:41.180> it<00:00:41.239> out

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
into the bucket and loading it out

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.080 
into the bucket and loading it out
you're<00:00:42.290> actually<00:00:42.590> dragging<00:00:43.219> the<00:00:43.399> dirt<00:00:43.640> out<00:00:43.940> in

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
you're actually dragging the dirt out in

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.770 
you're actually dragging the dirt out in
each<00:00:44.210> time<00:00:45.430> so<00:00:46.430> what<00:00:46.760> what<00:00:47.120> happens<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:47.660> when

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
each time so what what happens is when

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.390 
each time so what what happens is when
you're<00:00:47.930> dragging<00:00:48.290> the<00:00:48.380> dirty<00:00:48.590> two<00:00:48.920> out<00:00:49.160> each

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
you're dragging the dirty two out each

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.390 
you're dragging the dirty two out each
time<00:00:49.640> you<00:00:50.360> can<00:00:50.510> only<00:00:50.660> go<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:50.960> deep<00:00:51.440> each<00:00:52.070> time

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
time you can only go so deep each time

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.630 
time you can only go so deep each time
just<00:00:52.640> like<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.790> bulldozer<00:00:53.980> you<00:00:54.980> only<00:00:55.100> cut<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.400> few

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
just like a bulldozer you only cut a few

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.160 
just like a bulldozer you only cut a few
inches<00:00:55.820> at<00:00:56.090> a<00:00:56.120> time<00:00:56.150> with<00:00:56.450> a<00:00:56.480> bulldozer<00:00:56.780> maybe

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
inches at a time with a bulldozer maybe

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.040 
inches at a time with a bulldozer maybe
you<00:00:57.770> know<00:00:57.890> for<00:00:58.370> maybe<00:00:58.700> eight<00:00:59.000> you<00:00:59.720> know<00:00:59.840> the

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
you know for maybe eight you know the

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.440 
you know for maybe eight you know the
max<00:01:00.290> big<00:01:00.590> machine<00:01:00.950> so<00:01:01.850> it's<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.030> same<00:01:02.210> at<00:01:02.360> the

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
max big machine so it's the same at the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.749 
max big machine so it's the same at the
trencher<00:01:02.810> fang<00:01:03.050> bucket<00:01:03.500> you've<00:01:04.070> got<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:04.579> much

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
trencher fang bucket you've got so much

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.130 
trencher fang bucket you've got so much
power<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:06.740> much<00:01:07.119> control<00:01:08.119> you<00:01:08.150> gotta<00:01:08.930> take

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
power and so much control you gotta take

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.060 
power and so much control you gotta take
long<00:01:09.470> smooth<00:01:10.540> 4<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:11.720> 8<00:01:11.960> inch<00:01:12.229> steps<00:01:12.590> average

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
long smooth 4 to 8 inch steps average

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.880 
long smooth 4 to 8 inch steps average
about<00:01:13.310> 6<00:01:13.640> inches<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.049> end<00:01:15.470> up<00:01:15.619> with<00:01:15.799> this

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
about 6 inches and you end up with this

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.560 
about 6 inches and you end up with this
result<00:01:16.130> because<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:16.700> won't<00:01:16.820> blow<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.240> banks

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
result because you won't blow the banks

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.570 
result because you won't blow the banks
out<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:18.590> know<00:01:18.650> clean<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.040> dirt<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:19.520> then

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
out and you know clean the dirt and then

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.450 
out and you know clean the dirt and then
go<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.420> top<00:01:20.630> of<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.870> trench<00:01:21.050> always<00:01:21.440> you<00:01:22.250> lose

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
go the top of the trench always you lose

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.040 
go the top of the trench always you lose
the<00:01:22.610> banks<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:22.970> little<00:01:23.210> bit<00:01:23.330> to<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.600> top<00:01:23.630> so

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
the banks a little bit to the top so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:32.330 
the banks a little bit to the top so
it's<00:01:24.290> a<00:01:24.380> real<00:01:24.530> loose<00:01:24.740> dirt
