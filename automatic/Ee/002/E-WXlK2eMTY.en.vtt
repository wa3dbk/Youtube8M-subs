00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.770 

paint<00:02:23.840> maybe<00:02:24.439> NASA<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.329> can<00:02:26.510> see<00:02:26.629> that's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
paint maybe NASA and you can see that's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.580 
paint maybe NASA and you can see that's
right<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.140> worse

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
right the worse

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.250 
right the worse
so<00:02:27.769> I<00:02:27.829> faith<00:02:28.099> do<00:02:28.459> you've<00:02:28.610> ever<00:02:28.730> seen<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.420> then

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
so I faith do you've ever seen and then

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.530 
so I faith do you've ever seen and then
you<00:02:30.409> can<00:02:30.530> make<00:02:30.680> other<00:02:31.579> colors<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.180> overlay<00:02:32.510> on

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
you can make other colors to overlay on

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.380 
you can make other colors to overlay on
it<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.700> smaller<00:02:34.909> ones<00:02:35.120> it's<00:02:35.239> one

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
it and the the smaller ones it's one

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.160 
it and the the smaller ones it's one
pixel<00:02:35.890> whether<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.189> big<00:02:37.400> one<00:02:37.610> does

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
pixel whether the big one does

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.780 
pixel whether the big one does
approximately<00:02:39.849> 8x8<00:02:40.989> sort<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.079> exercise

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
approximately 8x8 sort of exercise

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.580 
approximately 8x8 sort of exercise
and<00:02:44.120> then<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.450> can<00:02:44.569> use<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.840> chippers<00:02:45.230> again

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
and then you can use the chippers again

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.619 
and then you can use the chippers again
while<00:02:45.739> right-clicking<00:02:46.159> to<00:02:46.970> remove<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.420> pain

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
while right-clicking to remove the pain

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.800 
while right-clicking to remove the pain
so<00:02:48.019> this<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.409> the<00:02:48.680> chipper<00:02:49.220> does<00:02:49.489> a

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
so this this the chipper does a

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.860 
so this this the chipper does a
allotment<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.760> knife<00:02:53.030> does<00:02:53.329> a<00:02:53.510> smaller

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
allotment and the knife does a smaller

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.900 
allotment and the knife does a smaller
amount

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.230 

you're<00:02:57.450> not<00:02:57.570> seeing<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:57.900> water<00:02:59.060> I'm<00:03:00.060> not
