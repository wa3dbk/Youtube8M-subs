today we're going to be looking at pump
technique<00:00:25.160> pump<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.400> vertical<00:00:26.880> movement<00:00:27.090> of

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
technique pump is a vertical movement of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.240 
technique pump is a vertical movement of
the<00:00:27.510> body<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:28.140> pushes<00:00:28.560> weight<00:00:28.769> through<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the body that pushes weight through the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.609 
the body that pushes weight through the
bike<00:00:29.369> into<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.000> tires<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.900> result<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.439> good

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
bike into the tires the result of a good

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.799 
bike into the tires the result of a good
pump<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.040> clear<00:00:32.309> acceleration<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.540> sound

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
pump is clear acceleration and the sound

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.680 
pump is clear acceleration and the sound
of<00:00:33.930> your<00:00:33.989> tires<00:00:34.260> biting<00:00:35.180> with<00:00:36.180> practice<00:00:36.570> you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
of your tires biting with practice you

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.479 
of your tires biting with practice you
can<00:00:36.840> pump<00:00:37.020> effectively<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.620> any<00:00:37.770> bike<00:00:37.920> but

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
can pump effectively on any bike but

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.740 
can pump effectively on any bike but
when<00:00:38.579> you're<00:00:38.730> learning<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.270> might<00:00:39.360> find<00:00:39.629> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
when you're learning you might find it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.660 
when you're learning you might find it
easier<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.140> hardtail<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.800> you've<00:00:41.460> got<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
easier on a hardtail if you've got a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.430 
easier on a hardtail if you've got a
full<00:00:41.790> suspension<00:00:41.969> bike<00:00:42.480> don't<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.200> put<00:00:43.410> off

just<00:00:44.430> make<00:00:44.610> sure<00:00:44.789> you've<00:00:44.969> got<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.120> nice<00:00:45.270> low

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
just make sure you've got a nice low

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.510 
just make sure you've got a nice low
seat<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.620> will<00:00:46.710> help<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:46.920> stand<00:00:47.219> over

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520

lucky<00:00:54.660> enough<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.050> one<00:00:55.230> nearby<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.800> pump

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
lucky enough to have one nearby a pump

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.520 
lucky enough to have one nearby a pump
truck<00:00:56.309> you'll<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.180> able<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.390> practice<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:58.020> berm

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
truck you'll be able to practice on berm

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.110 
truck you'll be able to practice on berm
corners<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.100> rollers<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.850> once<00:01:00.000> you've

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
corners and rollers and once you've

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.340 
corners and rollers and once you've
nailed<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> technique<00:01:00.809> you'll<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.140> able<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
nailed the technique you'll be able to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.830 
nailed the technique you'll be able to
use<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.649> wherever<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.980> write<00:01:02.840> pumping

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
use it wherever you write pumping

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600 
use it wherever you write pumping
technique<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.350> used<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.890> free<00:01:05.129> speed<00:01:05.430> from

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
technique is used to get free speed from

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
technique is used to get free speed from
the<00:01:05.670> trail<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.689> you're<00:01:06.810> riding<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.140> roller

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the trail so if you're riding a roller

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.890 
the trail so if you're riding a roller
you<00:01:08.100> want<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> suck<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.640> bike<00:01:08.939> up<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.750> up

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you want to suck the bike up on the up

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.830 
you want to suck the bike up on the up
side<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.189> over<00:01:11.420> push<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> bike

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
side and as you go over push the bike

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.960 
side and as you go over push the bike
down<00:01:13.080> into<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.619> down<00:01:13.799> side<00:01:14.130> generating<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
down into the down side generating the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.120 
down into the down side generating the
speed<00:01:15.240> firstly<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.290> important<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> realize

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
speed firstly it's important to realize

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.410 
speed firstly it's important to realize
that<00:01:17.159> pump<00:01:17.549> technique<00:01:17.880> comes<00:01:18.090> from<00:01:18.299> your

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that pump technique comes from your

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.810 
that pump technique comes from your
limbs<00:01:18.659> keeping<00:01:19.409> your<00:01:19.530> body<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.189> head<00:01:20.400> as
