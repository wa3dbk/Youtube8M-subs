Mega Drive version where's the
similarity<00:01:04.010> that<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.900> pretty<00:01:06.900> simple

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
similarity that is pretty simple

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.920

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
like because I have a problem with the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.710 
like because I have a problem with the
saturn<00:01:13.920> version<00:01:16.670> it's<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.820> Sega<00:01:18.150> rages

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
saturn version it's on the Sega rages

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.840 
saturn version it's on the Sega rages
information<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> second<00:01:20.700> one

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
information to you it's the second one

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.040 
information to you it's the second one
and<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.140> Z

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
and that is Z

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.130 
and that is Z
way<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:25.100> plane<00:01:25.460> controls<00:01:26.300> its<00:01:26.810> self

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
way the plane controls its self

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.640 
way the plane controls its self
centering<00:01:27.760> using<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:28.880> analog<00:01:29.300> stick<00:01:29.330> I<00:01:30.140> think

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
centering using the analog stick I think

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.490 
centering using the analog stick I think
or<00:01:30.920> whatever<00:01:31.570> basically<00:01:32.570> if<00:01:32.900> you<00:01:33.080> let<00:01:33.290> go<00:01:33.470> of

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
or whatever basically if you let go of

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.260 
or whatever basically if you let go of
the<00:01:33.680> stick<00:01:33.860> or<00:01:34.070> you're<00:01:34.190> not<00:01:34.310> pushing<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.880> in<00:01:35.060> a

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
the stick or you're not pushing it in a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.870 
the stick or you're not pushing it in a
particular<00:01:35.930> direction<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.620> centers<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.430> that

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
particular direction it centers and that

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
particular direction it centers and that
is<00:01:38.180> not<00:01:38.480> good<00:01:39.370> he<00:01:40.370> did<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.360> Mega<00:01:41.600> Drive

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
is not good he did the Mega Drive

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.270 
is not good he did the Mega Drive
version<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.560> were<00:01:42.650> pointed<00:01:43.040> in<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.250> direction

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
version you were pointed in a direction

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.880 
version you were pointed in a direction
and<00:01:44.030> until<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:44.930> pointed<00:01:45.110> in<00:01:45.440> a<00:01:45.530> different

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
and until you pointed in a different

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.840 
and until you pointed in a different
direction<00:01:46.040> it<00:01:46.520> stayed<00:01:46.820> there<00:01:47.120> pretty<00:01:47.540> much

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.420 

or<00:01:54.390> maybe<00:01:54.570> not<00:01:54.750> quite<00:01:55.110> completely<00:01:55.710> bird<00:01:56.189> um

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
or maybe not quite completely bird um

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.609 
or maybe not quite completely bird um
yeah<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.479> handles<00:01:57.900> like<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.140> mega<00:01:58.380> drive

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
yeah it handles like a mega drive

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.710 
yeah it handles like a mega drive
version<00:01:58.650> which<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.310> found<00:01:59.610> much<00:02:00.030> easier<00:02:00.540> if

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
version which I found much easier if

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.370 
version which I found much easier if
it's<00:02:01.140> less<00:02:01.439> true<00:02:02.340> gone<00:02:02.750> hold<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.930> I'm<00:02:04.170> not

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
it's less true gone hold it I'm not

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.280 
it's less true gone hold it I'm not
mastering<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.280> rolling<00:02:06.270> thing<00:02:06.720> that<00:02:07.140> you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
mastering that rolling thing that you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.499 
mastering that rolling thing that you
can<00:02:07.470> do<00:02:07.680> where<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.759> swing<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.390> one

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
can do where you you swing it to one

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.910 
can do where you you swing it to one
side<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.989> then<00:02:10.140> flick<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.590> back<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.890> other

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
side and then flick it back the other

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.830 
side and then flick it back the other
way<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> rolls<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.730> haven't<00:02:12.060> managed<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.540> do

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
way and it rolls I haven't managed to do

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.479 
way and it rolls I haven't managed to do
that<00:02:13.080> here<00:02:13.380> which<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.160> unfortunate<00:02:15.800> hmm<00:02:19.489> yeah

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
that here which is unfortunate hmm yeah

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.960 
that here which is unfortunate hmm yeah
I'm<00:02:20.790> ready<00:02:21.080> ready<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.170> die<00:02:22.800> mostly

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.610 

yeah<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.490> does<00:02:29.940> for<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.570> visually<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.350> just

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
yeah so it does for it visually is just

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.200 
yeah so it does for it visually is just
like<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.860> saturn<00:02:32.160> version<00:02:32.280> as<00:02:32.700> well<00:02:32.760> as<00:02:32.910> i<00:02:33.030> can

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
like the saturn version as well as i can

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.940 
like the saturn version as well as i can
tell<00:02:33.450> while<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.110> handling<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.740> plane

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
tell while the handling of the plane

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.550 
tell while the handling of the plane
dare<00:02:35.610> see<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.720> does<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.230> which<00:02:37.530> is

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
dare see it that it does that which is

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.610 
dare see it that it does that which is
great<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.160> want<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.760> do<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.410> or<00:02:40.410> i<00:02:40.440> do
