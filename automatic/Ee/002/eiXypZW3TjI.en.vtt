00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
you want to tell any thinking about

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.240 
you want to tell any thinking about
getting<00:05:06.670> that<00:05:07.650> much<00:05:08.650> help

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250

getting that much help
don't<00:05:09.640> just<00:05:10.390> grab<00:05:10.900> a<00:05:10.960> little<00:05:11.200> cheaper<00:05:11.740> like

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
don't just grab a little cheaper like

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.600 
don't just grab a little cheaper like
over<00:05:12.580> it<00:05:12.760> I<00:05:13.770> think<00:05:14.770> it<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:17.040> works<00:05:18.040> they<00:05:18.580> are

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
over it I think it and works they are

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.860 
over it I think it and works they are
really<00:05:19.170> well<00:05:20.170> they<00:05:20.590> are<00:05:21.120> really<00:05:22.120> extensible

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
really well they are really extensible

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.470 
really well they are really extensible
all<00:05:23.170> around<00:05:23.590> many<00:05:23.830> orders<00:05:24.280> this<00:05:24.910> is<00:05:25.060> the<00:05:25.180> best

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
all around many orders this is the best

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.550 
all around many orders this is the best
part<00:05:25.810> in<00:05:26.020> Cairo<00:05:26.320> and<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:30.960> it<00:05:31.960> has<00:05:32.020> an<00:05:32.410> actual
