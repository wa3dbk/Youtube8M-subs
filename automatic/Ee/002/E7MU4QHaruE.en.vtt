you have the three main pieces which are
the<00:00:55.180> triangle<00:00:55.810> shape<00:00:56.020> of<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.410> roof<00:00:58.020> these

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
the triangle shape of the roof these

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.270 
the triangle shape of the roof these
four<00:00:59.320> pieces<00:00:59.590> connect<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.880> roof<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:02.280> then

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
four pieces connect the roof and then

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.180 
four pieces connect the roof and then
these<00:01:03.490> four<00:01:03.850> longer<00:01:04.360> sticks<00:01:04.720> if<00:01:05.710> you<00:01:05.860> notice

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
picks at the end so those are going to

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.680 
picks at the end so those are going to
the<00:01:13.450> ground<00:01:13.660> and<00:01:13.990> then<00:01:14.170> that<00:01:14.410> is<00:01:15.510> what<00:01:16.510> will

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
the ground and then that is what will

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.680 
the ground and then that is what will
hold<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:17.050> frame<00:01:17.290> up<00:01:18.120> so<00:01:19.120> what<00:01:19.390> we're<00:01:19.510> going<00:01:19.630> to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
hold the frame up so what we're going to

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.000 
hold the frame up so what we're going to
do<00:01:19.900> is<00:01:20.520> set<00:01:21.520> up<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.940> frame<00:01:22.450> first<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.260> then

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
do is set up the frame first and then

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.440 
do is set up the frame first and then
we're<00:01:24.160> going<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.340> put<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.670> rest<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.390> the

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
guys kind of see the overall pattern of

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.960 
guys kind of see the overall pattern of
it<00:06:03.690> there's<00:06:04.690> a<00:06:04.840> few<00:06:05.280> things<00:06:06.280> that<00:06:06.370> we<00:06:06.760> need<00:06:06.850> to

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
get a closer look forward to understand

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.060 
get a closer look forward to understand
hold<00:06:10.330> up<00:06:10.740> so<00:06:12.840> run<00:06:13.840> at<00:06:13.990> the<00:06:14.110> bottom<00:06:14.500> of<00:06:14.860> the

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
hold up so run at the bottom of the

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.200 
hold up so run at the bottom of the

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
sunshade you have this ring here so this

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.090 
sunshade you have this ring here so this
ring<00:06:21.180> you<00:06:22.180> want<00:06:22.300> to<00:06:22.450> lift<00:06:22.660> this<00:06:22.870> piece<00:06:23.140> up<00:06:23.410> tuck

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
ring you want to lift this piece up tuck
