00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
talked a lot about how ethanol causes

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.120 
talked a lot about how ethanol causes
deforestation<00:00:33.930> basically<00:00:34.829> trying<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
about ethanol discouraging its using now

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.790 
about ethanol discouraging its using now
i<00:00:41.340> might<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.730> mentioned<00:00:42.290> ethanol<00:00:43.290> competing

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
i might have mentioned ethanol competing

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.069 
i might have mentioned ethanol competing
with<00:00:43.920> food<00:00:44.129> markets<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.910> video<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.840> not<00:00:46.020> i

this kind of volatility to the corn
markets<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:45.400> know<00:01:46.400> what<00:01:46.550> you<00:01:46.670> think<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:46.940> corn<00:01:47.240> I

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
markets I know what you think in corn I

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.380 
markets I know what you think in corn I
don't<00:01:48.770> need<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:48.980> much<00:01:49.160> corn<00:01:50.050> well<00:01:51.050> I<00:01:51.230> can't

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
don't need that much corn well I can't

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.740 
don't need that much corn well I can't
are<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.540> sure<00:01:53.780> about<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:55.120> on<00:01:56.120> NPR<00:01:56.570> they

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
are you sure about that on NPR they

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.380 
are you sure about that on NPR they
talked<00:01:56.990> about<00:01:57.080> a<00:01:57.260> study<00:01:57.700> it's<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.820> human<00:01:59.180> hair

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
talked about a study it's a human hair

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.170 
talked about a study it's a human hair
samples<00:01:59.900> from<00:02:00.050> Americans<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:00.830> they<00:02:01.670> tested

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
samples from Americans and they tested

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.850 
samples from Americans and they tested
it<00:02:02.270> now<00:02:02.750> before<00:02:02.930> I<00:02:03.110> talk<00:02:03.350> about<00:02:03.590> what<00:02:03.740> they

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
it now before I talk about what they

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.940 
it now before I talk about what they
tested<00:02:04.220> before<00:02:04.310> let<00:02:04.610> me<00:02:04.700> explain<00:02:05.150> something

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
tested before let me explain something

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.850 
tested before let me explain something
what<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:06.980> plant<00:02:07.340> takes<00:02:07.670> target<00:02:08.530> from<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.710> air

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
what a plant takes target from the air

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.640 
what a plant takes target from the air
and<00:02:10.700> turns<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.210> into<00:02:11.270> sugar<00:02:11.690> protein<00:02:12.640> or<00:02:13.640> oil

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
and turns it into sugar protein or oil

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.160 
and turns it into sugar protein or oil
it<00:02:15.650> leaves<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.520> signature<00:02:16.820> on<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.390> car<00:02:17.810> I

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
it leaves a signature on that car I

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.050 
it leaves a signature on that car I
think<00:02:18.710> it<00:02:18.800> does<00:02:18.950> this<00:02:19.160> because<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:19.610> selects

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
think it does this because it selects

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.750 
think it does this because it selects
certain<00:02:20.510> carbon<00:02:21.020> isotopes<00:02:21.560> from<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.610> air

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
certain carbon isotopes from the air

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.700 
certain carbon isotopes from the air
certain<00:02:23.240> ratio<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.900> different<00:02:24.380> ways<00:02:24.530> of

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
certain ratio of different ways of

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.130 
certain ratio of different ways of
carbon<00:02:25.160> new<00:02:25.660> nuclear<00:02:26.660> physics<00:02:27.140> thing<00:02:27.350> and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
carbon new nuclear physics thing and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.710 
carbon new nuclear physics thing and
they<00:02:30.140> tested<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.950> human<00:02:31.310> hair<00:02:31.580> for<00:02:32.540> this

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
they tested the human hair for this

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.380 
they tested the human hair for this
signature<00:02:33.370> what<00:02:34.370> they<00:02:34.490> thought<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.940> basically

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
signature what they thought is basically

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.910 
signature what they thought is basically
something<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:36.020> already<00:02:36.230> should<00:02:36.680> know

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
what pushed prices down kind of

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.479 
what pushed prices down kind of
normalize<00:04:15.820> things<00:04:16.180> but<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:17.260> would<00:04:17.530> still<00:04:17.739> be<00:04:18.220> a

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
normalize things but it would still be a

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.789 
normalize things but it would still be a
much<00:04:19.030> higher<00:04:19.269> price<00:04:19.540> in<00:04:19.840> some<00:04:20.109> years<00:04:20.350> than

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
much higher price in some years than

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.710 
much higher price in some years than
another<00:04:21.100> years<00:04:21.430> I<00:04:21.609> mean<00:04:21.820> that's<00:04:21.970> just<00:04:22.570> going

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
another years I mean that's just going

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.440 
another years I mean that's just going
to<00:04:22.840> be<00:04:22.870> unavoidable<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.610> basically<00:04:25.030> what<00:04:25.300> I'm

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
to be unavoidable so basically what I'm

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.380 
to be unavoidable so basically what I'm
