00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.480
 you're with eric 38 and I'm going to you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.690
 show how to connect your turtle 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.030
 beach to your xbox 360 while playing in 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.070
 hdmi on your TV and without needing 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.260
 to buy the scart adapter sold 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.070
 by microsoft 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.750
 so here to start everything 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.470
 just you 're going to link your 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.840
 xbox console to your TV in hdmi with 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.840
 the supplied cable simply 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.520
 then you will recover the cable 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.390
 scart also provides with the xbox 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.130
 360 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.559
 so if we must know is that the cable 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.430
 in fact the Scart plug that goes 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.129
 behind the xbox 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.469
 she has a black plastic cover that 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.870
 prevents the connection of pavements 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.010
 removed from the scart simultaneously so 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.320
 what we are going to do is simply 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.420
 remove it snatched so you 'll have to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 to force a little but do not scare that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.350
 will not break the record she in one 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.050
 piece and she's fine this so 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.989
 here it goes above age 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.830
 lines and we end up with 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.580
 rca cables that must be connected to 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.420
 two audio cables that come with 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.299
 the turtle beach 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.580
 so here's the red on the red the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.659
 white on the white just that's it 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.729
 so what you need to know is 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.689
 that just the young amy is going 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.310
 send the video to the TV while the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.810
 turtle beach sound will go through the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.520
 scart which you will hear very well 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.500
 all 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.729
 the sound you will receive in your door and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.299
 the beach will also pass through the other 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.860
 scart so your friends or the sound of the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.539
 video game everything will go into pyrite 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.280
 it is what to what is done 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:46.500
 automatically there is no time to 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.509
 screaming we're going after behind the cables 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.780
 audio we are penguins showers and we have 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:58.429
 a jack week we hooked up with 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.929
 the other here is here after a hdmi 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.569
 as much for me anne usd as we go 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.959
 support plugged behind the xbox 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:11.039
 this is simply 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:13.920
 and finally we can forget to connect 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.299
 the xbox controller to the headset while 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.840
 just then here on the small 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:25.019
 monitor you activate it the end you 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.370
 activate the microphone and eat everything 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.709
 the bass the cat and the game so voila 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.459
 and finally to finish maybe a 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.970
 last little tip this cable there it 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.840
 is actually plugged the pc so 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.579
 simply if you play with 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.109
 interfel 8 on the computer there you 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.560
 just plug the usb into 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.780
 the computer with this jack in a 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.209
 jack input on your computer 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.030
 and then if you want to use a 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:59.099
 capture software as she gado 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.389
 and capture game hd you will not have the 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.280
 sense of your turtle the beach he was coming 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.650
 to record your gameplay through the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.319
 xbox because just like 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.569
 I said earlier the sound of your 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.069
 tarte beach goes through the scart so in 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.389
 big in the age of miss will pass nothing 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.040
 so if you want to save the 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.359
 gameplay so do not lure what he 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.209
 must do is simply 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:22.349

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.049

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.930
