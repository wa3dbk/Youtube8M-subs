00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.599
 I'm with today it's about 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.880
 theme the bread i realized i have 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.500
 today ask in the war look at times very 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.570
 shortly after and that was the question of 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.640
 I noticed lido on facebook 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.130
 I have no video on the subject yet 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 and that's why I want to address 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.519
 I'm private wise, sometimes 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.969
 been raised so a 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.600
 whitebread everything offered what is it to be 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.010
 is propagated as the alternative 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.110
 to get one into the diet 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.500
 Carbohydrate rauszukriegen with it 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.180
 Of course, calories again 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.239
 or do not study too 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.559
 lose fat 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.860
 but we all know that hangs 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.750
 of course from the calorie balance with us 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 healthy people but maybe 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.399
 also family share da hamma last time 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.260
 such a story had so if I 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.699
 I of course was misconduct before 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.019
 I'm surprised if it is not so 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.689
 works optimally or I afterwards 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.250
 that has to do more, that's of course better 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.530
 Of course, that's not how it works 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.790
 look at the ingredients of the white bread 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.009
 back to the topic wheat glue is 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.000
 to compete that is not so whom invited 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.119
 fall on it 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.590
 otherwise always at other at what knew 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.650
 you maybe take or something 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.080
 always his please no gluten too granny 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.520
 No gluten should he be in there 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.590
 be, for example with x possible 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.920
 please do not look at it somehow 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.549
 and then nen super sport 70 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.270
 percent 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.790
 what else is there almost no in there 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.880
 mandl mail is in there linseed is so 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.290
 mostly 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.189
 Flaxseed for example 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.080
 Sunflower seeds can still be in it 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.170
 table salt spices dry yeast 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.790
 Dry yeast is mostly lose though 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.590
 It threatened as oneself bakes are 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.630
 just the data from the baker knows 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.810
 I do not usually tell me that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.330
 not even what exactly is in it 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.170
 that means there we go of that 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.600
 bread from the predecessor of the bread or 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.520
 dm the workboat par excellence 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.870
 I can not say it now because I am 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.130
 do not make meat surreptitious advertising 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.090
 But he would like to be in the Bible 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.840
 also place as I said these are the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.580
 ingredients that means if you if you 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.319
 you have problems with gluten 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.690
 Of course, take care here then 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.640
 Of course, allergy can be gluten then 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.420
 Of course everything has been offered again 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.209
 nothing for you, too, as far as this is concerned 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.579
 so now we have to look at what has 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.820
 Wheat calls wheat protein everything clear 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.950
 of course mandl mail almonds have fed 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:57.030
 Flax seeds have such a promi kerner feather 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:02.459
 has that is where there is hardly any was a 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.200
 calorie in-calorie what is 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.590
 start here 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.420
 approximately out at 20 60 calories two 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.230
 grams of carbs so it is 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.739
 actually local it is 33 grams of protein 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.209
 is a protein about the biological 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.900
 Validity we do not entertain ourselves 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.970
 Wheat protein is not necessarily great 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.299
 was allowed by the value 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.400
 in the overall concept so if you still 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.340
 animal proteins as good herbal 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.359
 to lead and doctors for example 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.450
 combines all one kind of 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.650
 sulphurous amino acids the other 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.500
 low has the same ones, too 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.690
 mutually exclusive himself gives in vegans 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.769
 there is no problem 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:52.180
 that means we just cling to it 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:54.459
 paradise is therefore tiptop and 13 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.560
 that comes naturally through the almonds 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.310
 through the sunflower seeds and such 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.670
 on and on 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:05.170
 Welcome to 260 calories 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.659
 out so you will already notice red pencil 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.000
 what's going on there 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:13.180
 if you take normal bread 40 grams 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.229
 Carbohydrates Calculate 10 12 grams of fat 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:25.599
 was that high was about 220 to ca 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:26.919
 230 calories that means there it is 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.870
 of course again dependent on 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.180
 bakers from the recipe and so on 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.520
 and so on but we come to one 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.550
 black bread for example, we come 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.479
 about on this value so at 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.729
 white bread has more calories than the normal one 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.990
 bread if I am so for example now 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.060
 say okay i put my calories 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.539
 about what I know about me 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.490
 to take 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.169
 I have no problem with that 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.030
 normal potent protein and would the 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.639
 Actually only worse 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:03.729
 make that a white bread also has 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:06.430
 the disadvantage that wheat gluten gluten 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.409
 this is not just for 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.330
 allergic a problem but also for 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.849
 people just do not gluten this 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.099
 So do not tolerate any health 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.810
 but have problems by for example 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:21.400
 getting it off can be good too 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.780
 that means there you have the ingredient list 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.909
 to look and really have to 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.020
 ok i have problems with that 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.280
 maybe I even have wheat 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.320
 I have allergic problems 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.490
 health compatibility problems 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.259
 somewhere that if one always 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.789
 still 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.810
 they say okay I have no problem there 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.220
 in order to 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.770
 You still have to think about it 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.400
 is it worth the taste to me 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.050
 to abstain from real bread and on 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.810
 do it once more anyway 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.610
 calories means that I had to 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.250
 plan every case if I of course 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.340
 Now, for example, say women's women 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.229
 have quite good and like the problem 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.610
 but enough protein to lead to 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.520
 I do not like any products which 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.500
 not contractually 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.210
 I do not like meat or I am 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.490
 currently not so the meat eater 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.210
 then of course we have one here 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.280
 possibility the bread from 2000 against one 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.620
 white bread and thereby the protein content in 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.659
 of course to raise the diet if 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.370
 But I have no problem here with us 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:22.610
 race I assume there is 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.259
 actually no need except me 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.960
 really say okay at the end go to me 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:29.690
 I really do this 20 30 grams of protein 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.800
 I'm someone for that I 'd rather eat 150 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:37.370
 gram more chicken or something or 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.110
 sausage or cheese or something but only 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.599
 no egg whites I am for example 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.650
 someone who does not tolerate it I am 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:45.740
 no allergic 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.280
 but I can handle that many notes 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.190
 once it's not there for me around 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.719
 So that's not the topic 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.789
 absolutely necessary has even more 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:58.310
 Calories that means you have to 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:01.009
 you have to find a need 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.379
 that in the diet with purely for 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.360
 So press to persuade 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:07.639
 take this egg white boot for it 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.340
 actually tastes worse 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:12.650
 you can eat less of it per gram 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.380
 and it could just be with the 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.830
 compatibility was not quite allowed 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.870
 his 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.460
 See you next time 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.080
 I hope I could do a bit here 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.860
 bring clarity 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.860
 until then it'll be good
