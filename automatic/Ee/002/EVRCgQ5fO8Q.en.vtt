00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.060
 how do you think that many will say here 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.750
 pretraining still something there 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.270
 mixed up 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.830
 what is actually with pre-workouts 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.780
 not quite the period andre needed very very 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.270
 neatly 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.560
 debica because abuse 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.050
 all sorts of different 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.810
 which training teams are large 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.440
 caffeine content and so on all 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.430
 not very beneficially affect 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.620
 training process 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.960
 just as many people think shoved more 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.420
 pretraining more stronger 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.760
 practiced it really is a big 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.420
 mistake I understood this after one 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.420
 time in competitions already 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.180
 eleutherococcus and all just help 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.820
 that while you can cram in here later 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.990
 we suggested just say so 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.580
 called caffeine small I became that 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.330
 In principle, caffeine steer me not 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.340
 all was well said to me well 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.660
 I was given well I don’t know I don’t remember seven 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.700
 probably pills 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.530
 i drank 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.950
 and strange things started happening to me 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:07.670
 things well, because I was bombed I sat on 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.970
 competition sit and understand nothing 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.950
 want i just want to sleep therefore him 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.769
 manual neat pretraining 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.739
 because it may very well be the likely 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.080
 reverse effect that is not that of you 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.540
 period and vice versa from the fact that you are sitting 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.190
 you then appeared able not 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.030
 understand you drank so much 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.530
 so much in yourself downloaded and nothing 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.120
 does not happen and sleepy happens 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.120
 state to what it says because 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:46.150
 because because besides 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.150
 everything is also shorter 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.280
 tom bc 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:06.350
 we will try this know-how in this room 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.830
 traction on chains began of course we will do 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.830
 warm up 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.430
 make traction on chains make it bigger 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.890
 as 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.580
 utility room as a variety in 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.580
 training process 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.870
 features of this movement is that 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.720
 very powerful legs turn on the breakdown 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.220
 it is this that this is very important with 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.290
 bottom phase bottom motion phase 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.290
 It turns out that is, with RF feet 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.800
 immediately rate transition miracle 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.300
 exercise theater filming from the pit 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.050
 carried out precisely in order to be 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:36.480
 powerful stall powerful stall fall asleep syam 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.950
 we will drag to the knees well, Dmitri I 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.590
 I think that will do with the full 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.290
 U-turn of the hull 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.560
 amplitude and i will work on stalling exactly 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.620
 up to your knees to work your technique 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.840
 stalling the same in principle and thrust on 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.290
 chains because when the bar hangs on 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.870
 chains 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.650
 it comes to the level of the knees 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.940
 there is a breakdown due to the legs and traction 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.840
 going to knee level this too 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:08.190
 it was on the breakdown that there was a powerful breakdown in 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.390
 mostly movement in the sweat then we 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.730
 it will exactly give ok yes it is too 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.060
 the final phase of movement in deads 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:21.810
 exactly when the turn is already happening 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:24.740
 also such an important back room for 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.740
 deadbolt 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.969
 in this gear cycle stop thrust we 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:38.080
 Probably considered all that you can 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:41.639
 had to consider around the back rooms 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.009
 Well, not touching of course the technique 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.870
 the classics and the amount because of this already 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:50.139
 said much more reputable uncle 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.550
 not so much what they say , and just 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:56.560
 indecent on everything with regard to the back rooms 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.139
 traction in dead traction 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.969
 todes plinths with yankoy disciplines 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:04.080
 considered completely and plant you 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:04.080
 should only take and do
