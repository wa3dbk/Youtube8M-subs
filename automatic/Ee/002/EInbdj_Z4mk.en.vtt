00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.330

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.450
 one hundred coins 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.129

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.300
 then you think a team exactly and may 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.149

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.340
 unfortunately not but yes that does not matter 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.500
 from what i actually have about that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.030
 we just now since the two thousand 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.850

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.920
 then also make it again because it is finished 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.110
 one way from my channel 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.540

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.840

 also show a lot of pack opening 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 it might not be super fun because 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.299
 this was not live because this was in the evening 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.090
 was around two o'clock or so then I saw 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.560
 they just buy these packs on account 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.079
 I just speed up in succession 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.200
 fuck asshole the what behind 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.450
 so yes with this I do the 7 and the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.310
 we will do silver packs live 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.680
 because of course they are something 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.210
 special i hope i have detail team there 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.009
 of the season can not get out because that 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.590
 would be fucking to if we could do it 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.210

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.780

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.030
 season players are going to do a review 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.219
 so if you want a player 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.570
 put it down in the comments and 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.719
 I'm going to see if that player can 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.799

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.750
