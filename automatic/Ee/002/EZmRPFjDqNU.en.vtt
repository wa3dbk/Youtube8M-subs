the<00:02:19.430> best<00:02:19.580> representation<00:02:19.880> I've<00:02:20.269> ever<00:02:20.390> seen

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
the best representation I've ever seen

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.140 
the best representation I've ever seen
in<00:02:20.750> terms<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.049> grading<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.099> out<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.370> 10<00:02:22.580> but<00:02:22.940> for

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
in terms of grading it out of 10 but for

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.970 
in terms of grading it out of 10 but for
me<00:02:23.269> it's<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.599> 10<00:02:23.810> I've<00:02:24.019> never<00:02:24.260> seen<00:02:24.410> something

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
me it's a 10 I've never seen something

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.660 
me it's a 10 I've never seen something
so<00:02:25.190> accurate

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.230 

I<00:02:30.740> have<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.890> sometimes<00:02:32.310> step<00:02:32.610> back<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.030> pinch

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
I have to sometimes step back and pinch

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.000 
I have to sometimes step back and pinch
myself<00:02:33.450> when<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.930> see<00:02:34.230> like<00:02:34.530> what<00:02:34.830> we're
