00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:24.389 
let's see how they go so I've just paste

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:26.359

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.459 
it onto my nail and I'm just heating up
the<00:01:26.490> foil<00:01:27.029> now<00:01:27.329> I've<00:01:27.479> seen<00:01:27.779> this<00:01:27.990> done<00:01:28.259> without

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
the foil now I've seen this done without

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.909 
the foil now I've seen this done without
heat<00:01:29.219> but<00:01:30.029> apparently<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:30.990> work<00:01:31.229> best<00:01:31.590> if

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:31.919 
heat but apparently they work best if

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:36.669 
heat but apparently they work best if
you<00:01:32.159> heat<00:01:32.459> up<00:01:32.609> the<00:01:32.700> foil<00:01:33.179> just<00:01:33.539> a<00:01:33.689> little<00:01:33.929> bit

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.289 

I'm<00:01:37.679> just<00:01:37.859> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> take<00:01:38.429> my<00:01:38.609> nail<00:01:38.789> scissors

I'm just going to take my nail scissors
now<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.779> cut<00:01:40.259> off<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.799> excess<00:01:41.219> if<00:01:41.729> you've<00:01:42.179> got

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
now and cut off the excess if you've got

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.569 
now and cut off the excess if you've got
longer<00:01:42.599> nails<00:01:42.869> obviously<00:01:43.679> you<00:01:43.859> can<00:01:44.039> skip<00:01:44.369> this

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
longer nails obviously you can skip this

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.550 
longer nails obviously you can skip this
part<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.539> if<00:01:45.659> you've<00:01:45.779> got<00:01:45.959> shorter<00:01:46.380> nails

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
part but if you've got shorter nails

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.830 
part but if you've got shorter nails
like<00:01:46.859> me<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.279> can<00:01:47.310> keep<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.789> extra<00:01:48.419> bit<00:01:48.569> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
like me you can keep that extra bit and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.690 
like me you can keep that extra bit and
then<00:01:49.229> reuse<00:01:49.859> it<00:01:50.099> and<00:01:50.489> you'll<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.359> an<00:01:51.539> extra

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
then reuse it and you'll get an extra

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.969 
then reuse it and you'll get an extra
hair<00:01:53.700> out<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.450> set<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.679> I'm<00:01:55.770> just

and<00:02:19.350> smooth<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.430> heat<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.700> up<00:02:20.910> at<00:02:21.120> this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
and smooth you can heat it up at this

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.590 
and smooth you can heat it up at this
stage<00:02:21.690> if<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.110> like<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:23.000> now<00:02:24.000> take<00:02:24.270> your<00:02:24.420> nail

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
file and just fall off the edges and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.060 
file and just fall off the edges and
file<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.020> down<00:02:28.290> would<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.710> don't<00:02:28.860> want<00:02:29.010> to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
file it down would you don't want to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.680 
file it down would you don't want to
push<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.460> up<00:02:29.700> because<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.300> might<00:02:30.480> actually

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
push it up because you might actually

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.510 
push it up because you might actually
lift<00:02:31.110> up<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> foil<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.970> that's<00:02:33.180> my<00:02:33.390> nail<00:02:33.990> done

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
lift up the foil so that's my nail done

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.520 
lift up the foil so that's my nail done
I'll<00:02:35.520> show<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.820> again<00:02:36.180> what<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.450> did<00:02:36.750> with<00:02:37.500> that

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
I'll show you again what I did with that

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.730 
I'll show you again what I did with that
leftover<00:02:38.520> piece<00:02:38.970> from<00:02:39.000> my<00:02:39.450> other<00:02:39.600> hand<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.680> you

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
leftover piece from my other hand so you

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.010 
leftover piece from my other hand so you
can<00:02:41.190> see<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.550> doesn't<00:02:41.820> have<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> round<00:02:42.330> edge<00:02:42.630> so

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
can see it doesn't have a round edge so

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.660 
can see it doesn't have a round edge so
i<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.290> took<00:02:43.380> my<00:02:43.530> scissors<00:02:44.100> which<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.430> can't

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
i just took my scissors which you can't

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.370 
i just took my scissors which you can't
see<00:02:44.790> me<00:02:45.000> doing<00:02:45.180> at<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> moment<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:46.020> i<00:02:46.080> just

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
see me doing at the moment but i just

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.440 
see me doing at the moment but i just
rounded<00:02:46.950> off<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.310> edges<00:02:47.460> there<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.150> i<00:02:48.180> could

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
rounded off the edges there so i could

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.210 
rounded off the edges there so i could
push<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.690> up<00:02:49.020> next<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.410> my<00:02:49.500> cuticle<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.040> it

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
push it up next to my cuticle and it

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.490 
push it up next to my cuticle and it
would<00:02:50.340> be<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.670> right<00:02:50.880> shape

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.170 

then<00:02:56.500> I'm<00:02:56.620> just<00:02:56.770> going<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.160> apply<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:57.880> straight

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
then I'm just going to apply it straight

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.450 
then I'm just going to apply it straight
onto<00:02:58.390> my<00:02:58.660> nail<00:02:58.840> now<00:02:59.380> once<00:02:59.650> you've<00:02:59.830> hated<00:03:00.070> these
