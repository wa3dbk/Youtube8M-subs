00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.099
 Mexican at this time that if the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.340

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.119
 the U-17 team that is 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.980
 participating in the World Cup 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.590
 specialty has given a big surprise 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.529
 good news for all the sport 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.410
 Mexican advanced to the semifinals of 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.359
 this world cup today eliminated 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.820
 nothing more or nothing less to the team 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.579
 favorite to win the World Cup 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.620
 the Brazilians is not the only occasion 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.290
 that eliminate the Brazilians or the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.270
 they leave out in a U-17 world cup is the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.969
 fourth time if I remember correctly that 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.390
 mexico beats brazil in this kind of 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.469
 events was very good match two 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.120
 of end 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.850
 mexico- ten minutes from the end 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.280
 He scored the goal that gave the victory 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.489
 these moments by iván ochoa 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.590
 who made a play inside the area 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.680
 girl practically bounced and hit her 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.600
 almost with the heel of the right foot and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.689
 embedded in the defended goal 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.780
 frames the Brazilian goalkeeper himself 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.659
 Brazil is Brazil, not luck, fortune 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.700
 I do not know what those Brazilians have but 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.340
 to end the match tied to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.680
 Mexico in a rebound that fell to him 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.869
 player and embedded it within the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.710
 networks of the Mexican goalkeeper surnamed 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.440
 gudiño and went to criminal penalties that 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.200
 they were one after another they were thrown in 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.899
 total 11 criminals by both 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.039
 teams by brásil failed two and by 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.990
 mexico only one is novelty that 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.909
 mexico win in penal in this type of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.520
 competitions but that means that 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.619
 Mexican soccer is advancing 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.560
 congratulations for all these young people who 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.990
 they put up the name of mexico because 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.720
 It is not easy in this specialty 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.700
 keep as one of the favorites for 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.819
 take the championship was champion 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.799
 of the world in Peru 2005 with a litter of 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.009
 very good players he was champion 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.550
 world in 2011 if not bad memory 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.830
 here in our country in mexico 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.080
 and you have the possibility to be 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.640
 again world champion in the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.610
 world sub-17 this year what it is of 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.910
 notice and what I would like to emphasize 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.490
 here is that young Mexicans have 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.450
 a lot of talent but a lot of talent 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.550
 to emigrate to other European clubs 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.610
 South America as leagues from Brazil to 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.890
 Argentina's not in Mexico I will 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.100
 I mean these young people who do have 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.010
 the possibility of going to a team of 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.020
 hollanda de españa 'of england by 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.720
 European countries that are competitive 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.870
 go do not stay in mexico in 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.000
 mexico football closes them very ugly 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.340
 doors to all the young people who have 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.530
 talent in brazil is given many 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.600
 possibilities to emigrate from developing 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.730
 a good soccer thing that does not happen in 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.220
 mexico also likewise in europe it 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.070
 is very supportive of young people here and not 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.800
 we have seen not only since it 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.530
 he was world champion in 2005 in the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.380
 2011 how many players had the 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.510
 opportunity to leave 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.540
 and not what they did to stay in 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.490
 mexico because they offered them the eggs 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.740
 of gold and they were told that they were going to 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.140
 become great athletes and 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.150
 it was not like that I give you the examples of the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.760
 duck araujo who was world champion in 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.220
 the year 2005 that if I remember correctly what 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.020
 he wanted the arsenal of england and jorge 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.820
 Vergara the manager of the Chivas 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.790
 under the moon and the stars to this 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.040
 young man who had a lot of talent and 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.740
 practically nothing has happened with him 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.840
 continues battling in a mediocre team 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.560
 as it is currently the guadalajara 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.090
 he also had the opportunity ever guzmán 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.790
 a young man who played in blue cross that 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.400
 practically disappeared in the 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.440
 2011 world champions there is 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.560
 iron that chivas currently plays 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.330
 with very few possibilities for 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.460
 show your soccer this July gomez that 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.880
 plays in the pachuca that has not been given 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.920
 the opportunity to not even play or 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.410
 have minutes in this tournament with the 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.230
 pachuca is also the player of 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.510
 Tiger is a slim young spery if 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.680
 not bad I remember that the tuca ferretti 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.770
 has deleted 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.080
 does not give you minutes are young with a lot 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.120
 talent to name only some 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.919
 but there are a lot of young people who were 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.740
 world champions with mexico that the 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.900
 they wanted in europe and they did not leave because 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.479
 here in Mexico they were promised something that 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.120
 have not met I do not know if the managers 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.639
 Mexicans the technical directors 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.889
 wait until they reach 22 23 years to 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.560
 give them minutes of play so that 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.330
 prove your football is not like this 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.190
 things how they work there are players 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.660
 Uruguayan Brazilian players 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.699
 Argentineans who at 21 22 years old are already 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.320
 world figures and here in mexico 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.590
 they just want to give them the opportunity 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.970
 to excel to be holders or 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.000
 headlines in the first teams 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.520
 Mexican division but to give them 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.130
 continuity of putting them some minutes 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.650
 to each party thing that should not be like that 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.539
 these young people have demonstrated character 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.849
 They have shown great hunger to succeed 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.580
 within football not only 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.349
 national but also international by 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.540
 what if these young people get to 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:31.380
 conquer the crown 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.090
 the world under-17 this year and many 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.250
 viewers from other European clubs are going 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.650
 to have in my sights and I can assure you 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.390
 that they are going to want to take some 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.570
 holland clubs spain england 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.940
 italy very many other teams of 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.820
 renown I tell them they do not have a 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.740
 contract with no Mexican club in the 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.650
 currently are minors so 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.560
 I imagine they are not well 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.050
 related to their equipment but not like that 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.140
 it does not mean that they do not have something 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.560
 see but it's much easier to go to 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.140
 Europe 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.020
 in these moments take the opportunity 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.270
 there they will develop them with much more 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.510
 ease here in Mexico they are going to 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.970
 truncate your career are the cases that 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.610
 he mentioned them at that moment I remember 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.010
 carlos vela that jorge vergara said that 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.280
 I did not know I was going to give him a chance 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:27.070
 it was not very well seen by him he wanted to 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.030
 go gentlemen and there is the decision that he 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.100
 it took was the best he would not be 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.230
 practically nobody in Mexico he is 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.870
 doing things very well 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.490
 europe in spain 'specific and if 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.730
 I was staying here in our country 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.010
 was this young man just getting 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.230
 minutes so young Mexicans 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.720
 you have a lot of talent take advantage 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.530
 that and take advantage of that they are in the sights of 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.430
 the best European teams for 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.040
 demonstrate your qualities 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.850
 congratulations for you Mexicans who 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.520
