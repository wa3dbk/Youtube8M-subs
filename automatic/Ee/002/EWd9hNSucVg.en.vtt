00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
you know where they belong it's not a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.280 
you know where they belong it's not a
guessing<00:02:58.610> game<00:02:58.790> when<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.240> design<00:02:59.510> far<00:02:59.810> ok<00:03:00.110> you

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
guessing game when you design far ok you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.230 
guessing game when you design far ok you
say<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.530> can<00:03:00.740> put<00:03:00.920> together<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.520> bouquet<00:03:01.940> a

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
say you can put together a bouquet a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:13.770 
say you can put together a bouquet a
wedding<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.750> play<00:03:02.959> in<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.320> minute<00:03:03.650> it's<00:03:03.920> about<00:03:04.220> a

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.360 

little<00:03:14.780> lesson<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.440> do<00:03:15.680> this<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:15.890> long<00:03:16.100> time

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
little lesson I to do this a long time

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.190 
little lesson I to do this a long time
so<00:03:16.730> maybe<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.150> average<00:03:17.450> girl<00:03:17.660> few<00:03:17.959> minutes

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
so maybe the average girl few minutes

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.470 
so maybe the average girl few minutes
longer<00:03:18.380> but<00:03:18.739> what<00:03:19.040> can<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.340> do<00:03:19.580> with<00:03:19.820> a<00:03:20.150> bunch

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
longer but what can you do with a bunch

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.650 
longer but what can you do with a bunch
of<00:03:20.620> rows<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.830> mattress<00:03:22.340> right<00:03:22.519> there<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:23.570> is

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
of rows the mattress right there this is

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.479 
of rows the mattress right there this is
a<00:03:23.690> really<00:03:24.110> good<00:03:24.200> tip<00:03:24.410> then<00:03:24.680> here's<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.250> here's

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
a really good tip then here's it here's

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.530 
a really good tip then here's it here's

left-to-right motion last fifth do that

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.360 
left-to-right motion last fifth do that
