00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.940 
cast iron is it really cooks everything
evenly<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.900> end<00:02:15.170> up<00:02:15.290> using<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.739> lot<00:02:15.920> less

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
evenly so you end up using a lot less

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.580 
evenly so you end up using a lot less
oil<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.790> then<00:02:17.599> we're<00:02:17.720> gonna<00:02:17.810> move<00:02:18.080> on<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.290> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
oil and then we're gonna move on to the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.500 
oil and then we're gonna move on to the
hollandaise<00:02:18.980> sauce<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.940> basically<00:02:20.269> I'm<00:02:20.390> gonna

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
hollandaise sauce so basically I'm gonna

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.199 
hollandaise sauce so basically I'm gonna
take<00:02:20.630> eggs<00:02:21.519> separate<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.670> whites<00:02:22.880> from<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
take eggs separate the whites from the

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.680 
take eggs separate the whites from the
yolks<00:02:26.440> whoo<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.970> here<00:02:29.150> we're<00:02:29.239> gonna<00:02:29.330> use<00:02:29.540> the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
yolks whoo so here we're gonna use the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.140 
yolks whoo so here we're gonna use the
juice<00:02:29.840> of<00:02:30.019> half<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.769> lemon<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.310> we're<00:02:32.060> gonna

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
juice of half of a lemon and we're gonna

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.059 
juice of half of a lemon and we're gonna
put<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.569> into<00:02:32.930> our<00:02:33.500> hollandaise<00:02:34.040> sauce

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
put this into our hollandaise sauce

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.210 
put this into our hollandaise sauce
which<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.640> basically<00:02:35.180> an<00:02:35.920> emulsified<00:02:36.920> egg

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
which is basically an emulsified egg

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.490 
which is basically an emulsified egg
yolk<00:02:37.760> sauce<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.510> mean<00:02:38.660> it's<00:02:38.840> really<00:02:39.080> not<00:02:39.350> as

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
yolk sauce I mean it's really not as

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.860 
yolk sauce I mean it's really not as
difficult<00:02:39.530> as<00:02:40.190> people<00:02:40.580> say<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:40.880> is<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.480> mean

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
difficult as people say it is I mean

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.170 
difficult as people say it is I mean
yeah<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.110> mean<00:02:42.260> it's<00:02:42.709> French<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.489> sounds

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
yeah I mean it's French so it sounds

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.150 
yeah I mean it's French so it sounds
fancy<00:02:44.420> but<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.230> doesn't<00:02:45.530> mean<00:02:45.590> fancy<00:02:46.010> is

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
fancy but that doesn't mean fancy is

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.580 
fancy but that doesn't mean fancy is
hard<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:47.660> we<00:02:47.750> do<00:02:47.930> here<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.170> I'm<00:02:48.230> gonna<00:02:48.319> whisk

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
hard so we do here is I'm gonna whisk

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.039 
together and basically you want to whisk
it<00:02:52.459> until<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.850> looks<00:02:53.180> like<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:53.510> doubled<00:02:53.900> in

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
it until it looks like it's doubled in

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.770 
it until it looks like it's doubled in
