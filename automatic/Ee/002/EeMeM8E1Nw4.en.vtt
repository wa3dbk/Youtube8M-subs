00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.590 
where it's held in just by two screws so
I<00:02:12.500> didn't<00:02:12.800> want<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.010> alter<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.580> plate<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:14.540> I

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
I didn't want to alter the plate so I

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.070 
I didn't want to alter the plate so I
put<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:14.870> screw<00:02:15.140> here<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.670> it's<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.510> know<00:02:17.630> not<00:02:17.840> so

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
put a screw here so it's you know not so

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.380 
put a screw here so it's you know not so
Mota<00:02:18.320> scible<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.250> put<00:02:19.459> another<00:02:19.700> screw<00:02:20.000> here

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
Mota scible and I put another screw here

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.930 
Mota scible and I put another screw here
so<00:02:21.230> two<00:02:21.290> screws<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:21.950> what<00:02:22.130> holds<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.520> license

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
so two screws is what holds this license

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.930 
so two screws is what holds this license
plate<00:02:23.000> down<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.739> so<00:02:24.739> these<00:02:24.920> these<00:02:25.400> four<00:02:25.730> holes

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
plate down and so these these four holes

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.530 
plate down and so these these four holes
are<00:02:26.209> just<00:02:26.390> not<00:02:26.630> being<00:02:26.660> utilized<00:02:27.670> but<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.940> think

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
are just not being utilized but I think

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.449 
are just not being utilized but I think
it's<00:02:29.690> smaller<00:02:30.260> if<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.590> use<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.040> license

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
it's smaller if you use the license

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.030 
it's smaller if you use the license
plate<00:02:31.700> frame<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.420> ends<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:32.720> being<00:02:32.930> bigger<00:02:33.230> and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
plate frame it ends up being bigger and

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.710 
plate frame it ends up being bigger and
I<00:02:34.130> kind<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:34.610> being<00:02:34.970> small

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
I kind of like it being small

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.270 
I kind of like it being small
