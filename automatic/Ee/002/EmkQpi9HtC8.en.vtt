00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 but 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.490
 welcome everyone to my channel today 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.059
 we talk about exotic fruits and 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.970
 berries 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.619
 China, thanks to advanced logistics in winter 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.960
 even in cold regions you can get 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.160
 almost any fruit or both 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.829
 i was pretty interesting to watch 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.050
 as in the winter the shelves alternately collapsed 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.789
 different seasonal fruits first everything 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.829
 was littered with tangerines then 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.870
 tangerines changed manga manga changed 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.880
 pineapples but spring has come on the street 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.620
 and in the baskets started selling strawberries 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.270
 but apart from strawberries appeared 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.770
 some interesting berry I first 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.420
 passed by did not pay attention but 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.800
 then still stopped and purchased 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.750
 myself when she brought her home and put 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.670
 the Internet turned out that this berry 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.110
 called and the barn is a berry already 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.580
 quite famous on the Internet 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.840
 thanks to one firm who 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.480
 advertise ice cream 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.610
 her tastes for half a kilo of such berries in my 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.290
 region ask from one and a half to two 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.850
 half dollars as the same kind to 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.740
 taste it reminds some joke 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.080
 genetic engineering from afar sort of like 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.240
 cherries come closer look like 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.549
 like blackberries or mulberry 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.590
 but inside the bone like conventional cherry 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.750
 but for such a cocktail of genetic properties 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.170
 the beast has nothing to do with that 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.360
 the reason that this berry is still 2000 years old 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.130
 grown in china 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.320
 why it was grown so long ago yes 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.670
 that tree is very unpretentious she 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.420
 can withstand almost any weather 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.120
 conditions 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.370
 if it is drought it will grow 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.260
 if there is strong humidity she too 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.300
 will feel fine poor 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.370
 the soil does not matter the main thing that was 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.500
 there was enough sun and there was no frost in winter 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.840
 below five degrees one plant can 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.299
 live for over 100 years and grow tall 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.170
 over 20 meters now these trees are also 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.909
 are grown 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.440
 but not only for food but also for 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.150
 decorations are cool let's see 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.700
 closer to the berry itself 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.430
 represents the surface of the berry very 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.020
 look like mulberry if you look 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.030
 carefully then it is also divided into 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.740
 there are some slices of mulberry too 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.720
 there are such cones but they have no bones 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:11.439
 bone here is only one if her 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:14.290
 cut then it will be more like 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:16.959
 cherries or cherries inside one big 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.700
 fuzzy bone that is not separated 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.360
 practically very tight and attached to 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.390
 outdoor 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.330
 and around 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.860
 but as to taste is also very ambiguous 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.569
 the taste of berries from berries can strongly 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.060
 differ for example here it has 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.950
 very sweet taste and pronounced 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.890
 smack through but if you take more 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.720
 light for example this here it 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.600
 will taste more like mulberry 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.000
 and berries ginger and there are other names 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.850
 and call as you are bending red or 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.920
 just wax berry in Japan is called 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.510
 pit mom in common call it 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.280
 Chinese strawberries confess with 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.800
 strawberries no common taste i'm not 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.540
 noticed on the strawberries he absolutely 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.090
 unlike the only thing that she is the same 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.040
 vulnerable as a strawberry and difficult to transport 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.290
 it is easy to drink is poisonous for what else 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.690
 uses these berries these berries 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.830
 use china as easy on food they cook 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.500
 with them jam and jam 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.269
 make juices and also drive Chinese 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.209
 moonshine from all exotic fruits 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.100
 who tried it in china this berry 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.660
 one of the few that came across me 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.400
 to taste 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.410
 so if you see something like this somewhere 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.130
 Berry highly recommend try it 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.019
 worth it 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.580
 on this i finish the video if you 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.170
 like this subject write to 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.600
