got the best box it's the only one that
we<00:06:20.380> pulled<00:06:20.620> out<00:06:20.710> of<00:06:20.770> the<00:06:20.860> whole<00:06:21.010> case<00:06:21.220> so<00:06:21.490> one

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
we pulled out of the whole case so one

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.310 
we pulled out of the whole case so one
out<00:06:21.789> of<00:06:21.820> every<00:06:22.060> 12<00:06:22.300> boxes<00:06:22.479> is<00:06:22.810> the<00:06:22.840> average<00:06:23.050> for

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
out of every 12 boxes is the average for

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.850 
out of every 12 boxes is the average for
this<00:06:23.440> guy

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
this guy

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.740 
this guy
so<00:06:24.400> that<00:06:24.700> guess<00:06:24.970> that's<00:06:25.240> it<00:06:25.479> this<00:06:25.630> is

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
so that guess that's it this is

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.330 
so that guess that's it this is
everything<00:06:26.050> we<00:06:26.260> were<00:06:26.350> able<00:06:26.470> to<00:06:26.620> pull<00:06:26.860> from<00:06:27.100> our

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
everything we were able to pull from our

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.540 
everything we were able to pull from our
case<00:06:28.229> pretty<00:06:29.229> decent<00:06:29.710> I<00:06:29.800> think<00:06:30.010> I<00:06:30.070> we<00:06:30.160> pulled<00:06:30.400> a

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
case pretty decent I think I we pulled a

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.250 
case pretty decent I think I we pulled a
good<00:06:30.880> number<00:06:31.060> of<00:06:31.330> really<00:06:31.570> good<00:06:31.750> cards<00:06:32.110> out<00:06:32.229> of

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
good number of really good cards out of

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.900 
good number of really good cards out of
here<00:06:32.500> would<00:06:32.680> have<00:06:32.800> wished<00:06:33.039> for<00:06:33.280> maybe<00:06:33.760> at

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
here would have wished for maybe at

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.149 
here would have wished for maybe at
least<00:06:34.030> one<00:06:34.330> or<00:06:34.479> two<00:06:34.510> more<00:06:34.690> the<00:06:35.289> gear<00:06:35.530> X's<00:06:35.919> but

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159 
least one or two more the gear X's but

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.100 
least one or two more the gear X's but
what<00:06:36.820> can<00:06:37.030> you<00:06:37.120> do<00:06:37.240> you<00:06:37.360> can't<00:06:37.659> get<00:06:37.840> them<00:06:37.990> all

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
what can you do you can't get them all

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.540 
what can you do you can't get them all
the<00:06:38.140> time

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
the time

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.890 
the time
in<00:06:39.729> the<00:06:39.910> comment<00:06:40.240> section<00:06:40.509> below<00:06:40.539> make<00:06:40.720> sure

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
in the comment section below make sure

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.510 
in the comment section below make sure
you<00:06:41.110> let<00:06:41.319> me<00:06:41.470> know<00:06:41.620> how<00:06:41.800> you<00:06:41.860> think<00:06:42.039> we<00:06:42.190> did<00:06:42.370> out

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
you let me know how you think we did out

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.879 
you let me know how you think we did out
of<00:06:42.639> our<00:06:42.759> case<00:06:43.000> opening<00:06:43.449> and<00:06:43.599> I<00:06:44.319> guess<00:06:44.620> that's

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
of our case opening and I guess that's

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:45.659 
of our case opening and I guess that's
it<00:06:45.129> for<00:06:45.160> now

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
it for now

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.990 
it for now
this<00:06:45.819> is<00:06:45.940> glad<00:06:46.150> to<00:06:46.180> god<00:06:46.449> out
