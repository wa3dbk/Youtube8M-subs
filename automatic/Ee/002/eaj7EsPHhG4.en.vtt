rules obviously which were nicely bound
nicely<00:01:09.390> produced<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.990> think<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> middle

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
nicely produced and I think the middle

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:22.249 
nicely produced and I think the middle
sections<00:01:13.920> come<00:01:14.100> away<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.729> my<00:01:14.880> case<00:01:21.110> just<00:01:22.110> show

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
sections come away in my case just show

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.179 
sections come away in my case just show
you<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> back<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:23.040> well

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.279 

and<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.640> pieces<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:31.079> wouldn't

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
and the pieces now you they wouldn't

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:32.510 
and the pieces now you they wouldn't
look<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.469> this<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.130> bought<00:01:32.340> this

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
look like this if you bought this

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.959 
look like this if you bought this

well<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.130> level<00:02:35.489> here<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.170> not<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.200> lot

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
well on this level here and not a lot

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.660 
well on this level here and not a lot
happens<00:02:37.680> there<00:02:37.920> probably<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:38.880> this<00:02:39.440> actually

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
happens there probably but this actually

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.129 
happens there probably but this actually
possibly<00:02:41.670> was<00:02:42.060> where<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.299> lot<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.630> combat<00:02:42.959> would

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
possibly was where a lot of combat would

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.129 
possibly was where a lot of combat would
take<00:02:43.350> place<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.950> cargo<00:02:44.340> area<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.959> game

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
take place this cargo area but the game

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.099 
take place this cargo area but the game
itself<00:02:46.470> doesn't<00:02:47.069> come<00:02:47.400> with<00:02:47.549> any<00:02:47.579> cargo<00:02:48.269> so

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
itself doesn't come with any cargo so

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.050 
itself doesn't come with any cargo so
what<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.319> did<00:02:49.620> was<00:02:49.829> I<00:02:50.389> made<00:02:51.389> up<00:02:51.630> some<00:02:52.380> squares

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
what I did was I made up some squares

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.379 
what I did was I made up some squares
which<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.239> can<00:02:54.420> then<00:02:54.600> place<00:02:55.260> over<00:02:56.150> the

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
which you can then place over the

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.300 
which you can then place over the
like<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.870> imagine<00:02:58.829> that<00:02:58.950> with<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.130> load

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
like that and imagine that with a load

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.830 
like that and imagine that with a load
of<00:02:59.340> cargo<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.000> then<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.299> run<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.720> out

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
of cargo and then you can run in and out

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.680 
of cargo and then you can run in and out
and<00:03:00.989> shoot<00:03:01.519> which<00:03:02.519> which<00:03:03.030> was<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.299> fun<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.599> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
and shoot which which was the fun of the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.620 
and shoot which which was the fun of the
game<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:04.139> better<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.250> play<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.700> game<00:03:05.849> as<00:03:06.299> two

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
game is better to play the game as two

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.559 
game is better to play the game as two
teams<00:03:06.930> or<00:03:07.549> some<00:03:08.549> objective<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.239> kill<00:03:09.480> off

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
teams or some objective like kill off

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.479 
teams or some objective like kill off
the<00:03:09.750> animals<00:03:10.190> running<00:03:11.190> around<00:03:11.389> obstacles<00:03:12.389> and

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
the animals running around obstacles and

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.379 
the animals running around obstacles and
generally<00:03:14.489> shooting<00:03:14.880> each<00:03:15.000> other<00:03:15.239> that's

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
generally shooting each other that's

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.539 
generally shooting each other that's
what<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.630> was<00:03:15.720> all<00:03:15.840> about<00:03:16.250> now<00:03:17.250> these<00:03:17.340> are<00:03:17.519> very

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
what it was all about now these are very

what it was all about now these are very
old-style<00:03:18.090> games<00:03:18.599> we've<00:03:18.900> got<00:03:19.079> write

everything down I've I've kept a few
motive<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:22.109> bit<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.769> previous<00:03:23.250> games<00:03:23.400> are

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
motive a bit of previous games are

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:24.650 
motive a bit of previous games are
written<00:03:23.819> down<00:03:23.940> but<00:03:24.150> there's<00:03:24.299> one<00:03:24.419> thing<00:03:24.569> I

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
written down but there's one thing I

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.629 
written down but there's one thing I
want<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.870> show<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.109> which<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.680> think<00:03:25.859> really<00:03:26.069> is

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
want to show you which I think really is

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.909 
want to show you which I think really is
very<00:03:26.819> nice<00:03:27.150> touch<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.750> game<00:03:27.959> I've<00:03:28.680> written

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
very nice touch the game I've written

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.190 
very nice touch the game I've written
this<00:03:29.040> down<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:30.060> lowest<00:03:30.419> action<00:03:30.900> point

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
this down is the lowest action point

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.740 
this down is the lowest action point
total<00:03:31.739> goes<00:03:31.950> first<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.760> highest<00:03:33.090> goes<00:03:33.450> last

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
total goes first and highest goes last

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.870 
total goes first and highest goes last
so<00:03:34.470> what<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.709> means<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.160> as<00:03:35.340> you're<00:03:35.519> running

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
so what that means is as you're running

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.699 
so what that means is as you're running
around<00:03:35.970> shooting<00:03:36.780> each<00:03:36.840> other<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.350> gradually

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
around shooting each other and gradually

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.410 
around shooting each other and gradually

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
dying those with more power

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.840 
dying those with more power
get<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.200> last<00:03:41.410> laugh<00:03:41.680> get<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.069> last<00:03:42.280> move<00:03:42.550> per

get the last laugh get the last move per

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.990 
get the last laugh get the last move per
turn<00:03:43.150> quite<00:03:43.690> realistic<00:03:44.319> that<00:03:44.610> so<00:03:45.610> they<00:03:45.730> are<00:03:45.760> I
