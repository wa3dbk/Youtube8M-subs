00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.859 
one of the greatest WWE superstars of
all<00:01:40.650> time<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.880> don't<00:01:42.060> know<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.390> Bray<00:01:42.600> Wyatt

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
all time and I don't know if Bray Wyatt

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.870 
all time and I don't know if Bray Wyatt
is<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> Undertaker's<00:01:43.979> level<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.549> yet<00:01:44.729> I

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
is on the Undertaker's level just yet I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.730 
is on the Undertaker's level just yet I
think<00:01:45.299> Bray<00:01:45.810> Wyatt<00:01:46.020> needs<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.439> groomed

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
think Bray Wyatt needs to be groomed

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530 
think Bray Wyatt needs to be groomed
further<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.299> match

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.859 
don't like disqualifications and I don't
agree<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:52.799> them<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.250> may<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.240> best<00:01:54.659> way

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280

of the ordinary I think Bray why and the
end<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.430> think<00:02:38.580> are<00:02:38.640> going<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.819> try<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.030> play
