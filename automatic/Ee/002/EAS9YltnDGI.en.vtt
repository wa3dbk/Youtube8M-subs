undercover<00:00:20.730> one<00:00:21.730> of<00:00:21.820> the<00:00:21.880> challenges<00:00:21.910> this

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
undercover one of the challenges this

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.079 
undercover one of the challenges this
year<00:00:22.599> was<00:00:22.990> creating<00:00:23.679> an<00:00:23.830> action<00:00:24.220> title<00:00:24.429> that

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089 
year was creating an action title that

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.540 
year was creating an action title that
was<00:00:25.240> very<00:00:25.419> accessible<00:00:26.019> with<00:00:26.259> the<00:00:26.349> physics<00:00:26.710> we

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
was very accessible with the physics we

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.009 
was very accessible with the physics we
wanted<00:00:27.759> to<00:00:27.820> create<00:00:27.910> a<00:00:28.119> whole<00:00:28.419> bunch<00:00:28.599> of<00:00:28.689> crazy

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
wanted to create a whole bunch of crazy

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.349 
wanted to create a whole bunch of crazy
cool<00:00:29.349> maneuvers<00:00:29.769> that<00:00:30.519> you<00:00:30.970> know<00:00:31.179> with

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
cool maneuvers that you know with

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.750 
cool maneuvers that you know with
essentially<00:00:31.929> a<00:00:31.960> flick<00:00:32.619> of<00:00:32.650> a<00:00:32.920> button<00:00:33.130> or<00:00:33.730> a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
essentially a flick of a button or a

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.840 
essentially a flick of a button or a
flick<00:00:34.240> of<00:00:34.329> the<00:00:34.390> stick<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.890> place<00:00:36.219> into<00:00:36.610> the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
flick of the stick to place into the

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.689 
flick of the stick to place into the
house<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:38.079> user<00:00:38.320> you<00:00:39.070> know<00:00:39.190> very<00:00:39.399> enjoyable

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
house the user you know very enjoyable

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.979 
house the user you know very enjoyable
easy<00:00:40.239> experience<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.910> this<00:00:43.210> year<00:00:43.359> we<00:00:43.840> started

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
easy experience so this year we started

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.290 
easy experience so this year we started
off<00:00:44.230> in<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.469> simple<00:00:44.739> burnout<00:00:45.070> so<00:00:45.789> essentially

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
off in the simple burnout so essentially

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.240 
off in the simple burnout so essentially
you're<00:00:46.510> just<00:00:46.570> holding<00:00:46.870> both<00:00:47.199> the<00:00:47.469> LTR<00:00:48.039> two

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
you're just holding both the LTR two

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.009 
you're just holding both the LTR two
triggers<00:00:48.579> down<00:00:48.789> its<00:00:49.359> spooling<00:00:49.539> up<00:00:49.780> those

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
triggers down its spooling up those

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.040 
triggers down its spooling up those
tires<00:00:50.320> getting<00:00:50.680> smoked

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
tires getting smoked

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.260 
tires getting smoked
billowing<00:00:52.320> out<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> fenders<00:00:53.040> there<00:00:53.270> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
billowing out of the fenders there and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.729 
billowing out of the fenders there and
all<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.320> like

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
all I'm going to do here is just like

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.020 
all I'm going to do here is just like
when<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> brakes<00:00:56.220> hold<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> throttle<00:00:56.790> down

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
when the brakes hold the throttle down

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.569 
when the brakes hold the throttle down
and<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.510> we're<00:00:57.690> off<00:00:57.920> that<00:00:58.920> essentially

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and and we're off that essentially

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.250 
and and we're off that essentially
started<00:01:00.090> okay<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.690> was<00:01:00.780> pretty<00:01:00.809> generic

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
started okay that was pretty generic

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.319 
started okay that was pretty generic
where<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.769> we<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:01.949> there<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.790> I<00:01:02.820> said<00:01:03.030> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
where can we go from there so I said you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.969 
where can we go from there so I said you
know<00:01:03.360> start<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> 360<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.800> do<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
know start with a 360 so you can do the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.469 
know start with a 360 so you can do the
same<00:01:05.129> thing<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.909> release<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> brake<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
same thing we release the brake and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.499 
same thing we release the brake and
steering<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> way<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.800> one<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.300> that<00:01:09.300> was

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
steering all the way to one way that was

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.170 
steering all the way to one way that was
the<00:01:09.659> car<00:01:09.840> into<00:01:10.050> a<00:01:10.080> beautiful<00:01:10.830> 360<00:01:11.460> camera

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
stays stationary first time ever were

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.200 
stays stationary first time ever were
you<00:01:14.820> able<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.330> full<00:01:15.810> 360<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.740> car<00:01:17.210> you

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
you able to see full 360 to the car you

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.580 
you able to see full 360 to the car you
see<00:01:18.390> all<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> realistic<00:01:19.080> suspension

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
see all the realistic suspension

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.109 
see all the realistic suspension
movement<00:01:19.649> as<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> normal<00:01:20.340> curveball<00:01:20.729> but

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
movement as a normal curveball but

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.120 
movement as a normal curveball but
really

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
really

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.859 
really
physics<00:01:23.969> is<00:01:24.090> all<00:01:24.270> doing<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.689> naturally

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
physics is all doing it naturally

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.760 
physics is all doing it naturally
bubbles<00:01:25.560> being<00:01:25.740> fake<00:01:26.009> phony<00:01:26.369> where<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.210> went

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
bubbles being fake phony where we went

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.490 
bubbles being fake phony where we went
basically<00:01:28.770> from<00:01:29.100> 40<00:01:29.850> attributes<00:01:30.420> say<00:01:31.049> six

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
basically from 40 attributes say six

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.590 
basically from 40 attributes say six
seven<00:01:31.770> years<00:01:31.799> ago<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.880> 400

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
seven years ago to up to 400

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.980 
seven years ago to up to 400
everything's<00:01:34.049> based<00:01:34.289> on<00:01:34.470> curves<00:01:34.770> speed<00:01:35.990> we

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
everything's based on curves speed we

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.080 
everything's based on curves speed we
can<00:01:37.020> tune<00:01:37.350> essentially<00:01:37.890> every<00:01:38.549> parameter<00:01:38.789> of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
can tune essentially every parameter of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.830 
can tune essentially every parameter of
the<00:01:39.179> car<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.070> got<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.429> got<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.299> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the car so then we got the got the you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.230 
the car so then we got the got the you
know<00:01:42.929> the<00:01:43.049> breaks<00:01:43.229> down<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.679> 360<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.119> then

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
know the breaks down with 360 so then

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.730 
know the breaks down with 360 so then
was<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.509> why<00:01:45.750> can't<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> warning<00:01:46.500> so

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
was that why can't we do a warning so

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.039 
was that why can't we do a warning so
essentially<00:01:47.069> with<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> flick<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.049> ebrake

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
essentially with a flick of the ebrake

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.929 
essentially with a flick of the ebrake
and<00:01:49.289> a<00:01:49.500> flick<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.860> steering<00:01:50.159> we're<00:01:50.640> into<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
and a flick of the steering we're into a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.630 
and a flick of the steering we're into a
180<00:01:51.329> let's<00:01:52.200> leave<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.679> camera<00:01:53.009> stationary

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
180 let's leave the camera stationary

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.399 
180 let's leave the camera stationary
there<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> do<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
there and all we have to do now the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.529 
there and all we have to do now the
camera<00:01:55.830> is<00:01:55.890> perfect<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:57.060> reverse<00:01:57.360> driving

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
camera is perfect for reverse driving

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.960 
camera is perfect for reverse driving
camera<00:01:58.409> rotates<00:01:58.770> around<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.459> now<00:01:59.789> we're

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
camera rotates around and now we're

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.240 
camera rotates around and now we're
reverse<00:02:00.240> driving<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.530> very<00:02:01.709> touchy<00:02:02.039> as

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
reverse driving so it's very touchy as

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.949 
reverse driving so it's very touchy as
in<00:02:02.369> real<00:02:02.520> life<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.270> really

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
in real life you have to be really

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.870 
in real life you have to be really
sensitive<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.619> stick<00:02:04.860> little<00:02:05.459> taps<00:02:05.700> will

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
sensitive for the stick little taps will

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.669 
sensitive for the stick little taps will
do<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.750> now<00:02:06.990> we're<00:02:07.289> actually<00:02:07.380> driving

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
do but now we're actually driving

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.800 
do but now we're actually driving
reverse<00:02:08.220> something<00:02:08.580> we've<00:02:08.670> never<00:02:08.880> ever<00:02:09.539> had

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
reverse something we've never ever had

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.020 
reverse something we've never ever had
before<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.229> any<00:02:10.349> need<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.679> speed<00:02:11.069> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
before in any need for speed and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.330 
before in any need for speed and
essentially<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:13.530> get<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.709> totally<00:02:14.069> different

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
essentially you get a totally different

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.009 
essentially you get a totally different
perspective<00:02:14.549> looking<00:02:15.420> at<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.690> front<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.930> the

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
perspective looking at the front of the

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.270 
perspective looking at the front of the
car<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.319> I'll

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
car and I'll

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.949 
car and I'll
so<00:02:17.850> now<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.180> have<00:02:18.209> reverse<00:02:18.569> driving<00:02:18.750> we

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
so now that we have reverse driving we

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.800 
so now that we have reverse driving we
said<00:02:19.110> okay<00:02:19.290> very<00:02:19.620> cool<00:02:19.830> let's<00:02:20.550> do<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:21.630> we<00:02:21.660> do

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
said okay very cool let's do can we do

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.809 
said okay very cool let's do can we do
j-turns<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:22.470> then<00:02:22.560> flick<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.950> switch<00:02:22.980> so

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
j-turns but then flick of a switch so

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.120 
j-turns but then flick of a switch so
all<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.209> flick<00:02:24.660> boom<00:02:25.319> or<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.830> other

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
all we do is flick boom or the other

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.970 
all we do is flick boom or the other
let's<00:02:26.730> see<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.150> combines<00:02:28.080> let's<00:02:28.500> go<00:02:28.650> into<00:02:28.950> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
let's see that combines let's go into a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.900 
let's see that combines let's go into a
j-turn<00:02:29.870> goes<00:02:30.870> into<00:02:31.170> reverse<00:02:31.290> or<00:02:31.830> flick<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.850> a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
j-turn goes into reverse or flick of a

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.800 
j-turn goes into reverse or flick of a
switch<00:02:34.040> boom<00:02:35.040> we're<00:02:35.850> back<00:02:36.000> or<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.600> other<00:02:36.660> way

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
switch boom we're back or the other way

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.920 
switch boom we're back or the other way
with<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.800> j-turn<00:02:38.190> there<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.600> okay

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
with the j-turn there so is that okay

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.410 
with the j-turn there so is that okay
all<00:02:40.200> all<00:02:40.530> that's<00:02:40.740> separating<00:02:40.890> now<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:41.790> 360s

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
all all that's separating now to do 360s

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.840 
all all that's separating now to do 360s
is<00:02:42.720> just<00:02:42.930> doing<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.170> faster<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.490> let's<00:02:44.730> get

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
is just doing that faster so let's get

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.010 
is just doing that faster so let's get
gather<00:02:45.210> some<00:02:45.480> speed<00:02:45.720> here

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.560 

so<00:02:52.350> nice<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.890> sharp<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.580> crisp<00:02:53.700> let's<00:02:54.270> do<00:02:54.420> one

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
so nice and sharp and crisp let's do one

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.110 
so nice and sharp and crisp let's do one
more<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:55.470> show<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.800> shows<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.190> at<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.610> one

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
more to show it shows that at that one

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.480 
more to show it shows that at that one
wasn't<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.450> fluke

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
wasn't a fluke

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.740 
wasn't a fluke
it's<00:02:59.490> a<00:02:59.610> simple

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.540 

nice<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.959> reactive<00:03:04.410> just<00:03:05.040> showing<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.400> how

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
nice and reactive just showing you how

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.580 
nice and reactive just showing you how
flicks<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.569> switch<00:03:06.840> flicks<00:03:07.410> are<00:03:07.530> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
flicks of the switch flicks are the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.620 
flicks of the switch flicks are the
controls<00:03:07.980> allow<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.150> dance<00:03:09.420> around

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
controls allow you just to dance around

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.199 
controls allow you just to dance around
finish<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.260> car<00:03:10.470> i'm<00:03:11.310> going<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.640> show<00:03:11.819> you<00:03:11.849> now

finish the car i'm going to show you now

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.830 
finish the car i'm going to show you now
how<00:03:12.569> that's<00:03:13.230> possible<00:03:13.650> if<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.780> pretty<00:03:15.780> much

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
how that's possible if you pretty much

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.320 
how that's possible if you pretty much
spin<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.230> car<00:03:16.380> around<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.830> this<00:03:16.920> light<00:03:17.330> first

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
spin the car around in this light first

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.880 
spin the car around in this light first
time<00:03:18.480> again<00:03:18.750> everywhere<00:03:19.260> you're<00:03:19.470> able<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.770> see

time again everywhere you're able to see

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.490 
time again everywhere you're able to see
the<00:03:20.010> side<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.489> car<00:03:20.670> completely<00:03:21.500> you'll

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
the side of the car completely you'll

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.309 
the side of the car completely you'll
notice<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.950> fenders<00:03:23.340> here<00:03:23.720> how<00:03:24.720> how<00:03:25.170> much

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
notice the fenders here how how much

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.780 
notice the fenders here how how much
suspension<00:03:25.800> movement<00:03:25.920> there<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> bit<00:03:26.640> from

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
suspension movement there is a bit from

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.670 
suspension movement there is a bit from
the<00:03:26.819> car<00:03:27.060> that's<00:03:27.870> all<00:03:28.080> happening<00:03:28.350> naturally

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
the car that's all happening naturally

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.440 
the car that's all happening naturally
that's<00:03:29.130> all<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.489> know<00:03:29.610> we<00:03:29.700> have<00:03:30.290> progressive

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
that's all you know we have progressive

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.619 
that's all you know we have progressive
Springs<00:03:33.319> we<00:03:33.920> have<00:03:34.069> digressive<00:03:34.819> shocks<00:03:35.090> we

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
Springs we have digressive shocks we

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.479 
Springs we have digressive shocks we
have<00:03:35.780> roll<00:03:36.020> bars<00:03:36.290> with<00:03:36.709> everything<00:03:37.099> based<00:03:37.310> on

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
have roll bars with everything based on

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.780 
have roll bars with everything based on
speed<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:38.360> we<00:03:38.840> are<00:03:38.959> able<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.410> go<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.920> diagnose

that's the other thing all wheel drives

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.730 
that's the other thing all wheel drives
