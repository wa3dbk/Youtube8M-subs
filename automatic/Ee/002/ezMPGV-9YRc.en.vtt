00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.840
 what would you think I said we can 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.680
 prepare a delicious dish of chop suey 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.680
 without any fat 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.490
 Hi, yes griffin and I are going to show you 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.619
 how to prepare this typical dish 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.020
 Chinese restaurant easily and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.940
 healthy 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.160
 we have made some variations with the 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.720
 weight in the recipe for drivers the first 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.119
 of them is that we are going to cook it without 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.150
 no fat and when I say nothing is 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.130
 nothing the second is that we have changed 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.020
 the almonds of the original recipe by 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.610
 peanut or corn the reason why what 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.680
 we have changed is because the peanuts 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.750
 they contain a higher protein value 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.580
 that the almond seems made dream 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.090
 we are not going to complicate with many 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.280
 vegetables 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.739
 let's use three of them peppers 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.150
 onions and carrots you in 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.460
 your house you can change it or 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.270
 add them by which you have the process 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.340
 it's going to be the same 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.720

 a little kiss until later phoenix for the 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.530
 today's recipe we will use 400 grams of 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.659
 boneless chicken thigh cut into 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.039
 small pieces about 50 milliliters of 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.770
 soybeans mixed with a little water the 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.539
 part equal about 15 grams of cornstarch 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.450
 or corn starch 100 grams of onion 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.280
 cut into large pieces 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.620
 50 grams of green pepper 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.370
 50 grams of carrot 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.980
 30 grams of peanuts 10 grams of 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.010
 lemon squeezed or catch half lemon and 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.720
 Hangover is the juice so no motorcycles 3 grams 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.460
 this is monosodium glutamate they sell it 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.690
 in Asian specialty stores if 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.730
 you do not find it does not happen absolutely 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.890
 nothing and a little bit of grated ginger 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.890
 about one gram or less 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.010
 look 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.819
 we are going to mix in a bowl the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.650
 ginger the lemon the cornstarch and half 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.780
 more or less of the watery soya that 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.390
 we had and we're going to leave the chicken 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.480
 marinated macerating as it is said in 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.099
 your country about an hour two 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.099
 hours or even the longer the better 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.370
 on the other hand we check in the pan 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.560
 It is also hot and we are adding 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.120
 the vegetables first the onion then the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.230
 carrot let's leave these two 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.910
 vegetables longer than the pepper 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.710
 because they take longer to be done later 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.630
 we will add the green pepper 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.490
 we will remove a little and here comes the crux 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.650
 of the matter we are going to add a 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.750
 glass of water to the vegetable and let's 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.180
 let this slime evaporate to fire 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.510
 very fast during a short space of 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.770
 weather 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.820
 the vegetable will take a prettier color and 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.770
 we will get the poached effect that 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.310
 get with the oil saving us 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.900
 that all fats which provides for longer 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.670
 all the water has evaporated and we have 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.580
 been moving the vegetable around 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.460
 about 5 more minutes to a medium heat or 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.910
 intense is not strong at all but almost 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.740
 you see how a drop has been 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.000
 of oil and the effect is practically 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.440
 he already knows the same but without oil 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.100
 we reserve we are going to reserve the 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.420
 vegetable and let's go with the chicken what 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.700
 first thing we're going to do is going to be catch 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.230
 the peanuts and toast them a bit yo to 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.750
 this before I gave him a little bit with the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.330
 mortar not much so that it 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.400
 when you put the meat on as it has no oil 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.560
 it will stick the pan so that you 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.720
 I recommend a non-stick pan if or 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.910
 yes 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.160
 in the cornstarch tends to stick to 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.080
 ribs so you have to move 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.360
 continuously with the palette the meat 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.610
 so that it does not stick to the end happens 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.560
 some 10 or 15 minutes 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.780
 the meat will be made and the only thing 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.140
 we will have to do is add the 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.140
 vegetable 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.900
 we are already reaching the end of the plate 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.780
 all we have to do is 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.700
 add the vegetable move everything not much 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.709
 because it is not necessary to add the 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.320
 ajinomoto the soy sauce that there was 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.330
 and it is already warm to wait for 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.140
 that thicken the cornstarch and serve the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.140
 dish to eat 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.680

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.259

 good you can eat the container 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.160
 The company will cut to the problem 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.350

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.670
