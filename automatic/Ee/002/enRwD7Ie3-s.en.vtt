 is found for a small video then 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.869
 new delhi the subject of the video i'm going 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.460
 first introduce you to the gameplay so 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.060
 a gameplay then pulls elite on the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.500
 close map 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.869
 hello rather not bad we go out 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.880
 will be able to see it then this video 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.590
 I will try to send it by the side that I 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.050
 have the coast cf 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 story to share the debate so I 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.810
 come on you talk when you can 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.430
 see in the title of what you think 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.020
 that there will be in the dlc 4 of black 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.730
 ops 2 why am I doing this video 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.140
 simply because in mourning his 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.210
 four of black ops 1 they did a 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.500
 dlc weird enough finally it's weird 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.760
 in the sense that it was because they 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.510
 we announce that they had made us 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.270
 in others 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.010
 so she's got us done for 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.170
 those who do not know that map 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.700
 zombie so four old call map 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.340
 of duty world at war and a new map 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.180
 world I do not really know what they 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.650
 have me in this dlc 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.270
 so I propose you is not bad of 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.549
 things we're going to do a lot of things 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.100
 combinations a parents compilation that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.780
 will be able to do what I would like 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.250
 that they do first then what 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.270
 I would like him to really do everything 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.439
 price it would be he give us back 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.579
 four matches of his big ben there like 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.439
 that what will be on the other hand for me the 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.670
 the must must we say so if a 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.440
 zombie map meter what I would like 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.550
 well they are putting these four 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.530
 notes that put me back i think that 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.659
 I'd like to see maps 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.010
 of air rice so the code map call of 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.260
 duty world at war a very very good 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.479
 mark that I had enjoyed too 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.100
 the ascension map what is one of 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.580
 best map I found on the same 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.400
 lacoste 1 and also both mavs so 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.310
 claude haughty art and rails and file 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.810
 sorry so I think it's this one 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.270
 the four best mc doumbia like that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.260
 at the level of its be so here is a meter 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.600
 maps I would like to hand over 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.090
 this one in the passage there I galéré actu 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.640
 is this one so that's it and then of course 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.070
 a new map they will create that 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.240
 for black ops so then if they do not 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.670
 do not do that what I would like it 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.189
 do is just put back too 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.489
 four children's maps call of duty 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.530
 so be world at war to the blackhawks this 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.810
 would be nice too in multiplayer 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.819
 for multiplayer players because 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.110
 it is true that there is a lot of map 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.599
 I love the hull st 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.340
 so we have already made the maps 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.439
 preferring we're going to say players so 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.029
 ie sudden and ferry barn that 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.419
 v that turns out to be really good 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:26.890
 map 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:29.319
 besides, even the same sum the commune 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.330
 they have me prophet in hobbies are very 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.800
 good maps so if they remake maps of 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.140
 black ops in multiplayer what 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.670
 I would like them to put so that's 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.410
 lahoud ch so a very good map so 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.480
 do our is the map or even the rocket 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.440
 take off a moment of the game and 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.540
 then the map wmd w kg synamap in the 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.520
 snow that I very much appreciated 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.650
 also in black ops one so especially if 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.730
 their fists a remake we will say that they 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.989
 leave it in the snow because 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.580
 it is true that he continues to measure 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.660
 a so sudden remake was a map in 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.130
 snow for those who do not 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.260
 do not know and we're done again in 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.600
 the map in the rain rather dark then 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.980
 that it was rather the opposite a map 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.400
 in the snow and then a map well 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.989
 sunny here and also in two maps 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.750
 two remaining amap 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.340
 whether it is the tablecloth stadium so a 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.320
 very good not possible of the path for 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.940
 strike so black ops a very 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.050
 very good map so that I had 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.600
 appreciated for me this is one of 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.019
 best bape of black ops dlc 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.380
 point 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.430
 and then also the map stop that among the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.190
 mavs in the snow that I have 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.900
 appreciated also because she would 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.310
 that she was she is tall enough even 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.600
 severe a big spot of campers the mans 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.019
 it is true that it was rather good 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.079
 map 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.780
 and then of course a new map a 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.220
 new map in addition here I think that 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.630
 these are doing that I think it's 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.100
 really it really made me their 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.019
 already make quite a way because 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.489
 it's true that you have to make maps 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.450
 as they did for now 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.650
 it's true they're really 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.910
 do it again I think it makes a 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.390
 great Jesuit they really have good 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.150
 made 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.530
 there is no need to say they take their job 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.239
 even if it's good it's not very difficult 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.709
 they do to redo the maps but 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.090
 it is true that it would be nice to 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.010
 find marks of the years a call of 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.180
 Duty mostly because blackhawks 1 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.290
 I find that blacks deb there like that 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.720
 was really really good 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.329
 by the way the sequence in sequence 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.030
 fault the stake make that side but 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.959
 without succeeding brief and to talk about the 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.220
 new zombie map that will 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.320
 maybe we do on black ops 2 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.030
 so for the last dlc it's really 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.140
 they make us a zombie map because 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.760
 would seem all that we are together to 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.620
 Because of them up there on the black 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.030
 May needs to stasi arnaud 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.590
 put all the weapons all the weapons 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.960
 specials we have in all maps 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.190
 an alternative way to move in 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.500
 the amap such as the bus but have 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.540
 maybe not the bus but 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.640
 another way of what maybe a 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.900
 giant where the alternative really a trick 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.700
 for with whom would gather all that 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.720
 had on black ops of really this 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.460
 would be huge 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.620
 and if they do that to us really I think 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.760
 that it will go down and especially that 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.660
 it will please many people 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.070
 of players so here we go I think that 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.410
 you in the comments to debate 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.810
 on that I really hope it's okay 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.740
 debate and then and then I also hope 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.850
 that they will do it one of 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.350
 complications that I gave you 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.880
 here I am losing this little video you 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.170
 please do not hesitate to pass on my channel 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.500
 on this game tell you more 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.500
 ciao
