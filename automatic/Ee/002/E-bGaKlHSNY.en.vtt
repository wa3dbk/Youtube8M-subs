here<00:00:11.219> at<00:00:11.309> some<00:00:11.490> point<00:00:12.019> this<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.230> good<00:00:13.469> signal

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
here at some point this is a good signal

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.370 
here at some point this is a good signal
I<00:00:14.330> read<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.780> think<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.020> was<00:00:16.110> 12<00:00:16.439> 19<00:00:17.009> I<00:00:18.380> have

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
I read and I think it was 12 19 I have

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.890 
I read and I think it was 12 19 I have
found<00:00:19.650> coins<00:00:19.950> along<00:00:20.220> here<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.699> I'm<00:00:21.570> kind<00:00:21.840> of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
found coins along here so I'm kind of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.769 
found coins along here so I'm kind of
hoping<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.470> little<00:00:23.359> threatened<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.449> bit<00:00:24.630> or

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
hoping it's a little threatened a bit or

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.630 
hoping it's a little threatened a bit or
something<00:00:24.990> Sears<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> isn't<00:00:25.740> deep<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.460> may

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
something Sears it isn't deep but it may

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:44.360 
something Sears it isn't deep but it may
well<00:00:26.910> be<00:00:26.939> deep<00:00:33.830> yeah

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.549 

well<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.269> would<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.019> think<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.409> is

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
well I would like to think that this is

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.110 
well I would like to think that this is
real<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.100> hey<00:00:59.909> that's<00:01:00.600> how<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:03.059> I

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
real but hey that's how it is and I

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.090 
real but hey that's how it is and I
can't<00:01:03.329> see<00:01:03.449> any<00:01:03.600> hallmarks

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.690 

got<00:01:09.100> me<00:01:09.189> excited<00:01:09.430> there<00:01:09.729> for<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:09.909> minute

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.140 

nah<00:01:14.630> can't<00:01:15.560> see<00:01:15.650> any<00:01:15.799> hallmarks<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:16.640> I'm<00:01:16.909> just

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
nah can't see any hallmarks so I'm just

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.800 
nah can't see any hallmarks so I'm just
presuming<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:17.720> that<00:01:18.250> isn't<00:01:19.250> real<00:01:19.430> gold<00:01:19.810> I'd

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
presuming that that isn't real gold I'd

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.999 
presuming that that isn't real gold I'd
like<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.049> think<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:21.290> was<00:01:21.320> gold<00:01:21.650> hooks<00:01:21.890> had

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
like to think it was gold hooks had

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.249 
like to think it was gold hooks had
never<00:01:22.159> found<00:01:22.310> anything<00:01:22.580> gold<00:01:23.049> suppose<00:01:24.049> it<00:01:24.170> was

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
never found anything gold suppose it was

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.469 
never found anything gold suppose it was
reading<00:01:24.619> where<00:01:24.770> gold<00:01:25.009> is<00:01:25.220> meant<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:26.270> read

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
reading where gold is meant to to read

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.940 
reading where gold is meant to to read
but<00:01:26.750> sinners<00:01:27.229> have<00:01:27.290> never<00:01:27.500> found<00:01:27.680> any<00:01:27.890> I
