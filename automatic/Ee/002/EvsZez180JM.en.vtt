00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
really important not only as a striker

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.790 
really important not only as a striker
but<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:36.090> every<00:00:36.390> position<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:37.410> me<00:00:37.530> especially

but in every position for me especially

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.069

as a goalkeeper it's about inches or
centimeters<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.980> even<00:00:41.399> millimeters<00:00:41.940> because

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
centimeters and even millimeters because

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.860 
centimeters and even millimeters because
a<00:00:42.629> bowl<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.079> only<00:00:43.290> six<00:00:43.950> centimeters<00:00:44.670> wide<00:00:44.879> so

a bowl is only six centimeters wide so
it's<00:00:46.440> really<00:00:46.739> important<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.879> really

it's really important to be really

little<00:00:52.980> data<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.460> how<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.420> make<00:00:54.600> sure

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
little data is how you have to make sure

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.630 
little data is how you have to make sure
that<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.170> are<00:00:55.260> right<00:00:55.440> -<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:56.160> order<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> win

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
that they are right - in order to win

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.770 
that they are right - in order to win
again<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:59.340> goal<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.550> around<00:01:00.090> 4<00:01:00.449> meters<00:01:00.750> wide

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
again the goal is around 4 meters wide

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.119 
again the goal is around 4 meters wide
and<00:01:01.070> turn<00:01:02.070> off<00:01:02.280> meters<00:01:02.670> high<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:04.010> precision<00:01:05.010> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and turn off meters high so precision is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.039 
and turn off meters high so precision is
crucial<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.820> goalkeeper<00:01:06.299> because<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.020> a

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
different techniques you can basically

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.180 
different techniques you can basically
do<00:03:03.450> what<00:03:03.569> we<00:03:03.810> want<00:03:04.019> with<00:03:04.349> shootouts<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:04.950> really

important<00:03:05.579> for<00:03:05.670> goalkeeper<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.420> be

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
important for goalkeeper to be

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.349 
important for goalkeeper to be
unpredictable<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.940> make<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
unpredictable so you have to make the

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.770 
unpredictable so you have to make the
striker<00:03:09.840> think<00:03:10.430> about<00:03:11.430> your<00:03:11.669> movement<00:03:12.150> so

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
striker think about your movement so

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.970 
striker think about your movement so
sometimes<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.620> be<00:03:13.739> aggressive

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
sometimes you have to be aggressive

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.949 
sometimes you have to be aggressive
sometimes<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:14.910> have<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.209> wait<00:03:15.569> a<00:03:15.630> little<00:03:15.810> bit

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
sometimes you have to wait a little bit

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.430 
sometimes you have to wait a little bit
longer<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.560> stay<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.069> little<00:03:17.220> bit<00:03:17.370> lower<00:03:17.609> and

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
longer and stay a little bit lower and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.289 
longer and stay a little bit lower and
you<00:03:19.440> have<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.829> make<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.669> striker<00:03:20.940> think

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
you have to make the striker think

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.839 
you have to make the striker think
instead<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.870> using<00:03:22.410> his<00:03:22.709> intuition<00:03:23.370> and

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
instead of using his intuition and

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.729 
instead of using his intuition and
that's<00:03:24.510> where<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:24.810> want<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.079> striker<00:03:25.349> to<00:03:25.560> be

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
that's where you want the striker to be

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.909 
that's where you want the striker to be
it<00:03:25.919> because<00:03:26.190> then<00:03:26.579> he<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.849> not<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.269> his<00:03:27.359> full

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
it because then he is not in his full

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.250 
it because then he is not in his full
strength<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:30.239> have<00:03:30.480> an<00:03:30.660> advantage<00:03:30.989> over

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
strength and you have an advantage over

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.890 
strength and you have an advantage over
the<00:03:31.500> striker<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:33.180> what<00:03:33.359> I'm<00:03:33.450> going<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.660> try<00:03:33.810> to

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
the striker so what I'm going to try to

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.550 
the striker so what I'm going to try to
do<00:03:34.079> now<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.530> run<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.400> him<00:03:35.790> try<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.660> put<00:03:36.900> my<00:03:37.049> body

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
in between the ball and a name so I can

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.800 
in between the ball and a name so I can
protect<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.280> at<00:03:41.639> some<00:03:42.209> moments<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.569> cannot

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810
