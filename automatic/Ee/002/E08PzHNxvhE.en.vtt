hi<00:00:01.110> everybody<00:00:02.100> in<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.610> tutorial<00:00:03.090> I'm<00:00:03.629> going

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hi everybody in this tutorial I'm going

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.099 
hi everybody in this tutorial I'm going
to<00:00:03.990> show<00:00:04.110> you<00:00:04.319> or<00:00:04.830> we<00:00:05.100> can<00:00:05.310> make<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:06.000> mesh<00:00:06.390> with

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
to show you or we can make a mesh with

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.140 
to show you or we can make a mesh with
triangular<00:00:07.950> or<00:00:08.160> X<00:00:08.519> agonal<00:00:09.210> pattern<00:00:11.150> usually

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
triangular or X agonal pattern usually

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.460 
triangular or X agonal pattern usually
as<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.960> know<00:00:13.700> the<00:00:14.700> mesh<00:00:14.940> as<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.809> square<00:00:16.289> pattern

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
as you know the mesh as a square pattern

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.760 
as you know the mesh as a square pattern
we<00:00:16.980> can<00:00:17.160> generate<00:00:18.090> one<00:00:18.359> quite<00:00:18.690> easily<00:00:18.990> shift<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
we can generate one quite easily shift a

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.220 
we can generate one quite easily shift a
to<00:00:20.430> make<00:00:20.609> planes<00:00:21.260> k10<00:00:22.609> instance<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.970> then<00:00:24.810> in

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
to make planes k10 instance and then in

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.419 
to make planes k10 instance and then in
the<00:00:25.560> edit<00:00:26.039> mode<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:26.789> subdivide<00:00:27.510> here

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
the edit mode we can subdivide here

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.490 
the edit mode we can subdivide here
several<00:00:29.429> time<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:31.340> here<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.610> Hamish

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
several time and here we have Hamish

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.319 
several time and here we have Hamish
with<00:00:35.239> this<00:00:36.239> 12<00:00:36.870> 10<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.980> square<00:00:38.760> symmetry

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
with this 12 10 and a square symmetry

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.530 
with this 12 10 and a square symmetry
you<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.559> point<00:00:41.160> stamps<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.030> generate

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
you can use point stamps to generate

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.840 
you can use point stamps to generate
some<00:00:44.960> some<00:00:45.960> figures<00:00:48.289> what<00:00:49.289> sounds<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.950> okay

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
some some figures what sounds like okay

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.930 
some some figures what sounds like okay
but<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:51.930> some<00:00:52.110> reason<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.500> wanted<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.129> one

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
but for some reason I wanted to have one

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.410 
but for some reason I wanted to have one
mesh<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:55.520> triangular<00:00:56.520> pattern<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.270> then

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
mesh with triangular pattern and then

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.970 
mesh with triangular pattern and then
I'm<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> show<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.469> how<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.800> can

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
I'm going to show you how we can

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.200 
I'm going to show you how we can
generate<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.410> let's<00:01:01.410> go<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
generate one like this let's go to the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.030 
generate one like this let's go to the
view<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:04.129> add<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:06.860> sicker

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
view and add here sicker

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.210 
view and add here sicker
chari<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.630> circle<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.500> make<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:11.010> with

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
chari and this circle will make it with

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.469 
chari and this circle will make it with
only<00:01:11.490> three<00:01:11.909> vertices<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.640> will<00:01:14.820> add<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
only three vertices then we will add a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.280 
only three vertices then we will add a
modifier<00:01:16.400> array<00:01:17.400> modifier<00:01:18.080> will<00:01:19.080> make

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
modifier array modifier will make

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.700 
modifier array modifier will make
frequent<00:01:19.770> here<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.259> will<00:01:22.939> merge<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
frequent here and we will merge so that

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.130 
frequent here and we will merge so that
this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.130> add<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.820> trust<00:01:27.119> each<00:01:27.659> other

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
this is add up to trust each other

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.560 
this is add up to trust each other
and<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.280> will<00:01:29.460> apply<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.860> modifier<00:01:32.329> again<00:01:33.329> we

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and we will apply this modifier again we

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.170 
and we will apply this modifier again we
add<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:34.020> new<00:01:34.590> array<00:01:35.009> at<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.030> time<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.439> I

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
add a new array at this time in the I

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.679 
add a new array at this time in the I
direction<00:01:39.530> we<00:01:40.530> want<00:01:40.740> also<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.490> small<00:01:42.030> offset<00:01:42.180> in

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
direction we want also a small offset in

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.639 
direction we want also a small offset in
the<00:01:42.960> x-direction<00:01:43.939> TP<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.240> point<00:01:45.649> eight-six

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the x-direction TP for point eight-six

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.020 
the x-direction TP for point eight-six
is<00:01:47.549> gone<00:01:48.229> we<00:01:49.229> merge<00:01:49.470> again<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.790> is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
is gone we merge again so that this is

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.109 
is gone we merge again so that this is
one<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.659> close<00:01:52.850> let's<00:01:53.850> say<00:01:54.500> open<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.119> we

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
one that close let's say open one and we

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.969 
one that close let's say open one and we
apply<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.920> modify<00:01:59.840> though<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:01.200> will<00:02:01.560> modify

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
apply this modify though we will modify

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.840 
apply this modify though we will modify
slightly<00:02:02.729> or<00:02:03.270> object<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.530> go<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:06.270> lattice

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
slightly or object we go here to lattice

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.600 
slightly or object we go here to lattice
and<00:02:08.850> we<00:02:09.450> connect<00:02:09.900> these<00:02:10.229> two<00:02:10.500> vertices<00:02:10.860> with<00:02:11.310> F

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
and we connect these two vertices with F

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.820 
and we connect these two vertices with F
and<00:02:12.770> again<00:02:13.770> here<00:02:14.870> with<00:02:15.870> F<00:02:17.390> then<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.720> have<00:02:19.680> to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and again here with F then we have to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.770 
and again here with F then we have to
remove<00:02:20.570> this<00:02:21.570> edges<00:02:22.910> with<00:02:23.910> left<00:02:24.180> edge

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
remove this edges with left edge

again with F we make face and we can

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.080 
again with F we make face and we can
verify<00:02:44.400> error<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.270> we<00:02:45.450> are<00:02:45.570> nice<00:02:45.840> placed<00:02:46.200> on

verify error that we are nice placed on

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.650 
verify error that we are nice placed on
each<00:02:48.090> or<00:02:49.100> triangular<00:02:50.360> pattern<00:02:51.890> okay<00:02:52.890> then<00:02:53.660> we

each or triangular pattern okay then we

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.750 
each or triangular pattern okay then we
can<00:02:54.930> add<00:02:55.230> some<00:02:55.710> more<00:02:56.630> array<00:02:58.250> typically<00:02:59.250> the

can add some more array typically the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.340 
can add some more array typically the
right<00:02:59.970> value<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:02.930> 0.66<00:03:03.950> here<00:03:05.450> we<00:03:06.450> mesh<00:03:06.690> again

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
right value is 0.66 here we mesh again

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.660 
right value is 0.66 here we mesh again

this gaze of our two rows and we can

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.160 
this gaze of our two rows and we can
make<00:03:14.880> several<00:03:15.270> of<00:03:15.420> them<00:03:15.780> let's<00:03:16.380> say<00:03:17.989> let's<00:03:18.989> say

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
make several of them let's say let's say

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.390 
make several of them let's say let's say
8<00:03:19.470> we<00:03:20.250> applies<00:03:20.640> ray<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.720> again<00:03:22.380> we<00:03:23.220> are

8 we applies ray and again we are

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.430 
8 we applies ray and again we are
worried<00:03:24.209> about<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.570> time<00:03:24.900> in<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.120 

okay

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
okay

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.470 
okay
what<00:03:47.340> else<00:03:47.580> you<00:03:47.760> can<00:03:47.940> do<00:03:48.239> while<00:03:48.959> we<00:03:49.290> can<00:03:49.560> try<00:03:50.190> to

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
what else you can do while we can try to

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.030 
what else you can do while we can try to
remove<00:03:51.480> some<00:03:53.480> faces<00:03:54.480> on<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.959> edge<00:03:55.200> with<00:03:55.709> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
remove some faces on the edge with the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.990 
remove some faces on the edge with the
selection<00:03:56.610> tool<00:03:57.000> from<00:03:57.630> Stan's<00:03:58.130> we<00:03:59.130> make<00:03:59.370> X

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
selection tool from Stan's we make X

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.780 
selection tool from Stan's we make X
remote<00:04:00.630> spaces<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.860> same<00:04:02.130> here<00:04:02.519> is<00:04:03.300> V

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790

remote spaces and the same here is V
selection<00:04:05.790> tool

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.450 

this<00:04:09.960> is<00:04:10.640> for<00:04:11.640> K<00:04:11.850> we<00:04:12.030> can<00:04:12.240> also<00:04:12.830> Center<00:04:13.830> for

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
this is for K we can also Center for

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:22.130 
this is for K we can also Center for
objects<00:04:15.150> or<00:04:15.810> G<00:04:16.290> X<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.610> little<00:04:18.090> bit<00:04:18.360> and<00:04:18.799> G<00:04:19.799> Y<00:04:21.140> like

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
objects or G X a little bit and G Y like

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.350 
objects or G X a little bit and G Y like
this<00:04:22.730> and<00:04:23.730> finally<00:04:24.390> we<00:04:25.200> can<00:04:25.470> make<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.610> origin

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
this and finally we can make the origin

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.450 
this and finally we can make the origin
to<00:04:28.790> symmetry<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:29.970> our<00:04:30.210> project<00:04:31.100> as<00:04:32.100> you<00:04:32.280> can

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
to symmetry of our project as you can

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.120 
to symmetry of our project as you can
see<00:04:32.670> no<00:04:32.880> we<00:04:33.480> have<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:34.140> nice<00:04:35.210> in<00:04:36.210> Lebanon<00:04:36.690> but

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
see no we have this nice in Lebanon but

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.910 
see no we have this nice in Lebanon but
M<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.520> we<00:04:38.880> can<00:04:39.260> play<00:04:40.260> with<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:41.000> symmetry<00:04:42.920> the

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
M and we can play with this symmetry the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.060 
M and we can play with this symmetry the
same<00:04:44.160> way<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.730> we<00:04:44.940> did<00:04:45.180> with<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:46.320> mesh<00:04:46.530> with

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
same way that we did with the mesh with

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.980 
same way that we did with the mesh with
two<00:04:47.730> square<00:04:48.030> pattern<00:04:50.060> okay<00:04:51.060> that's<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.480> hi

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
two square pattern okay that's it hi

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.480 
two square pattern okay that's it hi
upset<00:04:52.500> you<00:04:52.950> like<00:04:53.100> this<00:04:53.160> small<00:04:54.120> tutorial
