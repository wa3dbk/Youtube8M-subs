get the liner in tape it up the reason I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.240 
get the liner in tape it up the reason I
tape<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.050> sides<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.750> is<00:00:40.160> when<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
tape the sides like this is when the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.459 
tape the sides like this is when the
water<00:00:41.460> gets<00:00:41.969> heavy<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.630> the<00:00:42.809> plastic<00:00:43.260> here

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
water gets heavy on the plastic here

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.000 
water gets heavy on the plastic here
that<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.609> it<00:00:44.760> rips<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.269> up<00:00:45.530> it<00:00:46.530> won't<00:00:46.739> rip<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that if it rips this up it won't rip the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.040 
that if it rips this up it won't rip the
plastic<00:00:47.429> so<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.359> read<00:00:48.570> tape<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.929> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
plastic so you can just read tape it so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810 
plastic so you can just read tape it so

there
that's<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:00.929> deep<00:01:01.109> end<00:01:01.940> it's<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:02.999> looking<00:01:03.359> too

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
that's my deep end it's not looking too

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.190 
that's my deep end it's not looking too
bad<00:01:03.510> right<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:05.000> this<00:01:06.000> site<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.480> I<00:01:06.659> expect

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
bad right now this site here I expect

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.980 
bad right now this site here I expect
maybe<00:01:07.470> four<00:01:08.100> inches<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:09.570> hoping<00:01:09.840> down

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
maybe four inches and I'm hoping down

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.680 
maybe four inches and I'm hoping down
there<00:01:10.200> nine<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> we're<00:01:11.790> gonna<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.150> how<00:01:12.180> far<00:01:12.510> we

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
there nine so we're gonna see how far we

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.399 
there nine so we're gonna see how far we
can<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.900> today

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
can get today

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.360 
can get today
it<00:01:13.590> might<00:01:13.800> take<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:15.590> think<00:01:16.590> last<00:01:16.770> time<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:17.040> 11

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
it might take I think last time was 11

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.130 
it might take I think last time was 11
hours<00:01:17.580> last<00:01:17.790> year<00:01:17.940> I<00:01:18.240> don't<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:18.870> how<00:01:18.960> long

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
hours last year I don't see how long

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.360 
hours last year I don't see how long
this<00:01:19.350> takes<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.680> kind<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.980> it's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> little

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
this takes this kind of it's a little

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.890 
this takes this kind of it's a little
bit<00:01:20.580> bigger<00:01:20.760> than<00:01:20.850> last<00:01:21.000> year's<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> we'll<00:01:24.750> see

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
bit bigger than last year's so we'll see

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.150 
bit bigger than last year's so we'll see
what<00:01:25.020> happens<00:01:27.560> okay<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.710> guess<00:01:28.950> something

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
what happens okay I guess something

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.880 
what happens okay I guess something
heavy<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.840> put<00:01:31.050> down<00:01:31.230> on<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:34.170> side<00:01:34.410> here<00:01:34.710> so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
heavy and put down on the side here so

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.170 
heavy and put down on the side here so
that<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.250> wind<00:01:35.430> doesn't<00:01:35.550> blow<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:39.090> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that the wind doesn't blow it in and I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.010 
that the wind doesn't blow it in and I
taped<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.810> side<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.230> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:42.020> so

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
taped it all that side as you can see so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.990 
taped it all that side as you can see so
we're<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.170> going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> sit<00:01:43.620> back<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.070> enjoy
