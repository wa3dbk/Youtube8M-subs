go over a couple controls once we get

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.950 
go over a couple controls once we get
out<00:05:02.740> of<00:05:02.889> here<00:05:03.040> oh<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:03.700> have<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.060> I<00:05:04.510> do<00:05:04.570> have<00:05:04.780> to

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
out of here oh I have to I do have to

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
kill these guys okay so down here

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.930 
kill these guys okay so down here
basically<00:05:08.440> you<00:05:08.800> can<00:05:09.010> see<00:05:09.190> that<00:05:09.370> you<00:05:09.639> can<00:05:09.790> throw

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
basically you can see that you can throw

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.030 
basically you can see that you can throw
skills<00:05:10.360> in<00:05:10.600> and<00:05:10.810> whatnot<00:05:11.229> and<00:05:11.470> that<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.889> game

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
skills in and whatnot and that the game

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.550 
skills in and whatnot and that the game
will<00:05:12.310> get<00:05:12.460> more<00:05:12.669> complex<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.960> reason<00:05:14.440> I

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
will get more complex the reason I

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.170 
will get more complex the reason I
believe<00:05:14.770> I'm<00:05:15.040> hitting<00:05:15.340> so<00:05:15.580> high<00:05:15.790> and

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
believe I'm hitting so high and

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.379 
believe I'm hitting so high and
discussed<00:05:16.930> was<00:05:17.110> giving<00:05:17.520> me<00:05:18.520> basically<00:05:19.180> no

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
discussed was giving me basically no

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.409 
discussed was giving me basically no
damage<00:05:20.280> it's<00:05:21.280> because<00:05:21.669> this<00:05:21.820> is<00:05:21.880> more<00:05:22.210> like<00:05:22.389> a

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
damage it's because this is more like a

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.840 
damage it's because this is more like a
tutorial<00:05:22.840> section<00:05:23.440> I<00:05:23.680> need<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.340> see<00:05:24.400> here<00:05:24.639> I'm

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
tutorial section I need to see here I'm

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.780 
tutorial section I need to see here I'm
capable<00:05:25.510> of<00:05:25.750> claiming<00:05:26.400> certain<00:05:27.400> things<00:05:27.639> that

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
capable of claiming certain things that

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.290 
capable of claiming certain things that
were<00:05:27.970> so<00:05:28.180> often<00:05:28.860> every<00:05:29.860> minute<00:05:30.190> or<00:05:30.400> whatever<00:05:30.520> a

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
were so often every minute or whatever a

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.420 
were so often every minute or whatever a
new<00:05:31.720> server<00:05:31.990> event<00:05:32.500> and<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:32.919> get<00:05:33.039> a<00:05:33.070> daily

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
new server event and you get a daily

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.080 
new server event and you get a daily
bonus<00:05:33.610> I<00:05:34.410> think<00:05:35.410> that's<00:05:35.650> for<00:05:36.070> possibly<00:05:36.880> just

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
bonus I think that's for possibly just

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.880 
bonus I think that's for possibly just
logging<00:05:37.539> in<00:05:37.660> for<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:37.960> day<00:05:38.140> or<00:05:38.500> it<00:05:38.620> could<00:05:38.770> be

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
logging in for the day or it could be

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.029 
logging in for the day or it could be
because<00:05:39.010> it's<00:05:39.430> a<00:05:39.580> tutorial<00:05:40.380> now<00:05:41.380> weird<00:05:41.530> what<00:05:41.800> I
