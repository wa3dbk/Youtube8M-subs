fat<00:02:18.660> Max<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.170> see<00:02:19.290> what<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:19.530> got<00:02:19.709> here<00:02:24.110> all

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
fat Max and see what we got here all

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.130 
fat Max and see what we got here all
right<00:02:26.239> first<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:27.480> I'll<00:02:27.630> turn<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.959> its

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
right first of all I'll turn it to its

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.479 
right first of all I'll turn it to its
lowest<00:02:28.350> setting<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:30.660> beeps<00:02:31.079> to<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.650> green

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
lowest setting that beeps to a green

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.220 
lowest setting that beeps to a green
light<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.850> back<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.810> that's<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.079> lowest

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
light on the back so that's the lowest

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.710 
light on the back so that's the lowest
setting<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.769> light<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.730> light<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.209> that

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
setting the light of the light and that

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.390 
setting the light of the light and that
will<00:02:36.840> give<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.799> is<00:02:37.950> supposed<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.250> give

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
will give you this is supposed to give

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.910 
will give you this is supposed to give
you<00:02:38.519> approximately<00:02:39.480> ten<00:02:40.019> hours<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.350> light<00:02:40.709> on

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
you approximately ten hours of light on

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.560 
you approximately ten hours of light on
the<00:02:41.100> lowest<00:02:41.370> setting<00:02:41.549> so<00:02:41.820> that's<00:02:41.970> not<00:02:42.090> too<00:02:42.329> bad

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
the lowest setting so that's not too bad

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.870 
the lowest setting so that's not too bad
it's<00:02:42.810> not<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.769> not<00:02:43.860> overly<00:02:44.160> bright<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:44.670> just

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
it's not it's not overly bright but just

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.229 
it's not it's not overly bright but just
about<00:02:45.060> enough<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.360> see<00:02:46.700> turn<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.820> now<00:02:48.030> we'll

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
about enough to see turn it now we'll

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.770 
about enough to see turn it now we'll
turn<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.690> its<00:02:48.840> highest<00:02:49.260> setting<00:02:53.780> and

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
turn it to its highest setting and

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.360 
turn it to its highest setting and
that's<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.440> highest<00:02:55.590> setting<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.250> that's

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
that's the highest setting and that's

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.580 
that's the highest setting and that's
not<00:02:56.579> too<00:02:56.790> bad<00:02:56.970> either<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.329> mean<00:02:57.570> that's<00:02:57.780> that's

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
not too bad either I mean that's that's

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.569 
not too bad either I mean that's that's
pretty<00:02:58.829> decent<00:02:59.340> for<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.940> light<00:03:00.540> that's<00:03:01.130> not<00:03:02.130> you

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
pretty decent for a light that's not you

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.370 
pretty decent for a light that's not you
know<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.760> doesn't<00:03:02.880> claim<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.209> be<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:04.260> know

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
know it doesn't claim to be you know

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.300 
know it doesn't claim to be you know
millions<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.489> candle<00:03:05.850> power<00:03:06.000> right<00:03:06.329> or

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
millions of candle power right or

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.680 
millions of candle power right or
thousand<00:03:08.310> or<00:03:08.459> over<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> thousand<00:03:09.239> lumens<00:03:09.360> but

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
thousand or over a thousand lumens but

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.569 
thousand or over a thousand lumens but
so<00:03:10.350> yeah<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.650> got<00:03:10.799> a<00:03:10.829> little<00:03:10.950> trigger<00:03:11.280> switch

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
so yeah it's got a little trigger switch

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.140 
so yeah it's got a little trigger switch
here<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.940> front<00:03:13.459> not<00:03:14.459> basically<00:03:14.880> that

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
here in the front not basically that

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.550 
here in the front not basically that
when<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.390> when<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.870> pull<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.140> trigger<00:03:16.170> to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
when you when you pull the trigger to

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.220 
when you when you pull the trigger to
the<00:03:16.590> side<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:18.180> dims<00:03:18.510> till<00:03:19.440> you're<00:03:19.590> right<00:03:20.000> and

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.790 

then<00:03:25.230> when<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.410> push<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.799> way

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
then when you push it this way

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.970 
then when you push it this way
it<00:03:28.800> brightens<00:03:28.980> up<00:03:30.379> that's<00:03:31.379> pretty<00:03:31.590> cool

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
it brightens up that's pretty cool

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.930 
it brightens up that's pretty cool
and<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.760> course<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.030> turn<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.330> off<00:03:34.700> not<00:03:35.700> that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
and of course to turn it off not that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.740 
and of course to turn it off not that
it's<00:03:36.239> got<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.450> very<00:03:36.659> tight<00:03:38.360> knob<00:03:39.360> on<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.629> back

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
it's got a very tight knob on the back

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.570 
it's got a very tight knob on the back
here

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
here

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.960 
here
whatever<00:03:41.580> lid<00:03:42.209> basically<00:03:43.099> opens<00:03:44.099> up<00:03:44.310> opens<00:03:44.489> up

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
whatever lid basically opens up opens up

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.380 
whatever lid basically opens up opens up
to<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.569> charge<00:03:45.959> port<00:03:46.379> and<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.879> got<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.180> charge

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
to a charge port and I got the charge

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.360 
to a charge port and I got the charge
port<00:03:48.629> in<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.810> back<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:51.569> car<00:03:51.780> in<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.049> wall

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
port in the back and the car in the wall

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.920 
port in the back and the car in the wall
and<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.790> red<00:03:54.269> light<00:03:54.450> when<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.690> plug<00:03:54.840> it

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
and it's a red light when you plug it

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.690 
and it's a red light when you plug it
into<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.140> red<00:03:55.349> light<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.860> turn<00:03:56.099> it<00:03:56.370> turns

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
into the red light and a turn it turns

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.880 
into the red light and a turn it turns
green<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.090> beeps<00:03:57.510> when<00:03:57.810> it's<00:03:57.989> fully<00:03:58.470> charged

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
green and beeps when it's fully charged

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.729 
green and beeps when it's fully charged
and<00:03:59.329> this<00:04:00.329> here<00:04:00.569> is<00:04:00.599> watertight<00:04:01.049> it's<00:04:01.560> got<00:04:01.709> a

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
and this here is watertight it's got a

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.979 
and this here is watertight it's got a
little<00:04:01.860> little<00:04:02.670> o-ring<00:04:02.849> on<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.269> back<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:03.750> I

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
little little o-ring on the back so I

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.550 
little little o-ring on the back so I
should<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:05.400> should<00:04:05.760> give<00:04:05.910> you<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.090> quick<00:04:06.530> shot<00:04:07.530> of

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
should I should give you a quick shot of

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.759 
should I should give you a quick shot of
doors<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.160> see<00:04:08.310> how<00:04:08.370> far<00:04:08.579> this<00:04:08.730> beam<00:04:08.940> goes<00:04:09.180> too

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
doors to see how far this beam goes too

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.110 
doors to see how far this beam goes too
so<00:04:10.769> let's<00:04:10.980> turn<00:04:11.129> around<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.609> go<00:04:11.700> up<00:04:11.760> doors

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
so let's turn around and go up doors

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.970 
so let's turn around and go up doors
alright<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:13.109> there's<00:04:13.319> no<00:04:13.410> fun<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.829> beam

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
alright so there's no fun of the beam

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.400 
alright so there's no fun of the beam
goes<00:04:14.420> see<00:04:15.420> shining<00:04:15.720> on<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.049> building<00:04:16.350> over

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
goes see shining on that building over

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.539 
goes see shining on that building over
there<00:04:16.560> so<00:04:16.889> that's<00:04:16.949> not<00:04:17.160> bad<00:04:18.199> that's<00:04:19.199> about<00:04:19.549> 200

meters away so 250 maybe so that's
pretty<00:04:24.000> good<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.770> long<00:04:26.010> beam<00:04:26.310> on<00:04:26.490> that<00:04:26.610> sucker

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
pretty good so long beam on that sucker

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.230 
pretty good so long beam on that sucker
you<00:04:27.060> know

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
you know

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.590
