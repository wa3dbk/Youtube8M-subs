00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
started with a deep way of style we're

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880 
started with a deep way of style we're
gonna<00:00:57.539> start<00:00:57.840> from<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> bottom<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.559> work<00:00:58.739> our

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
gonna start from the bottom and work our

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.610 
gonna start from the bottom and work our
way<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.539> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.690> go<00:01:00.809> pretty<00:01:00.960> fast<00:01:01.230> because

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
way up you can go pretty fast because

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470 
way up you can go pretty fast because
the<00:01:01.800> waves<00:01:01.980> probably<00:01:02.370> overlap<00:01:02.789> each<00:01:03.000> other<00:01:03.149> so

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the waves probably overlap each other so

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.270 
the waves probably overlap each other so
as<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.750> move<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> next<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> hair

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
as you move on to the next one the hair

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.719 
as you move on to the next one the hair
has<00:01:05.489> already<00:01:05.909> been<00:01:06.030> partially<00:01:06.570> heated<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.729> like

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
has already been partially heated I like

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.490 
has already been partially heated I like
to<00:01:08.850> take<00:01:09.060> small<00:01:09.210> sections<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> heat<00:01:10.320> will

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
to take small sections so the heat will

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.830 
to take small sections so the heat will
distribute<00:01:10.830> more<00:01:11.159> evenly<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> result

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
distribute more evenly and the result

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
distribute more evenly and the result
will<00:01:12.930> look<00:01:12.960> more<00:01:13.170> natural<00:01:13.640> spray<00:01:14.640> each<00:01:14.850> layer

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
will look more natural spray each layer

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.700 
will look more natural spray each layer
lightly<00:01:15.509> with<00:01:15.630> hairspray<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> keep<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> curl

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
lightly with hairspray to keep the curl

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.240
