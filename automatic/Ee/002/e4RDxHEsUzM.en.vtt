is<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.949> result<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.369> poor<00:00:29.550> transfers

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
is this the result of poor transfers

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.089 
is this the result of poor transfers
from<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> original<00:00:30.660> film<00:00:30.800> obviously<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.920> is

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
from the original film obviously this is

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.500 
from the original film obviously this is
easier<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.640> animated<00:00:33.000> titles<00:00:33.360> but

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
easier with animated titles but

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.670 
easier with animated titles but
shouldn't<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> studio's<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> better<00:00:34.590> job

it's<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.780> sign<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.229> new<00:01:49.470> blu-ray<00:01:49.950> player

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
it's a sign of that new blu-ray player

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.770 
it's a sign of that new blu-ray player
you<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.880> 1080p<00:01:51.329> screen<00:01:51.630> you're

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
you have and that 1080p screen you're

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.300 
you have and that 1080p screen you're
using<00:01:51.990> are<00:01:52.259> actually<00:01:52.409> doing<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:52.979> good

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
using are actually doing a really good

using are actually doing a really good
job<00:01:53.369> yeah<00:01:54.030> one<00:01:54.990> kind<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> point<00:01:55.590> out

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
job yeah one kind of like a point out

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
for grainy artifacts it will just it'll

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.920 
for grainy artifacts it will just it'll
it'll<00:02:37.220> make<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.550> stand<00:02:37.820> out<00:02:37.970> even<00:02:38.210> more<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.570> so

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
it'll make it stand out even more so so

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.150 
it'll make it stand out even more so so
that's<00:02:39.110> just<00:02:39.230> one<00:02:39.410> thing<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.620> put<00:02:39.740> in<00:02:39.860> mind<00:02:40.010> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
that's just one thing to put in mind the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.800 
that's just one thing to put in mind the
grain<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.790> there<00:02:41.060> because<00:02:41.330> they<00:02:41.450> did<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.630> good

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
grain is there because they did a good

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.540 
grain is there because they did a good

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
film and didn't wipe it away they can do

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.670 
film and didn't wipe it away they can do
that<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.420> like<00:02:47.420> weird<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.990> generally<00:02:48.440> don't

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
that just like weird I generally don't
