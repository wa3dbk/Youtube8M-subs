Gunzburg<00:00:40.110> sweeper<00:00:40.500> located<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> bottom

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
Gunzburg sweeper located on the bottom

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.260 
Gunzburg sweeper located on the bottom
left<00:00:41.730> hand<00:00:41.850> corner

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
left hand corner

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.569 
left hand corner
it's<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:42.920> $14,000<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.309> kind<00:00:44.520> of

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
it's about $14,000 so it is kind of

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.700 
it's about $14,000 so it is kind of
expensive<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.840> think<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.289> extremely

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
expensive but I do think is extremely

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.410 
expensive but I do think is extremely
worth<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.760> fire<00:00:48.000> rate<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.300> this

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
worth it because the fire rate of this

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.119 
worth it because the fire rate of this
gun<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.660> extremely<00:00:49.200> high<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.860> probably

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
gun is extremely high and it's probably

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.459 
gun is extremely high and it's probably
by<00:00:50.489> far<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.000> my<00:00:51.120> favorite<00:00:51.239> weapons<00:00:51.930> from

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
by far one of my favorite weapons from

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.450 
by far one of my favorite weapons from
