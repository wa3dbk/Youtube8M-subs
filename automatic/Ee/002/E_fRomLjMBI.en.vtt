episode I'll be sure to do a raid or

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:04.860 
episode I'll be sure to do a raid or
base<00:07:03.340> build<00:07:03.669> and<00:07:03.940> should<00:07:04.330> have<00:07:04.419> spooner<00:07:04.690> that

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:04.870 
base build and should have spooner that

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.320 
base build and should have spooner that
we<00:07:04.930> actually<00:07:05.260> got<00:07:05.349> maybe<00:07:05.650> but<00:07:05.919> improve<00:07:06.340> a<00:07:06.639> mole

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
we actually got maybe but improve a mole

fraction<00:07:07.840> and<00:07:08.020> I<00:07:08.380> think<00:07:09.570> for<00:07:10.570> the<00:07:10.690> series<00:07:10.990> if

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 
fraction and I think for the series if

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.930 
fraction and I think for the series if
you<00:07:11.680> guys<00:07:11.800> would<00:07:12.010> like<00:07:12.039> to<00:07:12.159> come<00:07:12.310> join<00:07:12.580> the
