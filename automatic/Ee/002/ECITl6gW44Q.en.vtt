here<00:00:24.490> for<00:00:24.519> you<00:00:24.849> today<00:00:25.599> I<00:00:25.689> want<00:00:25.900> to<00:00:25.960> talk<00:00:26.109> about

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
here for you today I want to talk about

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.040 
here for you today I want to talk about
snares<00:00:26.980> now<00:00:27.669> depending<00:00:28.419> on<00:00:28.509> your<00:00:28.630> location

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
snares now depending on your location

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.290 
snares now depending on your location
snares<00:00:29.650> may<00:00:29.919> be<00:00:29.980> legal<00:00:30.489> and<00:00:30.640> they<00:00:30.699> may<00:00:30.849> not<00:00:31.060> be

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
snares may be legal and they may not be

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.330 
snares may be legal and they may not be
legal<00:00:31.630> so<00:00:31.750> you<00:00:31.810> need<00:00:31.989> to<00:00:32.079> check<00:00:32.349> them<00:00:32.559> before

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
legal so you need to check them before

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.760 
legal so you need to check them before
you<00:00:33.850> set<00:00:34.090> anything<00:00:34.570> out<00:00:34.750> plus<00:00:35.379> you<00:00:35.530> need<00:00:35.680> to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
you set anything out plus you need to

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.860 
you set anything out plus you need to
decide<00:00:36.070> if<00:00:36.280> you<00:00:36.399> need<00:00:36.699> to<00:00:37.000> set<00:00:37.210> snares<00:00:37.510> or<00:00:37.720> not

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
decide if you need to set snares or not

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.579 
decide if you need to set snares or not
and<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:39.430> this<00:00:39.640> case<00:00:39.879> here<00:00:40.269> the<00:00:41.050> snares<00:00:41.350> that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
and in this case here the snares that

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.650 
and in this case here the snares that
you're<00:00:41.710> going<00:00:41.830> to<00:00:41.890> see<00:00:42.129> are<00:00:42.550> on<00:00:43.030> a<00:00:43.059> managed

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
you're going to see are on a managed

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.810 
you're going to see are on a managed
property<00:00:44.290> which<00:00:44.680> down<00:00:45.010> in<00:00:45.160> Texas<00:00:45.550> where<00:00:45.699> I'm

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
property which down in Texas where I'm

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.270 
property which down in Texas where I'm
located<00:00:45.970> at<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.629> lot<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.260> people<00:00:47.500> -<00:00:48.010> store

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
located at a lot of people - store

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.540 
located at a lot of people - store
property<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:50.110> try<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:50.559> maintain<00:00:50.829> a

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
property and they try to maintain a

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.509 
property and they try to maintain a
genetic<00:00:52.530> dominance<00:00:53.530> of<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.860> deer<00:00:54.100> that's<00:00:54.369> on

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
genetic dominance of the deer that's on

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.509 
genetic dominance of the deer that's on
the<00:00:54.670> property<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.559> they<00:00:56.559> you<00:00:56.949> need<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.400> do

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
the property and they you need to do

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.729 
the property and they you need to do
this<00:00:57.640> every<00:00:57.820> once<00:00:58.150> in<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.299> while<00:00:58.360> by<00:00:58.869> bringing

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
this every once in a while by bringing

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.399 
this every once in a while by bringing
in<00:01:00.040> for<00:01:00.489> fresh<00:01:00.909> genes<00:01:01.360> into<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.019> gene<00:01:02.199> pool

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
in for fresh genes into the gene pool

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:03.539 
in for fresh genes into the gene pool
because<00:01:02.680> basically<00:01:02.860> you<00:01:03.129> have<00:01:03.220> a<00:01:03.250> captive

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
because basically you have a captive

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.210 
because basically you have a captive
audience<00:01:03.820> that's<00:01:04.590> breeding<00:01:05.590> with<00:01:05.860> each<00:01:05.979> other

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
audience that's breeding with each other

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.420 
audience that's breeding with each other
so<00:01:07.180> in<00:01:07.330> order<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.689> keep<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.560> gene<00:01:08.920> from<00:01:09.220> too

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
so in order to keep the gene from too

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.370 
so in order to keep the gene from too
much<00:01:09.549> interbreeding<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.869> bring<00:01:11.080> in<00:01:11.229> new

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
much interbreeding you bring in new

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.679 
much interbreeding you bring in new
genes<00:01:11.650> so<00:01:11.860> you<00:01:11.920> bring<00:01:12.310> in<00:01:12.490> bred<00:01:12.909> and<00:01:13.240> animals

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
genes so you bring in bred and animals

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.800 
genes so you bring in bred and animals
bred<00:01:13.990> dough<00:01:14.320> that<00:01:14.590> are<00:01:14.740> bred<00:01:14.979> with<00:01:15.220> some<00:01:15.810> some

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
bred dough that are bred with some some

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.249 
bred dough that are bred with some some
trophy<00:01:17.409> buck<00:01:18.009> somewhere<00:01:18.580> so<00:01:19.479> these<00:01:19.869> deer<00:01:20.110> are

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
trophy buck somewhere so these deer are

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.100 
trophy buck somewhere so these deer are
usually<00:01:20.619> very<00:01:20.920> tame<00:01:21.220> they're<00:01:22.119> raised<00:01:22.780> in<00:01:23.020> a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
usually very tame they're raised in a

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.599 
usually very tame they're raised in a
captive<00:01:23.530> environment<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:24.070> can't<00:01:24.280> pat<00:01:24.490> them

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
captive environment you can't pat them

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.609 
captive environment you can't pat them
or<00:01:24.700> anything<00:01:24.880> but<00:01:25.270> they<00:01:25.929> just<00:01:26.140> don't<00:01:26.380> know

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
or anything but they just don't know

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.139 
or anything but they just don't know
what<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.100> dangers<00:01:27.460> are<00:01:27.579> because<00:01:27.850> they<00:01:27.969> live

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
what the dangers are because they live

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.580 
what the dangers are because they live
in<00:01:28.179> a<00:01:28.359> sheltered<00:01:28.719> life<00:01:28.749> so<00:01:29.200> when<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.409> bring

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
in a sheltered life so when you bring

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.550 
in a sheltered life so when you bring
these<00:01:29.799> deer<00:01:30.070> in<00:01:30.299> they're<00:01:31.299> very<00:01:31.749> susceptible

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
these deer in they're very susceptible

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.999 
these deer in they're very susceptible
to<00:01:32.829> predators<00:01:33.159> like<00:01:33.640> coyotes<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.299> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
to predators like coyotes and and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.249 
to predators like coyotes and and
bobcats<00:01:36.009> and<00:01:36.249> such<00:01:36.490> especially<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.539> babies

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
bobcats and such especially the babies

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.010 
bobcats and such especially the babies
but<00:01:39.100> even<00:01:39.789> that<00:01:39.909> even<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.270> dogs<00:01:40.509> don't<00:01:40.810> know

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
but even that even the dogs don't know

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.959 
but even that even the dogs don't know
how<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.319> jump<00:01:41.649> a<00:01:41.799> fence<00:01:41.829> even<00:01:42.249> because<00:01:42.700> there's

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
how to jump a fence even because there's

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.429 
how to jump a fence even because there's
no<00:01:43.119> fences<00:01:43.479> for<00:01:43.689> them<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.899> jump<00:01:44.140> because<00:01:44.259> they

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
no fences for them to jump because they

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.489 
no fences for them to jump because they
live<00:01:44.619> in<00:01:44.649> small<00:01:45.189> pens<00:01:46.049> small<00:01:47.049> meaning<00:01:47.319> a

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
live in small pens small meaning a

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:50.099 
live in small pens small meaning a
couple<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.829> acres<00:01:47.950> as<00:01:48.310> they're<00:01:48.579> raised<00:01:48.789> so<00:01:49.719> you

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
couple of acres as they're raised so you

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.749 
couple of acres as they're raised so you
need<00:01:50.469> to<00:01:50.590> make<00:01:50.740> sure<00:01:50.799> that<00:01:51.009> your<00:01:51.280> predators

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
need to make sure that your predators

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.779 
need to make sure that your predators
are<00:01:52.240> reduced<00:01:52.960> so<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:54.280> don't<00:01:54.490> want<00:01:54.609> to<00:01:54.670> lose

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
are reduced so you don't want to lose

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.580 
are reduced so you don't want to lose
these<00:01:54.999> animals<00:01:55.359> because<00:01:55.509> you<00:01:55.659> pay<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> lot<00:01:56.350> as<00:01:56.560> a

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
these animals because you pay a lot as a

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.580 
these animals because you pay a lot as a
landowner<00:01:57.039> for<00:01:57.789> these<00:01:57.999> bred<00:01:58.299> animals<00:01:58.749> and<00:01:58.929> one

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
landowner for these bred animals and one

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.139 
landowner for these bred animals and one
way<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.829> doing<00:01:59.920> that<00:02:00.069> is<00:02:00.189> to<00:02:00.460> put<00:02:00.639> snares<00:02:00.939> up

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
way of doing that is to put snares up

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.410 
way of doing that is to put snares up
around<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.840> perimeter<00:02:02.289> of<00:02:02.319> your<00:02:02.409> fenced<00:02:03.100> in

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
around the perimeter of your fenced in

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.080 
around the perimeter of your fenced in
property<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.859> snare<00:02:06.459> basically<00:02:06.850> is<00:02:06.969> going

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
property so a snare basically is going

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.910 
property so a snare basically is going
to<00:02:07.149> catch<00:02:07.420> an<00:02:07.569> animal<00:02:07.899> as<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.110> comes<00:02:08.619> through<00:02:08.740> a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
to catch an animal as it comes through a

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.710 
to catch an animal as it comes through a
hole<00:02:09.190> or<00:02:09.490> a<00:02:09.520> little<00:02:09.910> opening<00:02:10.300> in<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.509> fence

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
hole or a little opening in the fence

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.840 
hole or a little opening in the fence
and<00:02:11.110> it'll<00:02:11.890> choke<00:02:12.100> them<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.340> death<00:02:12.430> pretty

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
and it'll choke them to death pretty

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.440 
and it'll choke them to death pretty
much<00:02:13.030> it's<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.720> pretty<00:02:14.410> brutal<00:02:14.620> way<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.950> go<00:02:15.450> but

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
much it's a pretty brutal way to go but

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
simple you attach this end to the fence

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.180 
simple you attach this end to the fence
or<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.900> an<00:02:25.990> anchor<00:02:26.290> somewhere<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:27.100> you

trap other animals that really don't

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.940 
trap other animals that really don't
need<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:53.290> keep<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.470> in<00:02:54.530> mind<00:02:54.620> when

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
need it and so keep that in mind when

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.260 
need it and so keep that in mind when
you<00:02:55.040> set<00:02:55.250> these<00:02:55.430> things<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.880> basically<00:02:56.180> how

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
you set these things and basically how

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.670 
you set these things and basically how
it<00:02:56.360> works<00:02:56.390> it's<00:02:56.750> like<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.900> noose<00:02:57.140> they<00:02:57.410> come

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
it works it's like a noose they come

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.170 
it works it's like a noose they come
through<00:02:57.920> their<00:02:58.100> holes<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.580> this<00:02:58.730> will<00:02:58.880> be<00:02:58.940> set

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
through their holes so this will be set

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.870 
through their holes so this will be set
up<00:02:59.300> they<00:03:00.020> come<00:03:00.290> through<00:03:00.590> they<00:03:01.190> get<00:03:01.370> stuck<00:03:01.700> on

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
up they come through they get stuck on

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.570 
up they come through they get stuck on
it<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.380> then<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.620> tightens<00:03:04.010> around<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.370> neck

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
it and then it tightens around the neck

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.120 
it and then it tightens around the neck
and<00:03:04.760> they<00:03:05.060> can't<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.720> won't<00:03:05.900> get<00:03:06.080> loose<00:03:06.320> you

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
and they can't it won't get loose you

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.229 
and they can't it won't get loose you
know<00:03:07.220> there's<00:03:07.430> no<00:03:07.610> that<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:07.910> don't<00:03:08.090> have

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
know there's no that you don't have

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.520 
know there's no that you don't have
hands<00:03:08.540> or<00:03:08.690> anything<00:03:08.840> like<00:03:09.050> that<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.410> these

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
hands or anything like that and these

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.810 
hands or anything like that and these
little<00:03:09.709> snares<00:03:10.010> they<00:03:10.160> lock<00:03:10.400> up

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
little snares they lock up

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.120 
little snares they lock up
so<00:03:11.390> they're<00:03:11.540> basically<00:03:11.660> stuck<00:03:12.230> there<00:03:12.470> they're

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
so they're basically stuck there they're

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.640 
so they're basically stuck there they're
going<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.209> die<00:03:14.360> probably<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:15.020> very<00:03:15.320> painful

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
going to die probably a very painful

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.810 
going to die probably a very painful
death<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:18.470> know<00:03:18.590> it's<00:03:18.890> it's<00:03:19.340> not<00:03:19.550> for

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
death and so you know it's it's not for

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.000 
death and so you know it's it's not for
