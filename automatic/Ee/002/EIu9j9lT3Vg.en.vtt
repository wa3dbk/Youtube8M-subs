00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.359
 the president-elect has already resolved 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.990
 the theme of transportation at home 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.990
 presidential 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.870
 the william solís will have his 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.850
 disposition two vehicles for 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.790
 mobilize as president throughout the 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.170
 country are of discretionary use ie not 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.060
 they have restrictions as to 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.790
 fuel schedule operation and 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.680
 traveled these vehicles carry plates 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.739
 individuals do not have visible marks 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.509
 to distinguish them as officers always 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.489
 will be accompanied by security and 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.240
 transit but the president-elect 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.460
 prefer your personal vehicle 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.460
 if not while it is for private use I will 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.630
 to use this and in the case of acts 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.030
 official happens some of the 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.200
 presidency but is working very 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.600
 well the pattern and egypt 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.340
 they are big charges and I think it's fine 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.890
 have them for the obligations that they 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.490
 they have the presidency but I will look for the 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.490
 way less 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.070
 less visible to move around the country 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.299
 but using your vehicle will be 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.299
 complicated for solís 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.549
 he wants to continue using his car but 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.929
 there seems to be a problem 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.899
 administrative to do it because 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.600
 obviously then controls of 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.100
 gasoline repairs policy could not 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.069
 be paid if they are not government charge 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.689
 then you will have to reconsider 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.729
 this vehicle was in repair from 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.829
 August 2013, so the 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.380
 chancellery lent him this similar to the 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.850
 presidency however you're ready 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.759
 to be used by luis guillermo solís 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.049
 as of May 8 but reality if 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.240
 it's a car it looks like it has some 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.149
 problem there are several ways to 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.259
 solving it is a minor problem there 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.119
 it seems that you exchange with the same company 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.209
 repair then we do not worry 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.149
 they asked for that because they had problems 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.920
 with the vehicle of the president and all 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.650
 by agreement we made an agreement 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.570
 and the loan was given the vehicle until 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.520
 but ground transportation is not what 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.110
 only available to solís the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.880
 president can use the aircraft 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.130
 of the security forces to travel through 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.140
 Costa Rican territory be it a 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.240
 diplomatic event in the capital or a 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.010
 tour in the rural area to the president-elect 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.580
 luis guillermo solís will not be short 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.580
 transport
