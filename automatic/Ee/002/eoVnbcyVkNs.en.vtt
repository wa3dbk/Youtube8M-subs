00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
minute up to two minutes certain

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.700 
minute up to two minutes certain
subjects<00:00:42.239> two-thirds<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.110> subjects<00:00:43.530> will

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
subjects two-thirds of all subjects will

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.979 
subjects two-thirds of all subjects will
start<00:00:44.280> experiencing<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.329> hand<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.809> some

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
start experiencing this hand for some

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.410 
start experiencing this hand for some
moments<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> were<00:00:47.100> belonging<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:48.239> their

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
moments as if it were belonging to their

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
moments as if it were belonging to their
body<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.190> way<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.550> is

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
body so this is one way and this is

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.270 
body so this is one way and this is
normally<00:00:51.620> investigated<00:00:52.620> by<00:00:52.680> questionnaires

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
normally investigated by questionnaires

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.740 
normally investigated by questionnaires
so<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> subject<00:00:54.000> will<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.149> asked<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> certain

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
so the subject will be asked a certain

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.600 
so the subject will be asked a certain
number<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.260> questions<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.949> respond<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
number of questions to respond to and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.520 
number of questions to respond to and
then<00:00:57.059> there's<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> second<00:00:57.690> measure<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
then there's a second measure which is

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.319 
then there's a second measure which is
in<00:00:58.949> my<00:00:59.070> opinion<00:00:59.100> even<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.789> interesting

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
in my opinion even more interesting

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.389 
in my opinion even more interesting
because<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.230> then<00:01:01.410> after<00:01:02.100> these<00:01:02.219> two

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
because if you then after these two

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.219 
because if you then after these two
minutes<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.760> stroking<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.390> close<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.049> eyes

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
minutes of stroking will close the eyes

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
minutes of stroking will close the eyes
of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> subject<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.250> ask<00:01:05.489> them<00:01:05.700> will<00:01:05.880> now

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
of the subject and ask them will now

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.120 
of the subject and ask them will now
point<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.990> where<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:07.350> hand<00:01:07.530> would<00:01:07.710> really<00:01:07.950> be

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
point to where your hand would really be

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730 
point to where your hand would really be
they<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.640> not<00:01:08.970> point<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.510> eyes<00:01:09.659> closed<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
they do not point with eyes closed to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.520 
they do not point with eyes closed to
the<00:01:10.860> real<00:01:11.070> arm<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.939> will<00:01:12.090> point<00:01:12.350> towards<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the real arm they will point towards the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.980 
the real arm they will point towards the
rubber<00:01:13.710> arm<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.850> felt<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.240> my<00:01:15.479> hand

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
rubber arm I really felt that my hand

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.749 
rubber arm I really felt that my hand
was<00:01:16.759> transposed<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.150> into<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.340> false<00:01:20.340> hand

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
was transposed and into that false hand

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.940 
was transposed and into that false hand
that<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.150> presented<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.810> front<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.229> me<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that was presented in front of me the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.249 
that was presented in front of me the
feeling<00:01:23.310> was<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.490> an<00:01:23.850> awkward<00:01:24.570> feeling<00:01:25.020> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
feeling was really an awkward feeling a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.890 
feeling was really an awkward feeling a
very<00:01:25.619> strange<00:01:26.070> feeling<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.850> having<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.570> fourth

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
very strange feeling of having a fourth

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.100 
very strange feeling of having a fourth
hand<00:01:28.259> belonging<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.400> me<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.970> see<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.570> visually

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
hand belonging to me we see we visually

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.179 
hand belonging to me we see we visually
see<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> hand<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> false<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.180> can't

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
see that the hand is false but we can't

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.830 
see that the hand is false but we can't
separate<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.369> from<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.670> fact<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.240> we

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
separate that from the fact that we

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.789 
separate that from the fact that we
actually<00:01:36.990> feel<00:01:37.560> our<00:01:37.950> hand<00:01:38.570> in<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.840> place<00:01:40.140> by

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
actually feel our hand in that place by
