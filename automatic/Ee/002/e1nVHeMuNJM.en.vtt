these Pikmin and watch them grow and pop
them<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.409> ground<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:43.890> he<00:01:44.009> needs

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
them out of the ground because he needs

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.770 
them out of the ground because he needs
them<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> objectives<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> game<00:01:45.570> like

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
them for the objectives in the game like

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
them for the objectives in the game like
moving<00:01:46.170> giant<00:01:46.590> rocks<00:01:46.799> out<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> way<00:01:47.310> or

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
moving giant rocks out of the way or

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.760 
moving giant rocks out of the way or
busting<00:01:48.030> down<00:01:48.180> into<00:01:48.509> new<00:01:48.659> areas<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.229> mean<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.649> me

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
busting down into new areas I mean to me

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.710 
busting down into new areas I mean to me
it<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.100> seems<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.520> Pikmin<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.689> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it just seems like Pikmin is like a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.950 
it just seems like Pikmin is like a
little<00:01:52.020> sub<00:01:52.439> game<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> mini<00:01:53.399> game<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
little sub game or a mini game for a

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.219 
little sub game or a mini game for a
much<00:01:55.530> larger<00:01:56.070> game<00:01:56.280> III<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:58.079> where

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
much larger game III can I can see where

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.020 
much larger game III can I can see where
you're<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:59.130> there<00:01:59.820> could<00:01:59.969> have

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you're going I I think there could have

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.850 
you're going I I think there could have
been<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.420> more<00:02:00.630> diversity<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.649> game

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
been a little more diversity in the game

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.530 
been a little more diversity in the game
but<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.219> are<00:02:02.340> little<00:02:02.579> surprises<00:02:03.210> along<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
but there are little surprises along the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.510 
but there are little surprises along the
way<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.140> fun<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.530> sort<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.920> unravel

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
way and it is fun to sort of unravel

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.160 
way and it is fun to sort of unravel
this<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:06.180> mystery<00:02:06.659> because<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.899> really

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
this this mystery because you really

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.199 
this this mystery because you really
don't<00:02:07.439> know<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.640> thing<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:08.940> all<00:02:09.179> about

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
don't know what this thing is all about

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.140 
don't know what this thing is all about
at<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> beginning<00:02:09.750> lots<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.349> reading

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
at the beginning lots of reading

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.940 
at the beginning lots of reading
there's<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.959> story<00:02:12.500> is<00:02:12.680> told<00:02:12.860> through

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
there's the story is told through

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.800 
there's the story is told through
reading<00:02:13.370> instead<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.760> through<00:02:14.030> some<00:02:14.599> little

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
reading instead of through some little

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.899 
reading instead of through some little
series<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.349> cinematics<00:02:16.099> this<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> problem

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
series of cinematics this is a problem

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.820 
series of cinematics this is a problem
with<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.360> GameCube<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.290> know<00:02:18.409> there's<00:02:18.650> no

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
with the GameCube is you know there's no

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.009 
with the GameCube is you know there's no
great<00:02:19.549> cinematics<00:02:20.420> there's<00:02:20.569> no<00:02:20.720> great

on<00:02:23.930> though<00:02:24.170> Reedus<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.950> game<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.489> unique<00:02:26.030> and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
on though Reedus this game is unique and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.539 
on though Reedus this game is unique and
so<00:02:27.200> far<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.620> game<00:02:27.650> qubit<00:02:28.159> is<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.370> most

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
so far in the game qubit is the most

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.520 
so far in the game qubit is the most
original<00:02:28.909> title<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:30.079> think<00:02:30.290> if<00:02:30.409> you're

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
original title and I think if you're

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.740

seem<00:04:47.539> that<00:04:47.620> update<00:04:48.620> if<00:04:49.039> you<00:04:49.280> saw<00:04:49.490> them<00:04:49.639> side<00:04:49.910> by
