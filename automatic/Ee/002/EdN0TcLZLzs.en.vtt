00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
that Archer you may think that's the end

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.530 
that Archer you may think that's the end
of<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.430> game<00:01:51.460> but<00:01:51.760> where<00:01:51.940> is<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.060> loop<00:01:52.330> to<00:01:52.450> the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
of the game but where is the loop to the

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.840 
of the game but where is the loop to the
end<00:01:52.660> of<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.810> king<00:01:53.310> after<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.400> kill<00:01:54.640> all<00:01:54.760> of

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
end of the king after you kill all of

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.460 
end of the king after you kill all of
the<00:01:55.000> science<00:01:55.420> there'll<00:01:56.050> be<00:01:56.080> some<00:01:56.320> small

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
the science there'll be some small

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.060 
the science there'll be some small
switches<00:01:57.330> switches<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:58.450> can<00:01:58.630> turn<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.350> it'll

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
switches switches you can turn and it'll

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.700 
switches switches you can turn and it'll
turn<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.730> switch<00:02:01.830> this<00:02:02.830> one<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:04.150> this<00:02:04.270> one

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
turn this switch this one and this one

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.380 
turn this switch this one and this one
so<00:02:05.710> for<00:02:05.890> us<00:02:05.950> this<00:02:06.160> let's<00:02:06.610> say<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.820> only<00:02:07.240> have

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
so for us this let's say you only have

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.420 
so for us this let's say you only have
six<00:02:07.660> times<00:02:07.930> each<00:02:08.560> one<00:02:08.770> will<00:02:08.860> turn<00:02:09.070> another<00:02:09.220> one

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
six times each one will turn another one

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.750 
six times each one will turn another one
let's<00:02:09.910> say<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.300> is<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.540> combination<00:02:11.760> and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
let's say this is the combination and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.540 
let's say this is the combination and
then<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.810> loop<00:02:14.020> will<00:02:14.200> come<00:02:14.410> out<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.830> then

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
then the loop will come out and then

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.850 
then the loop will come out and then
after<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.210> get<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.480> loop<00:02:16.690> will<00:02:17.410> be<00:02:17.440> capped

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
after you get the loop will be capped

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.060 
after you get the loop will be capped
and<00:02:18.220> yet<00:02:18.340> another<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:19.420> army<00:02:20.050> of<00:02:20.200> undead<00:02:20.800> will

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
and yet another on army of undead will

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.060 
and yet another on army of undead will
attack<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.670> with<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.360> fire<00:02:22.720> field<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
attack you with a fire field and the
