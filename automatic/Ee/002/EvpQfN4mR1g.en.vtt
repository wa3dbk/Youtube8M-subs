00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
blush and bronzer duo so let's open it

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.179 
blush and bronzer duo so let's open it
it's<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:15.840> pretty<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.909> looks<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.330> this

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and I'm assuming that this is the blush

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.270 
and I'm assuming that this is the blush
the<00:01:24.689> lighter<00:01:24.930> color<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.650> darker<00:01:26.040> color

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the lighter color and the darker color

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.830 
the lighter color and the darker color
is<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.790> bronzer<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.850> will<00:01:30.119> swatch<00:01:30.540> it

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
is the bronzer and I will swatch it

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.730 
is the bronzer and I will swatch it
without<00:01:31.140> messing<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.619> his<00:01:31.860> name<00:01:32.960> there<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
without messing up his name there is the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.109 
without messing up his name there is the
blush

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.789 

so<00:01:40.119> not<00:01:40.329> bad<00:01:40.540> I<00:01:40.840> know<00:01:40.899> it'll<00:01:41.140> show<00:01:41.320> up<00:01:41.439> on<00:01:41.590> me

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.910 
get y'all to get swatch other bronzer
okay<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.750> there's<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.350> bronzer<00:01:50.860> right<00:01:51.460> here

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
okay and there's the bronzer right here

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.320 
okay and there's the bronzer right here
that's<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.039> bronzer<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:55.210> that's<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.899> blush

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
that's the bronzer and that's the blush

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.100 
that's the bronzer and that's the blush
so<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.479> bronzer<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.320> coming<00:02:00.280> across<00:02:01.080> with<00:02:02.080> a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
so the bronzer is coming across with a

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.660 
so the bronzer is coming across with a
little<00:02:02.470> bit<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.619> petrol<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.159> little<00:02:03.429> bit<00:02:03.549> of

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
little bit of petrol a little bit of

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.120 
little bit of petrol a little bit of
coral<00:02:03.939> in<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:05.259> if<00:02:05.439> you<00:02:05.560> thought<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:05.950> the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
coral in it so if you thought that the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.070 
coral in it so if you thought that the
bronzer<00:02:06.549> would<00:02:06.729> not<00:02:06.939> work<00:02:07.149> on<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.659> I'm

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
bronzer would not work on you I'm

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.570 
bronzer would not work on you I'm
