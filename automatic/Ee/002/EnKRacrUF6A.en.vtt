00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.359
 since childhood I had this 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.089
 desire to fly and especially the 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.189
 version of ti helicopter even though I 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.839
 just I found interesting by 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.890
 versatility 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:31.069
 then there is in fact the union of the 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.509
 Helicopter with the photograph is very good 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:35.410
 are two tools there that 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.410
 complete well 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.620
 from the first opportunity I had 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.260
 that making the first flight is realizing that 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.290
 It's what I always wanted to have together. 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.650
 with me so aerial photography because 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.180
 I started to take a bite of 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.430
 helicopter 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.520
 I got closer to the middle of the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.510
 aviation just in case 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.510
 to fly more 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.020
 was the whole of Brazil, especially the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.640
 coastline almost all the coast and the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.850
 Outside I 've already taken a trip 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.020
 amazing that it was from the north of the states 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.759
 united to são paulo by helicopter 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.420
 were 15 days making the transfer 20 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.940
 ride was a wonderful experience and 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.729
 I also went to atacama the desert of 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.729
 Atacama in Chile left São Paulo 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.510
 I threw the eras from Brazil now in the year. 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.810
 past a photo book is like 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:59.040
 says the name and photo of brazil pt that gathers 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.159
 there many years of work both in 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.600
 all regions and are various visions it has 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:11.239
 town has a countryside road and is 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.239
 the movie or a new look about brazil 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.640
 awesome as agent force paulo is 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.010
 You can not see the whole city. 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.930
 Do not you see the end of the Inca city? 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.130
 several other large cities and I 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.350
 I always went 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.920
 Are you there oxy was already on the edge of 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.360
 city it does not happen sao paulo 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.150
 across the city were even a 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.110
 Cup does not take too long the 20 minutes. 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.000
 session 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.280
 it's crazy the dimension that this city 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.950
 and the number of buildings with certainty 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.900
 city ​​has so much building in the world that 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.850
 Sao Paulo is a little too dry and does not tire 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.459
 but when I go it 's a bit like a 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.090
 chance to have a horizon because it is something 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.150
 rare for people who live in são paulo, the people 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.490
 sees the city always fragmented 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.490
 pieces of the city never came back 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.320
 all that I do a part I have in 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.370
 mind that you photograph it 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.640
 I give a study before on the maps 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.290
 google and another part and that's what goes 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.220
 to appear naked this is cool 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.870
 surprise 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.160
 there is a lot of things that people imagine 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.530
 has been flying and is faced with a scene 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.590
 so cool, you always have to stay tuned 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.790
 once from a field of mars and there 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.380
 I came across a deposit of ortizons 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.710
 half- hearted carcasses 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.770
 surreal and neither imagines nor knew 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.960
 this existed and then it has to be 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.210
 always attentive and these surprises like this 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.210
 are always welcome always nice 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.250
 I never experienced grip and is contrary to the 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.040
 Contrary to the fear I feel well out of the 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.560
 I 'm happy on earth, for example. 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.359
 when they are flying over a 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.310
 oil down the focus still good that I 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.380
 'm up here I feel safe here is 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.060
 there on the road I do not feel safe not 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.510
 there I'm more scared than when 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.510
 flies
