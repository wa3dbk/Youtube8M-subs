00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.399
 it's very simple then me what I 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.760
 advise is to first pass a 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:14.809
 little bit of water in it to emulate 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.809
 general it's me this is particularly the case 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.590
 with a little bit of water to make 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.740
 pass to clean in a first 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740
 time 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.670
 so we see that already at this point 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.280
 the device almost cleaned up we see 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.220
 more than very very little fiber that 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.620
 stay in it and so it will be very easy 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.060
 then clean under the tap at 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.680
 note i will quote you the extractor 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.250
 pressure game you have a function 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.630
 the mores 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:18.909
 if you ever put too big 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:22.800
 piece that stays stuck the girls have 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:28.570
 then to clean your extractor 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:32.560
 we remove the cover in the sap so 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.690
 the housing 3 in 1 thus seen that it is 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.860
 already went very very well clean when 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.860
 I saw that she was passing 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.130
 farrah fawcett peck and the wood suite 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.130
 of extraction 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.220
 so how do all the extractors of 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.590
 vertical cabbage yannick nyanga joomla who 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.510
 allows to dissociate on one side the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.920
 juice that goes out on their side the ads so 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.570
 when you clean it's important to 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.910
 English to be able to access the goal 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.170
 either got stuck there and on the other hand that 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.210
 you redo just very important to 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.230
 remember to get you if we have 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.890
 said to have the impression that you have there 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.890
 why not him 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:37.910
 to perfect everything and access 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.210
 small fibers that are stuck play 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.480
 serve you the voice what is certain 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.480
 of the date 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.220
 and here is our extractor and so takes 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:09.900
 for their very simple beauty we 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:12.650
 will close the tongue is yellow and green 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.650
