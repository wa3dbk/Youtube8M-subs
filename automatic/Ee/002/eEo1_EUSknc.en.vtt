 hello everybody me for you 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.900
 some news 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.020
 I decided to open the second channel which 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.119
 will not be dedicated at all 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:27.320
 models of construction equipment 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.970
 and will be devoted mainly audio 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.050

 I have a large collection of them, too, and 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.230
 still listening tapes 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.330
 many of them were bought back in the 90s 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:06.479
 years when mostly all alone 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:10.350
 I did not really listen to the tapes 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.539
 correctly fill video on different 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:24.750
