follow through the steps once you've got

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.410 
follow through the steps once you've got
your<00:01:48.420> drivers<00:01:48.899> installed<00:01:50.090> we're<00:01:51.090> gonna<00:01:51.180> go

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
your drivers installed we're gonna go

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.330 
your drivers installed we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.689> go<00:01:52.170> into<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.619> phone<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:56.219> got

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
ahead and go into the phone and we got

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.889 
ahead and go into the phone and we got
to<00:01:56.430> make<00:01:56.520> sure<00:01:56.579> USB<00:01:57.060> debugging<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.540> turned<00:01:57.750> on

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
to make sure USB debugging is turned on

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.550 
to make sure USB debugging is turned on
so<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.110> got<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> go<00:01:58.409> into<00:01:58.560> settings<00:01:58.890> and<00:02:00.560> if

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so you got to go into settings and if

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.530 
so you got to go into settings and if
developer<00:02:02.549> settings<00:02:02.850> are<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.090> turned<00:02:03.360> on

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
developer settings are not turned on

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.050 
developer settings are not turned on
just<00:02:04.320> go<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:05.070> build<00:02:05.430> number<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.909> just

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
just go to the build number and just

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.059 
just go to the build number and just
keep<00:02:06.270> tapping<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.780> bunch<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.020> times<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
keep tapping it a bunch of times and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.710 
keep tapping it a bunch of times and
it'll<00:02:08.520> turn<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.330> setting<00:02:09.599> right<00:02:09.660> here

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it'll turn on at this setting right here

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050 
it'll turn on at this setting right here
developer<00:02:10.349> options<00:02:10.739> then<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.640> want<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.910> make

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
developer options then you want to make

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.760 
developer options then you want to make
sure<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.750> checked<00:02:13.110> or<00:02:13.440> turn

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
sure it is checked or turn

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.830 
sure it is checked or turn
here<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.340> then<00:02:14.430> make<00:02:14.670> sure<00:02:14.700> USB<00:02:15.270> debugging<00:02:15.420> is

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
here and then make sure USB debugging is

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.470 
here and then make sure USB debugging is
turned<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.320> okay<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.030> same<00:02:18.240> process

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
turned on okay and it's the same process

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.860 
turned on okay and it's the same process
on<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.680> prism<00:02:20.310> or<00:02:20.460> pretty<00:02:20.790> much<00:02:20.820> any<00:02:21.120> jelly

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
on the prism or pretty much any jelly

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.450 
on the prism or pretty much any jelly
bean<00:02:22.170> device<00:02:27.860> then<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.950> got<00:02:29.070> all<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.220> junk

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
bean device then you got all this junk

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.800 
bean device then you got all this junk
that<00:02:29.520> pops<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.210> gotta<00:02:30.360> close<00:02:30.540> all<00:02:30.720> this

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
that pops up so you gotta close all this

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.550 
that pops up so you gotta close all this
stuff<00:02:31.050> down<00:02:31.640> close<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.820> out<00:02:32.910> close<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.450> out<00:02:33.570> and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
stuff down close it out close it out and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.040 
stuff down close it out close it out and
go<00:02:35.340> ahead<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.610> do<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.880> let<00:02:36.480> your<00:02:36.630> drivers

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
go ahead and do this let your drivers

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.930 
go ahead and do this let your drivers
install<00:02:37.470> they<00:02:37.830> will<00:02:38.010> install<00:02:38.370> down<00:02:38.700> here

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
install they will install down here

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.810 
install they will install down here
probably<00:02:39.480> under<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.610> actually<00:02:41.610> looks

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
probably under this and actually looks

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.100 
probably under this and actually looks
like<00:02:41.970> these<00:02:42.120> are<00:02:42.180> all<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.450> ones<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.750> installed

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
like these are all the ones I installed

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.900 
like these are all the ones I installed
make<00:02:43.260> sure<00:02:43.380> they're<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:43.650> done<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.220> you've

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
make sure they're all done and you've

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.780 
make sure they're all done and you've
got<00:02:45.090> everything<00:02:45.330> installed<00:02:45.600> on<00:02:46.020> your<00:02:46.140> device

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
got everything installed on your device

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.190 
got everything installed on your device
close<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.810> want<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.050> make<00:02:49.170> sure

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
close that then you want to make sure

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.890 
close that then you want to make sure
that<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.760> have<00:02:50.880> USB<00:02:51.090> debugging<00:02:51.300> up<00:02:51.660> here<00:02:51.840> in

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
that you have USB debugging up here in

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.900 
that you have USB debugging up here in
notifications<00:02:52.560> as<00:02:52.800> connected<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:53.370> mess<00:02:53.640> as

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
notifications as connected as mess as

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.410 
notifications as connected as mess as
Mass<00:02:54.450> Storage<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.620> should<00:02:55.830> be<00:02:55.950> good<00:02:56.420> from

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
Mass Storage so that should be good from

just added in some little information
Burbidge<00:03:16.350> I'd<00:03:16.800> recommend<00:03:17.250> trying<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.120> on

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
Burbidge I'd recommend trying this on

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.330 
Burbidge I'd recommend trying this on
other<00:03:18.600> jellybean<00:03:19.170> devices<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.770> may<00:03:19.950> root<00:03:20.220> your

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
other jellybean devices it may root your

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.220 
other jellybean devices it may root your
device<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.940> if<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.360> doesn't<00:03:21.540> it'll<00:03:21.900> just<00:03:22.110> say

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
device and if it doesn't it'll just say

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.530 
device and if it doesn't it'll just say

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
to continue so hit the spacebar and you

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.730 
to continue so hit the spacebar and you
can<00:03:30.510> see<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:30.870> running<00:03:31.050> through<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.410> script

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740

and use root checker application you

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.720 
and use root checker application you
don't<00:07:16.620> have<00:07:16.770> to<00:07:16.890> do<00:07:17.010> this<00:07:17.130> this<00:07:17.310> just<00:07:17.490> proves
