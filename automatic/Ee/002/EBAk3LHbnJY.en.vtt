00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.840
 What about this problem 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.740
 Let's consider this Mushigi 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.920
 Captured pieces is the nucleus 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.920
 What should I do 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.910
 Everyone everyone 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.780
 Useful Ogoma 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.780
 I think you know the words 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.020
 Daikoma is received talk 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.840
 I did it 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:01.359
 If I write and sell 22 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.359
 It is held with 12 powers 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.410
 with this 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.410
 It will be boring 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.940
 Daikoma is received talk 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.940
 With the knowledge that 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.490
 Where should I hit 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.980
 That's right 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:28.200
 If you write 31 and hit 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.200
 I can not get out because there is silver on 24 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.960
 There is no choice but to go down 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.960
 there 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.140
 The strong angle 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.460
 Come not when it comes 22 people or 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.180
 with this 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.180
 Sumi is 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.680
 So the correct answer is 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.960
 31 each 12 power 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.409
 22 corner 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.409
 It is up to 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.280
 It will be always on 3 of 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.900
 Power to think 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.229
 As of Toko 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.569
 knowledge 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.800
 Talk and hit a large piece 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:20.350
 If you know that 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.350
 Problem will come to be seen more and more 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.120
 Thank you very much
