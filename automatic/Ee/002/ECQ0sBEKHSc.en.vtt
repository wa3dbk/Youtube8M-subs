to the end and seeing how people's
performance<00:02:04.540> has<00:02:04.930> changed<00:02:05.590> was<00:02:05.890> just

performance has changed was just

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.050

incredible<00:02:08.080> on<00:02:08.290> and<00:02:08.679> even<00:02:08.950> from<00:02:09.670> moment<00:02:10.000> to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
incredible on and even from moment to

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.200 
incredible on and even from moment to
moment<00:02:10.440> where<00:02:11.440> he<00:02:11.470> might<00:02:11.890> say<00:02:12.220> no<00:02:12.580> do<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.000> this

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
moment where he might say no do it this

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.890 
moment where he might say no do it this
way<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:14.760> five<00:02:15.760> minutes<00:02:16.000> later<00:02:16.120> someone<00:02:16.720> is

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
way and five minutes later someone is

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.630 
way and five minutes later someone is
doing<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.500> totally<00:02:17.800> different<00:02:18.100> performance

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
doing a totally different performance

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.690 
doing a totally different performance
and<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.240> much<00:02:19.450> richer<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.440> more<00:02:20.680> depth<00:02:21.400> but

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
and so much richer and more depth but

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.210 
and so much richer and more depth but
but<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.420> only<00:02:22.600> took<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:23.020> small<00:02:23.320> little<00:02:23.530> tweak<00:02:24.040> of

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
but it only took a small little tweak of

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.320 
but it only took a small little tweak of
his<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:26.500> bring<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:27.580> character<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:29.140> life
