this time we're gonna be looking at a D

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.260 
this time we're gonna be looking at a D
form<00:00:19.170> Barre<00:00:19.410> chord<00:00:19.710> which<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.730> pretty<00:00:21.060> much

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
form Barre chord which is pretty much

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.960 
form Barre chord which is pretty much
anything<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.960> looks<00:00:22.109> like<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> D<00:00:22.560> shape<00:00:22.970> all

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
anything that looks like a D shape all

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.089 
anything that looks like a D shape all
over<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.689> guitar<00:00:27.140> so<00:00:28.140> we'll<00:00:28.470> be<00:00:28.650> looking

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
over the guitar so we'll be looking

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.690 
over the guitar so we'll be looking
close<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.939> how<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.009> as<00:00:32.009> far<00:00:32.640> as

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
close up on how to do this and as far as

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.819 
close up on how to do this and as far as
usefulness<00:00:33.300> goes<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.350> commonly

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
usefulness goes this is like commonly

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.040 
usefulness goes this is like commonly
I'll<00:00:35.100> use<00:00:35.340> these<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.270> top<00:00:36.510> three<00:00:36.780> strings

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
I'll use these the top three strings

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.330 
I'll use these the top three strings
here<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.280> highest<00:00:38.550> ones<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.180> make<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.050> chord

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
here the highest ones to make the chord

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.590 
here the highest ones to make the chord
if<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.460> put<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> root<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.090> that's<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.450> little

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
if you put the root in that's a little

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.540 
if you put the root in that's a little
bit<00:00:42.719> more<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.020> stretch<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.590> that's<00:00:43.860> where

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
bit more of a stretch but that's where

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.979 
bit more of a stretch but that's where
the<00:00:44.670> bar<00:00:44.850> part<00:00:45.180> comes<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.750> we're<00:00:45.899> gonna

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the bar part comes in so we're gonna

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:46.940 
the bar part comes in so we're gonna
look<00:00:46.200> at<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.469> right<00:00:46.710> now

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
look at that right now

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.970 
look at that right now
anyway<00:00:47.940> more<00:00:48.629> talking<00:00:49.079> let's<00:00:49.110> zoom<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
anyway more talking let's zoom in and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.209 
anyway more talking let's zoom in and
see<00:00:50.100> how<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:50.640> done<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> let's<00:00:52.800> start<00:00:53.070> off

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
see how it's done so let's start off

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.490 
see how it's done so let's start off
this<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.510> court<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.079> gonna<00:00:55.230> sound

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
this is a the court this is gonna sound

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.529 
this is a the court this is gonna sound
like<00:00:55.850> right<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.750> F<00:00:57.899> chord

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
like right here is an F chord

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.389 
like right here is an F chord
it'll<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.780> another<00:01:00.890> inversion<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> F

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it'll just be another inversion of the F

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.070 
it'll just be another inversion of the F
chord<00:01:02.840> so

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.440 

as<00:01:06.260> we<00:01:06.890> play<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.250> along<00:01:07.550> here<00:01:07.820> our<00:01:08.000> notes<00:01:08.270> are

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
as we play that along here our notes are

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.250 
as we play that along here our notes are
gonna<00:01:08.570> be<00:01:08.840> F<00:01:09.620> C<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:13.750> that's<00:01:14.750> pretty<00:01:15.080> much

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
gonna be F C and a so that's pretty much

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.990 
gonna be F C and a so that's pretty much
the<00:01:15.500> one<00:01:15.680> three<00:01:15.920> five<00:01:16.100> there<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:16.610> just<00:01:16.760> a

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
the one three five there it's just a

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.460 
the one three five there it's just a
major<00:01:17.240> F<00:01:17.720> chord<00:01:18.790> so<00:01:19.790> starting<00:01:20.660> out<00:01:20.810> here<00:01:20.840> this

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
major F chord so starting out here this

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.640 
major F chord so starting out here this
is<00:01:21.650> gonna<00:01:21.830> be<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.250> full-on<00:01:22.850> Barre<00:01:23.150> chord

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
is gonna be the full-on Barre chord

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.620 
is gonna be the full-on Barre chord
version<00:01:24.650> first<00:01:24.920> where<00:01:25.550> you<00:01:25.730> take<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.480> can

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
here and right there and that will

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.390 
here and right there and that will
pretty<00:01:48.290> much<00:01:48.410> do<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.830> same<00:01:49.010> thing<00:01:49.250> because

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
pretty much do the same thing because

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.070 
pretty much do the same thing because
these<00:01:49.729> three<00:01:50.000> fingers<00:01:50.210> should<00:01:50.660> already<00:01:50.960> be

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
these three fingers should already be

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.140 
these three fingers should already be
holding<00:01:51.500> everything<00:01:51.710> else<00:01:51.950> down<00:01:52.220> however<00:01:52.940> if

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
holding everything else down however if

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.310 
holding everything else down however if
you<00:01:53.240> want<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.510> change<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.930> chord<00:01:54.170> or

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
you want to change the chord or

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.700 
you want to change the chord or
something<00:01:54.619> like<00:01:56.020> drop<00:01:57.020> something<00:01:57.500> out<00:01:57.680> of

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
something like drop something out of

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.830 
something like drop something out of
there<00:01:58.040> it's<00:01:58.400> not<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.729> bad<00:01:59.000> idea<00:01:59.030> just<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.690> have

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
there it's not a bad idea just to have

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.690 
there it's not a bad idea just to have
it<00:01:59.869> barred<00:02:00.200> down<00:02:00.470> all<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.860> way<00:02:00.950> if<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.460> felt

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
it barred down all the way if you felt

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.380 
it barred down all the way if you felt
like<00:02:01.760> changing<00:02:02.360> up<00:02:02.479> your<00:02:02.510> chord<00:02:07.390> mid-flow

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
like changing up your chord mid-flow

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.380 
like changing up your chord mid-flow
anyway<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:10.580> we're<00:02:10.760> gonna<00:02:10.850> start<00:02:11.209> with<00:02:11.330> our

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
anyway so we're gonna start with our

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.050 
anyway so we're gonna start with our
index<00:02:11.810> finger<00:02:12.280> going<00:02:13.280> all<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.670> way<00:02:13.700> across

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
index finger going all the way across

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.930 
index finger going all the way across
here<00:02:14.330> on<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.170> third<00:02:15.350> fret<00:02:15.560> barring<00:02:16.370> from<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
here on the third fret barring from the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.850
