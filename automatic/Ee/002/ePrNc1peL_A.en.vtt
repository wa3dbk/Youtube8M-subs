my<00:03:21.980> fingers<00:03:22.370> breathing<00:03:23.329> out<00:03:24.880> breathing<00:03:25.880> yet

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
my fingers breathing out breathing yet

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.809 
my fingers breathing out breathing yet
everything<00:03:28.579> out<00:03:30.040> breathing<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.609> I'm

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
everything out breathing it and I'm

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.809 
everything out breathing it and I'm
letting<00:03:32.810> my<00:03:33.109> own<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.440> sink<00:03:33.859> into<00:03:34.160> my<00:03:34.310> hands<00:03:34.670> I'm

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
letting my own a sink into my hands I'm

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.410 
letting my own a sink into my hands I'm
feeling<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.900> space<00:03:36.380> in<00:03:36.650> here<00:03:37.100> I'm<00:03:37.970> feeling

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
feeling the space in here I'm feeling

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.180 
feeling the space in here I'm feeling
the<00:03:38.510> sensation<00:03:39.109> on<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.290> inside<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:39.799> my<00:03:39.890> thumb

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
the sensation on the inside of my thumb

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.920 
the sensation on the inside of my thumb
and<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.519> inside<00:03:40.819> of<00:03:40.940> my<00:03:41.030> fingers<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.569> index

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
and the inside of my fingers and index

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.050 
and the inside of my fingers and index
finger<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.500> there<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.250> subtle<00:03:43.549> change<00:03:43.850> of

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
finger and there is a subtle change of

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.140 
finger and there is a subtle change of
sensation<00:03:44.600> just<00:03:45.319> with<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:45.650> movement

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
sensation just with that movement

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.569 
sensation just with that movement
coordinated<00:03:47.150> with<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.420> breathing<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:49.400> so

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
coordinated with the breathing and so

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.479 
coordinated with the breathing and so
this<00:03:49.760> movement<00:03:50.090> can<00:03:50.510> become<00:03:51.370> something<00:03:52.370> you

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
this movement can become something you

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.300 
this movement can become something you
do<00:03:52.700> just<00:03:53.030> with<00:03:53.209> your<00:03:53.329> arm<00:03:53.540> draped<00:03:53.859> down<00:03:54.859> under

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
do just with your arm draped down under

do just with your arm draped down under
the<00:03:55.970> table<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.900> conversation<00:03:57.500> gets<00:03:57.680> a

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
the table and the conversation gets a

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.400 
the table and the conversation gets a
little<00:03:58.159> -<00:03:58.400> no<00:03:59.269> just<00:03:59.840> straight

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
down out of sight but you're breathing

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.960 
down out of sight but you're breathing
out<00:04:09.640> hands<00:04:10.640> fingers<00:04:11.510> coming<00:04:11.750> closer

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
out hands fingers coming closer

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.650 
out hands fingers coming closer
breathing<00:04:13.970> in<00:04:14.230> stretching<00:04:15.230> them<00:04:15.560> apart<00:04:16.660> three

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
breathing in stretching them apart three

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.690 
breathing in stretching them apart three
breaths<00:04:19.989> four<00:04:20.989> breaths<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:25.310> will<00:04:25.490> feel

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
breaths four breaths and you will feel

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.240 
breaths four breaths and you will feel
yourself<00:04:25.850> quiet<00:04:26.420> and<00:04:27.350> as<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.740> mind<00:04:27.980> gets

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
yourself quiet and as the mind gets

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.200 
yourself quiet and as the mind gets
quiet<00:04:29.170> then<00:04:30.170> your<00:04:30.770> own<00:04:31.040> deeper<00:04:31.580> intelligence

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
quiet then your own deeper intelligence

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.430 
quiet then your own deeper intelligence
has<00:04:32.960> an<00:04:33.500> opportunity<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:34.460> step<00:04:35.450> in<00:04:35.720> your

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
has an opportunity to step in your

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.800 
has an opportunity to step in your
intuition<00:04:36.980> clicks<00:04:37.310> in<00:04:37.640> you<00:04:38.300> see<00:04:38.540> things

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
intuition clicks in you see things

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.540 
intuition clicks in you see things
clearer<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.620> can<00:04:39.800> respond<00:04:40.310> in<00:04:40.490> an

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
clearer and you can respond in an

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.470 
clearer and you can respond in an
appropriate<00:04:41.150> way

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
appropriate way

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.380 
appropriate way
so<00:04:42.440> this<00:04:43.100> is<00:04:43.250> another<00:04:43.490> practice<00:04:44.060> for

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
so this is another practice for

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.770 
so this is another practice for
centering<00:04:46.240> sometimes<00:04:47.240> you'll<00:04:47.420> feel<00:04:47.630> almost

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
centering sometimes you'll feel almost

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.140 
centering sometimes you'll feel almost
like<00:04:48.020> an<00:04:48.260> energy<00:04:48.710> moving<00:04:49.220> in<00:04:49.490> your<00:04:49.640> hand<00:04:49.880> or

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
like an energy moving in your hand or

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.680 
like an energy moving in your hand or
between<00:04:50.420> your<00:04:50.690> hands<00:04:52.360> well<00:04:53.360> we<00:04:53.450> don't<00:04:53.600> really

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
between your hands well we don't really

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.930 
between your hands well we don't really
need<00:04:53.960> that<00:04:54.020> work<00:04:54.440> worried<00:04:55.040> all<00:04:55.190> we<00:04:55.340> need<00:04:55.820> to

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
need that work worried all we need to

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.580 
need that work worried all we need to
notice<00:04:56.240> is<00:04:56.420> that<00:04:56.450> subtle<00:04:56.900> change<00:04:57.410> of

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
notice is that subtle change of

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.190 
notice is that subtle change of
sensation<00:04:58.330> so<00:04:59.330> again<00:04:59.570> this<00:04:59.690> is<00:04:59.840> something<00:05:00.050> you

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
sensation so again this is something you

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.740 
sensation so again this is something you
just<00:05:00.470> practice<00:05:00.980> until<00:05:01.910> it<00:05:02.030> becomes<00:05:02.360> a<00:05:02.570> an

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
just practice until it becomes a an

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.970 
just practice until it becomes a an
instant<00:05:03.560> queue<00:05:04.010> for<00:05:05.470> lowering<00:05:06.470> your<00:05:06.740> arousal

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
instant queue for lowering your arousal

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.460 
instant queue for lowering your arousal
level<00:05:07.490> less<00:05:07.970> emotion<00:05:08.540> less<00:05:08.840> agitation

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
level less emotion less agitation

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.670 
level less emotion less agitation
because<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:09.950> your<00:05:10.100> thoughts<00:05:11.440> it's<00:05:12.440> a<00:05:12.530> good

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
because of your thoughts it's a good

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:25.100 
because of your thoughts it's a good
practice<00:05:12.940> teach<00:05:13.940> it<00:05:14.090> to<00:05:14.180> all<00:05:14.450> my<00:05:14.480> ribs
