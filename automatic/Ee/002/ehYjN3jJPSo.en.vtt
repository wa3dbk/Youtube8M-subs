00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.629
 hello how about this time I'm going to 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.690
 prepare the red rice since in some 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.430
 recipes I said that I have determined and 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.380
 we can only accompany with a rice 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.490
 good is the way I do it 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.860
 I have half a kilo of rice or two cups of 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.880
 rice 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.009
 3 tomatoes 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:35.040
 a piece of onion a clove of garlic 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:40.170
 chicken soup and make a bucket or 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.230
 powder I put parsley but in this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.750
 time is this time I do not have 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.290
 fresh parsley I have this parsley that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.170
 It is dry if you have dried parsley da 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.490
 the same 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.810
 and a liter of water 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:00.090
 sometimes I put carrot potato 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.700
 pea or corn kernels or other 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.370
 Sometimes I put clams 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.110
 or you can also put shrimp in 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.660
 end to rice you can put many 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.600
 many other things more 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.300
 we will also need oil and salt 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.030
 the necessary we are going to as a first step 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.330
 let's rinse the rice very well and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.180
 let's drain 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.880
 and drain the rice after the 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.060
 rinse in this saucepan that I put to the 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.259
 I'm going to add fire 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.259
 so little 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.369
 let's add a little only one 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.369
 bit 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.970
 with that with that is enough as this 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.270
 Teflon pan lends itself very very 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.400
 ok to make the the rice I'm not going to 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.770
 extend earlier I have a 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.570
 clay pan that also came out 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.590
 very good to make it good we are going to 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.229
 wait for the oil to be hot 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.740
 and in the meantime we can take away the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.540
 navel to our tomato 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:11.510
 and move them 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:13.600
 they are for a cup of rice they tell me 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.330
 They are two cups of water 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.000
 that is going to be a liter of water 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.640
 and with that liter of water with a cup 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.050
 we're going to grind these tomatoes 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.340
 with onion and garlic clove good 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.340
 we know that of this caliber this 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.659
 and we're going to go I'm going to put these 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.840
 those onion bits the rice 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.540
 also for it to be donated together 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.909
 with rice 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.220
 and we will keep moving him from time to time 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.760
 when 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.150
 the rice has already changed color and is half 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.350
 Golden I'm not going to leave it to be 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.810
 I love a lot as it is right now 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.600
 I will empty the tomatoes that mony with 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.480
 part of the liter of water look to see if it 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.440
 you can appreciate the gold well here 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.620
 I'll leave it golden 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.720
 I'm going to strain the tomato I'm going to the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.680
 sink so it does not mess so much 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.710
 stove is already 100 tomato 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.740
 the strained tomato 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.610
 and from the same liter of water I added a 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.690
 little more to the glass 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.690
 to rinse it 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.020
 Now we are going to add the cube of 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.990
 consommÃ© or consommÃ© in powder and that you 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.510
 want 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:52.270
 the parsley if you have fresh is very much 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.270
 better but if not also the known pse 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.290
 and let's let it boil and 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.620
 try to make us Swiss look good 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.430
 dissolved 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.780
 if you're going to make a quarter or a cup of 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.110
 rice that is the same the fourth and the 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.280
 cup of rice only uses two cups of 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.280
 water or half a liter 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.090
 well I hope the boil already 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.020
 Season the tomato and the consommÃ© well 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.330
 chicken 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:28.100
 and now I 'm going to add what's missing 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.100
 of water of a liter of water 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.009
 and now I hope he releases the 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.699
 boil 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:39.889
 it was happening to me to put the salt the 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.539
 salt you know what is the amount that you 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.050
 you want but little because you already have the 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:46.780
 chicken soup 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.930
 already returned to let the boil and now what 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.530
 I'm going to cover 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.699
 and I'm going to put it on a tiny flame 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.699
 the smallest that can be 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.400
 well there are times that it is very tiny 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.880
 that will not let anything boil 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:09.710
 good a small flame and we're going to 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:12.350
 leaving uncapped for 15 minutes is the 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.240
 my friend Angie gave me advice 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.080
 garden that I do not know anything about her 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.590
 good we left for 15 minutes 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.840
 15 minutes have passed and it's time to 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.400
 turn it off but I want you to see in what 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:31.169
 I do not have a flame 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:34.630
 well I turn it off and without uncovering what I'm going 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.970
 to leave like this for about 10 minutes 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.180
 it's been 10 minutes after 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:43.750
 I paid for it and I'm going to emphasize that 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.400
 we're going to see let's see look like 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.610
 how was it 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.520
 here if you want, you can remove the 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.300
 branches of him 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.300
 parsley 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.229
 I'm going to serve it sometimes 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.870
 look how nice I am 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.870
 it was fluffed 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.980
 well this is a secret also to leave it 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.350
 ten minutes after switching it off 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.710
 so that it would finish cooking like this 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:25.130
 nice is from my little friend angie garden 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:27.500
 good and if you like this rice you know 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:32.020
 that you have to give to the mayor and 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.020
 I send many kisses
