00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
by the way yeah I guess maybe mean a

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.600 
by the way yeah I guess maybe mean a
mage<00:05:00.230> you<00:05:00.260> know<00:05:00.560> I'm<00:05:00.800> a<00:05:00.890> little<00:05:01.070> weaker<00:05:01.430> so<00:05:01.580> I

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
mage you know I'm a little weaker so I

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.030 
mage you know I'm a little weaker so I
gotta<00:05:01.880> maintain<00:05:02.150> my<00:05:02.480> distance<00:05:02.960> but<00:05:03.860> for<00:05:03.980> the

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
gotta maintain my distance but for the

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.590 
gotta maintain my distance but for the
most<00:05:04.160> part<00:05:04.370> every<00:05:04.610> single<00:05:04.850> quest<00:05:05.120> has<00:05:05.420> been

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
most part every single quest has been

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.870 
most part every single quest has been
different<00:05:05.960> it's<00:05:06.170> been<00:05:06.350> unique<00:05:06.880> completely

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
different it's been unique completely

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.640
