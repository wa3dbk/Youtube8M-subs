see mark become the Joker when he's

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.600 
see mark become the Joker when he's
actually<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.709> recording<00:01:43.130> booth<00:01:43.280> and

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
actually in the recording booth and

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.770 
actually in the recording booth and
doing<00:01:43.819> these<00:01:43.909> voices<00:01:44.299> he<00:01:44.420> actually

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
doing these voices he actually

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.539 
doing these voices he actually
physically<00:01:45.259> kind<00:01:45.500> of<00:01:45.590> twists<00:01:45.950> himself<00:01:46.340> and

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
physically kind of twists himself and

manifests himself into Joker mark
sometimes<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.739> think<00:01:51.890> he<00:01:51.950> actually<00:01:52.099> is<00:01:52.280> Joker

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
sometimes I think he actually is Joker

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.669 
sometimes I think he actually is Joker
so<00:01:53.000> he<00:01:53.119> just<00:01:53.329> turns<00:01:53.539> up<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:53.840> he<00:01:53.929> just<00:01:54.140> nails<00:01:54.409> it

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
so he just turns up and he just nails it

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.190
