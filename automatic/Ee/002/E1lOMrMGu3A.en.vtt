last night for a little while and so I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.660 
last night for a little while and so I
thought<00:00:58.770> well<00:00:59.460> I'll<00:00:59.760> record<00:01:00.239> myself<00:01:00.570> being

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
thought well I'll record myself being

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.350 
thought well I'll record myself being
attacked<00:01:02.670> by<00:01:03.979> mirelurks

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
attacked by mirelurks

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.679 
attacked by mirelurks
cuz<00:01:06.360> that's<00:01:06.750> entertaining<00:01:07.380> enough<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.939> it

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
cuz that's entertaining enough and so it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.510 
cuz that's entertaining enough and so it
was<00:01:09.840> really<00:01:09.990> dark<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.010> didn't<00:01:11.220> work<00:01:11.369> out

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
was really dark and it didn't work out

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.219 
was really dark and it didn't work out
and<00:01:11.670> there's<00:01:12.090> not<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.270> lot<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.570> dialogue<00:01:12.990> when

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and there's not a lot of dialogue when

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.450 
and there's not a lot of dialogue when
you're<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.530> questing<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> thought<00:01:14.340> well

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you're just questing so I thought well

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.940 
you're just questing so I thought well
maybe<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.790> isn't<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> best<00:01:15.119> game<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
maybe this isn't the best game so then I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.840 
maybe this isn't the best game so then I
did

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
did

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.969

it<00:02:22.670> I'm<00:02:22.820> not<00:02:22.850> retarded<00:02:23.300> I'm<00:02:23.720> pretty<00:02:24.080> sure<00:02:24.350> I

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
it I'm not retarded I'm pretty sure I

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.190 
it I'm not retarded I'm pretty sure I
hooked<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.890> up<00:02:25.010> correctly<00:02:25.750> but<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.810> didn't<00:02:27.080> use

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
hooked it up correctly but I didn't use

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.380 
hooked it up correctly but I didn't use
any<00:02:27.440> splitters<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.910> maybe<00:02:29.120> that's<00:02:29.300> got

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
any splitters so maybe that's got

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.430 
any splitters so maybe that's got
something<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.690> do<00:02:29.810> with<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.990> if<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.290> know

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440
