00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
of things happened that after reading

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.560 
of things happened that after reading
this<00:00:16.289> chapter<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.890> had<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.310> go<00:00:17.490> back<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.119> Reese

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
this chapter I had to go back and Reese

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.529 
this chapter I had to go back and Reese
Kim<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> parts<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.130> get<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.789> grip<00:00:21.330> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
Kim a lot of the parts to get a grip of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.840 
Kim a lot of the parts to get a grip of
everything<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.529> happened<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.519> chapter

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
everything that happened in this chapter

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.099 
everything that happened in this chapter
so<00:00:24.449> law<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.170> after<00:00:25.859> something<00:00:26.430> known<00:00:26.789> as<00:00:27.109> sad

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
so law is after something known as sad

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.950 
so law is after something known as sad
and<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.310> confirmation<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:30.390> he<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and that is the confirmation that he is

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.799 
and that is the confirmation that he is
completely<00:00:31.769> betraying<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.820> Flamingo<00:00:33.420> there

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
completely betraying the Flamingo there

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.930 
completely betraying the Flamingo there
go<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.469> everybody<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.190> guess<00:00:35.489> before<00:00:35.640> they

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
go and everybody I guess before they

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.060 
go and everybody I guess before they
weren't<00:00:36.149> sure<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
weren't sure but this is like the the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.729 
weren't sure but this is like the the
line<00:00:38.309> he's<00:00:38.760> crossed<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.510> line<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
line he's crossed the line so the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.400 
line he's crossed the line so the
Flamingo<00:00:41.370> appears<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.570> chapter<00:00:42.989> but

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
Flamingo appears in this chapter but

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.010 
Flamingo appears in this chapter but
he's<00:00:43.590> actually<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.370> his<00:00:44.610> base<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.960> guess

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
he's actually at his base with I guess

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.900 
he's actually at his base with I guess
that's<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.739> rest<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.160> his<00:00:47.250> crew<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.550> don't<00:00:47.850> know

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that's the rest of his crew I don't know

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.000 
that's the rest of his crew I don't know
there's<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.300> bunch<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.690> old<00:00:48.989> guys<00:00:49.200> there<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
there's a bunch of old guys there and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.920 
there's a bunch of old guys there and
some<00:00:50.489> other<00:00:50.670> new<00:00:50.879> characters<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.719> guess

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
some other new characters but I guess

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.990 
some other new characters but I guess
that's<00:00:52.170> his<00:00:52.379> crew<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.860> some<00:00:53.370> other<00:00:53.579> people

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that's his crew and some other people

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.029 
that's his crew and some other people
but<00:00:54.270> he<00:00:54.390> pretty<00:00:54.660> much<00:00:54.750> gives<00:00:55.110> ver<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.770> order

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
but he pretty much gives ver go to order

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.200 
but he pretty much gives ver go to order
to<00:00:56.449> mercilessly<00:00:57.739> completely<00:00:58.739> kill<00:00:59.190> long<00:00:59.850> but

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
to mercilessly completely kill long but

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.000 
to mercilessly completely kill long but
not<00:01:00.300> thinking<00:01:00.539> about<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.930> information<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
not thinking about that information the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.520 
not thinking about that information the
thing<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.430> made<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.090> chapter<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:04.140> seeing
