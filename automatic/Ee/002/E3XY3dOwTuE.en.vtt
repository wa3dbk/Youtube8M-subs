00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello and welcome sharkoon 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.490
 is especially for cheap 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.550
 housing known 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.030
 Here, too, is the new growth CC 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.440
 no exception is a mini itx model 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.779
 So it's pretty compact, though 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.820
 designed also for players 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.050
 to satisfy and costs 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.050
 no 40 euros 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.030
 The cc is really barely bigger than that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.370
 typical shoe box comes from the format 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.640
 also very good because we have something here 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.640
 more depth than height and width have 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.489
 From the design here you can do this 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.549
 bevelled corner with the integrated 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.740
 power button even as a gamer loan 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.390
 otherwise it is actually 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.790
 relatively decent okay we have here 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.369
 nevertheless against the bevelled 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.740
 lettering but a closed front 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.810
 with a surface structure which is light 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.509
 it is practically aluminum 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.330
 but a plastic front of course 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.549
 price reasons the prices can be quite 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.560
 Good if you are here 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.150
 There are optical drive space ideas there 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.240
 actually here and he has too 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.450
 the standard format so no problems 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.409
 here just normal 5.25 inch drives 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.409
 to obstruct 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.079
 practically also that the euro commutes 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.610
 here the two usb 3.0 ports offers the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.509
 means he has to be so despite the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.009
 Price class no drawbacks 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.439
 yes I join the whole then again 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.600
 short here on the top there we see 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.659
 namely the heart of 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.630
 cooling system a pre-assembled 120 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.819
 millimeter fan a second 120 mm 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.710
 fan space is right next to the are 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.240
 still optional to equip 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:19.220
 otherwise we only have 1 80 mm 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.870
 fan space on the back wall and this 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.270
 Air intakes in both sides divide the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.900
 but not suitable for fans 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.970
 are each behind all air intakes 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.730
 this dust grid does not sound right 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.530
 dust filter that would be the coarsest 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.110
 catching dirt though is just 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.320
 not quite as fine as a real one 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.730
 textile dust filter solution den 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.410
 We can do interior work here on the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.700
 back already divine but wants 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.040
 I'll look at it right away 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.600
 housing itself we imagine what we are here 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.720
 In any case, ever see are the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.180
 side panels and the floor the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.710
 each held by rendel screws 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.630
 Simply be it says here 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.110
 we have to take apart now 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.420
 just once all pages removed synonymous 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.490
 The lid is also easy 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.880
 solve it and see it now 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.270
 The framework of the housing is yes 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.660
 principle from these steel struts the the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.400
 all the necessary solidity give it 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.420
 but of course, right 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.800
 stay lightweight components 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.450
 Construction can also be seen well 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.300
 before we turn to it 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.370
 a short look at the inside of one 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.130
 such sides partly there we still see 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.080
 times that these filters so this kita 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.600
 element was stuck here correctly 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.160
 with glue, therefore, does not adhere magnetically 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.650
 like similar solutions but 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.090
 simply stuck now does not have to 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.890
 be absolutely negative we can here 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.650
 simply the side panels or lids 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.720
 and soil so take and then 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.610
 to cleanse the vacuum cleaner 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.810
 or shake out the sink like 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.960
 but you can accept it 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.350
 otherwise mentioned we will see now 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.490
 nice here like all the hardware 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.260
 the mini itx is housed 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.710
 mainboard becomes easy here at the back 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.100
 filed expansion card is then yes 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.460
 in principle into this recess 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.480
 This can be at least a moderate 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.299
 longer reach something 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.049
 limited is that is one against the 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.639
 processor cooler height 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.250
 the processor cooler can be easy here 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.470
 up there has already been a 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.780
 a few inches of course, of course 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.629
 will louder customers on 15 centimeters 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.030
 limited and unfortunately many fall 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:38.479
 tower cool but let out here 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.759
 simply can not accommodate 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:46.710
 accommodate that, however, some 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:49.500
 drives I want something uneven 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.419
 say we have the opportunity first 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.419
 a mass storage so ssd or 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.370
 hard disk below here the optical 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.379
 to mount cage 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.750
 Of course we have the possibility too 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.639
 the optical cage just not for 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.909
 an optical drive to use but 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:09.300
 instead here in this drive 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.469
 adapter a hard drive or ssd 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.419
 accommodate 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:15.000
 and we can finally be here at the 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.949
 Rear wall a two and a half inch drive 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.629
 instead of the 80 millimeter fan 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.210
 to install 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:26.130
 a total of a maximum of three 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.110
 Mass storage possible if you are on the 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.310
 Rear fan and optical 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:35.580
 Drive should be omitted in the 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.080
 Most cases are sufficient but am 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.360
 certainly also for some users 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.319
 there is simply not enough for that 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.080
 in the other models 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:46.500
 the power supply then finds that way 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.930
 here in front of the mainboard square and 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.810
 below this drive cage can 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.840
 have optionally ATX or fx format 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.229
 and then will be here with this cable 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.810
 We will be connected 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.159
 for the test a sfx power supply use that 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.379
 kindly also from us 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:08.490
 shoes was provided 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:10.770
 that his storm sfx gold 1 500 watts 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.129
 power supply that should be typical 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:17.250
 mini it systems sufficient power 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:19.879
 deliver 80plus gold certified 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.250
 so also relatively efficient 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:25.770
 visually very chic and designed 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.870
 also fully modular that is straight 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.310
 of course with such a housing completely 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.860
 really helpful is only the 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.759
 cable strands must accommodate the we 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.880
 really need 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.420
 the rest will just be here 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.050
 housed in this bag and disturbs 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.050
 not anymore 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.090
 in total, sharkoon has the cc 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.420
 in fact a pretty attractive bundle 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.700
 laced on the one hand, of course, the 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.200
 attractive selling price to another 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.270
 but then also the possibility here 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.290
 actually a gaming system 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.510
 accommodate 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.900
 we have enough space for something 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.750
 longer graphics card we can also use one 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.340
 yes, something voluminous processor cooler 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.620
 although we are there of course 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.620
 really pay attention to the maximum height 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.390
 must and we have enough 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.550
 drive itself places the optical 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.940
 drive can be accommodated him 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.530
 So all in all a very attractive 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.420
 I also do that in a package 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.550
 I find quite appropriate optics 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.870
 the whole thing will be presented 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.870
 of course, equip with hardware and 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.370
 even more detailed testing the right one 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.300
 test it gives up soon 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.300
