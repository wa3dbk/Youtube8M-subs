sorta<00:03:32.989> in<00:03:33.200> your<00:03:33.319> face<00:03:33.500> record<00:03:33.829> this<00:03:33.950> one<00:03:34.099> seems

sorta in your face record this one seems

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.069 
sorta in your face record this one seems
more<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:35.060> kind<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.269> more<00:03:35.390> laid-back<00:03:35.599> and<00:03:35.989> this

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
more you kind of more laid-back and this

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.319 
more you kind of more laid-back and this
one<00:03:36.260> kind<00:03:36.409> of<00:03:36.500> kick<00:03:36.680> back<00:03:36.859> and<00:03:37.129> it's<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.120> bit<00:03:38.239> of

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
one kind of kick back and it's a bit of

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.089 
one kind of kick back and it's a bit of
a<00:03:38.390> mix<00:03:38.599> I<00:03:38.750> think<00:03:38.959> it's<00:03:39.079> probably<00:03:39.349> similar<00:03:39.980> in

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
a mix I think it's probably similar in

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.690 
a mix I think it's probably similar in
its<00:03:40.220> energy<00:03:40.640> from<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.840> front<00:03:42.109> gravity<00:03:42.560> I<00:03:43.190> know

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
its energy from the front gravity I know
