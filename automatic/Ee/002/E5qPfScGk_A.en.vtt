 January finally victory but a corner the iphone app is about 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.570
 now 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.999
 next to others wears 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:11.589
 because finally to break the finger 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.589
 If I had more, he would not be that way 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.419
 he wants to be able to recover success a bit 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.249
 so there comes directly call 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.619
 Water consumption Christoph g 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.480
 1 million waved through 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.849
 Bassendowski Euro Ayers Rock 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.999
 and 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.999
 Ipswitch looks like this 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.740
 is now 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.740
 I need that around the front finger 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.800
 around the hearth it is like this with me 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.790
 not quite Brody but as the Bully you stand with the old demand 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.550
 Finger in the middle of the calls 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.300
 here I stand in the evening so a little bit of poetic wine screws not on the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.630
 Electricity price and credit Olli not so good 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.410
 Make Aachen 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.520
 so and if we wanted to get on it can do really well for the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.190
 Of course in the middle the board is one too but during the 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.250
 Leap forward and then take the lead 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.650
 he has advised the Quadriga new nice cheap seems right 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.060
 in the beginning, if you have the 2 to 10 over 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.860
 and Sam 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.860
 the only thing he does is what is a fighter 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 so well off as your fingers could be sworn to join the eu 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.370
 everything could be like that 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.650
 and Peter Zschunke dpa 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.660
 Val d'isere misjudged that was about composure 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.770
 then there is a fighter 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.060
 Perfection and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.500

 in Munich a bit like a trauma start is made difficult that 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.430
