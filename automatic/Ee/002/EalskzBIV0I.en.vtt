00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.710
 hello I have a craving that I love you 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.080
 share 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.860
 it's about arepas de chÃ³colo I hope that 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.860
 like this recipe 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.950
 this is another variety of arepa that 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.950
 prepare in colombia 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.129
 the corn has to be tender and fresh 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.579
 starts opening the most hours 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.840
 then put the beans in the blender 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.840
 or processor and sugar is added 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.930
 when a homogeneous mass is already obtained 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.510
 is ready to start roasting 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.270
 you put a pan or griddle with 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.070
 Non-stick surface at medium heat and 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.600
 it gets a little bit of oil 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.030
 margarine in it when it's hot 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.560
 a portion of the dough is added and 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.979
 distributed over the surface of the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.979
 skillet 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.710
 past five minutes or when the 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.960
 surface is dry it is turned over 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.260
 to finish cooking on the other 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.260
 side 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.170
 the arepa de choco accompanies them with 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.170
 margarine and that is good profit 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.860
 Hello 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.050
