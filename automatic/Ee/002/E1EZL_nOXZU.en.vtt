this connected right absolutely rich and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.100 
this connected right absolutely rich and
it<00:02:44.310> will<00:02:44.460> just<00:02:44.640> use<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.000> built-in<00:02:45.330> microphone

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110

it will just use the built-in microphone
of<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.560> phone<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.820> case<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.270> can

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
of the phone and in that case you can

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.540 
of the phone and in that case you can
actually<00:02:48.600> improve<00:02:49.170> upon<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.560> because<00:02:50.130> you

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
actually improve upon that because you

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.580 
actually improve upon that because you
can<00:02:50.700> get<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.880> splitter<00:02:51.270> cable<00:02:51.510> now<00:02:52.170> you'll<00:02:52.410> note

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
can get a splitter cable now you'll note

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.970 
can get a splitter cable now you'll note
on<00:02:52.740> this<00:02:52.890> end<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.490> there<00:02:53.670> are<00:02:53.850> three<00:02:54.360> rings

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
on this end that there are three rings

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
a stereo connection on this other side

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.130 
a stereo connection on this other side
of<00:02:59.580> this<00:02:59.730> cable<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.420> specialty<00:03:00.810> cable

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
of this cable it's a specialty cable

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.290 
of this cable it's a specialty cable
this<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.410> not<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> y<00:03:02.070> splitter<00:03:02.460> so<00:03:02.790> your<00:03:02.940> kids<00:03:03.120> in

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
this is not a y splitter so your kids in

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.270 
this is not a y splitter so your kids in
the<00:03:03.390> backseat<00:03:03.570> could<00:03:04.320> share<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.740> same<00:03:04.890> iPad

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the backseat could share the same iPad

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.760 
the backseat could share the same iPad
this<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.910> actually<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.330> splitter<00:03:06.810> taking<00:03:07.470> it

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
this is actually a splitter taking it

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.770 
this is actually a splitter taking it
separate<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.580> one<00:03:08.850> side<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.360> only

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
separate so on one side is only

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.050 
separate so on one side is only
headphones<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:11.100> other<00:03:11.250> side<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.700> mic

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
headphones and the other side is mic

unique<00:03:55.500> thing<00:03:55.680> about<00:03:55.710> this<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.700> actual

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
unique thing about this is the actual

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.070 
unique thing about this is the actual
connector<00:03:57.360> itself<00:03:57.660> you're<00:03:57.930> good

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
connector itself you're good

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.050 
connector itself you're good
traditionally<00:03:58.740> see<00:03:58.920> lobs<00:03:59.190> with<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.970> know

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
quarter inch jack or something like that

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.810 
quarter inch jack or something like that
this<00:04:04.770> is<00:04:04.890> nice<00:04:05.040> because<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.490> this<00:04:05.610> eighth

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
this is nice because of this eighth

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.490 
this is nice because of this eighth
eighth<00:04:06.060> inch<00:04:06.360> jack<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:06.990> can<00:04:07.110> plug<00:04:07.290> into

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
eighth inch jack that you can plug into

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.790 
eighth inch jack that you can plug into
sort<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.070> consumer<00:04:08.760> level<00:04:09.360> devices<00:04:10.200> yeah<00:04:10.620> so

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
sort of consumer level devices yeah so

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.980 
sort of consumer level devices yeah so
this<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.160> essentially<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.760> decent<00:04:12.510> enough<00:04:12.690> Mike

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
this is essentially a decent enough Mike

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.540 
this is essentially a decent enough Mike
that<00:04:13.380> works<00:04:13.590> well<00:04:13.830> of<00:04:13.980> course<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.459> get

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
that works well of course you can get

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.280 
that works well of course you can get
adapter<00:04:15.060> as<00:04:15.120> an<00:04:15.270> XLR<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.810> mini<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.080> everything

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
adapter as an XLR to mini and everything

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.900 
adapter as an XLR to mini and everything
else<00:04:16.410> but<00:04:16.620> this<00:04:16.709> mic<00:04:16.980> doesn't<00:04:17.340> need<00:04:17.460> any<00:04:17.669> power

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
else but this mic doesn't need any power

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.700 
else but this mic doesn't need any power
so<00:04:18.540> it<00:04:18.630> works<00:04:18.840> well<00:04:19.049> with<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:19.260> device<00:04:19.500> so

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
so it works well with that device so

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.229 
so it works well with that device so
most<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.549> are<00:04:20.640> walking<00:04:20.820> around<00:04:21.030> with<00:04:21.210> a

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
most of you are walking around with a

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.790 
most of you are walking around with a
smartphone<00:04:21.540> or<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.780> tablet<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:22.260> can

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
smartphone or a tablet I can

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.800 
smartphone or a tablet I can
recommend<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.580> zoom<00:04:23.940> app<00:04:24.120> enough<00:04:24.419> even<00:04:24.750> if

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
recommend that zoom app enough even if

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.689 
recommend that zoom app enough even if
you<00:04:24.960> don't<00:04:25.199> have<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.800> zoom<00:04:26.009> hardware<00:04:26.460> device

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
you don't have the zoom hardware device

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.939 
you don't have the zoom hardware device
it's<00:04:27.270> still<00:04:27.659> incredibly<00:04:27.960> useful<00:04:28.319> but<00:04:28.620> i<00:04:28.650> would

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
it's still incredibly useful but i would

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.759 
it's still incredibly useful but i would
add<00:04:29.159> this<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.490> your<00:04:29.580> back
