so<00:01:44.930> you<00:01:44.990> can<00:01:45.170> see<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:46.960> very<00:01:47.960> defined<00:01:48.380> curls

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
so you can see the very defined curls

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.250 
so you can see the very defined curls
and<00:01:49.880> then<00:01:50.330> when<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.570> do<00:01:50.690> your<00:01:50.840> whole<00:01:50.990> head

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
and then when you do your whole head

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.300 
and then when you do your whole head
you'll<00:01:51.530> have<00:01:51.650> something<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:52.070> looks<00:01:52.250> like

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
you'll have something that looks like

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.800 
you'll have something that looks like
this<00:01:52.580> which<00:01:52.880> kind<00:01:53.120> of<00:01:53.300> reminds<00:01:53.690> me<00:01:53.750> of

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
this which kind of reminds me of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.450 
this which kind of reminds me of
spaghetti<00:01:54.230> and<00:01:54.590> it's<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.860> little<00:01:55.070> bit<00:01:55.160> scary

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
spaghetti and it's a little bit scary

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.580 
spaghetti and it's a little bit scary
but<00:01:56.330> then<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:56.660> just<00:01:56.870> want<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.110> spray<00:01:57.260> on<00:01:57.380> some

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
but then you just want to spray on some

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.260 
but then you just want to spray on some
hairspray<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:58.190> help<00:01:58.370> them<00:01:58.610> hold<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.150> then

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
hairspray to help them hold and then

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.300 
hairspray to help them hold and then
leave<00:01:59.450> them<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.780> cool<00:01:59.810> it's<00:02:00.530> really<00:02:00.590> important

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
leave them to cool it's really important

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.180 
leave them to cool it's really important
that<00:02:01.370> the<00:02:01.550> cool<00:02:01.760> before<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.240> brush<00:02:02.390> them<00:02:02.600> out

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
that the cool before you brush them out

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.830 
that the cool before you brush them out
so<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.280> can<00:02:04.400> use<00:02:04.550> any<00:02:04.580> kind<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:05.120> brush<00:02:05.390> but

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
so you can use any kind of brush but

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.290 
so you can use any kind of brush but
then<00:02:06.560> spa<00:02:07.370> bristle<00:02:07.820> ones<00:02:08.000> are<00:02:08.180> probably

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
then spa bristle ones are probably

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.120 
then spa bristle ones are probably
better<00:02:08.690> than<00:02:09.020> those<00:02:09.170> hangul<00:02:09.560> teased<00:02:09.770> them

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
better than those hangul teased them

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.640 
better than those hangul teased them
like<00:02:10.460> what<00:02:10.640> I'm<00:02:10.729> using<00:02:10.940> here<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.960> it<00:02:12.500> does

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
like what I'm using here and it does

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.950 
like what I'm using here and it does
break<00:02:12.860> them<00:02:13.040> off<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.420> makes<00:02:14.600> them<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.840> bit

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
break them off and it makes them a bit

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.590 
break them off and it makes them a bit
looser<00:02:15.380> but<00:02:16.220> then<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.460> just<00:02:16.490> need<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.970> put

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
looser but then you just need to put

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.870 
looser but then you just need to put
some<00:02:17.630> Sarah<00:02:18.050> my<00:02:18.380> smile<00:02:18.860> through<00:02:19.160> I'm<00:02:19.820> just

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
some Sarah my smile through I'm just

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.150 
some Sarah my smile through I'm just
using<00:02:20.270> some<00:02:20.450> macadamia<00:02:21.320> oil<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.950> need<00:02:22.070> to

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
using some macadamia oil you need to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.560 
using some macadamia oil you need to
really<00:02:22.400> rub<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.670> into<00:02:22.790> your<00:02:22.910> hands<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.390> work

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
really rub it into your hands and work

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.640 
really rub it into your hands and work
from<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.930> bottom<00:02:24.110> out<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.660> disperse<00:02:27.410> it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
from the bottom out just to disperse it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.950 
from the bottom out just to disperse it
through<00:02:27.800> your<00:02:27.950> hair<00:02:28.660> you'll<00:02:29.660> have<00:02:29.780> something

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
through your hair you'll have something

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.340 
through your hair you'll have something
that<00:02:30.170> looks<00:02:30.350> like<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:32.960> could<00:02:33.110> stop

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
that looks like this so you could stop

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.410 
that looks like this so you could stop
here<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.770> looks<00:02:33.920> really<00:02:34.190> pretty<00:02:34.220> it's<00:02:35.180> still

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
here it looks really pretty it's still

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.240 
here it looks really pretty it's still
fairly<00:02:35.690> defined<00:02:36.170> where<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:36.920> if<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.100> want

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
fairly defined where you so if you want

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.740 
fairly defined where you so if you want
to<00:02:37.310> loosen<00:02:37.700> them<00:02:37.760> up<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:37.940> bit<00:02:38.060> more<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.600> can

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
to loosen them up a bit more you can

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.260 
to loosen them up a bit more you can
take<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.280> denser<00:02:40.280> brush<00:02:40.490> like<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:41.030> back

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
take a denser brush like this back

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.480 
take a denser brush like this back
combing<00:02:41.510> little<00:02:42.260> brush<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.800> then<00:02:42.980> brush

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
combing little brush and then brush

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.220

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
through and you can see it's making them

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.190 
through and you can see it's making them
into<00:02:45.530> more<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:45.980> like<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.160> Hollywood<00:02:46.790> wave<00:02:47.200> so

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200
