some balls here's a good idea for you

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.169 
some balls here's a good idea for you
every<00:00:27.170> shot<00:00:27.500> should<00:00:27.859> have<00:00:28.070> a<00:00:28.099> start<00:00:28.550> line<00:00:28.789> and

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
every shot should have a start line and

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.820 
every shot should have a start line and
a<00:00:29.240> finish<00:00:29.570> line<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.050> if<00:00:30.140> I'm<00:00:30.259> trying<00:00:30.439> to<00:00:30.589> draw

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
a finish line so if I'm trying to draw

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.439 
a finish line so if I'm trying to draw
the<00:00:30.890> ball<00:00:31.279> I<00:00:31.310> want<00:00:31.550> my<00:00:31.640> ball<00:00:31.849> starting<00:00:32.269> to<00:00:32.360> the

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
the ball I want my ball starting to the

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.420 
the ball I want my ball starting to the
right<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:32.870> that<00:00:32.989> it<00:00:33.080> can<00:00:33.199> draw<00:00:33.470> into<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.160> flag

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
right so that it can draw into the flag

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.819 
right so that it can draw into the flag
now<00:00:35.059> obviously<00:00:35.510> if<00:00:35.660> I'm<00:00:35.839> fading<00:00:36.290> it<00:00:36.410> it<00:00:36.530> go<00:00:36.650> the

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
now obviously if I'm fading it it go the

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.220 
now obviously if I'm fading it it go the
other<00:00:36.949> way<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.250> fade<00:00:37.670> into<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.059> flag<00:00:38.360> so<00:00:39.079> what

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
other way and fade into the flag so what

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.770 
other way and fade into the flag so what
you<00:00:39.379> do<00:00:39.589> is<00:00:39.860> you<00:00:40.430> take<00:00:40.640> a<00:00:40.699> ball<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:41.480> set<00:00:41.750> a

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
ball either on a tee or you can hit them

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.189 
ball either on a tee or you can hit them
off<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:43.910> ground<00:00:44.180> kind<00:00:44.539> of<00:00:44.719> in<00:00:44.809> a<00:00:44.899> straight

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
look here I put a pole out in line with

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.180 
look here I put a pole out in line with
the<00:00:52.460> ball<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.030> in<00:00:53.120> line<00:00:53.390> with<00:00:53.629> my<00:00:53.840> target<00:00:54.410> okay

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
the ball and in line with my target okay

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.580 
the ball and in line with my target okay
so<00:00:55.250> when<00:00:56.120> I<00:00:56.149> come<00:00:56.449> over<00:00:56.570> here<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:57.019> address<00:00:57.379> the

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
so when I come over here to address the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.349 
so when I come over here to address the
ball<00:00:57.769> and<00:00:58.070> now<00:00:58.250> I<00:00:58.280> look<00:00:58.670> at<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:58.940> pole<00:00:59.149> it

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
ball and now I look at the pole it

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.970 
ball and now I look at the pole it
actually<00:00:59.719> looks<00:00:59.929> like<00:01:00.019> the<00:01:00.260> pole<00:01:00.500> has<00:01:00.679> shifted

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
actually looks like the pole has shifted

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.759 
actually looks like the pole has shifted
some<00:01:01.460> 10<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.210> 15<00:01:02.660> yards<00:01:03.079> to<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.260> right<00:01:03.500> it's

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
some 10 to 15 yards to the right it's

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.639 
some 10 to 15 yards to the right it's
amazing<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.550> perception<00:01:05.269> of<00:01:05.360> where<00:01:06.020> my<00:01:06.259> start

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
amazing the perception of where my start

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.340 
amazing the perception of where my start
line<00:01:06.920> needs<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.369> be<00:01:07.820> relative<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.780> that<00:01:09.050> pole

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
line needs to be relative to that pole

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.469 
line needs to be relative to that pole
based<00:01:09.710> on<00:01:09.920> where<00:01:10.130> I'm<00:01:10.250> standing<00:01:10.550> and<00:01:11.270> what<00:01:11.450> I

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
based on where I'm standing and what I

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.120 
based on where I'm standing and what I
want<00:01:11.690> you<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.840> think<00:01:12.140> about<00:01:12.410> today<00:01:12.860> I'm

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
want you to think about today I'm

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.339

hitting a draw so if you want to think

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:17.169 
hitting a draw so if you want to think
of<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.590> right<00:01:15.619> side<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.429> pole<00:01:16.700> as<00:01:16.940> being

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.870 
confident on your shots as opposed to
missing<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.170> left<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:36.649> right<00:01:36.739> so<00:01:37.610> what<00:01:37.729> our

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
missing a left and right so what our

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.199 
missing a left and right so what our
idea<00:01:38.599> is<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.530> make<00:01:39.770> swing<00:01:40.310> started<00:01:40.940> in<00:01:41.090> the

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
idea is is to make swing started in the

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.540 
idea is is to make swing started in the
green<00:01:41.479> zone<00:01:41.869> every<00:01:42.259> time<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:42.830> then<00:01:43.340> all

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
green zone every time and then all

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.339 
green zone every time and then all
you've<00:01:43.729> got<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.060> do<00:01:44.179> is<00:01:44.300> control<00:01:44.660> how<00:01:44.959> much<00:01:45.140> it

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
you've got to do is control how much it

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:46.900 
you've got to do is control how much it
draws<00:01:45.590> whether<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.099> hang<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.489> to<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.700> right

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
draws whether you hang it to the right

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.550 
draws whether you hang it to the right
or<00:01:47.119> draw<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.479> back<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:47.929> really<00:01:48.289> only<00:01:48.440> have

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
or draw it back so you really only have

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.359 
or draw it back so you really only have
one<00:01:48.709> variable<00:01:49.429> so<00:01:50.270> as<00:01:50.390> I<00:01:50.539> set<00:01:50.840> up<00:01:50.950> now<00:01:51.950> I<00:01:51.979> look

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
one variable so as I set up now I look

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.070 
one variable so as I set up now I look
out<00:01:52.550> towards<00:01:52.940> my<00:01:53.090> start<00:01:53.450> line<00:01:53.629> I'm<00:01:53.899> going<00:01:53.989> to

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
out towards my start line I'm going to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.660 
out towards my start line I'm going to
look<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.349> the<00:01:54.379> right<00:01:54.649> of<00:01:54.830> that<00:01:55.009> I'm<00:01:55.340> going<00:01:55.640> to

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
look to the right of that I'm going to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.880 
look to the right of that I'm going to
hit<00:01:55.819> my<00:01:56.000> shot<00:01:58.539> and<00:01:59.539> now<00:01:59.929> I<00:01:59.989> can<00:02:00.289> see<00:02:00.560> what<00:02:00.830> my

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
hit my shot and now I can see what my

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.639 
hit my shot and now I can see what my
ball<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:01.429> doing<00:02:01.759> relative<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.539> pole<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.200> if

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
ball is doing relative to the pole so if

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.139 
ball is doing relative to the pole so if
I<00:02:03.830> can<00:02:03.950> get<00:02:04.039> every<00:02:04.310> ball<00:02:04.520> starting<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.030> the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
I can get every ball starting to the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.880 
I can get every ball starting to the
right<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.569> only<00:02:05.810> thing<00:02:06.050> left<00:02:06.259> is<00:02:06.530> how<00:02:06.679> much

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
right the only thing left is how much

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.729 
right the only thing left is how much
does<00:02:07.129> it<00:02:07.160> curve<00:02:07.520> back<00:02:07.879> so<00:02:08.330> think<00:02:08.989> in<00:02:09.170> terms<00:02:09.470> of

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
does it curve back so think in terms of

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.710 
does it curve back so think in terms of
that<00:02:09.860> start<00:02:10.280> line<00:02:10.489> and<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:10.910> finish<00:02:11.239> line<00:02:11.450> and

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
that start line and that finish line and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.010 
that start line and that finish line and
you're<00:02:12.170> going<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.319> be<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> lot<00:02:12.709> more<00:02:12.950> consistent

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.080
