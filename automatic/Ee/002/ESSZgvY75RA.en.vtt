files<00:02:20.690> copying<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:22.879> case<00:02:23.090> there's<00:02:23.360> not<00:02:23.420> a

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
files copying in this case there's not a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.479 
files copying in this case there's not a
lot<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:23.810> files<00:02:24.110> because<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.069> just<00:02:25.099> an

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
lot of files because this is just an

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.000 
lot of files because this is just an
example<00:02:26.080> but<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.410> may<00:02:27.620> take<00:02:27.650> an

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
example but it may take an

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.619 
example but it may take an
extraordinarily<00:02:28.370> long<00:02:28.879> time<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.299> read<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
extraordinarily long time to read the

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.039 
extraordinarily long time to read the
files<00:02:29.870> because<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.650> data<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.810> drive

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
files because the data is on the drive

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.350 
files because the data is on the drive
that<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.379> failing<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.860> dying<00:02:34.129> but<00:02:34.760> anything

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
that is failing and dying but anything

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.199 
that is failing and dying but anything
you<00:02:35.390> can<00:02:35.599> get<00:02:35.720> off<00:02:35.900> with<00:02:36.110> this<00:02:36.260> method<00:02:36.470> is

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
you can get off with this method is

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.050 
you can get off with this method is
basically<00:02:38.209> stuff<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.629> can<00:02:38.780> save<00:02:39.129> so<00:02:40.129> you<00:02:40.880> just

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
basically stuff you can save so you just

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.610 
basically stuff you can save so you just
let<00:02:41.269> it<00:02:41.299> copy<00:02:41.630> it's<00:02:41.989> got<00:02:42.140> sixty<00:02:42.500> eight

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
let it copy it's got sixty eight

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.589 
let it copy it's got sixty eight
megabytes<00:02:42.950> he<00:02:43.280> notice<00:02:43.579> it's<00:02:43.730> copying<00:02:44.150> like

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.080 

43k<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.630> second<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.340> that's<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.700> really<00:02:49.970> unusual

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
43k a second and that's a really unusual

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.330 
43k a second and that's a really unusual
a<00:02:50.510> little<00:02:50.810> number<00:02:51.079> normally<00:02:51.500> that's<00:02:51.680> 800<00:02:53.290> to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
a little number normally that's 800 to

USB<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:59.829> says<00:03:00.829> it's<00:03:00.950> going<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:01.160> take<00:03:01.280> 40

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
USB so says it's going to take 40

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.580 
USB so says it's going to take 40
minutes<00:03:01.879> you<00:03:02.420> just<00:03:02.629> pause<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.870> let<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.319> finish

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
minutes you just pause it let it finish

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.920 
minutes you just pause it let it finish
and<00:03:03.920> when<00:03:04.040> you're<00:03:04.190> done<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.760> go<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.629> John

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
and when you're done you go to John

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.650 
and when you're done you go to John
stuff<00:03:06.319> you<00:03:06.500> can<00:03:06.650> see<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.730> stuff<00:03:08.030> on<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.239> next

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
stuff you can see the stuff on the next

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.900 
stuff you can see the stuff on the next
door<00:03:08.810> that's<00:03:09.500> John<00:03:09.920> stuff<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.579> what<00:03:10.760> it's

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
door that's John stuff this is what it's

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.590 
door that's John stuff this is what it's
copied<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:11.599> far<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:13.250> that's<00:03:14.030> how<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.329> rescue

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
copied so far so that's how to rescue

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.889 
copied so far so that's how to rescue
