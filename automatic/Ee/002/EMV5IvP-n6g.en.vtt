 The Rattlesnake Comes Out The Stomach Comes Out 

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:26.500

 It was eaten as soon as it was eaten by rattlesnake 

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:33.500
 A poison called love is turning around

 A long time until the longing snake strawberry Con! Con! Con! 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.600
 It was a serpent to hear "Can you meet again?" 

00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:07.400
 "Goodbye tears are serpent!" Serpent's path is serpent (Serpent's path is like snake!) 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.000
