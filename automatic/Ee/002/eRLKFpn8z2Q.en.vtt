okay so in an effort to be more green
we're<00:00:03.720> gonna<00:00:03.840> check<00:00:03.990> out<00:00:04.110> some<00:00:04.140> LED

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
we're gonna check out some LED

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.550 
we're gonna check out some LED
alternatives<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.879> this<00:00:06.060> standard<00:00:06.569> 35<00:00:07.230> watt

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
alternatives to this standard 35 watt

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.950 
alternatives to this standard 35 watt
halogen<00:00:08.010> light<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:09.360> we're<00:00:09.570> gonna<00:00:09.660> be<00:00:09.750> looking

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
halogen light and we're gonna be looking

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.540 
halogen light and we're gonna be looking
at<00:00:10.050> all<00:00:10.290> IKEA<00:00:10.650> stuff<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> standard

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
at all IKEA stuff so this is a standard

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
lights which is the GU 10 prongs this is

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.630 
lights which is the GU 10 prongs this is
35<00:00:17.400> watt<00:00:17.640> halogen<00:00:18.020> now<00:00:19.020> originally<00:00:19.400> IKEA<00:00:20.400> had

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
35 watt halogen now originally IKEA had

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.109 
35 watt halogen now originally IKEA had
the<00:00:20.939> LED<00:00:21.449> air<00:00:21.600> which<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.109> which<00:00:23.119> consumes

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the LED air which is this which consumes

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.990 
the LED air which is this which consumes
4<00:00:24.449> watts<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.890> actually<00:00:26.340> kind<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.640> liked<00:00:26.849> it

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
4 watts and I actually kind of liked it

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.429 
4 watts and I actually kind of liked it
pretty<00:00:27.119> good<00:00:27.240> alternative<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> 35<00:00:28.320> watt

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
pretty good alternative to the 35 watt

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.500 
pretty good alternative to the 35 watt
halogen<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> main<00:00:29.820> issue<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.390> it

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
halogen but the main issue is that it

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.389 
halogen but the main issue is that it
takes<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.750> full<00:00:31.080> second<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> turn<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.250> not

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
takes a full second to turn on so not

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.520 
takes a full second to turn on so not
good<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.910> kitchen<00:00:33.239> area<00:00:33.719> which<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.380> what

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
good in the kitchen area which is what

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.479 
good in the kitchen area which is what
I'm<00:00:34.620> looking<00:00:34.649> at<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.570> replace<00:00:36.570> those<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.079> today

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
I'm looking at to replace those in today

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.160 
I'm looking at to replace those in today
but<00:00:38.489> they<00:00:38.760> apparently<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.540> recently<00:00:39.960> came

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
but they apparently just recently came

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.080 
but they apparently just recently came
out<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> new<00:00:40.559> version<00:00:40.739> still<00:00:41.489> called<00:00:41.700> LED

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
out with a new version still called LED

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.690 
out with a new version still called LED
air<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:43.010> looks<00:00:44.010> completely

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
air but as you can see looks completely

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.920 
air but as you can see looks completely
different<00:00:44.820> feels<00:00:45.510> completely<00:00:45.840> different

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
different feels completely different

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.260 
different feels completely different
feels<00:00:46.320> very<00:00:46.559> nice<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.010> solid<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.120> got

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
feels very nice and solid and it's got

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.500 
feels very nice and solid and it's got
two<00:00:48.840> big<00:00:49.440> elements<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:49.980> there<00:00:50.129> versus<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> one

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
two big elements in there versus the one

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.760 
two big elements in there versus the one
in<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:51.930> although<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.320> there<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.590> see

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
in there although and there you can see

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
in there although and there you can see
there's<00:00:52.920> actually<00:00:52.980> four<00:00:53.430> elements<00:00:53.969> we're

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
there's actually four elements we're

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.510 
there's actually four elements we're
probably<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:54.899> Crees<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.980> anyways<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.460> was

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
probably all Crees but anyways this was

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.700 
probably all Crees but anyways this was
claimed<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.180> 4<00:00:57.510> watt<00:00:57.690> consume<00:00:58.230> egde<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
claimed to be 4 watt consume egde and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.279 
claimed to be 4 watt consume egde and
these<00:00:59.489> guys<00:00:59.670> are<00:00:59.699> claimed<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.239> 3.8<00:01:00.840> watkins

these guys are claimed to be 3.8 watkins
imaged<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> somewhere<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.000> below<00:01:03.300> 200

lumens<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:05.100> always<00:01:05.489> find<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.820> those

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
lumens but I always find that those

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.340 
lumens but I always find that those
ratings<00:01:06.360> seem<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.630> inaccurate<00:01:06.990> for

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
ratings seem to be inaccurate for

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.870 
ratings seem to be inaccurate for
whatever<00:01:07.500> reason<00:01:07.890> plus<00:01:08.400> also<00:01:08.729> there's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
whatever reason plus also there's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.050 
whatever reason plus also there's
obviously<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.240> difference<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.580> spread

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
obviously a difference in the the spread

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.730 
obviously a difference in the the spread
these<00:01:12.330> are<00:01:12.510> somewhere<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> high<00:01:13.170> 30s<00:01:13.200> I

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
these are somewhere in the high 30s I

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.530 
these are somewhere in the high 30s I
think<00:01:14.010> I'm<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.610> sure<00:01:14.820> what<00:01:14.939> these<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.330> but

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
think I'm not sure what these are but

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.289 
think I'm not sure what these are but
spread<00:01:16.080> aside<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.220> want<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:17.939> these

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
spread aside I just want to see if these

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.050 
spread aside I just want to see if these
guys<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> proper<00:01:19.530> replacement<00:01:20.520> for
