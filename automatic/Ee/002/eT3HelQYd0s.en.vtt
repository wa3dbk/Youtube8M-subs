00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.870
 Welcome to another video lesson from 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.269
 photoshop 6 and today it continues to 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.580
 teaching is one of the classics of photoshop 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.590
 which is how to change the color of the eyes 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.210
 This is an extra class I 'm going to do. 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.340
 during the week in the most 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.740
 simple but they are that they are very much 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.630
 requests until now many new people have 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.430
 entered the channel so I'll make the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.109
 older but simpler effects like 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.390
 extra, it 's obvious that we will have a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.520
 class is most advanced during the week 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.380
 but I'm going to do these extra lessons 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.030
 during the week are these things more 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.530
 simple and this is the first 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.190
 we will learn how to change the color of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.079
 eyes he does not know as cruel as 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.489
 curiosities down here already knew 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.020
 make an effect just so we can have an idea 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.239
 of the people who are watching and who do not 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.820
 Did you know that? 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.379
 image here of a model of 18 thousand a 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.510
 image of a resolution then the eyes 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.850
 So, what are we going to do then? 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.590
 there are millions of ways to make made 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.449
 I'll be here I think it's simpler 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.439
 easier to hear here in the tool 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.060
 steel and I will go around and around the eye 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.250
 model does not have to be perfect is 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.170
 selecting more or less so 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.600
 shift to add this 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.010
 Marzinho there in our steel that is for us 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.080
 add some selection stuff and 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.850
 select the other eye 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.400
 after both eyes will be 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.200
 selected to plague against oj that 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.970
 People will separate their eyes from the rest of the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.439
 image ok let's picture mate adjustments 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.350
 saturation 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.869
 let's check the box coloring serve 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.030
 thing has already changed color and we will look for 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.460
 here today is box I'll have an eye 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.259
 green 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.060
 look more or less the green you 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.070
 want and find this change because you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.350
 also want is something like this ok 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.700
 did not stay legal because the part 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.259
 of her eye stayed here in 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 Eyebrow also turned green. 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.189
 got a lot of stuff but when 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.680
 I should have wanted to do that 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.799
 tool rubber continue low well 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.670
 gentle more or less aquino or whatever 40 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.590
 are 40 good let's get close enough and 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.200
 carefully we will begin to remove the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.640
 part that is not in her eye and see 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.830
 extra jack 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.900
 we do not need to run around with 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.100
 Care is going to shoot to get the maximum 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.900
 perfect you get if you 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.300
 you have a control error and you are already 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.340
 I'll try to do the same again. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.720
 closer to the perfect and I got 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.180
 her distiller and we'll repeat 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.650
 exactly the same process 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.989
 on the other side of her eye was also 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:48.239
 Good man here in this one that did not stay 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:51.090
 cool and we'll also remove this part 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.730
 extra green that did not stay and again 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.440
 You can use any body you 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.500

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.630

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.480
 this effect here I am here because 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.190
 There is a place that I missed. 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.980
 can look a lot to return to the polls 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.630
 to vote for red purple from there 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.070
