Trinity I'm going to be using the mod
and<00:00:14.570> room<00:00:15.570> reverbs<00:00:16.260> when<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.070> led<00:00:17.550> is

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
and room reverbs when just that led is

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.400 
and room reverbs when just that led is
lit<00:00:17.699> when<00:00:18.330> they<00:00:18.480> are<00:00:18.570> both<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:19.020> I'm<00:00:19.289> actually

and now the TC electronic a big room
with<00:01:11.240> view<00:01:11.630> toneprints

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.109 

and<00:01:30.020> now<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:30.409> will<00:01:30.770> switch<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:31.039> the<00:01:31.369> shimmer

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
and now we will switch to the shimmer

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:43.850 
and now we will switch to the shimmer
mode

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.380

and<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:52.380> switch<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.950> e1<00:01:53.630> position<00:01:54.630> on

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and we will switch to the e1 position on

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:09.510 
and we will switch to the e1 position on
the<00:01:55.140> Trinity

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.650 

that<00:02:10.520> seemed<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:10.880> have<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.030> bit<00:02:11.209> of<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.360> short

that seemed to have a bit of a short

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:21.430 
that seemed to have a bit of a short
decay<00:02:12.140> so<00:02:12.200> we'll<00:02:12.560> turn<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:12.830> 2k<00:02:13.010> up<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.400> little
