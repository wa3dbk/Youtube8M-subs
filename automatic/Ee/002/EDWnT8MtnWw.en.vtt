00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
it too small so that's the other side of

it too small so that's the other side of
that<00:03:18.889> and<00:03:20.139> then<00:03:21.139> this<00:03:21.350> I<00:03:21.709> actually<00:03:22.959> it<00:03:23.959> was<00:03:24.109> on

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
that and then this I actually it was on

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.039 
that and then this I actually it was on
a<00:03:24.290> sticky<00:03:24.739> note<00:03:24.829> pad<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:25.819> had<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.810> just

took it off and glued it to the back of
this<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:30.069> think<00:03:31.069> I<00:03:31.280> use<00:03:31.400> glue<00:03:31.639> dots<00:03:31.970> cuz<00:03:32.239> they

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.190 
this I think I use glue dots cuz they
hold<00:03:32.600> very<00:03:32.870> well<00:03:33.109> unless<00:03:34.069> you<00:03:34.970> just<00:03:35.200> there's
