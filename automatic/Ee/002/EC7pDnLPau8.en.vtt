00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:46.010
 this rise is really it was french fries 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:50.030
 she comes from the mattress is rest she 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.390
 was here and the etchings and an engraving 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.390
 by note 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.730
 it's not that we blew that moves 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:06.280
 it's a usual habit we work 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.280
 with the side by side to the organic bone 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.830
 when we stick mostly happy that we 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.330
 in the skin is better is a 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.280
 natural product that come into play 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.610
 very well with our natural products 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.610
 like the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.130
 not much room 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.289
 at 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:36.520
 there are people who go to fitness wii 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:40.060
 name does not need 70 a valve 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.729
 if the pedal wah it goes through the stock market 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.039
 is leather in good that must be 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.289
 changed will not have what is broken there 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.289
 we sell a ba yes it is torn 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500
 at 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.270
 a screed that holds the corner pipes 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.660
 it's the symbol each note is composed 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.350
 of six trios next to each one of the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.620
 mixture there are whistles the larigot the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.220
 nazar the doublet fight or four for 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:42.880
 the angels the trumpet the bugle and the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:45.670
 human voice and outside with a 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.880
 rag with alcohol travel and one 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.940
 also spend a little one a little close 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.290
 of a pipe to enter the 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.140
 big pipes from a little huillo 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.019
 mixture that is damaged so it is 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:05.850
 crushed on the left 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:10.260
 the solution we pass on a form 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.260
 like this one where a little bigger 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.189
 and we press from inside 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.620
 tap lightly to remove the bump 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:31.579
 like city â€‹â€‹metal to be dulled from the pond 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.799
 is moreover very old pipes 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.930
 embassies and baltringues but 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.700
 what hypocrisy when the host origins 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:45.450
 their eyes the leading role of jeans 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:48.989
 baptist be the feature in the eighteenth century 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.939
 in 1950 two jugal ehpad but it's not 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.000
 tradition French better than me 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:56.579
 but there is the way to make organic 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.769
 mouths good for someone who has 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.939
 the habit of old material 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.340
 still strong son and 18th or 19th 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:08.010
 on the patches how to treat then 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.530
 the structures do by valve train they 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.849
 are different from those of Calvary 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.760
 we see that they are made by small 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.079
 19th century tips the welds are made 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:23.729
 in one stroke they did not have the same 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:25.570
 interesting tools to see a big in 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.400
 dignity 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.280
 with the different floors since 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.980
 positive up to and if will see is 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.540
 a machine is considerable and above all 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.700
 so how do you see there the draw of the 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.850
 game that talks about the console has to shoot 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.230
 a register relatively easily and 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.380
 see here for example 6 crew 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.000
 counterweight here it is, which means nothing 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.360
 register account pulls a player 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.480
 in the console if a counterweight for 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.810
 offset the weight of the part in 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.430
 wood that goes down down on me 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.410
 it's the whole climb like this until 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.930
 third floor with some 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.510
 flexibility a certain accuracy and without 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:14.470
 that the weight of all the mechanism their 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:17.350
 put the game back in its place this is the 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.480
 blown from the god of the narrative the story that eva 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.480
 behind locked in a box 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:36.860
 each form of pipes in a color 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.400
 in the sense if we change the form is surprised 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.400
 another meaning 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:07.739
 and also it was more affordable sometimes 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:11.619
 because there we are stuck on the skin 

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:13.889
 but no I bombard you cease to the 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:13.889
 pedal 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.410
 the 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:39.940
 here we see so blow the pedal where he 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:47.920
 must put a sleeve for nine and 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:50.350
 So you do not know what it looks like the 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.120
 last the surface a ticket on 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:57.520
 recognizes after ammonia labels 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.970
 and alcohol to burn a mixture that are 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:05.380
 very good and that makes you oxidation and 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:09.100
 the poly with you intend to lille the 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:13.050
 link between the key and what is 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:18.450
 then after the rollers he squares them 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.450
 and up to the valve like new 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.970
 the shine that says it only starts 

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:51.790
 the second time and there is a keyboard 

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:53.470
 on the water so that we will also pass 

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.530
 mechanics in 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.870
 montfaucon in the gambling task by 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.520
 keys and that's why we can not 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.170
 beautiful at all after no longer accepts between 

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.560
 the showers palm with the with the 

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.560
 mechanical 

00:08:08.609 --> 00:08:15.230
 every rod of the pond was in a bar 

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.120
 ammonia and alcohol to burn to remove 

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.660
 oxidation what was all black or 

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.660
 even to
