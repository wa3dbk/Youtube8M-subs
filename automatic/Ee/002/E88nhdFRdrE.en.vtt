possibility<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:49.970> knowing<00:03:50.540> how<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.780> load

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
possibility to knowing how to load

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.070 
possibility to knowing how to load
properly<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.700> calories<00:03:53.209> during<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.840> meals

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
properly the calories during the meals

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.160 
properly the calories during the meals
why<00:03:55.070> would<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.340> calories<00:03:55.820> so<00:03:56.030> do<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.810> do

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
why would the calories so do you do

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.560 
why would the calories so do you do
counter<00:03:57.650> measure<00:03:57.830> going<00:03:58.340> into<00:03:58.910> complicated

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
counter measure going into complicated

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.870 
counter measure going into complicated
well<00:04:00.140> in<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.320> beginning<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.800> used<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:01.280> but<00:04:01.790> I

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
well in the beginning I used to but I

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.340 
well in the beginning I used to but I
think<00:04:01.910> so<00:04:02.330> I've<00:04:02.450> had<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.630> rough<00:04:02.810> idea<00:04:02.989> of<00:04:03.170> what<00:04:03.290> I

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
think so I've had a rough idea of what I

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.830 
think so I've had a rough idea of what I
could<00:04:03.590> eat<00:04:03.709> and<00:04:03.950> what<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:04.310> couldn't<00:04:04.519> eat<00:04:04.700> so<00:04:05.030> you

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
could eat and what I couldn't eat so you

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.150 
could eat and what I couldn't eat so you
have<00:04:05.959> to<00:04:06.080> like<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:06.470> know<00:04:06.500> it's<00:04:06.860> going<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.010> come

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
have to like you know it's going to come

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.050 
have to like you know it's going to come
down<00:04:07.280> though<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.610> know<00:04:07.760> when<00:04:07.880> you're<00:04:07.970> getting

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
down though you know when you're getting

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.030 
down though you know when you're getting
dieting<00:04:08.810> down<00:04:08.959> calories<00:04:09.530> in<00:04:09.680> versus<00:04:10.010> calories

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
dieting down calories in versus calories

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.920 
dieting down calories in versus calories
out<00:04:10.580> how<00:04:10.760> much<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:11.090> compared<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.510> how<00:04:11.600> much<00:04:11.720> it

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
out how much you compared to how much it

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.960 
out how much you compared to how much it
burns<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:12.500> everyone's<00:04:13.310> body's<00:04:13.670> going<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.850> be

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
burns so everyone's body's going to be

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.190 
burns so everyone's body's going to be
different<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:14.299> you<00:04:14.390> need<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.630> find<00:04:14.810> what<00:04:15.049> works

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
different so you need to find what works

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.140 
different so you need to find what works
for<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:15.560> so<00:04:15.620> in<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.549> beginning<00:04:16.700> I<00:04:16.970> probably

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
for you so in the beginning I probably

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.039 
for you so in the beginning I probably
would<00:04:17.359> you<00:04:17.510> know<00:04:17.600> if<00:04:17.720> you're<00:04:17.810> going<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.019> eat

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.570 
would you know if you're going to eat
chicken<00:04:18.290> breasts<00:04:18.709> and<00:04:18.769> rice<00:04:19.010> in<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:19.280> count

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
chicken breasts and rice in that count

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.759 
chicken breasts and rice in that count
the<00:04:19.729> calories<00:04:19.940> in<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.630> see<00:04:21.229> where<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.650> are

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
the calories in it and see where you are

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.960 
the calories in it and see where you are
the<00:04:21.979> next<00:04:22.160> time<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.460> do<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.610> you'll<00:04:22.760> pretty

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
the next time you do it you'll pretty

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.820 
the next time you do it you'll pretty
much<00:04:23.060> just<00:04:23.360> know<00:04:23.570> how<00:04:23.750> much<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.960> can<00:04:24.200> eat<00:04:24.380> you

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
the cardio and training hard and it

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.030 
the cardio and training hard and it
really<00:04:38.750> looked<00:04:39.020> like<00:04:39.050> I<00:04:39.170> said<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.800> can't

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.530 
really looked like I said you can't
really<00:04:40.220> when<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:40.670> if<00:04:40.970> you're<00:04:41.120> dieting<00:04:41.270> for<00:04:41.420> a

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
you don't create you've got to go

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.030 
you don't create you've got to go
through<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.670> hunger<00:04:52.940> pain<00:04:53.150> -<00:04:53.330> next<00:04:53.510> meal<00:04:54.040> so

you've<00:05:02.270> got<00:05:02.360> a<00:05:02.390> rough<00:05:02.510> idea<00:05:02.750> but<00:05:03.050> then<00:05:03.170> after

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
you've got a rough idea but then after

you've got a rough idea but then after
that<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:04.340> pretty<00:05:04.520> much<00:05:04.580> go<00:05:04.790> up<00:05:04.850> memory<00:05:05.240> and

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
that you pretty much go up memory and

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.820 
that you pretty much go up memory and
