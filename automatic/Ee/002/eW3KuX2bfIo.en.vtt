soon<00:03:12.010> your<00:03:12.189> pieces<00:03:12.400> long<00:03:12.730> together

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.650

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
change house it a progression you can

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.840 
change house it a progression you can
switch<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.440> this<00:03:54.040> instead<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.730> going<00:03:56.850> and

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
switch to this instead of going and

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.510 
switch to this instead of going and
switch<00:03:58.210> to<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.750> higher<00:03:59.220> G<00:04:00.220> flat<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.880> G<00:04:01.420> sharp<00:04:02.520> so

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
switch to a higher G flat a G sharp so

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:24.840 
switch to a higher G flat a G sharp so
like<00:04:20.730> like<00:04:21.730> so<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:23.370> that's<00:04:24.370> pretty<00:04:24.520> much<00:04:24.640> it

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
like like so and that's pretty much it

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.490
