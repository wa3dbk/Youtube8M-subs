not evolved from that until now our goal

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.150 
not evolved from that until now our goal
was<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.150> build<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.050> better<00:00:28.260> mousetrap<00:00:28.560> when

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
was to build the better mousetrap when

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.710 
was to build the better mousetrap when
he<00:00:29.250> came<00:00:29.429> into<00:00:29.670> pedal<00:00:30.060> boards<00:00:30.330> because<00:00:30.510> it's

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
he came into pedal boards because it's

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.020 
he came into pedal boards because it's
just<00:00:30.990> time<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.439> need<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.099> next<00:00:32.279> step<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.669> we

ask us about is why are the handles

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.380 
ask us about is why are the handles
offset<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.159> reason<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.490> put<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.729> offset<00:01:39.210> is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
offset the reason we put it offset is

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.940 
offset the reason we put it offset is
that<00:01:39.540> puts<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> bounce<00:01:40.110> point<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.650> the
