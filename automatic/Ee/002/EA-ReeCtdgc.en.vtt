do<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.539> work<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:46.020> both<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.530> those<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.010> made<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
do the work of both of those I made a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.270 
do the work of both of those I made a
great<00:00:47.789> pesto<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.590> little<00:00:49.920> mason

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
great pesto right in this little mason

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.069 
great pesto right in this little mason
jar<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.700> my<00:00:50.760> personal<00:00:51.180> blenders<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.780> strong

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
jar and my personal blenders have strong

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.040 
jar and my personal blenders have strong
motors<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> tribest<00:00:53.550> motor<00:00:53.910> shuts<00:00:54.809> off

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
motors but the tribest motor shuts off

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.020 
motors but the tribest motor shuts off
automatically<00:00:55.800> when<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.070> overheats<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
automatically when it overheats and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.420 
automatically when it overheats and
that's<00:00:57.480> why<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.140> motor<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.710> better<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that's why it's motor is better so the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.849 
that's why it's motor is better so the
