00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
them appear a little bit more on the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.640 
them appear a little bit more on the
actually<00:00:17.210> side<00:00:17.450> more<00:00:17.689> of<00:00:17.779> a<00:00:17.840> cool<00:00:18.050> tone<00:00:18.080> blonde

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
actually side more of a cool tone blonde

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.980 
actually side more of a cool tone blonde
and<00:00:19.010> usually<00:00:19.640> I<00:00:19.670> just<00:00:19.730> do<00:00:20.000> that<00:00:20.150> with<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.450> purple

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
and usually I just do that with a purple

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.350 
and usually I just do that with a purple
shampoo<00:00:21.170> normally<00:00:22.040> from<00:00:22.310> my<00:00:22.430> experience<00:00:23.029> when

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
shampoo normally from my experience when

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.909 
shampoo normally from my experience when
I<00:00:23.390> order<00:00:23.720> hair<00:00:23.930> extensions<00:00:24.230> I<00:00:24.439> always<00:00:24.740> have

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
I order hair extensions I always have

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.679 
I order hair extensions I always have
two<00:00:25.189> purple<00:00:25.730> washed<00:00:25.910> in<00:00:26.090> my<00:00:26.180> shampoo<00:00:26.540> because

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
two purple washed in my shampoo because

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.450 
two purple washed in my shampoo because
normally<00:00:27.230> hair<00:00:27.619> extensions<00:00:28.040> become<00:00:28.250> a<00:00:28.279> little

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
normally hair extensions become a little

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.400 
normally hair extensions become a little
bit<00:00:28.579> more<00:00:28.820> yellowy<00:00:29.360> and<00:00:29.509> more<00:00:29.810> golden<00:00:30.200> tone

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
bit more yellowy and more golden tone

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.240 
bit more yellowy and more golden tone
than<00:00:30.650> my<00:00:30.800> hair

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
than my hair

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.520 
than my hair
so<00:00:31.579> using<00:00:32.060> purple<00:00:32.509> shampoos<00:00:32.989> definitely

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
so using purple shampoos definitely

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.410 
so using purple shampoos definitely
helped<00:00:33.710> out<00:00:33.890> a<00:00:33.920> lot<00:00:34.310> so<00:00:34.610> that's<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.210> only

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
helped out a lot so that's the only

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.850 
helped out a lot so that's the only
thing<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:35.720> I<00:00:35.750> really<00:00:36.050> do<00:00:36.200> I<00:00:36.230> don't<00:00:36.500> have<00:00:36.620> to

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
thing that I really do I don't have to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.189 
thing that I really do I don't have to
like<00:00:37.100> use<00:00:37.280> any<00:00:37.520> kind<00:00:37.730> of<00:00:37.820> bleach<00:00:38.120> or<00:00:38.450> like<00:00:39.050> an

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
like use any kind of bleach or like an

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.049 
like use any kind of bleach or like an
actual<00:00:39.620> hair<00:00:39.980> toner<00:00:40.280> because<00:00:40.670> it's<00:00:40.820> going<00:00:40.940> to

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
actual hair toner because it's going to

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.060 
actual hair toner because it's going to
be<00:00:41.149> way<00:00:41.449> too<00:00:41.480> harsh<00:00:42.019> on<00:00:42.260> your<00:00:42.379> hair<00:00:42.559> extensions

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
be way too harsh on your hair extensions

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.000 
be way too harsh on your hair extensions
and<00:00:43.570> you<00:00:44.570> know<00:00:44.660> they<00:00:44.809> just<00:00:44.840> won't<00:00:45.170> be<00:00:45.320> as<00:00:45.559> soft

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
and you know they just won't be as soft

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.340 
and you know they just won't be as soft
so<00:00:46.460> I<00:00:46.730> definitely<00:00:47.149> recommend<00:00:47.449> purple<00:00:48.199> shampoo

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
so I definitely recommend purple shampoo

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.200 
so I definitely recommend purple shampoo
