this is done mostly with hand tools
which<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.400> constantly<00:01:21.060> sharpen<00:01:21.540> isn't<00:01:21.780> working

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
which I constantly sharpen isn't working

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.249 
which I constantly sharpen isn't working
also<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> wood<00:01:24.270> can't<00:01:24.540> really<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:24.960> used<00:01:25.080> as

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
also the wood can't really be used as

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.170 
also the wood can't really be used as
dimensional<00:01:25.830> lumber<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> just

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
dimensional lumber because it just

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.350 
dimensional lumber because it just
checks<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:28.530> order<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> cracks<00:01:29.189> quite<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> bit

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
checks in order to cracks quite a bit

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.330 
checks in order to cracks quite a bit
which<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.540> an<00:01:30.750> attractive<00:01:31.049> aspect<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> but

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
which is an attractive aspect of it but

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.420 
which is an attractive aspect of it but
if<00:01:32.430> you've<00:01:32.549> got<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.880> shaped<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:34.430> squares

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
if you've got it shaped as a squares

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.880 
if you've got it shaped as a squares
board<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.750> find<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.229> crack<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
board it's going to find it crack and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.980 
board it's going to find it crack and
not<00:01:38.250> work<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.210> lot<00:01:39.360> better<00:01:39.509> squeaks

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
not work so it's a lot better squeaks

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.920 
not work so it's a lot better squeaks
the<00:01:40.920> construction<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.970> entirely<00:01:42.420> mortise<00:01:42.899> and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
starburst which is also made out of iron

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.880 
starburst which is also made out of iron
wood<00:02:16.360> actually<00:02:16.959> this<00:02:17.079> is<00:02:17.230> another<00:02:17.439> non<00:02:17.680> iron

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
wood actually this is another non iron

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.339 
wood actually this is another non iron
wood<00:02:18.189> part<00:02:18.489> it's<00:02:18.700> just<00:02:18.939> pined<00:02:19.239> again<00:02:20.049> because

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
wood part it's just pined again because

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.990 
wood part it's just pined again because
it<00:02:20.439> has<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.739> be<00:02:20.860> dimensional<00:02:21.430> lumber<00:02:21.640> an

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
it has to be dimensional lumber an

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.809 
it has to be dimensional lumber an
interesting<00:02:22.689> feature<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.769> it<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.189> the<00:02:24.400> Sun

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
interesting feature of it is the Sun

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.380 
interesting feature of it is the Sun
disk<00:02:25.269> which<00:02:26.079> is<00:02:27.030> really<00:02:28.170> neat<00:02:29.170> Tiger<00:02:29.980> maple

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
disk which is really neat Tiger maple

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.970 
disk which is really neat Tiger maple
but<00:02:31.390> what's<00:02:31.989> interesting<00:02:32.109> about<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.769> from<00:02:32.859> a

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
but what's interesting about it from a

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.149 
but what's interesting about it from a
structural<00:02:33.760> point<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.120> view<00:02:34.329> is<00:02:34.450> all<00:02:34.659> of<00:02:34.900> these

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
structural point of view is all of these

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.250 
structural point of view is all of these
members<00:02:36.159> here<00:02:36.459> are<00:02:36.730> mortise<00:02:37.420> about<00:02:37.959> an<00:02:38.109> inch

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
members here are mortise about an inch

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.470 
members here are mortise about an inch
and<00:02:38.409> a<00:02:38.439> half<00:02:38.500> into<00:02:38.950> here<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.370> then<00:02:39.939> also<00:02:40.150> an

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
and a half into here and then also an

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.039 
and a half into here and then also an
inch<00:02:40.629> and<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.810> half<00:02:40.840> into<00:02:41.590> here<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.569> the

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
inch and a half into here so the

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.660 
inch and a half into here so the
question<00:02:44.409> then<00:02:44.440> remains<00:02:44.590> well<00:02:45.129> how<00:02:45.340> can<00:02:45.549> you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
question then remains well how can you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.379 
question then remains well how can you
get<00:02:45.909> a<00:02:45.940> disc<00:02:46.389> suspended<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:48.190> air<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.849> get<00:02:49.269> it

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
get a disc suspended in air and get it

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.369 
get a disc suspended in air and get it
mortise<00:02:50.519> all<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:52.060> way<00:02:52.180> around<00:02:52.299> so<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:52.930> kind

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
mortise all the way around so that kind

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.289 
mortise all the way around so that kind
of<00:02:53.439> makes<00:02:53.500> an<00:02:53.889> interesting<00:02:54.299> structural

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
of makes an interesting structural

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.379 
of makes an interesting structural
puzzle<00:02:55.750> which<00:02:56.560> I'm<00:02:57.159> not<00:02:57.609> going<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:57.879> take<00:02:58.180> time

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
puzzle which I'm not going to take time

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.879 
puzzle which I'm not going to take time
to<00:02:58.599> explain<00:02:58.959> here<00:02:59.379> but<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.590> bed<00:03:02.590> that

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
to explain here but this is the bed that

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:10.739 
to explain here but this is the bed that
is<00:03:04.590> landscape<00:03:07.739> inspired
