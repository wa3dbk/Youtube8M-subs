way I mean I've got like everything on a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.030 
way I mean I've got like everything on a
bazillion<00:01:56.770> right<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:59.320> one<00:01:59.560> which<00:01:59.800> requires

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
bazillion right this one which requires

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.980 
bazillion right this one which requires
phantom<00:02:00.520> power<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:01.030> one<00:02:01.240> doesn't<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.750> PD

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
phantom power this one doesn't the PD

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.240 
phantom power this one doesn't the PD
procaster<00:02:02.830> does<00:02:03.370> not<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.910> at2020<00:02:04.600> does<00:02:05.250> but

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
procaster does not the at2020 does but

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.080 
procaster does not the at2020 does but
if<00:02:06.370> you<00:02:06.460> as<00:02:06.580> you<00:02:06.730> can<00:02:06.850> tell<00:02:08.040> there's<00:02:09.040> no<00:02:09.190> hum<00:02:09.940> in

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
if you as you can tell there's no hum in

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.580 
if you as you can tell there's no hum in
the<00:02:10.149> background<00:02:10.660> that's<00:02:11.020> number<00:02:11.260> one<00:02:11.560> number

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
the background that's number one number

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.660 
the background that's number one number
two<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:13.090> picks<00:02:13.390> up<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.660> lot<00:02:13.690> more<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.950> mean<00:02:15.520> I

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
two it picks up a lot more I mean I

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.040 
two it picks up a lot more I mean I
could<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:16.000> could<00:02:16.150> blow<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.420> levels<00:02:16.720> out<00:02:16.870> right

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
could I could blow the levels out right

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.350 
could I could blow the levels out right
now<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:18.070> wouldn't<00:02:18.550> really<00:02:18.640> do<00:02:18.940> too<00:02:19.180> much

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
now and I wouldn't really do too much

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.410 
now and I wouldn't really do too much
but<00:02:20.110> it's<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:20.770> much<00:02:20.890> warmer<00:02:21.100> sounding<00:02:21.610> mic

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
but it's so much warmer sounding mic

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.280

number<00:02:22.960> one<00:02:23.140> number<00:02:23.290> two<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.900> can<00:02:26.110> hear

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
number one number two so you can hear

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.200 
number one number two so you can hear
some<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.620> background<00:02:27.010> noise<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:27.460> this<00:02:28.030> is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
some of the background noise so this is

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.600 
some of the background noise so this is
not<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.660> mic<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.050> want<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.470> use<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.860> on

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610

the<00:03:15.160> board<00:03:15.430> maybe<00:03:15.820> it's<00:03:16.060> some<00:03:16.420> wacky

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
the board maybe it's some wacky

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.770 
the board maybe it's some wacky
electromagnetic<00:03:18.910> interference<00:03:19.570> somewhere

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
electromagnetic interference somewhere

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.220 
electromagnetic interference somewhere
and<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:21.160> maybe<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.330> is<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.540> mic<00:03:22.690> maybe<00:03:22.930> this

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
and and maybe it is the mic maybe this

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.380 
and and maybe it is the mic maybe this
specific<00:03:23.770> mic<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.160> broken<00:03:24.310> somehow<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.300> I've

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
really really do but for some reason the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.240 
really really do but for some reason the
broadcaster's<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:38.410> not<00:03:38.620> working<00:03:38.950> well<00:03:39.100> with

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
broadcaster's it's not working well with

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.020 
broadcaster's it's not working well with
me<00:03:39.870> also<00:03:40.870> when<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.890> speak<00:03:42.310> it's<00:03:42.579> got<00:03:42.820> this

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
me also when you speak it's got this

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.710 
me also when you speak it's got this
kind<00:03:43.299> of<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:44.160> responsive<00:03:45.160> tinny<00:03:45.730> noise<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.540> it

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
kind of a responsive tinny noise to it

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.190 
kind of a responsive tinny noise to it
that's

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
that's

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.720 
that's
almost<00:03:47.440> like<00:03:47.560> it's<00:03:47.770> it's<00:03:48.099> reverberating

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
almost like it's it's reverberating

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.509 
almost like it's it's reverberating
inside<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.930> chamber<00:03:50.410> here<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:50.950> I

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
inside of the the chamber here and I

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.500 
inside of the the chamber here and I
don't<00:03:51.730> know<00:03:51.790> why<00:03:51.940> that<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.360> either<00:03:52.569> but<00:03:52.900> I

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
don't know why that is either but I

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.430 
don't know why that is either but I
really<00:03:55.510> don't<00:03:55.599> want<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.840> have<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.110> go<00:03:56.260> and

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
really don't want to have to go and

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.140 
really don't want to have to go and
spend<00:03:56.800> high<00:03:57.040> o<00:03:57.069> money<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:57.610> I<00:03:57.640> think<00:03:57.879> I<00:03:57.970> might

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
spend high o money but I think I might

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.449 
spend high o money but I think I might
have<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.510> so<00:03:59.019> that<00:03:59.140> I<00:03:59.650> just<00:04:00.069> want<00:04:00.190> to<00:04:00.280> give<00:04:00.370> you
