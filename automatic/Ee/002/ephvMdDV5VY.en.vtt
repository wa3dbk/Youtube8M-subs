00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.470 

now<00:00:03.810> we<00:00:03.870> will<00:00:04.230> review<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.890> features<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.790> the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
now we will review the features of the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.669 
now we will review the features of the
base<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.020> skull

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.350 

first<00:00:10.679> anteriorly<00:00:11.190> let's<00:00:11.490> look<00:00:11.700> at<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> hard

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
first anteriorly let's look at the hard

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.120 
first anteriorly let's look at the hard
palate<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.440> hard<00:00:13.650> palate<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.190> broken<00:00:14.519> into<00:00:14.990> an

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
palate the hard palate is broken into an

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.849 
palate the hard palate is broken into an
anterior<00:00:17.130> 2/3<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.029> posterior<00:00:18.630> third<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
anterior 2/3 and a posterior third the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.830 
anterior 2/3 and a posterior third the
anterior<00:00:20.369> two-thirds<00:00:20.880> are<00:00:21.090> made<00:00:21.210> up<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
anterior two-thirds are made up of the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.310 
anterior two-thirds are made up of the
palatine<00:00:22.500> process<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.340> maxilla<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.170> is

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
palatine process of maxilla so this is

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.460 
palatine process of maxilla so this is
part<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> maxilla<00:00:26.460> bone<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.990> posterior

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
part of the maxilla bone the posterior

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.370 
part of the maxilla bone the posterior
third<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.250> made<00:00:29.939> up<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.660> palatine<00:00:31.140> bone

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
third is made up of the palatine bone

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.030 
third is made up of the palatine bone
itself<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> palatine<00:00:34.530> process

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
itself so we have the palatine process

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.660 
itself so we have the palatine process
of<00:00:35.250> maxilla<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.600> palatine<00:00:37.079> bone<00:00:39.800> as<00:00:40.800> we

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
of maxilla and the palatine bone as we

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.330 
of maxilla and the palatine bone as we
look<00:00:41.820> at<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.559> posterior<00:00:43.559> opening<00:00:44.040> into<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
look at the posterior opening into the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.090 
look at the posterior opening into the
nasal<00:00:44.760> cavity<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.320> these<00:00:46.469> openings<00:00:46.920> here

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
nasal cavity we see these openings here

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.119 
nasal cavity we see these openings here
which<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.460> called<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.789> co<00:00:48.180> ana<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.950> in<00:00:49.950> there

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
floor of the skull and we'll discuss

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.719 
floor of the skull and we'll discuss
some<00:01:31.350> other<00:01:31.530> frame<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.280> won't<00:01:32.490> see

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
some other frame and that we won't see

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.749 
some other frame and that we won't see
on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.240> floor<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> skull<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.520> give<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
on the floor of the skull so to give you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.380 
on the floor of the skull so to give you
an<00:01:35.880> idea<00:01:36.229> when<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.350> turn<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.710> guy<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.610> skull

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
an idea when we turn this guy the skull

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510 
an idea when we turn this guy the skull
around<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.900> look<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.530> floor<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.430> the
