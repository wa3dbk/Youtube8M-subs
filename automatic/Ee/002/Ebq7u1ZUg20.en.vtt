00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:03.620
 where exactly was the last step 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.990
 mammoth science is unknown but if 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.340
 masters of the ice age and destined 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.290
 find a second life then it should 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.520
 happen in japan in the lab 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.300
 kinki hem sakai university 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.070
 professors akira iritani revival 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.960
 siberian mammoth has been practicing since the end 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.390
 eighties i think that successful 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.269
 final wait is not long yes 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.539
 if we talk about the most 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.429
 optimistic scenario yes it is 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.879
 It will take about five more years I believe that after 

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.169
 how the mammoths will be revived them 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.149
 need to send to their historical homeland in 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.850
 Siberia in general is my dream to organize in 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.540
 Russia zoo animals of the ice age 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.980
 to return from the next world he is a mammoth 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.700
 one way repeat the way 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.490
 offenders share material for 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.440
 surviving leg cloning and 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.160
 other fragments of animal carcass deceased 15 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.810
 thousand years ago Japanese scientists 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.310
 got another 2000 third year after 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.430
 expeditions to the Yakut tundra since 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.310
 valuable samples stored under lock and key 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.300
 special freezer 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.270
 at a temperature of minus 80 4 degrees 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.950
 on the pony here it contains fragments 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.460
 skin muscle and bone mammoth 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.290
 they cannot be removed ahead of time 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.390
 since this market is very delicate 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.280
 genetic material he is constantly 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.860
 must remain frozen 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.659
 condition 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.420
 otherwise it may further damage 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.510
 research 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.049
 the task of scientists is to find frozen tissues 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.770
 cell venom with full 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.859
 genetic code and transplant them into 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.319
 cell next of kin 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.780
 Mammoths ideally this is an elephant but for now 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.459
 specialists train on 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.219
 lab mice just recently 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.679
 Japanese genetics have achieved a breakthrough they 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.829
 planned a group of rodents from the cells 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.850
 animal that was frozen 16 years ago 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.159
 if successful, our technology will be 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.770
 indispensable for animal rescue 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.430
 which are already extinct or are on 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.430
 the verge of extinction, I hope that we 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.650
 will be able to clone not only mammoth but also 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.960
 other animals of that era woolly 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.670
 rhinos 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.460
 and saber-toothed tigers 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.780
 this summer a professor or tanya is going to 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.900
 again go to Yakutia and get 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.470
 fresh samples frozen 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.600
 remains of mammoths 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.030
 elephants are pregnant 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.670
 long federico feeding 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.119
 about two years if everything goes 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.209
 safely 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.789
 then the first mammoth clone can 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.170
 will be released in 2016 and in this case 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.620
 forces Japanese genetics anecdote about 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.019
 the fact that Russia is the birthplace of elephants finally 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.819
 will receive scientific confirmation 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:20.959
 Sergey even walk 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.189
 east asian hold japan
