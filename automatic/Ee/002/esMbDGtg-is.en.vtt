pretty good for being stuck up in a
fireplace<00:04:56.020> for<00:04:56.260> over<00:04:56.440> a<00:04:56.470> hundred<00:04:56.530> years<00:04:56.770> the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
fireplace for over a hundred years the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.159 
fireplace for over a hundred years the
owners<00:04:57.640> also<00:04:57.970> stated<00:04:58.600> that<00:04:58.630> he<00:04:58.870> didn't<00:04:59.080> know

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
owners also stated that he didn't know

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.540 
owners also stated that he didn't know
whether<00:04:59.350> he<00:04:59.440> went<00:04:59.740> to<00:04:59.860> write<00:05:00.010> back<00:05:00.190> or<00:05:00.430> not

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
whether he went to write back or not

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.400 
whether he went to write back or not
because<00:05:00.700> chances<00:05:01.510> are<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.930> kids<00:05:02.140> probably

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
because chances are the kids probably

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.930 
because chances are the kids probably
aren't<00:05:02.680> alive<00:05:02.919> anymore<00:05:02.950> but<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:03.550> think<00:05:03.820> he

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
aren't alive anymore but I think he

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.400 
aren't alive anymore but I think he
should<00:05:04.120> still<00:05:04.390> send<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.720> letter<00:05:04.900> out<00:05:04.990> next

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
should still send the letter out next

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.159 
should still send the letter out next
