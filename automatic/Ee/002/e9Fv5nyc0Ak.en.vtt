to<00:00:10.139> make<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.559> quadrupedal<00:00:11.630> using<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.750> robot

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
to make a quadrupedal using the robot

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.560 
to make a quadrupedal using the robot
from<00:00:13.170> tears<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.590> Steel<00:00:13.849> so<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.180> result

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
from tears of Steel so this is a result

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.660 
from tears of Steel so this is a result
of<00:00:15.660> today's<00:00:15.780> tutorial<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:17.099> before<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.550> get

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
of today's tutorial and before we get

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.339 
of today's tutorial and before we get
started<00:00:17.910> on<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.270> actual<00:00:18.570> tutorial<00:00:18.720> part<00:00:19.259> in

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
started on the actual tutorial part in

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.130 
started on the actual tutorial part in
the<00:00:19.410> video<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.890> need<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.760> show<00:00:20.940> you<00:00:20.970> something

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
the video I need to show you something

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.269 
the video I need to show you something
interesting<00:00:22.140> about<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.830> way<00:00:22.860> that

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
interesting about the way that

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.929 
interesting about the way that
quadrupeds<00:00:24.029> walk<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.740> if<00:00:26.190> I<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.520> just<00:00:26.760> going

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
quadrupeds walk so if I was just going

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.880 
quadrupeds walk so if I was just going
to<00:00:27.029> show<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.270> this<00:00:27.570> over<00:00:27.869> exaggerated<00:00:28.710> pose

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
to show you this over exaggerated pose

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.630 
to show you this over exaggerated pose
here<00:00:29.269> it's<00:00:30.269> over<00:00:31.140> exaggerating<00:00:31.859> but<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.460> does

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
here it's over exaggerating but it does

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.710 
here it's over exaggerating but it does
get<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> point<00:00:33.150> across

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
get the point across

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.070 
get the point across
so<00:00:33.930> when<00:00:34.350> quadrupeds<00:00:34.920> walk<00:00:35.160> they<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:36.080> two

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
so when quadrupeds walk they have two

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.790 
so when quadrupeds walk they have two
legs<00:00:37.379> on<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.830> ground<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.879> most<00:00:39.390> cases

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
legs on the ground and in most cases

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.860 
legs on the ground and in most cases
enter<00:00:40.800> these<00:00:41.010> two<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:41.909> from<00:00:42.299> the<00:00:42.390> front<00:00:42.659> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
enter these two one from the front and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.990 
enter these two one from the front and
one<00:00:43.110> from<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> back<00:00:43.589> or<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:43.949> the<00:00:44.129> ground<00:00:44.370> well

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
one from the back or on the ground well

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.509 
one from the back or on the ground well
the<00:00:45.150> other<00:00:45.299> two<00:00:45.570> legs<00:00:45.750> are<00:00:46.019> in<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.140> air<00:00:46.519> the

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
the other two legs are in the air the

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.180 
the other two legs are in the air the
only<00:00:47.909> time<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.570> success<00:00:49.049> this<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.409> broken<00:00:49.769> is

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
only time this success this is broken is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.759 
only time this success this is broken is
when<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.549> have<00:00:50.790> things<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.930> llamas

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
when you have things like llamas

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.930 
when you have things like llamas
or<00:00:53.809> camels<00:00:54.809> or<00:00:55.350> other<00:00:55.830> sort<00:00:56.400> of<00:00:56.489> exotic

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
or camels or other sort of exotic

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.719 
or camels or other sort of exotic
animals<00:00:57.330> like<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.839> and<00:00:58.260> say<00:00:58.409> if<00:00:58.920> that's

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
animals like that and say if that's

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.160 
animals like that and say if that's
where<00:00:59.909> you'd<00:01:00.059> want<00:01:00.089> to<00:01:00.299> break<00:01:00.479> this<00:01:00.659> rule<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
where you'd want to break this rule and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.670 
where you'd want to break this rule and
have<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.860> be<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.909> each<00:01:03.269> side<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:04.170> maybe<00:01:04.409> these

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
have it be on each side like maybe these

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.310 
have it be on each side like maybe these
two<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> ground<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.119> these<00:01:06.960> would<00:01:07.200> be

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
two be on the ground and these would be

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.120 
two be on the ground and these would be
in<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> air<00:01:07.729> walking<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.680> but<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.890> is

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
in the air walking like that but this is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.319

negative<00:02:06.319> 0.7<00:02:07.319> blender<00:02:07.679> units<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.700> it's

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
negative 0.7 blender units so it's

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.050

down and also move the root zone up

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.410 
down and also move the root zone up
answer<00:03:59.360> a<00:03:59.390> keyframe<00:03:59.810> whole<00:04:00.260> character

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.530 

and<00:04:04.960> there<00:04:05.110> we<00:04:05.200> go<00:04:05.610> we<00:04:06.610> now<00:04:06.760> have<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.390> leg

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
and there we go we now have the leg

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.670 
and there we go we now have the leg
movements<00:04:09.450> this<00:04:10.450> is<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.690> very<00:04:10.990> mechanical

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
movements this is a very mechanical

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.060 
movements this is a very mechanical
movement<00:04:12.130> so<00:04:12.580> this<00:04:13.450> is<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.990> robot<00:04:14.530> at<00:04:14.680> we're<00:04:14.830> all

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
movement so this is a robot at we're all

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.410 
movement so this is a robot at we're all
familiar<00:04:15.220> with<00:04:15.520> because<00:04:16.000> our<00:04:16.150> about

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
familiar with because our about

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.420 
familiar with because our about
frontiers<00:04:16.780> of<00:04:16.840> Steel<00:04:17.170> as<00:04:17.500> well<00:04:17.799> they<00:04:18.100> robot

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
frontiers of Steel as well they robot

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.590 
frontiers of Steel as well they robot
and<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.630> this<00:04:20.489> perfect<00:04:21.489> mechanical<00:04:22.150> movement

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
and so this perfect mechanical movement

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.750 
and so this perfect mechanical movement
between<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.960> front<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.410> back<00:04:23.560> legs<00:04:23.760> looks

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
between the front and back legs looks

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.810 
between the front and back legs looks
okay<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.360> guess<00:04:25.810> for<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.410> mechanical<00:04:27.220> object<00:04:27.340> for

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
okay I guess for a mechanical object for

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.870 
okay I guess for a mechanical object for
if<00:04:27.940> you're<00:04:28.090> going<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.570> be<00:04:28.720> doing<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:29.200> organic

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
if you're going to be doing a organic

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.700 
if you're going to be doing a organic
object<00:04:30.880> you're<00:04:31.480> going<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.780> want<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.080> offset

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
object you're going to want to offset

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.080 
object you're going to want to offset
the<00:04:32.830> back<00:04:33.010> legs<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.430> little<00:04:33.520> bit<00:04:33.730> that<00:04:33.940> it's

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
the back legs a little bit that it's

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.450 
the back legs a little bit that it's
very<00:04:34.330> easy<00:04:34.420> to<00:04:34.810> do<00:04:35.050> this<00:04:35.230> so<00:04:36.010> I'm<00:04:36.100> going<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.310> do

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
very easy to do this so I'm going to do

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.600 
very easy to do this so I'm going to do
is<00:04:36.640> select<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:37.300> two<00:04:37.780> back<00:04:37.990> legs<00:04:38.430> select<00:04:39.430> all

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
is select the two back legs select all

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.430 
is select the two back legs select all
the<00:04:39.730> keyframes<00:04:39.880> in<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.450> action<00:04:40.750> editor<00:04:40.870> and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
the keyframes in the action editor and

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.540 
the keyframes in the action editor and
move<00:04:42.130> their<00:04:42.340> keyframes<00:04:42.790> back<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.870> frames

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
move their keyframes back to frames

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.010 
move their keyframes back to frames
sometimes<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:45.700> might<00:04:45.820> want<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.090> do<00:04:46.240> more<00:04:46.540> or

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
sometimes you might want to do more or

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.590 
sometimes you might want to do more or
sometimes<00:04:47.530> you<00:04:47.650> want<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.830> do<00:04:47.980> lettuce<00:04:48.400> but<00:04:48.760> for

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
sometimes you want to do lettuce but for

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.230 
sometimes you want to do lettuce but for
this<00:04:49.720> I<00:04:50.020> think<00:04:50.169> it's<00:04:50.710> good<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.490> offset<00:04:52.060> them

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
this I think it's good to offset them

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.659 
this I think it's good to offset them
two<00:04:52.450> keyframes<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.830> now<00:04:54.070> you<00:04:54.130> can<00:04:54.370> see<00:04:54.520> the

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
two keyframes and now you can see the

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.060 
two keyframes and now you can see the
back<00:04:54.820> legs<00:04:55.150> are<00:04:55.480> in<00:04:55.630> unclear<00:04:55.900> positions<00:04:56.440> two

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
back legs are in unclear positions two

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.790 
back legs are in unclear positions two
keyframes<00:04:57.280> before<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.450> front<00:04:58.660> legs<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.290> this

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
keyframes before the front legs and this

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.470 
keyframes before the front legs and this
looks<00:05:00.010> very<00:05:00.250> good<00:05:02.850> and<00:05:03.850> now<00:05:04.000> for<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:04.360> last

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
looks very good and now for the last

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.270 
looks very good and now for the last
part<00:05:04.900> we're<00:05:05.200> going<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.500> be<00:05:05.650> doing<00:05:05.830> the

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
part we're going to be doing the

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.050 
part we're going to be doing the
rotations<00:05:06.850> for<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.180> episode<00:05:07.570> body<00:05:08.850> so<00:05:09.850> I'm

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
rotations for the episode body so I'm

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.080 
rotations for the episode body so I'm
going<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.390> be<00:05:10.540> going<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:11.080> frame<00:05:11.410> one<00:05:11.710> and

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
going to be going to frame one and

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.090 
going to be going to frame one and
selecting<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.570> back<00:05:13.750> hips<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.620> we<00:05:14.740> can<00:05:14.890> see

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
selecting the back hips and we can see

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.390 
selecting the back hips and we can see
that<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.970> left<00:05:16.570> leg<00:05:16.900> is<00:05:17.290> back<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.979> the<00:05:18.190> right

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
that the left leg is back and the right

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.130 
that the left leg is back and the right
leg<00:05:18.640> is<00:05:18.820> forward<00:05:19.030> so<00:05:19.479> we're<00:05:19.630> going<00:05:19.810> to<00:05:19.900> update

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
leg is forward so we're going to update

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.100 
leg is forward so we're going to update
the<00:05:20.380> hips<00:05:20.590> in<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:20.919> direction<00:05:21.100> so<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:22.570> right

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
the hips in that direction so the right

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.570 
the hips in that direction so the right
side<00:05:23.470> of<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.680> hips<00:05:23.860> is<00:05:24.010> forwards<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.490> the

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
side of the hips is forwards and the

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.070 
side of the hips is forwards and the
left<00:05:24.790> side<00:05:25.030> is<00:05:25.180> backwards<00:05:26.940> there<00:05:27.940> go<00:05:28.150> and

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
left side is backwards there go and

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.860 
left side is backwards there go and
insert<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.500> keyframe<00:05:29.740> for<00:05:30.190> rotation<00:05:30.729> and<00:05:31.690> we're

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
insert a keyframe for rotation and we're

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.870 
insert a keyframe for rotation and we're
only<00:05:31.990> going<00:05:32.229> to<00:05:32.290> need<00:05:32.380> to<00:05:32.560> do<00:05:32.770> this<00:05:32.979> on<00:05:33.220> the

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
only going to need to do this on the

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.090 
only going to need to do this on the
contact<00:05:34.479> positions<00:05:34.930> versus<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.440> positions

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
contact positions versus the positions

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.400 
contact positions versus the positions
on<00:05:36.400> frame<00:05:36.880> one<00:05:37.240> 16<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.350> 32<00:05:39.479> now<00:05:40.479> I'll<00:05:41.169> show<00:05:41.350> you

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
on frame one 16 and 32 now I'll show you

on frame one 16 and 32 now I'll show you
a<00:05:41.530> cool<00:05:41.800> trick<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:42.130> speed<00:05:42.490> up<00:05:42.640> the<00:05:42.729> process<00:05:43.210> so

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
a cool trick to speed up the process so

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.380 
a cool trick to speed up the process so
by<00:05:43.750> hitting<00:05:43.990> ctrl<00:05:44.470> +<00:05:44.770> C<00:05:45.040> with<00:05:45.669> these<00:05:45.880> two<00:05:46.090> bands

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
by hitting ctrl + C with these two bands

selected I have just copied their

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.070 
selected I have just copied their
rotations<00:05:50.710> so<00:05:51.640> at<00:05:51.880> frame<00:05:52.090> 16<00:05:52.540> I<00:05:52.570> can<00:05:52.930> hit

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
rotations so at frame 16 I can hit

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.900 
rotations so at frame 16 I can hit
control<00:05:53.500> shift<00:05:53.530> V<00:05:54.160> and<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.640> will<00:05:54.790> paste

direction rotation and hoppy clock frame

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.920 
direction rotation and hoppy clock frame
16<00:06:47.130> kosher<00:06:47.910> V<00:06:49.010> and<00:06:50.010> frames<00:06:50.760> already<00:06:51.060> do<00:06:51.240> ctrl<00:06:51.720> +

16 kosher V and frames already do ctrl +

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.140 
16 kosher V and frames already do ctrl +
P<00:06:53.690> so<00:06:54.690> now<00:06:54.840> we<00:06:54.900> have<00:06:55.170> the<00:06:55.530> hips<00:06:56.010> going<00:06:57.000> to

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
choose to body bum and this is the West

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.580 
choose to body bum and this is the West
when<00:06:59.940> we<00:07:00.090> need<00:07:00.240> to<00:07:00.270> do<00:07:00.540> rotating<00:07:01.410> in<00:07:01.470> the<00:07:01.560> same

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
when we need to do rotating in the same

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.960 
when we need to do rotating in the same
direction<00:07:01.800> as<00:07:02.220> the<00:07:02.340> hips<00:07:03.020> copy<00:07:04.100> rig<00:07:05.100> 16<00:07:05.520> ctrl

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
direction as the hips copy rig 16 ctrl

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:13.220 
direction as the hips copy rig 16 ctrl
shift<00:07:06.000> V<00:07:06.450> and<00:07:07.320> on<00:07:07.680> frame<00:07:07.950> 30<00:07:07.980> -<00:07:08.430> ctrl<00:07:08.880> +<00:07:09.090> P<00:07:12.230> so

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.230 
shift V and on frame 30 - ctrl + P so

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.650 
shift V and on frame 30 - ctrl + P so
there<00:07:13.440> we<00:07:13.560> go<00:07:13.740> we<00:07:14.040> have<00:07:14.070> our<00:07:14.670> quadrupedal<00:07:15.480> walk

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 
there we go we have our quadrupedal walk

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.520 
there we go we have our quadrupedal walk
cycle<00:07:16.910> so<00:07:17.910> that's<00:07:18.510> pretty<00:07:18.840> much<00:07:18.930> it<00:07:19.260> it's

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
cycle so that's pretty much it it's

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.800 
cycle so that's pretty much it it's
