going to put it in back sake and see

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.680 
going to put it in back sake and see
what<00:00:44.700> actually<00:00:44.850> happens<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> shutter<00:00:46.190> and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
what actually happens to the shutter and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.760 
what actually happens to the shutter and
put<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> camera<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.320> shutter<00:00:49.829> priority<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
put the camera on shutter priority and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.130 
put the camera on shutter priority and
let's<00:00:52.770> do<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> shutter<00:00:53.940> speed<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.750> tenth<00:00:55.050> of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
let's do a shutter speed of one tenth of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.270 
let's do a shutter speed of one tenth of
a<00:00:55.260> second<00:00:56.390> I<00:00:57.390> probably<00:00:57.989> didn't<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:58.469> any<00:00:58.620> light

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
a second I probably didn't see any light

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.840 
a second I probably didn't see any light
coming<00:00:59.550> through<00:00:59.730> there's<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> little<00:01:00.539> bit

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
coming through there's a little bit

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.460 
coming through there's a little bit
there<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.000> go<00:01:03.120> there's<00:01:03.480> some<00:01:03.719> there's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
there we go there's some there's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.240 
there we go there's some there's
something<00:01:05.100> ok<00:01:05.990> what<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.110> happening<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
something ok what is happening is the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.719 
something ok what is happening is the
the<00:01:08.610> shutter<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.000> sticky<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.229> fact<00:01:10.860> it's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the shutter is sticky in fact it's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.950 
the shutter is sticky in fact it's
called<00:01:12.000> kind<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.450> sticky<00:01:12.840> shutter<00:01:13.320> syndrome<00:01:14.130> I

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
called kind of sticky shutter syndrome I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.039 
called kind of sticky shutter syndrome I
enjoy<00:01:15.960> even<00:01:16.200> faster<00:01:16.799> shutter<00:01:17.580> speed<00:01:18.090> let's<00:01:18.689> go

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
enjoy even faster shutter speed let's go

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:27.980 
enjoy even faster shutter speed let's go
up<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:20.840> 180<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.650> second<00:01:24.170> you'll<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.990> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
up to 180 of a second you'll see the the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.390 
up to 180 of a second you'll see the the
mirror<00:01:28.229> moved<00:01:28.470> by<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> way<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> won't

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
mirror moved by the way but you won't

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.230 
mirror moved by the way but you won't
see<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.229> light<00:01:31.369> because<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> shutter<00:01:32.759> just

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
see the light because the shutter just

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.020 
see the light because the shutter just
isn't<00:01:33.509> opening<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.020> too<00:01:34.200> sticky<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.939> we

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
isn't opening it's too sticky and if we

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.399 
isn't opening it's too sticky and if we
look<00:01:36.180> back<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.409> shutter

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
look back here you can see the shutter

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.940 
look back here you can see the shutter
itself<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.869> see<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.259> hardly<00:01:43.799> even

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
itself you can see it's hardly even

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.859 
itself you can see it's hardly even
moving

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
moving

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.600 
moving
now<00:01:45.869> another<00:01:47.240> telltale<00:01:48.240> sign

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
now another telltale sign

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.520 
now another telltale sign
this<00:01:50.820> shutter<00:01:51.330> problem<00:01:51.870> you<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.350> right

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this shutter problem you can see right

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.640 
this shutter problem you can see right
there<00:01:53.750> right<00:01:54.750> here<00:01:55.080> it's<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.040> shiny<00:01:57.650> substance

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
there right here it's a shiny substance

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.940 
there right here it's a shiny substance
on<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.070> shutter<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.750> if<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.930> actually<00:02:01.110> touch

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
on the shutter and if you actually touch

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.410 
on the shutter and if you actually touch
that<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.990> it's<00:02:03.990> kind<00:02:04.260> of<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:05.330> tari<00:02:06.330> substance

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
that it's it's kind of a tari substance

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.990 
that it's it's kind of a tari substance
okay<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.570> what's<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:09.960> on<00:02:10.320> here

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
okay so what's going on here

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.390 
okay so what's going on here
well<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:14.150> shutter<00:02:15.150> itself<00:02:15.600> has<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.400> foam

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
well the shutter itself has a foam

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.100 
well the shutter itself has a foam
bumper<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.110> bottom<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
bumper in it on the bottom of the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.890 
bumper in it on the bottom of the
shutter<00:02:22.110> box<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.790> foam<00:02:24.150> bumper<00:02:24.660> over

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
shutter box and this foam bumper over

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.560 
shutter box and this foam bumper over
time<00:02:25.350> has<00:02:25.860> turned<00:02:26.280> into<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:27.320> glob<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:29.570> grease

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
time has turned into a glob of grease

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.220 
time has turned into a glob of grease
Atari<00:02:31.260> substance<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.880> what<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.510> happening<00:02:34.020> is

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
Atari substance and what is happening is

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.260 
Atari substance and what is happening is
the<00:02:34.380> shutter<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.709> trying<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> open<00:02:35.580> its<00:02:35.940> and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
the shutter is trying to open its and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.940 
the shutter is trying to open its and
it's<00:02:36.420> going<00:02:37.080> into<00:02:37.350> that

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
it's going into that

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.420 
it's going into that
tari<00:02:38.280> substance<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.240> getting<00:02:39.480> hung<00:02:39.690> up<00:02:40.430> this

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
tari substance and getting hung up this

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.400 
tari substance and getting hung up this
will<00:02:41.640> kind<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.000> manifest<00:02:42.450> itself<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:43.080> your

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
will kind of manifest itself on your

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.800 
will kind of manifest itself on your
film<00:02:43.800> as<00:02:44.720> shots<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:46.080> are<00:02:46.880> overexposed<00:02:47.880> kind

we're<00:03:36.420> going<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.780> try<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.080> do<00:03:37.320> is<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.980> fix<00:03:38.640> it

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
we're going to try to do is to fix it

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.850 
we're going to try to do is to fix it
ourselves<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:41.269> so<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.600> actually<00:03:43.110> firing

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
ourselves and so it is actually firing

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.830 
ourselves and so it is actually firing
on<00:03:44.340> all<00:03:44.370> shutter<00:03:44.940> speeds<00:03:45.300> and

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
I hope to make another video at the end

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.300 
I hope to make another video at the end

camera shutter firing on all speeds like
I<00:03:59.989> said<00:04:00.170> this<00:04:00.319> is<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.440> very<00:04:00.470> common<00:04:01.069> problem

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
I said this is a very common problem

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.229 
I said this is a very common problem
with<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:02.120> these<00:04:02.510> early<00:04:02.900> Canon<00:04:03.910> camera<00:04:04.910> bodies

with the these early Canon camera bodies
and<00:04:05.510> in<00:04:06.379> fact<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.799> really<00:04:07.040> drives<00:04:07.280> down<00:04:07.610> the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
and in fact it really drives down the

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.009 
and in fact it really drives down the
resale<00:04:09.260> value<00:04:09.580> this<00:04:10.580> particular<00:04:10.900> thing<00:04:11.900> I
