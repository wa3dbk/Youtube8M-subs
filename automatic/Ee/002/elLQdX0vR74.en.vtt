this is the workout started off with

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.130 
this is the workout started off with
pretty<00:00:25.500> much<00:00:25.650> flat<00:00:26.240> dumbbell<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.599> clients<00:00:28.019> but

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
pretty much flat dumbbell in clients but

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.870 
pretty much flat dumbbell in clients but
I<00:00:28.170> put<00:00:28.380> up<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.830> notch<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> little<00:00:29.730> bit

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
I put up one notch so it's a little bit

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.600 
I put up one notch so it's a little bit
more<00:00:30.029> focused<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:32.279> upper<00:00:32.550> chest<00:00:33.380> and<00:00:34.610> then

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
more focused on the upper chest and then

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.590 
more focused on the upper chest and then
we<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:36.149> right<00:00:38.030> up<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.500> dumbbell<00:00:40.500> inclines<00:00:41.600> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
we go right up to dumbbell inclines the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.650 
we go right up to dumbbell inclines the
weights<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:43.079> were<00:00:43.320> let's<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.430> 125<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.329> 150

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
weights there were let's see 125 to 150

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.950 
weights there were let's see 125 to 150
on<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.020> flats<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.460> right<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.120> 150<00:00:48.750> s<00:00:48.809> on

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
on the flats and then right to 150 s on

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.189 
on the flats and then right to 150 s on
the<00:00:49.079> incline<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.239> did<00:00:51.390> about<00:00:51.480> 4<00:00:51.780> sets

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the incline and we did about 4 sets

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.970 
the incline and we did about 4 sets
8<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.710> 12<00:00:53.039> reps<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.579> both<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.059> those<00:00:54.980> just

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
8 to 12 reps on both of those just

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.529 
8 to 12 reps on both of those just
having<00:00:56.190> fun<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.640> squeezing<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.149> taking<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
having fun just squeezing it taking a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.330 
having fun just squeezing it taking a
time<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.050> lot<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.980> isolation<00:01:00.680> simple<00:01:01.680> simple<00:01:02.160> on

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
time a lot of isolation simple simple on

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.719 
time a lot of isolation simple simple on
the<00:01:02.820> incline<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.329> see<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> actually

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
the incline you can see that I actually

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.039 
the incline you can see that I actually
relative<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> flat<00:01:06.299> bench<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.689> took<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.960> up

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
relative to the flat bench I took it up

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.649 
relative to the flat bench I took it up
one<00:01:07.229> notch<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.460> inclines<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.240> take<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.570> up

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
one notch on the inclines I take it up

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.500 
one notch on the inclines I take it up
about<00:01:09.930> four<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.619> five<00:01:10.650> notches<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.270> even

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
about four to five notches so it's even

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.800 
about four to five notches so it's even
above<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.710> basic<00:01:14.400> incline<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
above a basic incline so it's a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.760 
above a basic incline so it's a
extremely<00:01:16.619> high<00:01:16.770> harder<00:01:18.290> then<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.470> went<00:01:19.650> off

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
extremely high harder then we went off

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.359 
extremely high harder then we went off
to<00:01:20.070> some<00:01:20.790> incline<00:01:21.210> barbell<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.159> pre

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
to some incline barbell I like to pre

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.719 
to some incline barbell I like to pre
fatigue<00:01:23.850> or<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.320> don't<00:01:25.560> I'll<00:01:25.920> hit<00:01:26.159> four<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
fatigue or if I don't I'll hit four to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.980 
fatigue or if I don't I'll hit four to
five<00:01:26.939> four<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.900> four<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.380> half<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:29.990> incline

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
five four to four and a half on incline

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.190 
five four to four and a half on incline
barbell<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:33.000> at<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.390> point<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.930> know<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
barbell and at this point you know the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.140 
barbell and at this point you know the
day<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.590> shoot<00:01:34.860> no<00:01:35.250> need<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.729> I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
day of the shoot no need to do that I

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.030 
day of the shoot no need to do that I
just<00:01:36.600> go<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.079> kind<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.409> play<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> boys

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.080 
pushing it so when these I'm keeping the
reps<00:01:43.619> low<00:01:43.890> relative<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> beginning<00:01:45.030> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
reps low relative to the beginning of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.749 
reps low relative to the beginning of
the<00:01:45.149> workout<00:01:45.540> where<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.750> went<00:01:46.020> high<00:01:46.320> reps<00:01:46.759> tens

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
