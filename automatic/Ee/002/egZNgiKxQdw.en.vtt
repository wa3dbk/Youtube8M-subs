00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.890
 sir yesterday is the meteorological service 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.630
 nationals is still reporting on 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.120
 the presence of the tropical storm the 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.430
 king very well you are in this 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.890
 point that generates enough cloudiness and 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.770
 that is doing good because its 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.470
 distance is really important 535 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.810
 kilometers south south southwest of 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.279
 manzanillo in the state of colima and that 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.009
 continues its trip to the west 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.689
 integrating into the ocean at a rate of 17 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.480
 kilometers per hour and that has winds 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.910
 maximum of 75 and gusts of up to 90 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.940
 kilometers per hour continues to provide 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.070
 little peace to guerrero michoacán colima 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.440
 Jalisco moderate precipitation 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.050
 occasionally strong in this in this 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.660
 region and on the other hand we have less to 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.219
 front to front number 8 that 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.350
 finds just dominating the 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.149
 Southeast and the Yucatan Peninsula 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.760
 we have a good generation of 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.499
 negotiated in these two zones and that will give 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.510
 place to precipitations that go from 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.940
 intense in the south of veracruz in 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.220
 Tabasco in very strong chiapas in oaxaca 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.770
 in the Yucatan peninsula as well 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.270
 intense in quintana not very strong in 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.240
 campeche and the state 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.759
 Yucatan that rains and more rain in 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.310
 the southeast and in the yucatan peninsula 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.719
 the cold air mass of this system 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.490
 you dominate a good part of the territory 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.860
 national with very low temperatures 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.509
 the morning in the north and in the center of 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.130
 the Mexican Republic we continue with the 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.079
 northern event on the Gulf Coast 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.969
 of mexico wind speeds that 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.399
 can reach 60 to 70 kilometers 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.259
 per hour and its displacement observe 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.380
 you will be the displacement that 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.750
 have the front retreating towards what 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.329
 is the Atlantic Ocean and that will stop 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.759
 affect the Mexican republic in the 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.030
 next in the next hours but without 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.220
 before leaving with clouds and rains the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.659
 Southeast and the Yucatan Peninsula in 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.729
 how much are the temperatures you are 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.179
 We have temperature value that can 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.799
 get to 36 and from 36 to 38 39 degree the 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.209
 maximum temperature in the north of 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.009
 Pacific coast of the peninsula 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.349
 baja california sonora in sinaloa el 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.599
 sky almost clear and it really is 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.280
 sunny in the middle part cloudy 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.769
 some moderate rainfall in 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.420
 is in this region and we also have 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.609
 very nice temperatures that are 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.330
 rising little by little they are 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.830
 recovering 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.200
 those of temperature and we can 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.570
 reach them reach between 33 to the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.240
 34 degrees in the south in the south of 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.680
 shoreline of the Pacific observe you for 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.470
 the beautiful port of acapulco that we arrived 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.360
 at 26 degrees the maximum temperature at 10 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.390
 past now we'll wait for it to go 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.610
 the 32 to the 34 and that in the rest of the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.740
 south of the pacific the hot 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.240
 the atmosphere to the sky half cloudy to 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.730
 cloudy with rainfall that can 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.160
 become strong to intense and that 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.720
 the yucatan peninsula just like 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.390
 strong and intense precipitation 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.950
 temperatures ranging from 30 to 32 the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.140
 maximum temperature on the coast of 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.090
 gulf of mexico dominated by everything 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.260
 is not only the front but more than 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.600
 nothing by the cold air mass 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.570
 temperatures ranging from 28 to 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.010
 30 to 32 degrees the maximum temperature 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.830
 mainly in the north of the littoral 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.870
 because the south we continue with this system 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.250
 of cold air with winds up to 70 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.900
 kilometers per hour and rainfall 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.900
 mainly in what is south of 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.060
 Veracruz and in the state of Tabasco 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.190
 precipitation from strong to intense the 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.680
 north of the republic a lot atmosphere 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.510
 drier an environment where the 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.540
 temperatures problems are really 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.879
 low values ​​in the maximums have 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.019
 also those resentments about what 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.349
 is the presence of this air mass 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.090
 cold / warm to warm the atmosphere in 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.620
 the north of the Mexican Republic and you have to 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.239
 remember that a new system is approaching 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.590
 frontal that I'm going to give something of 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.170
 precipitation in the north of coahuila 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.299
 but it will be really insignificant 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.120
 in the center is but we see a sky 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.560
 Partly cloudy in most of the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.940
 Center of the American republic maybe 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.069
 a little over half cloudy by the 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.900
 afternoon with moderate rainfall in 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.000
 most of the region much more 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.310
 scattered is likely towards what 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.530
 is the state of puebla can reach 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.049
 be even strong rainfall 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.970
 the morning temperatures cool and 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.400
 even some cold spots and in the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.959
 rest of the day tempered the atmosphere in the 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.599
 center that was dominated by the mass 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.250
 of cold air from front number 8 for the 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.010
 capital of the republic will travel that 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.329
 Friday this Saturday and this Sunday 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.940
 watch yourself temperatures that are going away 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.789
 recovering little by little from 1822 the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.430
 minimum the same can be from 9 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.260
 at 11 degrees celsius in the morning 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.960
 here in the capital of the republic 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.960
 American with some real precipitation 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.060
 very light and very scattered 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.490
 - possibility for Saturday and less 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.740
 possibility for Sunday but you 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.449
 we put in that condition because there is 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.919
 a little bit more a little the possibility 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.789
 it was more important that we have 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.180
 you of the meteorological service 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.180
 national
