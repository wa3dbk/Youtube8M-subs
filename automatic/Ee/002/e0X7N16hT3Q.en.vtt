00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello dear viewers with you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.180
 Calder and welcome to garry's mod 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.380
 I welcome you to this hot 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.410
 sunny day on the map Mr. construct 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.599
 today we 'll see what happens 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.779
 for garry's mod let's break it down 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.000
 functions and anything weight anything 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.890
 work out 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.529
 the smartest game garry's mod is 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.869
 physical sandbox on the source engine on 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.970
 the same on which to do half-life 2 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.140
 You are respectively counter-strike and 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.140
 many other companies 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.989
 as you know with the half-life with the second 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.210
 there is such a big connection here but 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.309
 not really important but will 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.550
 well if you win if you didnâ€™t play 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.340
 I do not care for example, I did not play and so did 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.230
 the main thing in the game is that we are nothing 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.829
 limits you can do anything 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.559
 everything is limited only by your imagination 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.949
 the most important button in the game is the button 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.699
 drink 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.010
 it brings up the spawn menu if you can 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.229
 compare different objects they will all be 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.270
 naturally obey all laws 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.130
 physicists you can interact with 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.229
 They also have a huge game 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.930
 many tools with which 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.110
 possible with these objects somehow 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.270
 interact with the twin game was not 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.890
 would be so great if there wasn't 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.880
 additions you can from the internet 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.820
 download absolutely all some here 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.250
 samples and here these are all objects behind the numbers 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.040
 You see how many categories here 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.520
 can download pro tools there 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.939
 don't know pis weapon anything and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.040
 this is the reason i bought 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.200
 license because steam is 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.610
 workshop 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.470
 now unfortunately I will press shift ap 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.360
 for some reason, we open but believe me 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.610
 to me 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.130
 directly from the workshop you can download and 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.640
 create absolutely anything there i'm 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.800
 I do not know the car and some mechanisms yes 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.020
 at least dock from dota 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.390
 Ottoman chick yet okay in an era are you not 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.270
 i need harris mod go like this 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.130
 probably in the spiritual these guys we 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.310
 you go directly to 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.310
 construction perhaps the most primitive 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.920
 what can you create in the game is some 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.750
 semblance of a car let's see how 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.470
 this is done open the menu 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.989
 spawn sheets and pick up something like 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.270
 the machine body is not for example mad 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.459
 I like the box perfectly 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.709
 also this one that i have in 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.550
 hand in this gun emitting autumn 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.150
 such a ray she is called a screech she 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.010
 allows you to move objects in the air 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.470
 rotate them in every way the axes in the bones and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.830
 freeze them i mean it hangs in 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.320
 air shift and they like a lens it 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.150
 very helpful in the interaction well 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.030
 let's start collecting our typewriter 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.280
 the body already has lift us higher 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.230
 Of course we need wheels here in 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.350
 standard tools harris mod 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:13.250
 there is a tool wheel you can choose 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.860
 wheel model and buttons on which 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.900
 it will work let's some 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.579
 set 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.829
 let's say this is his his here and the second 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.870
 put here as you see when we put 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.959
 the wheel shows us how and which 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.060
 side it will spin naturally 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.209
 on this side we need to change 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.760
 the direction of the wheel well, because on 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.599
 one case not poets objects she 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:48.290
 already spinning in the opposite direction and so 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:50.750
 Here is our blank, it can be created 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.780
 even ride but we need her 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.319
 it somehow controls it remotely therefore 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:02.060
 we look at here you can assign 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:05.299
 most buttons innovator on this figure 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.280
 eight this number 2 because here 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.049
 this know us cleverly pavia ture she 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.500
 full of wine and so called yes yes here I am 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:16.430
 hold button 8 she drives forward I clamp 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:20.139
 button 2 and now she is trying to drive back 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.599
 yes now she goes but here with the car we 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.510
 have finished such a thing 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:29.360
 bother to invent a system 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.090
 turning let's do it 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.110
 you make it very easy here with us 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.960
 there is a transport this turbine 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.930
 they say in the corners too 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.919
 model select buttons force effect sound 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.590
 anything 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:49.460
 we need not really strong tractor but 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.349
 let's say with but such a can let's 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.659
 test by the way you can still do 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:58.150
 rather, for the machine it will be like nitro 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:05:03.669
 assigned buttons yes just to speed up 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:06.009
 let there be a sex hall button called 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:11.710
 wet cats we put transport check 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:15.569
 everything needs work let's turn on yes not 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.699
 work on on too hard 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:25.899
 somehow that one could remember changing to 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:30.249
 go the portal as a force let's say now 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:33.189
 equal to four thousand we add up to 2 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:36.159
 600 but in everything and as if we are updating here 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:39.759
 change again we press and everything is there 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:43.360
 updated so or not wait 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:45.029
 loosened up gotten stronger 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.080
 the wheel we can also attract 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:52.899
 objects so wait what's the matter here two 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.589
 tractors already get their summertime now 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:55.589
 i will spare 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.740
 what 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:05.559
 nowhere is everything all right under 200 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:08.669
 ok but for turning we need more 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:18.610
 less power the state machine did not carry 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:22.119
 worth let's say the husband herself can enter before 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.449
 sotochku put will be fine and here 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:29.279
 this simple which will be you 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:34.929
 turn tailoring left put here on 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:39.300
 I forgot the button on the four and this one 

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:41.789
 times that the six 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.800
 Now we have created such 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:49.979
 elementary turning system 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:53.639
 see it in our nitro is not visible 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:56.159
 does something subway and steam turn than 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.860
 turn left to the right you can go 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:01.919
 at very convenient, I made a set because 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.550
 the car turns and you can even 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:08.300
 a little punching of course you need 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.500
 experiment pick up such more 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.500
 managed values but really 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:16.669
 so come down nicely the trick is that we 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:20.789
 created a car with you 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:22.949
 perhaps this was all with you calder 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:25.800
 think you will like it i will 

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:27.780
 several such episodes also don't forget 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.979
 that garry's mod is a multiplayer game 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:33.930
 that is, you can play with friends 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:35.699
 write like this collectively on yourself 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:41.060
 if you like leaving yours 

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:41.060
 comments with you about calder all bye
