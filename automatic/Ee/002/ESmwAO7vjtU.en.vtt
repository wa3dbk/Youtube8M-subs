 which is terrible horror sauce there 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.899

 many of them are stored in special 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.530
 fluid and started just disembarking on 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.400
 have to come up with something that will 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.960
 relate to the storage of this data 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.610
 the first thing that comes to mind is to go to 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.320

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.970
