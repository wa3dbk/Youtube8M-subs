my grandmother's

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.320 
my grandmother's
I<00:03:15.130> think<00:03:15.430> she<00:03:15.580> wants<00:03:15.820> them<00:03:15.940> back<00:03:16.120> though

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
I think she wants them back though

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.090 
I think she wants them back though
because<00:03:16.660> every<00:03:16.900> time<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.080> go<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.410> visit<00:03:17.680> her<00:03:17.890> at

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
because every time I go to visit her at

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.860 
because every time I go to visit her at
home<00:03:18.280> she<00:03:18.610> keeps<00:03:18.820> looking<00:03:18.970> around<00:03:19.180> for<00:03:19.570> him<00:03:19.690> I

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
home she keeps looking around for him I

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.360 
home she keeps looking around for him I
guess<00:03:20.140> maybe<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.500> should<00:03:20.769> have<00:03:20.890> asked<00:03:21.280> her

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
guess maybe I should have asked her

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.710 
guess maybe I should have asked her
before<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.670> took<00:03:21.730> them<00:03:22.060> but<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.330> was<00:03:22.450> just<00:03:22.600> afraid

before I took them but I was just afraid

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.690

she'd say no okay actually she's not my
real<00:03:24.730> grandmother<00:03:25.299> but<00:03:25.690> she<00:03:25.840> does<00:03:26.049> look<00:03:26.260> very

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
real grandmother but she does look very

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.410 
real grandmother but she does look very
