 women made the yard 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.130
 and with me 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.010
 it's not that Andalusian 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.810
 people only think about celebrating that is 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.520

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.410
 study work go abroad 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.900

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.390
 the beautiful sides of life too 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.880
