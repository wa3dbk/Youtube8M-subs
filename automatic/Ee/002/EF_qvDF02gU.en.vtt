connecting to someone else's server that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.859 
connecting to someone else's server that
they<00:01:44.280> made<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.759> they<00:01:44.880> may<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.360> take<00:01:45.509> down<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
they made so they may just take down the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.170 
they made so they may just take down the
server<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.130> guys<00:01:47.250> will<00:01:47.610> not<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.939> banned
