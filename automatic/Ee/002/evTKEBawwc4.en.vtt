 mediterranean what has allowed 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.179
 determine that in this species the 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.309
 growth stops at 13 degrees 

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:39.989
 centigrade temperature at which the 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:42.149

 that with this technique they have achieved

 unthinkable survivals until a

 year and copies that are twice as

 better natural conditions in the sea

 of the Galician and Mediterranean coast these 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.530
 results have opened new horizons 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.360
 of research since we have been 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.980
 suggested the hypothesis that the 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.020
 temperature could be a key factor 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.970
 to explain the fact that the species 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.890
 do not distribute further north of the 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.200
 Dutch coasts where temperatures 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.480
 of seawater are less than 13 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.640
 degrees centigrade these temperatures 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.680
 so low they would not allow a development 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.510
 suitable seahorses so 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.910
 than those of the Galician coasts and 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.110
 especially those of the Mediterranean 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.630
 they would be in clear advantage in front of their 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.610
 congeners of the Atlantic not for a 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.710
 part the availability of copies 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.990
 produced in captivity has allowed the 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.570
 incorporation of the first 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.400
 species within the framework of the aquarium 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.490
 a price that is around 60 90 euros 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.260
 exemplary this fact has caused a great 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.320
 excitement among fans to this 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.240

 the scientist comments on the other hand 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.980
 should facilitate the use of the species 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.170
 for scientific purposes and reduce the 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.340
 capture of wild specimens since 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.500
 It is prohibited when dealing with species 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.100
