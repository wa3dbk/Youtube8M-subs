 selection as you have seen this party 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.370
 It has been very important for us 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.800
 as a family to be in this moment 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.470
 It's so important to Camilo for 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.199
 selection for a country is a dream that 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.329
 it's coming true and very 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.949
 very happy to be here 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.290
 can also be with the others 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.960
 families can share and also be able to 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.640
 families feel that they feel 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.530
 the selection that is a family 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.390
 really is a team is a group that 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.640
 more than your co -workers are 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.580
 family we are very very happy to 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.350
 be able to be here and be able to share with 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.660
 them this important moment in their 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.580
 lives good don osvaldo has a 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.710
 problem in your knee a revision one 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.390
 torn ligaments but that has not 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.670
 impeded to be here with accompanying 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.320
 to your child as you have seen this moment of 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.259
 the selection to each new what has 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.179
 lived what experience you have felt 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.920
 good morning is the experience that 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.070
 I have lived here is 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.490
 familiar all this is a whole 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.570
 family here we all do strength by 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.000
 Our selection 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.290
 with the boys they have tried to 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.080
 maximum and all this is for them and I 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.520
 I felt really good here really and 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.530
 carolina that I did the support that has 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.500
 his brother made the rest of the team 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.580
 the selection as that has manifested 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.979
 your support of the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.840
 families here good afternoon is super 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.390
 important because it's not just the dream of 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.220
 23 players who are on the court but 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.959
 the one of more than 48 million Colombians 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.150
 it's super important for players 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.550
 be close to their families I think it's 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.500
 the greatest motivation and good I think 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.570
 like all Colombians every game 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.910
 we suffer we support them we encourage them 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.250
 until the last minute and I know that Colombia 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.350
 has a lot to do in this world 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.700
 from brasil-2014 how these have been 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.530
 angelic moments 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.650
 when they can already be with the players 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.110
 they can already share can be and 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.660
 dialogue about more familiar things like 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.540
 those moments have been very very very 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.790
 good or they gave us as energy 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.830
 because since having a baby like them 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.799
 grow by leaps and bounds or for the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.940
 a month of development in your child is a lot 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.560
 weather 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.170
 is the power to be as you can usually 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.390
 share that is already crawling that is 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.310
 eating more then that I think is 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.840
 what a player fills it up to be able to 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.300
 with their families and to share with 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.650
 your children that is the most important thing up 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.280
 where do you think this will come 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.510
 selection is not worth I think that the 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.010
 team reaches quarters as well as goes to 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.420
 world I think we can get to 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.580
 rooms with the number of effort they 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.250
 although they are doing the maximum but 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.620
 I believe and I have faith that we just 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.390
 get to the quarterfinals and carolina 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.770
 I thought that soon the family and 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.110
 players may be living this 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.690
 dream can be here accompanying them and 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.010
 maybe go much further than what 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.920
 we had all in the head in Colombia 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.480
 well really not but thanks to 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.000
 inseparable fans of the entire campaign 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.710
 that has been done we achieved that 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.860
 each player could share with their 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.900
 families and not that I think the biggest 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.580
 motivation of all the players and 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.530
 thanks to all the companies that 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.630
 they were part of this project that 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.460
 we can be here sharing with them 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.800
 and especially because Colombia is going to go to 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.840
 the final they are inseparable fans 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.270
 they are the family of the arquero camilo vargas 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.959
 and they're supporting the players here 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.790
 the colombia national team from brazil 2014 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.600
 edo reds and césar polanía because the country 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.600
 Is worldwide
