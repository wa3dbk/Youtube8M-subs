 o come to yes hi we will altogether 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.950

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.890
 long time not doing that cooking 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.830
 scrambled eggs no we will talk today about 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.730
 how to switch the box lever 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.180
 gears mechanically it may not be necessary 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.099
 need a century 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.710
 it is necessary well what is your show what's here 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.989
 switch how to do it first come on 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.770
 talk about how to hold your hand 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.350
 Violations if the car is ordinary 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.309
 passenger car with the low-slung 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.320
 a hand 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.629
 more convenient to put here and so it is on the side of 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.829
 lever thumb up y and the rest 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.739
 embrace my fingers . 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.780
 but not much to compress if that's how this 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.320
 car he high-fit tube 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.180
 You can keep it like that from above and just 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.480
 palm is the top of the main thing that you 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.000
 a lever from under the arm and a bowl still about and this 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.010
 what kind of tsiferki probably 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.480
 gear numbers yes these are gear numbers 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.680
 by the way here 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.450
 speak it specifically here shemka 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.880
 I threw you see this so here 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.730
 to switch everything is drawn here more 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.520
 that well, well, first drawn not always 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.220
 and secondly, when we drive and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.480
 where we look at the road to us once 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.940
 look at the gear lever 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.040
 therefore we must feel therefore 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.380
 Now you and I will learn first 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 check the neutral position of the lever 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.280
 gearbox 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.670
 giving study so look here this 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.740
 the line is the neutral line 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.210
 gearshift lever 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.820
 the lever here if it does not touch it 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.050
 is this one here 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.360
 lever up here and so to check 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.520
 is there a lever in this in this 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.680
 position need to push it here and 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:59.700
 then relax your hand and he will return 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.120
 here, here, try the only one 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.300
 moment 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.610
 mistake when you hand it here and pull 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.260
 returns back that is exactly necessary 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.260
 so he came back himself 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.080
 and if you have a car and it is not 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.670
 happens means you have a faulty 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.310
 faulty backstage need to be repaired 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.960
 Well, enough already show how to transfer 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.150
 hold on 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.160
 all and keep the man no narrow put 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.880
 hand on the lever all mean now pull up 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.150
 see here 1 2 forward 1 let's push a 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.090
 back 2 forward 1 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.890
 2's girlfriend back then Pay 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.660
 attention that you need constantly 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.490
 hold the lever to yourself because 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.890
 if you relax your hand he is with you 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.410
 will jump back and that's why maybe 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.230
 turn on either 3 or 4 flights due 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:54.030
 this and confused instead of 1 include the third 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:55.790
 and instead of 2 4 3 or 4 gears even easier 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.530
 turn on your hand 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.400
 nothing is not done simply pushes 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.510
 forward 3 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.090
 just pull back 4 do i just 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.910
 remind everyone that if you even 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.860
 strain your hand a little and not a little 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.480
 go there your efforts 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.520
 then you either do not turn on at all 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.800
 transmission because it doesn't get stuck 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.610
 rocker or you can even if too 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.460
 strongly you can press instead of 3 binge 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.250
 Now the most difficult from second to third 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.850
 Well, include second gear means 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.470
 see we 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.480
 to turn the third 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.340
 need push and lever translation 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.120
 relax your hand so he went here and 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.190
 include the third 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.620
 The truth here is so but the third should be 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.160
 turn off pull up to yourself and turn on 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.530
 Tuesday 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:48.320
 come on come and sing and 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:52.620
 pulled myself 2 turned off let go 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:04:00.090
 turned on fun pulled 2 here 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:02.640
 practice your well and 5 how to enable 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.709
 in order to enable the fifth one 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.180
 palm 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.490
 flip it like that 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.720
 conveniently pushes away well so much 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.750
 don't be like that 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.490
 pushed aside and just turn 5 on to 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.109
 turn off and pull the hand like this should 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.420
 to be you just to your body she is only 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.859
 don't slip to 100 skills and you can 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.850
 include the fourth fourth or if 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.919
 pull to yourself 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.060
 then 2 or 1 it depends on 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.090
 speed 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.740
 Well, dear viewers, we talked 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.990
 how to shift gears 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.300
 forward turn up talked about pro 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.050
 rear why not know about the rear 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.600
 especially the transfer is not worth 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.390
 why why because there is always there 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.740
 some kind of secret first it turns on 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.930
 can in different directions 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.550
 The secret lies in the fact that there can not be 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.160
 I just inclusive pull something up 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.270
 hand or somehow press the lever or on 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.430
 push harder 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.830
 and why such difficulties because 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.240
 reverse gear cannot be engaged 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.050
 when you move it is imperative 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.650
 stop if you need to turn it on while standing 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.900
 in place 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.600
 I can see nothing difficult in this 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.140
 sort it out yourself so let's 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.300
 saying goodbye 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.750
 Well, I forgive the crustacean and not with me 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.750
 the spectator so to new meetings
