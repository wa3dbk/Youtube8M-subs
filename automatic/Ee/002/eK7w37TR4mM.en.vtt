 here is access to a high esteem 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.250
 tends from there you go 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.209
 to be able to play so we will 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.130
 find in game for the future 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.819

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.800
 so nancy nancy you have done well there but 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.769
 nor to launch steam before launching the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.739
 multiplayer game will not be gray so 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.060
 we are in version 1.600 so here we are 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.670
 there we come to the part where I go 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.030
 explain how to play in store 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.610
 friends 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.810
 so that's nothing actually looking for 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.360
 online part 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.319
 the parties that will be found you 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.959
 will not be able to join them 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.489
 it is true that I show you lan network 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.540
 I've never done maybe so unless 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.849
 you are no longer at home that can 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.799
 to walk but in any case I was looking for 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.170
 parties online when you click you 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.420
 make it join it does not work ben 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.640
 already two dead ends that the versions the 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.709
 serna for 7 points 3 times ago 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.109
 god of 1.6.0 but when I joined 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.459
 sam was gone by storm and so I 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.410
 explain how to reach your 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.180
 clothes so just have to host 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.700
 a party you can put a pastis 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.160
 you want before you go 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.450
 then you choose the debt 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.010
 history or one of your backups and 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.350
 you will give 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.109
 yes at the address here servers that on 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.479
 e4 loudly let your mouse if 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.070
 you let your mouse if during and 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.440
 you see an address that's the idea of 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.810
 server and this idea you're going to give 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.190
 to your friend so that he will replay you and 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.539
 so he has the idea he's going back to school 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.220
 in multiplayer I want to tell you 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.880
 exactly to the good 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.230
 not silly for not finally found no I 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.300
 do not say it's silly if you find 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.920
 not so here and he will put it here 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.200
 the idea of ​​the server if you put a 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.930
 password it will put the mup too so 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.340
 here he will put the idea of ​​Serbian or that 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.050
 now I was explaining something to you 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.030
 general when we give the idea there when 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.580
 we launch the game all that when you have 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.620
 launched the game you had been playing yourself 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.810
 create the part then give you 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.090
 the address to your friend and he'll get 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.110
 connect except that normally finally me 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.840
 it happens to me all the time it does not work 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.270
 not there is going to be marked from all 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.430
 found 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.870
 the part does not exist so what it 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.610
 must do is that you who created 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.860
 at the party you do re everything and that's at 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.190
 him to create the party and he will you 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.790
 give his idea of servers and it will be up to 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.460
 you're back 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.050
 a pump there I created the part I him 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.200
 give the address he tries to get 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:30.780
 connect up 1909 feel something 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:35.530
 that's blue hole would join he joins 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.100
 so these business are connecting and that does not 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.650
 will not work 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.140
 the corn corn we share I like and moinard 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.220
 years it never sounds when 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.940
 I try to join the first time 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:49.410
 during one instance two parts that 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.410
 does not work it's a little time 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.260
 so it takes a little bit of time so 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.900
 gone and did not find that will make you 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.010
 so from that moment it's 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.350
 as if there was a connection that 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.860
 was that was created between you two 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.240
 so you do re everything is so the one 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.700
 who hosted the party for example you 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.140
 you are doing everything to turn in the 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.340
 multiplayer menu and you tell your 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:16.980
 friend to create the party he makes banks of the 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.470
 host server and he will give you the idea 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.630
 that he has and this time it will be up to you to 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.550
 connect to his idea and this time 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.970
 it's going to work 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:30.390
 I hope it was pretty clear I'm going 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.010
 try to redo the diagram we go 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:36.950
 redo the diagram up I arrive 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:40.980
 multiplayer host a high party 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.500
 I give the address so he tries to 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.830
 connect it does not work you do 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.830
 too much 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:57.289
 multiplayer they give you the idea you 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:00.380
 you connect to join and that 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.150
 will not work that I hope that you 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.050
 will have pleased 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.060
 I hope it will also help you to 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.340
 to be able to play in multi especially do not hesitate 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.900
 not to post comments if you 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.139
 want to play with me if I have time 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.190
 maybe we can play together 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.259
 make small parties friendly 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:19.190
 judge very quickly particles 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:22.130
 done is with friends for example 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.539
 this part where we are far enough 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:28.009
 we have in 1740 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:31.090
 it's almost spent 300 employees 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:34.610
 committee we can do some giant stuff 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:36.380
 so I have germany is my friend to 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.240
 years when at the beginning the bramble and 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.669
 little tricks and in the beginning Germany beats 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.039
 I had Brandenburg we can see that the 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.330
 France will still be strong here that we 

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:46.759
 can see that in america this is the 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.250
 brothel and that brittany that has 

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:53.690
 colonies Russia that is gigantic 

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:54.740
 be normal what and the self is missing that 

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.090
 is still big enough but who 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.110
 was a little last seven 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:03.349
 time otherwise it will be all about this game 

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.940
 tell you to fart more stake if we go 

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:08.169
