00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.939
 injury 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:03.370
 c 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.370
 this goal him 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.069
 yes yes 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:15.399
 as for herself 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.230
 remember we can miss 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.810
 at one point that's it 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.810
 my name it comes alive fans of the national team 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.970
 but what do I see that I have done since 1997 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.289
 as explained a certain moment I think the football of the new 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:35.590
 generation 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.200
 physical that can incite 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.590
 times for some penetrating force 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.890
 over his companion laure murat players 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.670
 the two quality points 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.620
 after that it's true that if we talk about a global 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.640
 the level of a world is baffled 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.210
 a certain moment you have to put constants 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.080
 because football new generation of fields 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.220
 we had players holes 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.220
 everything was in place 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.890
 trades 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.870
 it's the same thing in a team 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.170
 level of posts 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.490
 the players have arrived 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.240
 it takes up space for everyone 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.670
 we respect all the Algerian players who operates 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.770
 in this national team that represented the national team 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 but towards a qualification 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.470
 we must stop the feelings 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.890
 behind the feelings 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.820
 mention always starts with the same team because 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.020
 there was we are going to say 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.470
 remember we journey 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.360
 long matches there are players who have attended every game 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.970
 according to fo on world cup detection 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.920
 in matters 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.070
 the opponent the competition the competition to progress 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.220
 for the world cup if I could make a team like I scored 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.740
 it's a team 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.970
 yes to all these qualities there the physical 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.380
 penetration force 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.810
 liveliness 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.530
 painful angry who takes 4 5% 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.270
 I have great respect for Mr. Saadane for the horses team 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.920
 national 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.440
 but giving that my opinion 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.530
 as a supporter 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.290
 I like all the players of the national team 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.790
 you are always supported 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.570
 but if i can be good with eads with myself 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.949
 magic a team 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.339
 4 5% so I put in goals 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:11.769
 symbolic work 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.269
 in March it's a guardian of the future 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.619
 we know very well that big clubs want it 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:18.599
 I think it should be put in the bath this article 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.970
 embarrassing him because if the forest some tactics 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:24.139
 but I think that 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.599
 imposes itself imposes he speaks much less 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.109
 so that's fine 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.909
 for a caretaker who talks a lot about his defense 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.799
 after I put the defender 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.239
 in 4th place 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.660
 this four-stop stopper defense that are 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.209
 bougherra halliche 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.209
 still to say on a year on this earth 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.159
 we want to demonstrate to 1 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.139
 in a ticket showed us a bike ride from Montreal 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.289
 pretty much everywhere 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.789
 Bougherra is a boss in Scotland l chine revelation in Algeria 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:56.329
 parties and portugal 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.679
 we take a hat trick 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.999
 here is a beautiful right-handed dog will produce for me it's shine is named 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.249
 captain 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.769
 on the coast 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.019
 i updated division 2 carl medjani 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.919
 in division 2 in French national league very difficult 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.199
 for defenders 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.359
 I say it's people who do not walk 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.859
 not walk the piece 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.179
 he was a good player for games like slovenia yesterday 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.049
 for england and america 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.699
 medjani which is very fast 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:24.809
 I put my foot 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:25.969
 bourgeois jack sion 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.889
 agrochemistry free nothing to say we all know him 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.399
 gold this word without england 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:32.399
 it's a boss 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.889
 after I put quick lines on the sides 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.679
 if you see well I put 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:39.579
 on offensive orly 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.589
 before talking about the recuperators 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:44.589
 I put three offensive midfielders right matmour 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:46.649
 andy serkis friends 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.599
 the left debbouze 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.949
 e there is youth well speed 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.389
 but for the moment it is necessary for the fourrent must test it is necessary to test 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.709
 challenged for his text so that it will go fast 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.849
 with only djebbour 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.429
 it's someone who is bringing back a lot of defenders on his side 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:05.919
 it will allow us to open 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.729
 bhp on deep coma 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.210
 who can think second striker 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.429
 in a harmless this big day 4 5 ha on line offensive because k2 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:15.629
 riboud and boussoufa 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.049
 you see well we have 10 cases minutes he had two opportunities 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.419
 people do not laugh 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.960
 employment preach mitu recuperator 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.470
 at the time the great respect I have for yazid mansouri is with the 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.479
 new generation recuperators 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.400
 yesterday was a bit of old style bossa saÃ¯b 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.110
 it's guys who must quickly move forward 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.689
 in Asia but various scene is really a boss 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.669
 quickly advance the ball forward is someone very technical and 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:40.669
 various scenes 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.120
 but we imagine that m second recuperator who is very very strong 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.830
 physically and that at the same time as technical because 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.419
 in a line of recovery requires great talented players 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.529
 a little surprised rare if finished the little details 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.330
 now we live the scene when you see are very very high 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.569
 and we have ten hectares it's really a boss and when you see it well 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:00.410
 snowy years 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.580
 we often hear 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.719
 offensively we get you back 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:07.679
 mount an attacked the fed a center for the halls that almost scored the 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:10.680
 second goal is someone who is very strong so when you see this 

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:11.259
 team 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.689
 it's beefy we feel that it's a consistency that what I did 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.409
 watch out i'm not the coach 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.759
 That's what I say 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:19.930
 after I put 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.659
 bunning in front of substitute jimena middle recuperator who is very strong 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.780
 because at some point if we see that with wounded internet 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.819
 you have to be strong 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:28.809
 I would be wrong 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:31.960
 I tell him you're tall it's really someone in England we saw 

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:32.880
 to be born package 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.469
 it's called liners we prepare for the future 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.579
 the practical consequences of this opportunity for the start of the school year for all 

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:39.550
 technician 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.420
 it takes someone who reads the left side 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.270
 the police his post at nantes it hurts a lot 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.219
 but after it takes 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:47.110
 the attacker 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.039
 additional physical 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.650
 we will play a last half hour 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.990
 instead of djebbour 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.069
 these weapons 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.370
 and from there we saw this team 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.449
 it's really a team 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:58.729
 as well as the beefy 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.249
 because you have to go 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:04.139
 if I was a beefy team his feeling 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.119
 that is my opinion 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:07.529
 I know it weighs heavy this team 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:10.740
 you will hear it at the whim 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.740
 it will please me I say to not please 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.669
 I hope we will make a good world cup now some but not 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.480
 for his team with his composition bachar oven with him 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.009
 whenever the Algerian team 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.689
 I am thoroughly with all the players that I encourage 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.689
 it's team I did it's just a team of the future 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.189
 signs that can not there 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:36.319
 she offers on terra shale because apple 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.319
 while fans who love the Algerian team 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.539
 I made a team like that it's not because we kill my intention 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:44.080
 accessible 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.159
 you have to be realistic you have to tell the truth 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:47.839
 I hope you will follow me 

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:51.110
 because I am a supporter of the Algerian team for years 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.219
 I saw tonight 

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:55.309
 that because I like a little far - when I do something 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:56.149
 because we are 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.819
 it is for our country Algeria 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:06:59.710
 once he takes with our country 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.399
 even blow fans tell you yourself 

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.599
 we do not want feeling 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:05.689
 not for me if I encourage ciani 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:07.030
 watchmouse who wanted 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.860
 I encourage him by his players I encourage him to manage it 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.159
 he represents Algeria 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:13.899
 but one day or another they will leave their place to other players 

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:15.319
 the 500 passengers 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:17.350
 by cons when I turned it on 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.930
 in front of caen Saturday, May 30 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.330
 when you play for Algeria 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.680
 not everyone knows how to handle 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.360
 from there I hope you all understood one out of three rooms for 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.530
 cheaper it's a drama
