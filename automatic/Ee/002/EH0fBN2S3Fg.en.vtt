things are being built at the moment I'm
finishing<00:02:22.400> up<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.970> pathway<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:24.079> the<00:02:24.200> DC<00:02:24.410> gate

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
finishing up the pathway to the DC gate

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.590 
finishing up the pathway to the DC gate

some<00:02:49.250> little<00:02:50.250> features<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.880> there<00:02:51.060> if<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:52.320> can

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
some little features in there if you can

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.760 
some little features in there if you can
find<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.600> yeah<00:02:54.600> well<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.320> video<00:02:55.620> they

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
even know you will see where it is I

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.610 
even know you will see where it is I
actually<00:03:02.910> told<00:03:03.240> somebody<00:03:03.480> exactly<00:03:04.350> where<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
League there's out satellite tower thing

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.990 
League there's out satellite tower thing
yeah<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.680> watchtower<00:03:26.070> I'd<00:03:26.220> actually<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.820> put

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
yeah the watchtower I'd actually I put

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.150 
yeah the watchtower I'd actually I put
that<00:03:27.030> into<00:03:27.240> this<00:03:27.390> video<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.160> completed

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
that into this video to the completed

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.340 
that into this video to the completed
out<00:03:29.400> exterior<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.480> that's<00:03:30.630> that's<00:03:31.200> going

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
out exterior of it that's that's going

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.630 
out exterior of it that's that's going
to<00:03:31.410> be<00:03:31.470> able<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.680> top<00:03:31.860> I'm<00:03:32.040> actually<00:03:32.280> probably

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
to be able to top I'm actually probably

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640 
to be able to top I'm actually probably
probably<00:03:33.540> already<00:03:33.720> flown<00:03:34.050> through<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.470> by

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
probably already flown through that by

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.760 
probably already flown through that by
now<00:03:34.880> yeah<00:03:35.880> that's<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.330> bottom<00:03:36.690> or<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.410> bottom

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
now yeah that's the bottom or the bottom

now yeah that's the bottom or the bottom
of<00:03:37.890> its<00:03:38.010> toe<00:03:38.250> up<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:38.580> air<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:38.910> rata<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.900> hit

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
of its toe up in the air I rata I hit

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.110 
of its toe up in the air I rata I hit
the<00:03:40.950> barrier<00:03:42.140> building<00:03:43.140> height<00:03:43.890> wise<00:03:44.100> so<00:03:44.970> now

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
the barrier building height wise so now

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.690 
the barrier building height wise so now
I<00:03:45.150> have<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:46.080> have<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.440> build<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:47.010> remains<00:03:47.520> on

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
I have to I have to build the remains on

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.500 
I have to I have to build the remains on
the<00:03:47.730> ground<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.250> tore<00:03:50.640> down<00:03:50.820> some<00:03:51.330> of<00:03:51.420> my

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
the ground so I tore down some of my

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.390 
the ground so I tore down some of my
wall<00:03:51.720> or<00:03:51.960> I'm<00:03:52.110> currently<00:03:52.500> tearing<00:03:52.800> down<00:03:53.010> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
wall or I'm currently tearing down the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.000 
wall or I'm currently tearing down the
wall<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:53.960> I'm<00:03:54.960> starting<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.470> build<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:55.770> but
