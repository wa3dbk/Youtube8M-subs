00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:12.500
 the exercise now is used a lot in 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:16.400
 joy guajira or dances and from 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.160
 12 times in truth as for late 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.000
 is to take the gown from one diagonal to another 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.070
 agree then I will do for 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.240
 example some arms though they could do 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.110
 otherwise 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.560
 ok what overwhelmed him first would be to make half 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.560
 here 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.790
 around here on the right and by the 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.000
 left that would be on the right side 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.000
 for the opposite then the same 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 left 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:00.320
 ok i do sunk brittle yes yes 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.200
 what if you see it worth then it is not 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.449
 difficult but if it's maybe it's difficult to 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.070
 control the gown that does not leave me what 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.740
 only I do 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:16.400
 when on the one hand I need to move the foot 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:19.040
 of base I do a course to take it from me 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.450
 with the other one with the other leg 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:28.160
 and as you see I need to move by the same 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.920
 plant for pushing skeg 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.250
 paten support heel that pushes for 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.820
 back heel that pushes for supports 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.820
 heel that pushes back is worth bony 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:48.140
 could be but I would always lose the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.330
 balance that I make while I raise 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.880
 the robe I advise you to be the minimum 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.780
 time that I lift and push taro 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.280
 Place the foot lift and push the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.520
 heel back 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.520
 OK 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.049
 poked on one side and on the other you got 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.220
 for this part quote from the flyers 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.140
 turns and I take it by this part appointment of 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.450
 the ball 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.010
 and the same thing that we said in another 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.900
 I try not to pass the robe 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:26.720
 because if I do not take it fatally the second 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.240
 It has to be this entity 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.810
 it's like in one direction and in other 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:37.520
 sometimes the point here and we make 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.640
 around here as here is worth the 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.370
 arm really helps 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.560
 is the torso game we make or 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.180
 gossip or waist as we want 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.630
 work is on the one hand and poked 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.760
 on the other hand, on the one hand and I assume 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.760
 column another is worth this medium 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.629
 and this means is the game of shoulders there 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.269
 to do it because it helps in this medium and 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:12.150
 this means is valid for the other side 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.150
 exactly the same would be this shoulder 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:22.250
 This is my side and another side 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.250
 agree then to work it
