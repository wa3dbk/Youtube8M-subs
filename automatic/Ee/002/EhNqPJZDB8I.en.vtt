00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.350
 I had boys 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.150
 here we are again a video today vi 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.520
 i will show you how to put these apps that 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.620
 I had shown in the previous sub 2 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.390
 when we go to copy rescue of 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.830
 two are for any usb stick one 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.680
 Once copied we connect the stick 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.750
 usb to the computer and then run in the 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.210
 program of which I will of course put them 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.960
 linking description let's go to the 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.640
 key we offer this folder with 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.829
 their rescue 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.909
 we have the program 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:53.440
 select the folder containing the area 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:56.079
 radius this given this looks and a 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.269
 once you do these things we have this 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.879
 text files also only there too 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:05.210
 of this file sun description where 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:09.400
 the various codes will be kept 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:15.310
 yes varisco dc for the various 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:18.500
 we are the first for example with under the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:23.300
 own currency in this case 0 then 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.360
 you need to make doilies and insert the 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.009
 save and the code the with 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.259
 but there are really many promo codes 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.229
 with everyone they work on the sad face 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:38.179
 Once done all we fileserve 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.220
 we go to replace the rescue 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:44.570
 which then proceed the normal one with 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.580
 what we say mounted 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.150
 replace now we can very well 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.220
 get back on ps3 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:58.750
 where we're going to copy the save 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.280
 modified this fate on the person 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.280
 usb triangle copy device 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 replace 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.790
 let's say that 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.219
 I do not know 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.079
 here now I will show you these fads 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:24.180
 let's say you touch us deliver 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:27.450
 meanwhile we open in this way in the meantime 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.209
 only that zombie campaign works 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.329
 or other things just giving multiple notes 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:37.310
 for the campaign here 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:44.720
 we open the game of course the game 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:48.659
 that needs to be taken over and the bosses have committed 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.109
 I think the shutter speed is also 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:55.859
 they give credit when you fly 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:58.470
 let's say he did it outside with super 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.900
 Sardinian and now I don't want you at all in 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.650
 field of a crisis 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.140
 I lose 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.849
 the guys write to me I like it because it is 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.230
 liked even though that was grades 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.629
