so familiar unit tester and I'm going to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.790 
so familiar unit tester and I'm going to
be<00:00:21.720> showing<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.169> little<00:00:22.439> bit<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.619> micro

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
be showing you a little bit of micro

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.400 
be showing you a little bit of micro
today<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.610> the<00:00:24.509> concept<00:00:24.960> we're<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.259> to<00:00:25.320> be

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
today and the concept we're going to be

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.460 
today and the concept we're going to be
covering<00:00:25.680> today<00:00:25.919> is<00:00:27.169> basically<00:00:28.169> just<00:00:28.200> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
covering today is basically just the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040 
covering today is basically just the
idea<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.829> pulling<00:00:29.340> back<00:00:29.700> units<00:00:30.119> before<00:00:30.689> they

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
idea of pulling back units before they

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.749 
idea of pulling back units before they
die<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:31.890> sending<00:00:32.250> them<00:00:32.309> back<00:00:32.430> into

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
die and then sending them back into

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.610 
die and then sending them back into
battle<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.149> fight<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.140> reason<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.559> is

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
battle to fight and the reason this is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.790 
battle to fight and the reason this is
so<00:00:34.770> effective<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:36.540> unit<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.469> one

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
so effective is because a unit with one

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.119 
so effective is because a unit with one
HP<00:00:38.059> does<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.540> much<00:00:39.719> damage<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.290> unit<00:00:40.649> with

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
HP does just as much damage as unit with

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.970 
HP does just as much damage as unit with
max<00:00:41.879> HP<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.960> want<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.320> keep<00:00:43.530> all<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.829> your

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
max HP so you want to keep all of your

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.889 
max HP so you want to keep all of your
units<00:00:44.399> alive<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:44.969> long<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.149> possible<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
units alive for as long as possible and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.650 
units alive for as long as possible and
keep<00:00:46.109> them<00:00:46.350> attacking<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.129> battle<00:00:47.660> so

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
keep them attacking in the battle so

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.180 
keep them attacking in the battle so
basically<00:00:49.170> you're<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.499> to<00:00:49.559> try<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.769> spread

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
basically you're going to try to spread

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.799 
basically you're going to try to spread
out<00:00:50.399> your<00:00:50.550> damage<00:00:50.910> among<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.300> units<00:00:51.659> as

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.349 
out your damage among your units as
evenly<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.320> possible<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.070> especially<00:00:53.909> I'm

battle this should be quite even every
once<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> while<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.979> know

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
once in a while you know

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.850 
once in a while you know
one<00:01:24.270> side<00:01:24.720> will<00:01:24.900> get<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> slight<00:01:25.350> edge<00:01:25.530> over<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
one side will get a slight edge over the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.540 
one side will get a slight edge over the
other<00:01:25.980> but<00:01:26.420> basically<00:01:27.740> eight<00:01:28.740> stalkers<00:01:29.220> vs

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
other but basically eight stalkers vs

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.780 
other but basically eight stalkers vs
eight<00:01:30.000> stalkers<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.440> come<00:01:31.620> down<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.040> one

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
eight stalkers going to come down to one

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.610 
eight stalkers going to come down to one
or<00:01:32.970> two<00:01:33.090> stalkers<00:01:33.390> fighting<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.230> out<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
or two stalkers fighting it out to the

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.649 
or two stalkers fighting it out to the
end

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
end

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.130 

so<00:01:37.399> yeah<00:01:38.399> looks<00:01:38.999> like<00:01:39.119> Reds<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.929> to<00:01:39.990> come

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
so yeah looks like Reds going to come

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.559 
so yeah looks like Reds going to come
out<00:01:40.200> slightly<00:01:40.560> ahead<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.819> by<00:01:41.939> much<00:01:42.119> so

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
out slightly ahead but not by much so

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.809 
out slightly ahead but not by much so
we're<00:01:43.170> going<00:01:43.289> to<00:01:43.380> restart<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:44.069> and<00:01:44.310> this

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
we're going to restart this and this

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.580 
we're going to restart this and this
time<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.539> be<00:01:45.719> my<00:01:45.899> crowing<00:01:46.289> this

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
pretty well this works for basically any

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.179 
pretty well this works for basically any
type<00:02:41.629> of<00:02:41.659> unit<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.110> could<00:02:42.319> be<00:02:42.439> a<00:02:42.470> male<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.860> unit

type of unit this could be a male a unit

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.690

I<00:02:46.819> chose<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.269> do<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.540> with<00:02:47.750> stalkers<00:02:48.049> is<00:02:48.470> just

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
I chose to do this with stalkers is just

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.550 
I chose to do this with stalkers is just
to<00:02:48.860> show<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.159> how<00:02:49.519> effective<00:02:50.140> blink<00:02:51.140> can<00:02:51.409> be

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
to show you how effective blink can be

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.800 
to show you how effective blink can be
because<00:02:51.799> blink<00:02:52.069> is<00:02:52.280> basically<00:02:53.209> assist<00:02:53.569> you<00:02:53.720> in

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
doing this rather than have to run them

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.490 
doing this rather than have to run them
back<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:56.209> can<00:02:56.359> just<00:02:56.480> blink<00:02:56.840> back<00:02:57.049> behind<00:02:57.290> the

these<00:03:23.280> stalkers<00:03:23.610> are<00:03:23.910> in<00:03:24.030> such<00:03:24.330> low<00:03:24.660> health

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
these stalkers are in such low health

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.450 
these stalkers are in such low health
but<00:03:25.200> that's<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.560> way<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.740> want<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.220> be<00:03:26.250> at

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
but that's the way you want it to be at

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.190 
but that's the way you want it to be at
the<00:03:26.550> end<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.880> battle<00:03:27.210> rather<00:03:27.720> than<00:03:27.840> having<00:03:28.080> a

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
the end of a battle rather than having a

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.260 
the end of a battle rather than having a
smaller<00:03:28.530> number<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:28.950> units<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.970> couple

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
smaller number of units and a couple

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.390 
smaller number of units and a couple
more<00:03:30.420> more<00:03:30.870> health<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:31.710> I<00:03:31.740> hope<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.340> was

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
more more health so I hope that was

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.150 
more more health so I hope that was
