stuff<00:01:57.899> all<00:01:58.079> together<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.770> same<00:01:59.009> exact

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
stuff all together at the same exact

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.310 
stuff all together at the same exact
time<00:02:00.770> pretty<00:02:01.770> simple<00:02:02.040> plane<00:02:02.430> pretty<00:02:02.969> big

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
time pretty simple plane pretty big

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.440 
time pretty simple plane pretty big
let's<00:02:04.320> try<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> go<00:02:04.740> ahead<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.040> land<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.670> I'm

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
let's try to go ahead and land this I'm

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.160 
let's try to go ahead and land this I'm
not<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.899> best<00:02:07.110> pilot<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> world

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.230 

let's<00:02:11.530> try<00:02:11.920> not<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.250> break<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.490> yeah<00:02:12.820> let's<00:02:12.970> try

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
let's try not to break it yeah let's try

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.240 
let's try not to break it yeah let's try
at<00:02:13.390> least<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.720> Landis<00:02:14.200> where's<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.620> landing<00:02:15.100> oh

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
at least a Landis where's the landing oh

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.700 
at least a Landis where's the landing oh
there<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.840> perfect<00:02:16.900> maybe<00:02:17.080> we<00:02:17.230> going<00:02:17.500> back

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
there it is perfect maybe we going back

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.560 
there it is perfect maybe we going back
down<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.280> ground<00:02:18.520> we<00:02:18.670> you're<00:02:19.210> gonna<00:02:19.360> set

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
down on the ground we you're gonna set

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.650 
down on the ground we you're gonna set
this<00:02:19.660> baby<00:02:19.840> back<00:02:20.260> down<00:02:20.940> pop<00:02:21.940> open<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.420> wheels

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
this baby back down pop open the wheels

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.980 
this baby back down pop open the wheels
here<00:02:23.380> they<00:02:23.530> go<00:02:23.740> out<00:02:24.420> seems<00:02:25.420> like<00:02:25.570> we<00:02:25.690> can<00:02:25.840> do

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
here they go out seems like we can do

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.780 
here they go out seems like we can do
this<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.500> seems<00:02:26.770> like<00:02:26.860> we<00:02:27.100> can<00:02:27.250> do<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.640> I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
this it seems like we can do this I

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.210 
this it seems like we can do this I
don't<00:02:27.850> think<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.180> have<00:02:28.300> enough<00:02:28.330> runway
