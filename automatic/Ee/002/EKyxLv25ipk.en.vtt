what<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.220> like<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.700> do<00:04:42.880> is<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.180> like<00:04:43.480> to<00:04:43.540> just

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.490 
what I like to do is I like to just
spray<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:44.889> down<00:04:45.490> there<00:04:45.850> so<00:04:46.120> coach<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:46.930> our

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500

spray it down there so coach and our
pitch<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.700> then<00:04:49.030> what<00:04:49.180> you<00:04:49.330> do<00:04:49.480> is<00:04:49.510> you<00:04:49.810> move

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
pitch and then what you do is you move

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.350 
pitch and then what you do is you move
it<00:04:50.140> up<00:04:50.290> and<00:04:50.560> down<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:51.040> can<00:04:51.070> get<00:04:51.370> through<00:04:51.669> the

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
it up and down so it can get through the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.230 
it up and down so it can get through the
hole<00:04:52.630> so<00:04:53.320> there's<00:04:53.650> in<00:04:53.890> there<00:04:54.250> that's<00:04:54.730> a<00:04:54.940> little

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
hole so there's in there that's a little

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
hole so there's in there that's a little
hole<00:04:55.450> where<00:04:56.050> the<00:04:56.290> UM<00:04:56.910> metal<00:04:57.910> bar<00:04:58.419> thing<00:04:58.960> goes

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
hole where the UM metal bar thing goes

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.230 
hole where the UM metal bar thing goes
so<00:04:59.740> you've<00:05:00.010> got<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.310> move<00:05:00.490> it<00:05:00.610> up<00:05:00.700> and<00:05:00.910> down<00:05:00.970> if

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
so you've got to move it up and down if

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.830 
so you've got to move it up and down if
you<00:05:01.390> if<00:05:01.630> it<00:05:01.990> hurts<00:05:02.260> don't<00:05:02.940> make<00:05:03.940> it<00:05:04.210> you<00:05:04.570> just

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
you if it hurts don't make it you just

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.260 
you if it hurts don't make it you just
want<00:05:05.020> to<00:05:05.050> wait<00:05:05.320> for<00:05:05.800> two<00:05:06.070> days<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.610> then<00:05:06.970> you

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
want to wait for two days and then you

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.170 
want to wait for two days and then you
can<00:05:07.510> probably<00:05:07.720> make<00:05:08.320> it<00:05:08.770> go<00:05:09.070> up<00:05:09.280> and<00:05:09.430> down<00:05:09.610> but

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
can probably make it go up and down but

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.360 
can probably make it go up and down but
you<00:05:10.360> don't<00:05:10.390> want<00:05:10.780> to<00:05:10.900> push<00:05:11.260> it<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:11.650> stress<00:05:12.100> it

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370
