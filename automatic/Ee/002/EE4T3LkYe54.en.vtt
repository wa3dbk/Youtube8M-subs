00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.760
Baby...Ooh...

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.510
Even in my heart, I see

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.140
You're not being true to me

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.150
Deep within my soul, I feel

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.390
Nothing's like it used to be

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.640
Sometimes I wish I could

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.450
Turn back time

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.810
Impossible as it may seem

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.320
But I wish I could

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.250
So bad, baby

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.780
Quit playing games with my heart

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.100
Quit playing games with my heart

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.340
Before you tear us apart

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.720
Quit playing games with my heart

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340
I should've know from the start

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.780
Before you got in my heart

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.720
keep tearing us apart

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.280
Quit playing games with my heart

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.910
I live my life, the way

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.530
To keep you coming back to me

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.660
Everything I do

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.470
Is for you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.970
So what is it that you can't see

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.160
Sometimes I wish I could

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.910
Turn back time

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.160
Impossible as it may seem

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.850
But I wish I could

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.390
So bad, baby you'd better

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.220
Quit playing games with my heart

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.470
Quit playing games with my heart

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.600
Before you tear us apart

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.380
Quit playing games with my heart

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.410
I should've know from the start

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.380
You know you've gotta stop

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.990
You're tearing us apart

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.780
Quit playing games with my heart

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.400
Quit playing games

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.470
Baby, baby

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.530
The love that we had was so strong

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.510
Don't leave hangin' here forever

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.170
Oh baby, baby this is not a lie

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.550
Let's stop this tonight

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.170
Baby, ohh, quit playing games

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.540
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.420
Nah nah nah nah nah baby

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.290
Nah nah nah nah

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.100
Sometimes I wish I could

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.230
Turn back time

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.190
Impossible as it may seem

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.570
But I wish I could

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.950
So bad baby

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.960
Quit playing games with my heart

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.910
Quit playing games with my heart

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.590
Before you tear us apart

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.960
Quit playing games with my heart

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.710
I should've know from the start

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.840
You know you've gotta stop

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.270
You're tearing us apart

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.710
Quit playing games with my heart

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.770
Quit playing games with my heart

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.130
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.100
Nah nah nah nah nah baby

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.940
Nah nah nah nah

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.190
Quit playing ganes with my heart

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.820
With my heart, with my heart

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.880
With my heart, with my heart
