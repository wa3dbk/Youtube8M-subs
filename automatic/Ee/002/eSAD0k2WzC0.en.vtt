an access camera with camp cloud access
IP<00:00:22.380> cameras<00:00:22.800> are<00:00:23.340> great<00:00:24.029> cameras<00:00:24.600> they've<00:00:24.869> got

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
IP cameras are great cameras they've got

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.380 
IP cameras are great cameras they've got
lots<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.500> features<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.070> capabilities<00:00:26.390> but

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
lots of features and capabilities but

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.269 
lots of features and capabilities but
they<00:00:27.660> also<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> lot<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.320> settings<00:00:28.680> so

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
they also have a lot of settings so

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.910 
they also have a lot of settings so
sometimes<00:00:29.880> users<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.810> new<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.199> access

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
sometimes users that are new to access

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.670 
sometimes users that are new to access
or<00:00:32.130> new<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.759> camp<00:00:32.969> cloud<00:00:33.239> find<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> settings<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
or new to camp cloud find the settings a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.680 
or new to camp cloud find the settings a
little<00:00:34.829> bit<00:00:35.040> overwhelming<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.820> we've<00:00:36.540> taken

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
little bit overwhelming so we've taken

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.650 
little bit overwhelming so we've taken
the<00:00:37.320> step<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.860> create<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> simple<00:00:38.760> tool<00:00:38.940> that

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the step to create a simple tool that

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.410 
the step to create a simple tool that
automates<00:00:40.760> virtually<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> setup

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
automates virtually all of the setup

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.830 
automates virtually all of the setup
required<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:43.829> an<00:00:43.980> access<00:00:44.340> camera<00:00:44.840> working

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
required to get an access camera working

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.660 
required to get an access camera working
with<00:00:45.960> camp<00:00:46.200> cloud<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.010> let's<00:00:47.190> go<00:00:47.309> ahead<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
with camp cloud so let's go ahead and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.250 
with camp cloud so let's go ahead and
show<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.879> first<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> log<00:00:49.079> in

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
show you first we have to log in

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.410 
show you first we have to log in
securely<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.610> our<00:00:50.969> cam<00:00:51.780> cloud<00:00:52.050> account<00:00:56.420> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
of the cam cloud system this is where

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.350 
of the cam cloud system this is where
you<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> list<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.850> cameras<00:01:09.240> that

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you have a list of all your cameras that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.390 
you have a list of all your cameras that
have<00:01:09.420> been<00:01:09.540> set<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.710> access<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
have been set up you have access to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.510 
have been set up you have access to
features<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.150> global<00:01:12.600> motion<00:01:12.810> detection

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
features like global motion detection

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.039 
features like global motion detection
I'm<00:01:14.520> not<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.030> into<00:01:15.180> these<00:01:15.659> features

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
I'm not going to go into these features

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.320 
I'm not going to go into these features
in<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.710> much<00:01:16.860> detail<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.549> demo<00:01:18.030> we

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
in really much detail in this demo we

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.289 
in really much detail in this demo we
have<00:01:18.360> other<00:01:18.720> demos<00:01:19.140> available<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.299> but

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
have other demos available for that but

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.600 
have other demos available for that but
I<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:22.170> say<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.460> do

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
I will say that you can see that we do

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.270 
I will say that you can see that we do
have<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:24.090> camera<00:01:24.360> setup<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.020> webcam<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
have one camera setup a webcam in the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.179 
have one camera setup a webcam in the
basement<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.750> that's<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.470> existing<00:01:28.650> camera

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
basement so that's the existing camera

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.190 
basement so that's the existing camera
that<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.000> now<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> add<00:01:30.840> an

that we have and now I want to add an
additional<00:01:31.950> camera<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.119> I'm<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> go

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
additional camera and so I'm going to go

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.440 
additional camera and so I'm going to go

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
ahead and obviously add an access IP

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.050 
ahead and obviously add an access IP
camera<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.250> new<00:01:38.700> little

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
camera and when I do that a new little

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.780 
camera and when I do that a new little
forum<00:01:39.750> opens<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> bunch<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.400> settings

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
forum opens up with a bunch of settings

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.240 
forum opens up with a bunch of settings
the<00:01:42.659> only<00:01:42.869> thing<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.170> need<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:44.009> is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the only thing you really need to do is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.760 
the only thing you really need to do is
add<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> camera<00:01:45.840> name<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.500> we're<00:01:46.680> gonna

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
add in the camera name so we're gonna

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.490 
add in the camera name so we're gonna
call<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.220> office<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:48.360> our<00:01:48.540> case<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.140> camera

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
call it office in our case it's a camera

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.380 
call it office in our case it's a camera
being<00:01:49.890> used<00:01:50.130> at<00:01:50.310> our<00:01:50.430> office<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.060> that's<00:01:51.240> what

being used at our office so that's what

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.410 
being used at our office so that's what
we're<00:01:51.479> gonna<00:01:51.570> call<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.970> other<00:01:53.970> settings

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
we're gonna call it the other settings

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.420 
we're gonna call it the other settings
are<00:01:54.570> things<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.990> camera<00:01:55.409> quality<00:01:55.439> motion

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
are things like camera quality motion

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
are things like camera quality motion
detection<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.270> whether<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.290> want

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.960 
with the correct settings so that it can
properly<00:04:39.410> integrate<00:04:39.979> with<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.580> camp<00:04:40.759> cloud
