00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.390
 park where the health of your 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.320
 family starts right here the kitchen 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.470
 let's make breakfast because 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.370
 we are hungry yes or no 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.660
 a bread and for breakfast they beats 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.450
 you 're also going to have a mustard chicken 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.790
 and he's going to finish a corn cake this 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.200
 it is at your request because you 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.400
 they asked him we are going to make a cake of 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.380
 corn that I love because it has 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.210
 a lot of fiber but we're going to 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.680
 start with this bread and not and because I already 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.480
 I'm starving 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.890
 so go prepare and in 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.220
 Let's go analyze a little bit of 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.950
 butter, you're hungry too 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.860
 everyone is hungry I also the truth 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.479
 is that if we already want to eat good they will 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.460
 be a little butter 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.170
 we last that in this case they are 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.690
 silenced they have the cascarita and everything 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.740
 the more we remove the seed a little bit 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.800
 sugar lemon juice plus bread bread this 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.110
 the countryside or ciabatta bread or some you 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.830
 They give what they have in the house and a little 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.580
 almonds and besides that they are cakes or as 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.580
 you would say movie 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.520
 of this good is to say you can also 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.550
 good 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.280
 here what I'm going to do is that 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.870
 I'm going to warm my pans 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.480
 put to melt the butter in this 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.990
 decorated and my loaves I'm going to put 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.990
 here 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.850
 start to toasting to see if they mark us 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.020
 the hairlines would be wonderful and here 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.640
 I put my butter to melt 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.380
 remember that each teaspoon 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.630
 butter are 90 calories so it's 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.509
 deliver I'm going to share with you 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.960
 kids do not worry about anything you see me 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.700
 back to come to record let's put 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.700
 the Peach 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.670
 and let's put some sugar now 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.130
 why 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.390
 I 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.280
 we're not going to put a little bit of 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.650
 sugar remember that the fruit itself 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.600
 It already has sugar around 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.330
 is that it comes out a lot is a little touch 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.000
 to give it that flavor and like to explode 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.670
 the sugar that already has sugar in it 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.560
 you do not have to consume too much because the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.050
 consumption of sugar is related to 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.270
 several types of cancer besides 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.430
 obviously obesity diabetes 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.140
 osteoporosis this problem of the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.330
 thyroid is really what they want 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.000
 why do you want to add more to this 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.000
 When beans if you say so 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.500
 and so it is said good this I what they 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.569
 I recommend is that your sugar consumption 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.209
 be 4 to 10 grams a day that does not pass 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.080
 from there water with some drinks that 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.600
 they have a little more 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.210
 and the fruit is always good good allied 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.610
 for the diet the fruit has in the case 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.550
 of the peach I put the lemon juice in 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.690
 the case of the peach because it also has 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.600
 calcium 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.000
 the peach has calcium the peach has 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.200
 a lot of calcium has iron has 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.319
 iron 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.690
 for the good for the teeth and good 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.720
 have you have iron have iron have 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.550
 potassium this also has a lot 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.930
 vitamin d I do not know if you have heard 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.019
 that vitamin D takes away your 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.720
 tiredness good if it takes away the fatigue 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.300
 because all your central nervous system 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.819
 that is, from your way of thinking to your 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.480
 reactions this I do not know what it's called in 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.580
 that you have good 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.400
 neurotransmitters to and what sophisticated more 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.709
 Well, if all the neurotransmitters and 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.900
 the reflections are enhanced with the 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.510
 vitamin d in the case of peach 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.459
 we found b1 b2 and b12 then that 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.489
 is 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.139
 all good let's see how the bread and ni 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.500
 I tell them the bread and not the bread and it's not a 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.240
 bread that is consumed a lot in italy 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.610
 derived from the focaccia the focaccia is a 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.249
 kind of white pizza that were made 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.649
 since Roman times 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:38.049
 this one started making bread and when 

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:41.409
 it began to crush this same bread it 

00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:43.029
 I pressed like this and coal and then I got 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.400
 the count of sandwich because there is a 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:48.460
 textual control and sandwich 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.290
 textual that begins to ask as you 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.020
 he liked to play the cards he starts to ask 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.910
 this food that I could grab with the 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.130
 fingers then the sandwich is born 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.130
 first panini and this 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.150
 in history in england 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.690
 well I'm going to take a path that has already been 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.470
 pretty good this little market we're going to 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.720
 put a bit of this hard what you see 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.920
 succulent 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:22.600
 really walk who says I 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.920

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.270
 let's put a little bit of the peach 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.840
 let's add you also want that 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:35.980
 quoted cheese can you put ham yes 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.790

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.760
 we also put it on what is the roll 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.490

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.069
 Saleh Cheese Awards 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:53.729
 It's wrong for me that I love you very much but 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:55.620
 it's a bit of pottage success and with this 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.210
 he's going to leave you with a delicious craving 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.240
 because we make a cut do not leave
