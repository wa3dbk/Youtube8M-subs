bomb here you guys go here's a decoder

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.139 
bomb here you guys go here's a decoder
for<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.470> codes<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.310> wall<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.850> here's

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
for the codes on the wall so here's

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.660 
for the codes on the wall so here's
everything<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.409> learn<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:56.490> hit

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.730 
everything you have to learn and go hit
the<00:01:56.790> signs<00:01:57.060> correctly<00:01:57.450> there's<00:01:58.079> three<00:01:58.439> codes

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the signs correctly there's three codes

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.950 
the signs correctly there's three codes
and<00:01:59.040> here's<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.820> decoder<00:02:00.299> remember<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> need

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
and here's the decoder remember you need

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.719 
and here's the decoder remember you need
vultures<00:02:01.530> day<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> look<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.219> wisp<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
bomb you gotta activate it and then you

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.009 
bomb you gotta activate it and then you
will<00:02:40.370> get<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.090> infinite<00:02:41.540> round<00:02:41.780> or

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
will get to the infinite round or
