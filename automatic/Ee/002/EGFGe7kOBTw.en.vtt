should watch out for first thing i want
to<00:00:44.789> say<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> don't<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:45.690> EKKO<00:00:45.930> is

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to say is that I don't think EKKO is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.690 
to say is that I don't think EKKO is
overpowered<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.010> don't<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.550> he's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
overpowered but I don't think he's

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.650 
overpowered but I don't think he's
balanced<00:00:48.300> either

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
balanced either

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.720 
balanced either
I<00:00:48.780> think<00:00:49.140> he's<00:00:49.289> strong<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.100> might<00:00:50.309> deserve<00:00:50.670> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
I think he's strong and might deserve a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.340 
I think he's strong and might deserve a
bit<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.059> nerves<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.539> think<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> reason<00:00:52.199> people

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
bit of nerves I think the reason people

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.229 
bit of nerves I think the reason people
are<00:00:52.559> seeing<00:00:52.949> him<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.219> being<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.699> overpowered

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
are seeing him as being so overpowered

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.910 
are seeing him as being so overpowered
is<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:55.020> he's<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> new<00:00:55.379> champion<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
is one because he's a new champion and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.229 
is one because he's a new champion and
people<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.489> don't<00:00:56.610> understand<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.180> to

quite literally take a lead get stronger
do<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> lot<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> damage<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.450> your<00:01:18.540> team<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.960> hard

do a lot of damage to your team in hard
carry<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.560> game<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> flipside<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.090> they

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
carry a game or on the flipside if they

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.520 
carry a game or on the flipside if they
don't<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> lead<00:01:21.900> they<00:01:22.140> should<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
don't get the lead they should be a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.289 
don't get the lead they should be a
little<00:01:22.860> useless<00:01:23.310> which<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.820> actually<00:01:24.119> where<00:01:24.270> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
little useless which is actually where I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.120 
little useless which is actually where I
think<00:01:24.540> EKKO<00:01:24.810> shines<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.470> even<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.009> he's

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
think EKKO shines because even if he's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.830 
think EKKO shines because even if he's
not<00:01:26.280> super<00:01:26.670> ahead<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> still<00:01:27.330> feel<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.689> he's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
not super ahead I still feel like he's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.240 
not super ahead I still feel like he's
quite<00:01:28.049> good<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.470> that's<00:01:28.680> probably<00:01:29.100> because

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
quite good and that's probably because

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.160 
quite good and that's probably because
he<00:01:29.579> has<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> lot<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> great<00:01:30.299> slow<00:01:30.600> from<00:01:30.810> his<00:01:30.930> q

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
he has a lot of great slow from his q

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
he has a lot of great slow from his q
ability<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.770> he<00:01:31.950> has<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> beautiful<00:01:32.490> stun<00:01:33.060> from

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
ability and he has a beautiful stun from

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.120 
ability and he has a beautiful stun from
his<00:01:33.360> W<00:01:33.689> well<00:01:34.020> regardless<00:01:34.470> let's<00:01:34.740> first<00:01:34.979> go

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
his W well regardless let's first go

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.039 
his W well regardless let's first go
into<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> topic<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.909> general<00:01:36.509> tips<00:01:36.810> when

into the topic of general tips when

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.870 
into the topic of general tips when
facing<00:01:37.470> an<00:01:37.590> echo<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> first<00:01:38.460> thing<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
facing an echo so the first thing is the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.210 
facing an echo so the first thing is the
fact<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.150> EKKO<00:01:39.509> heavily<00:01:40.049> relies<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.500> his<00:01:40.950> Q

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
fact that EKKO heavily relies on his Q

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.710 
fact that EKKO heavily relies on his Q
ability<00:01:41.369> especially<00:01:42.180> during<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.570> laning

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
ability especially during the laning

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
ability especially during the laning
phase<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:43.829> important<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> try

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
phase and it's really important to try

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.520 
phase and it's really important to try
and<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:45.030> hit<00:01:45.149> by<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.360> q<00:01:45.659> whatsoever<00:01:46.229> let

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and not get hit by the q whatsoever let

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.319 
and not get hit by the q whatsoever let
alone<00:01:46.799> both<00:01:47.070> times<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.759> reason<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.210> so

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
alone both times the reason it's so

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.999 
alone both times the reason it's so
important<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.869> because<00:01:48.899> EKKO<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> laning

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
important is because EKKO in the laning

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.710 
important is because EKKO in the laning
phase<00:01:50.040> doesn't<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.880> any<00:01:51.149> other<00:01:51.390> poke

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
phase doesn't really have any other poke

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.660 
phase doesn't really have any other poke
except<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.380> his<00:01:52.530> excuse<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:53.009> only<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.520> that

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
except for his excuse not only is that

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.060 
except for his excuse not only is that
his<00:01:53.820> main<00:01:54.030> source<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.479> damage<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.649> he<00:01:55.920> gets

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
his main source of damage but if he gets

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160 
his main source of damage but if he gets
especially<00:01:56.850> two<00:01:57.060> stacks<00:01:57.390> from<00:01:57.540> his<00:01:57.719> q<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.079> you

from his passive all he has to do is use

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.149 
from his passive all he has to do is use

then do it all again ten seconds later
another<00:02:09.209> huge<00:02:09.569> thing<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.959> probably<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.739> most

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
another huge thing and probably the most

another huge thing and probably the most

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
mean echo is gonna heavily rely on his W

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.040

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
talking to Pearson he himself has said

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.020 
talking to Pearson he himself has said
that<00:05:18.380> he<00:05:18.500> beat<00:05:18.680> almost<00:05:18.860> every<00:05:19.310> echo<00:05:19.520> mid<00:05:19.850> lane

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
that he beat almost every echo mid lane

but the champs you probably wanna watch

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.510

out<00:05:24.230> for<00:05:24.380> when<00:05:24.500> picking<00:05:24.860> against<00:05:25.160> an<00:05:25.250> echo

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
out for when picking against an echo

these champions have skill shots that
they<00:05:32.810> rely<00:05:33.140> on<00:05:33.200> hitting<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.830> EKKO<00:05:34.370> can<00:05:34.550> be

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
they rely on hitting and EKKO can be

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.040 
they rely on hitting and EKKO can be
very<00:05:34.880> mobile<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.420> dodge<00:05:35.630> him<00:05:35.810> with<00:05:35.930> his

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
very mobile to dodge him with his

ultimate or his he ability and they have
no<00:05:38.480> real<00:05:38.840> escape<00:05:39.110> against<00:05:39.530> echo<00:05:39.860> in<00:05:39.980> his<00:05:40.130> kit

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
no real escape against echo in his kit

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.950 
no real escape against echo in his kit
because<00:05:40.640> echo<00:05:41.030> has<00:05:41.180> a<00:05:41.210> lot<00:05:41.600> of<00:05:41.750> stick

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
because echo has a lot of stick

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.810 
because echo has a lot of stick
potential<00:05:42.410> with<00:05:42.560> his<00:05:42.710> kit<00:05:43.040> that<00:05:43.190> can<00:05:43.280> be<00:05:43.430> very

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
potential with his kit that can be very

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.370 
potential with his kit that can be very
annoying<00:05:44.180> for<00:05:44.390> those<00:05:44.540> champions<00:05:45.020> and<00:05:45.260> the

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
annoying for those champions and the

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.840 
annoying for those champions and the
last<00:05:45.650> thing<00:05:45.830> I'll<00:05:45.920> talk<00:05:45.950> about<00:05:46.160> in<00:05:46.520> this<00:05:46.610> video

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
last thing I'll talk about in this video

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.820 
last thing I'll talk about in this video
is<00:05:47.030> what<00:05:47.360> I<00:05:47.390> think<00:05:47.510> needs<00:05:47.840> nerfing<00:05:48.350> on<00:05:48.500> echo

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
is what I think needs nerfing on echo

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.260 
is what I think needs nerfing on echo
because<00:05:49.040> like<00:05:49.310> I<00:05:49.400> said<00:05:49.640> even<00:05:49.850> though<00:05:50.060> I<00:05:50.090> don't

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
because like I said even though I don't

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.820 
because like I said even though I don't
think<00:05:50.390> is<00:05:50.600> overpowered<00:05:51.260> I<00:05:51.440> don't<00:05:51.710> necessarily

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
think is overpowered I don't necessarily

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.040 
think is overpowered I don't necessarily
think<00:05:52.340> he's<00:05:52.670> balanced<00:05:53.120> I<00:05:53.300> do<00:05:53.420> think<00:05:53.750> there<00:05:53.870> are

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
think he's balanced I do think there are

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.690 
think he's balanced I do think there are
some<00:05:54.380> tweaks<00:05:54.710> that<00:05:54.950> should<00:05:55.130> be<00:05:55.220> done<00:05:55.400> to<00:05:55.520> his

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
some tweaks that should be done to his

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.520 
some tweaks that should be done to his
kit<00:05:55.940> to<00:05:56.060> make<00:05:56.210> him<00:05:56.390> more<00:05:56.540> balanced<00:05:56.990> so<00:05:57.410> the

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
kit to make him more balanced so the

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.930 
kit to make him more balanced so the
main<00:05:57.680> two<00:05:57.890> things<00:05:58.070> I<00:05:58.220> will<00:05:58.280> be<00:05:58.370> talking<00:05:58.640> about

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
main two things I will be talking about

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.750 
main two things I will be talking about
is<00:05:59.270> gonna<00:05:59.630> be<00:05:59.780> his<00:05:59.930> passive<00:06:00.560> and<00:06:00.800> his<00:06:01.220> cute<00:06:01.520> I

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
is gonna be his passive and his cute I

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.980 
is gonna be his passive and his cute I
think<00:06:01.790> these<00:06:02.120> are<00:06:02.180> the<00:06:02.360> main<00:06:02.660> things<00:06:02.900> that

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
think these are the main things that

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.480 
think these are the main things that
make<00:06:03.230> EKKO<00:06:03.530> very<00:06:03.740> strong<00:06:04.040> because<00:06:04.220> his

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
make EKKO very strong because his

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.880 
make EKKO very strong because his
passive<00:06:04.970> damages<00:06:05.540> again<00:06:05.870> not<00:06:06.170> only<00:06:06.680> very

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
passive damages again not only very

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.440 
passive damages again not only very
strong<00:06:07.370> especially<00:06:07.880> when<00:06:08.000> you<00:06:08.060> combine<00:06:08.420> it

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
strong especially when you combine it

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.900 
strong especially when you combine it
with<00:06:08.630> his<00:06:08.840> W<00:06:09.170> passive<00:06:09.590> but<00:06:10.010> the<00:06:10.130> move<00:06:10.460> speed<00:06:10.790> is

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
with his W passive but the move speed is

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.820 
with his W passive but the move speed is
the<00:06:11.060> main<00:06:11.300> thing<00:06:11.630> because<00:06:11.960> he<00:06:12.080> can<00:06:12.230> trade<00:06:12.500> so

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
the main thing because he can trade so

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.710 
the main thing because he can trade so
well<00:06:13.100> in<00:06:13.280> the<00:06:13.400> laning<00:06:13.580> phase<00:06:13.730> do<00:06:14.390> a<00:06:14.420> lot<00:06:14.690> of

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
well in the laning phase do a lot of

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.480 
well in the laning phase do a lot of
damage<00:06:15.020> and<00:06:15.350> then<00:06:15.470> with<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:15.740> MU<00:06:15.890> speed<00:06:16.160> simply

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
damage and then with the MU speed simply

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.520 
damage and then with the MU speed simply
retreat<00:06:16.880> or<00:06:17.120> continue<00:06:17.570> on<00:06:17.690> with<00:06:17.810> the<00:06:17.900> chase<00:06:18.140> he

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
retreat or continue on with the chase he

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.020 
retreat or continue on with the chase he
has<00:06:18.650> a<00:06:18.680> little<00:06:19.010> too<00:06:19.160> many<00:06:19.340> options<00:06:19.580> in<00:06:19.880> that

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
has a little too many options in that

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.030 
has a little too many options in that
scenario<00:06:20.360> and<00:06:20.750> his<00:06:20.960> Q<00:06:21.230> has<00:06:21.380> a<00:06:21.410> little<00:06:21.740> too<00:06:21.890> much

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
scenario and his Q has a little too much

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.800 
scenario and his Q has a little too much
damage<00:06:22.280> for<00:06:22.430> how<00:06:22.640> much<00:06:22.820> he<00:06:22.940> can<00:06:23.090> spam<00:06:23.420> it<00:06:23.600> the

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
damage for how much he can spam it the

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.410 
damage for how much he can spam it the
slow<00:06:24.080> is<00:06:24.260> very<00:06:24.740> strong<00:06:25.370> and<00:06:25.910> it<00:06:26.090> applies<00:06:26.390> to

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.420 
slow is very strong and it applies to

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.300 
slow is very strong and it applies to
stacks<00:06:26.960> of<00:06:27.110> your<00:06:27.230> passive<00:06:27.620> which<00:06:27.860> if<00:06:28.040> you<00:06:28.100> just

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
stacks of your passive which if you just

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.920 
stacks of your passive which if you just
combine<00:06:28.490> an<00:06:28.820> e<00:06:29.000> right<00:06:29.030> after<00:06:29.540> you're<00:06:29.840> gonna

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
combine an e right after you're gonna

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.750 
combine an e right after you're gonna
deal<00:06:30.170> a<00:06:30.200> lot<00:06:30.410> of<00:06:30.470> damage<00:06:30.590> and<00:06:31.100> very<00:06:31.430> easily

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
deal a lot of damage and very easily

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.490 
deal a lot of damage and very easily
especially<00:06:32.150> when<00:06:32.660> your<00:06:32.780> q<00:06:32.960> is<00:06:33.050> hitting<00:06:33.320> three

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
especially when your q is hitting three

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.629 
especially when your q is hitting three
to<00:06:33.650> five<00:06:33.830> people<00:06:34.130> in<00:06:34.250> team

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
to five people in team

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.459 
to five people in team
I<00:06:34.699> mean<00:06:35.180> chasing<00:06:35.539> an<00:06:35.629> echo<00:06:35.780> with<00:06:36.050> his<00:06:36.199> Q

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:36.469 
I mean chasing an echo with his Q

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:38.140 
I mean chasing an echo with his Q
ability<00:06:36.800> makes<00:06:36.979> it<00:06:37.129> almost<00:06:37.249> impossible<00:06:37.430> but

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
ability makes it almost impossible but

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.249 
ability makes it almost impossible but
those<00:06:38.270> are<00:06:38.419> the<00:06:38.509> things<00:06:38.629> that<00:06:38.870> I<00:06:38.900> think<00:06:39.110> are<00:06:39.229> a

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
those are the things that I think are a

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.080 
those are the things that I think are a
little<00:06:39.289> too<00:06:39.680> strong<00:06:39.979> about<00:06:40.219> echo<00:06:40.580> and<00:06:40.759> I<00:06:40.819> think

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
little too strong about echo and I think

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.969 
little too strong about echo and I think
should<00:06:41.300> be<00:06:41.360> toned<00:06:41.749> down<00:06:41.870> by<00:06:42.139> just<00:06:42.349> a<00:06:42.469> bit<00:06:42.499> but

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 
should be toned down by just a bit but

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:44.469 
should be toned down by just a bit but
that<00:06:43.099> is<00:06:43.249> it<00:06:43.430> for<00:06:43.460> this<00:06:43.699> video<00:06:43.939> guys<00:06:44.120> I<00:06:44.449> hope
