in<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.479> loop<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.869> you're<00:01:57.960> gonna<00:01:58.079> end<00:01:58.259> up

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
in and the loop so you're gonna end up

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.319

with<00:01:58.500> three<00:01:58.829> now<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> Berkeley<00:02:00.090> braid

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329

knot<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.899> looks<00:02:01.079> impressive

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
knot and it looks impressive

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.289
