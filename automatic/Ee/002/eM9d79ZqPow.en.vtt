00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.309 

can<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.439> square<00:00:01.829> root<00:00:02.040> of<00:00:02.070> 2<00:00:02.669> be<00:00:03.480> written<00:00:04.049> as

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
can the square root of 2 be written as

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.080 
can the square root of 2 be written as
the<00:00:04.500> ratio<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:05.100> two<00:00:05.899> integer<00:00:06.899> numbers<00:00:07.290> P<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.589> Q

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
the ratio of two integer numbers P and Q

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.629 
the ratio of two integer numbers P and Q
question<00:00:09.260> if<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:11.040> could<00:00:11.280> square<00:00:11.580> both

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
question if so we could square both

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.839 
question if so we could square both
sides<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.570> get<00:00:12.840> two<00:00:13.259> equals<00:00:13.920> P<00:00:14.400> squared

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
sides and get two equals P squared

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.990 
sides and get two equals P squared
divided<00:00:15.330> by<00:00:15.360> Q<00:00:16.020> square<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.830> hence<00:00:18.619> 2q<00:00:19.619> squared

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
divided by Q square and hence 2q squared

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.509 
divided by Q square and hence 2q squared
equals<00:00:21.000> P<00:00:21.570> squared<00:00:22.170> now<00:00:22.619> let's<00:00:22.830> count<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
equals P squared now let's count the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.870 
equals P squared now let's count the

it on its side this has to have an even

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.060 
it on its side this has to have an even
number<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:31.980> prime<00:00:32.369> factors<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.880> 2<00:00:33.239> because<00:00:34.070> any

factor of 2 that may be present in Q is

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.260 
factor of 2 that may be present in Q is
appearing<00:00:39.600> twice<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.040> square<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.030> this

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
appearing twice and the square so this

00:00:42.270 --> 00:01:06.050 
appearing twice and the square so this
has

e to the K natural logarithm of X now to
the<00:02:17.470> derivative<00:02:17.890> that's<00:02:18.610> very<00:02:18.910> easy<00:02:20.700> now<00:02:21.700> we

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
the derivative that's very easy now we

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.720 
the derivative that's very easy now we
can<00:02:22.060> use<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:23.380> chain<00:02:23.650> rule<00:02:23.680> e<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.580> the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
can use the chain rule e to the

something becomes e to the something no
change<00:02:29.230> in<00:02:29.410> there<00:02:29.620> are<00:02:29.739> times<00:02:30.160> now<00:02:30.640> we<00:02:30.700> have<00:02:31.090> to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
change in there are times now we have to

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.200 
change in there are times now we have to
form<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.629> derivative<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.319> K<00:02:32.830> times<00:02:33.400> 10

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
form the derivative of K times 10

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.690 
form the derivative of K times 10

so now we have to remember this came

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.240 
so now we have to remember this came

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
from this was X to the K power so that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.190 
from this was X to the K power so that
