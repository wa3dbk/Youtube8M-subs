00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.830
 my video 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.690
 for this you just need to throw the number 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.030
 match played in the VKontakte group 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.629
 in a discussion called work on 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.879
 mistakes 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.650
 well now to the main topic of this video 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.809
 hero today we become witch 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.850
 doctor who played under the nickname skit 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.829
 and it is by his example that I will show you 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.960
 what typical mistakes many make 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.150
 Supports in the pub considering that supports 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.070
 This role is not the most popular 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.140
 as a rule, and experience to this role 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.089
 the average dota player is not so 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.129
 and a lot of course everyone knows that we 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.500
 sort of like they should help our farm 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.869
 carry wards and buy courier 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.060
 well and then and then begin the typical 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.950
 pub support problems for example our 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.960
 the main character of the video puts two at once 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.119
 ward at the very beginning of the game despite the fact that 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.220
 just one ward is enough to 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.350
 control the rune and see the forest from the side 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.420
 from the line another important point is this 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.789
 that hiv doctor is pumped through the mill 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.770
 email and dict such a skillbild makes sense 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.020
 when you stand with a hero who 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.179
 capable of early aggression but since 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.100
 our line mate is antimag then for 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.869
 it is primarily important safe 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.149
 farm meaning that in this case it is better 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.189
 it would be to pump the treatment instead of we lady 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.840
 kt and because it allowed anti could 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.549
 would keep on the line longer and in 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.350
 largely defend against 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.140
 Haras opponent further hiv doctor 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.210
 decides it's time to drive in rq but 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.490
 in the end, he himself loses half of his health 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.289
 empty place what's wrong with that 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.659
 when your character starts to attack 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.630
 enemy hero being within 500 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.219
 from enemy creeps then it is automatically 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.139
 makes them attack us at first 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.299
 levels creep strikes can take away 

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:03.159
 significant part of life therefore need 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.109
 attack either standing away from 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.090
 creeps either by making a shot right away 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.950
 retreat back so the enemy does not have time for you 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.929
 answer further during the game witch 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.610
 doctor flies to the top to help 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.709
 to his team with gangs 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.300
 it turns out quite well but then 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.220
 he wants to kill so much 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.970
 hated rikimaru that forgets about 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.250
 all the rest 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.290
 and becomes easy prey here stands 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.970
 start by not having mana even on 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.760
 I will try to do something under 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.220
 an enemy tower is definitely a bad idea 2 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.900
 important 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.420
 factor that the hero of the video is clearly not 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.220
 took this health into account 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.080
 visually it may seem like hiv 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.030
 doctor and a little over half of life and 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.140
 that health doesn't seem to be on 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.060
 critical level 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.910
 but in fact he only has a little more 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.770
 300 cp which means the doctor will die 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.110
 just one hatch and a couple of strikes 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.060
 Well, on top of the picture we see how 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.980
 another opponent teleports to 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.510
 your tower so the very best and 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.230
 a safe solution would be just 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.370
 retreat to its base 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.560
 then another similar situation 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.480
 happens to hiv doctor a little later on 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.400
 the course of the game is nevertheless our hero 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.290
 video not only do not pay attention to 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.090
 stock of health but also on teleportation 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.280
 the enemy to the tower so train yourself 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.200
 every time to watch what hero 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.760
 teleports to you on line because 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.490
 what it can tell you in many ways 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.230
 what will happen next as a whole 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.360
 one of the main mistakes set 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.400
 Supports in the pub is what they think 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.350
 yourself exactly the same heroes as everyone 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.090
 other people keep playing 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.890
 familiar manner and then they 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.290
 suddenly realize that they are just sitting and 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.060
 die from scratch and the reason is here in 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.130
 that after quite a bit 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.959
 of time, the first games support start 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.570
 noticeably lag behind others 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.610
 characters giving fom to allied cary they 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.860
 They do not have any major purchase and 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.570
 still as a rule and lag behind in level a 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.670
 because of this they become extremely 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.890
 vulnerable and moving each time 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.930
 map or fight you need to remember 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.970
 that you simply have no chance even for one 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.860
 wrong move because you just 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.660
 die in seconds exactly 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.580
 so you only need to move 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.200
 behind their teammates and preferably not 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.060
 glow once again in the open 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.799
 space where you can see the whole 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.200
 the enemy team must always be remembered 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.769
 that hit any camp or prokast 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.840
 guaranteed to send you to the tavern 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.150
 another common mistake is when wards 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.840
 buys only once per game in the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.459
 its beginning 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.260
 and then when on the 7th minute they 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.450
 end the snow put them 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.580
 many for some reason forget themselves 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.830
 then suffering from the fact that there is no map 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.930
 review and another wrong decision in 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.770
 In this game, this purchase of dust against Ricky 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.660
 at least 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.669
 and allows you to show in business heroes 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.010
 when they try to run away from us but she 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.810
 no way protects us from attack we are up 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.500
 the last moment we will not know what 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.300
 they will attack us 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.220
 having dust on your hands while 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.400
 having placed in advance the center on the map we 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.410
 we knew perfectly 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.419
 all movements of invisible enemies and 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.600
 for rikimaru, we will be taken by surprise 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.550
 much harder 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.470
 Well, closer to the end of this game is HIV 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.810
 the doctor shows us a typical mistake 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.759
 for many players which i call 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.650
 spree in spite of the fact that wards 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.930
 allow you to perfectly see all movements 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.850
 contender without a doctor decides anyway 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.979
 that it is time to make some fuss 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.750
 away from the base and naturally he doesn't 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.639
 time to return to base 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.400
 because the enemies have already run to him 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.289
 over the cut so always remember if you 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.180
 moved away from your base this is the most 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.530
 safe way to get back at it 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.530
 use flowers to teleport 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.520
 summing up this video is worth saying 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.830
 that support is not a favorite role for 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.990
 most players not only because 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.180
 all the laurels and tripkill and get to others 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.010
 but also due to the fact that the average 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.380
 the player plays on support significantly 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.910
 worse than any other role for many 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.889
 quite unusual neat and 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.630
 calculating style of play when for each 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.550
 small mistake you'll be right there 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.229
 go to the tavern but i hope that 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.449
 after this video you can more 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.400
 carefully assess the situation and take 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.169
 into account the maximum possible details 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.919
 which will significantly increase your 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.470
 game level 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.150
