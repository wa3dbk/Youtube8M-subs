00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.660
 nigger nothing 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.789
 to wash 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.010
 ae 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.110
 when you truly do something 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.390
 original and this is the innovation 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.339
 The point is you work with elements 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.000
 that seek some originality of the 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.739
 job 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.129
 It does not matter if you sell discs. 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.559
 flying if you come with fraccaroli 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.960
 Interestingly, within the proposed 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.729
 that the search is original because it does not 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.680
 Goodbye, you sell in a frock coat. 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.259
 is bringing elements beyond 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.679
 so the question is you know 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.210
 how to innovate within the process that requires 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.530
 that everything that has relevance to the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.369
 plot worth it 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 I think it's that I leave technicians in fact 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.869
 have to front committee and join 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.670
 a rhythm with harmony right 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.710
 this is one of the positive aspects because 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.979
 real you have no way to bring 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.470
 so specific elements and the parade 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.840
 that they are the surprise just for 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.840
 that many children happen 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 i 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.790
 I think the game was all ne caldwell 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.430
 qmilch showed that it will present 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.580
 Because it's cool, it 's neither surprising nor 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.740
 good test long movements but 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.960
 we do not present nor 70% that we go 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.780
 present on the day because it will take a lot 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.460
 more and more emotion 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.420
 It is carnival, that is what moves the 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.040
 samba player 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.960
 the emotion is that we want to convey 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.530
 in the day and this is going to be what God wants 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.690
 our greatest gift is the greatest asset 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.450
 to collect the scores of ten judges 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.850
 to conquer is not to deserve is to dance a lot 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.230
 beautiful with happiness and joy and will 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.900
 be a lot of emotion for our pavilion 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.910
 20 years of partnership with 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.310
 hummingbird our three year old children 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.170
 together, we vaccinated here, there's a lot of love 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.870
 a lot of friendship and respect above all else 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.440
 I think we've been rehearsing since 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.760
 June and the hummingbird is having a strong corner 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.940
 she was going to do this work with 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.920
 community of song and god for all 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.760
 segments of the school and today it was not 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.310
 different 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.160
 school tatÃ¡ bitten by the loan sharks of the year 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.650
 past and today is showing the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.470
 so this is already a technical essay 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.240
 Vareiro heading for victory Excuses and 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.940

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.280
 orientations of philosophical teachings 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.220
 laÃ­la president of honor

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.690
