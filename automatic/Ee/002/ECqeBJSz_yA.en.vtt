00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.870
 hello how welcome are you here 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.750
 I show how my new being says 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.109
 previously the one of my hands the sanity ce 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.410
 also my tool and now only 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.400
 I'm removing the dead cell with 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.380
 short wool of the cultivation pusher lo 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.009
 here I am removing the shine of the nail 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.070
 natural with this lime that very style 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.710
 suavecito is I think number 180 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.100
 now remove powder and in this sprayer 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.129
 I have lined up and sprayed them over my 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.930
 nails to dehydrate these are the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.460
 dreams that I will be using that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.290
 when I looked at them in the store 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.800
 they loved 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.970
 and the mehdi and now I'm going to pronounce the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.750
 Smile nails with the line so the 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.930
 side to lengthen the smile this is 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.720
 because I 'm not going to make almond with 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.390
 acrylic but this is a way that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.750
 you can extend the tips and then 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.240
 They can simplify their work 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.900
 now I'm going to use these poems that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.020
 are of plants and less the first is a 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.500
 ph leveler and the second one is a 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.500
 adherent 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.960
 a capita of each one now I show you 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.080
 this fret cited that I found for the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.850
 bad monkey and I loved it very shiny and 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.510
 I'm going to show you how I get the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.330
 brush bubbles whose monomer 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.700
 clean I introduce the brush and what 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.400
 he pressed and as they saw are lists 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.980
 bubbles out this is because 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.080
 times in our set in the acrylic it 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.900
 they make bubbles and it's because it comes from 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.470
 the brush and well this is a way that 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.680
 I in the sack 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.840
 I wanted to give you a tea when you 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.230
 they are going to be a being, nobody, not you 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.500
 they already have the tips or the 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.980
 adhered forms when they go to put the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.460
 First put it first in your hand 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.650
 who will work first 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.810
 in the first five fingers because 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.840
 when you put the first one in ten 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.330
 fingers when they finish working in the 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.750
 first five and proceed to the second 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.110
 hand that is the text of two the timer already 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.050
 it evaporated and that's another reason 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.180
 by which the nails fall or are 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:42.570
 they raise for that when you finish 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.860
 your first hand and proceed to the second 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.560
 Apply your first in the second hand 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.330
 because the first one to work 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.940
 perfectly has to be cool 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.070
 when the acrylic contacts the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.210
 The first one has to be the nail 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.130
 mojadita that's the perfect time to 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.870
 apply the acrylic because sometimes it 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.260
 it dries up evaporates and we do not give 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.360
 account the nails are falling I am not labor of 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.090
 our client tells us that I dropped a 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.190
 nail that is one of the reasons why 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.590
 what the first if dry 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.230
 that's why you have to be careful in this and 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.990
 They will see that their nails are going to fall more 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.100
 I guarantee them clear with a preparation 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.350
 correct nail first here 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.270
 As you can see I am decorating with this brush 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:36.240
 what I showed you is the fantasy enamel 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.560
 - It's the bronze and nothing else 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.680
 applying jewelery stones here I am 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.070
 putting a large acrylic stone the 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.490
 crystals number 9 2 hours now I'm going 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:54.800
 to number 7 these crystals that see the 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:57.450
 as silver these do not swarovski but 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.570
 it looked very nice is a stone is 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:05.650
 good stone and here as you see where not 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:08.860
 I put enamel I'm decorating with stones 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.840
 these stones do not use them 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.110
 customers because they do not shine as much as the 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.539
 swarovski and well there's nothing better than 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.440
 offer our clients the best I 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.639
 he only used swarovski on them 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.520
 these crystals was not used on me 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.210
 because then I take my nails off soon 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.180
 changes 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.310
 and I 'm going to tell you something about the gel and if I 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.770
 I put on the stones but in my being 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.479
 not in the clients I say to you 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.509
 that is not good to put them because sometimes 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.180
 opaque happens one thing or another and is 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.090
 good nothing more to put in the clients 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.560
 I rented as soon as I put the gel 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.900
 around the pebbles so you do not 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.750
 rising to little clear the stone has 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.840
 that being good to me has never been 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.960
 opaque but only I put the gel 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.389
 on the stones not on my clients 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.610
 Well that's how they are and be very 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:05.120
 Brilliant I hope you liked me 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.220
 sign super long and very shiny 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.949
 but you liked it as much as I 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.199
 liked me great and thanks for watching my 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.349
 videos and see you in the next 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.349
 bye
