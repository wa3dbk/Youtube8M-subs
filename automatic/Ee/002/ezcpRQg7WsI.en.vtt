00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.740
 hello everyone I made a little 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.559
 tutorial on how to record our games 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.250
 using very few resources and without 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:22.099
 lose virtually nothing of quality in 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.169
 our game people always complain 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.180
 that using programs like 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.800
 flash example 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.110
 we lose 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.080
 quality d 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:39.480
 the game slows us down the game 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:42.600
 we have a substantial drop in fps that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.030
 It is due to the excessive consumption of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.239
 resources of the program I 'm going to 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.550
 recommend a program this here that 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.590
 it's called band and camps is very simple what 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.960
 unique that at first may seem like a 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.600
 little confused I will explain how 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.270
 set it correctly to finish 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.570
 our multiple games with very few 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.509
 resources and another advantage is that it remains 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.259
 videos much lighter than those 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.259
 who records the track 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.330
 Well, the first thing we have to do is 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.020
 just start a game mode 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.600
 window and I have not started already for 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.759
 who does not know how to put the game in 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.030
 window mode is simply by pressing the 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.700
 alt key and enter together at the same time 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.420
 we get the game a window mode 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.979
 to put it back on screen 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.380
 we press again before and it 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.939
 will put us in full screen so what 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.530
 what we have to do is start the 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.530
 Program 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.130
 we have here 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.170
 this little box that does not tell us what 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.330
 we press and we see two options 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.430
 to record game we have to have 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.189
 marked the option to go x if it 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.560
 put in a rectangle on a screen 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.290
 what would tax us would be the desk 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.780
 and if we try to record a game what 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.509
 will record us will be a video totally in 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:13.019
 black we mark the option of x 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.450
 and here in this box it tells us by 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.870
 please select destination 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.900
 here the only thing we have to do is 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.670
 click on the game we see that no 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.670
 shows the people of this 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.540
 and here in the box we see that we do not 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.700
 shows the game executable this 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.770
 means that the recognized program 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.680
 well the game 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.880
 and you're ready to be able to 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.250
 Record 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.840
 to record we will simply have to 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.840
 press f12 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.659
 we see that he puts us in red of his 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.530
 means that you are recording and to leave 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:59.220
 to record simply press f12 other 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.440
 time and stop recording and now I'm going to 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.370
 explain a bit how to set it up 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.819
 correctly 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.640
 the program so that you explain your 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.560
 functions 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.510
 we go to the general screen here 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.290
 we have the options where we want 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.840
 save our videos that we record 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:26.780
 tell the program where we want 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.939
 save in the fps tab we see the 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.290
 options where do we want us to 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:35.769
 show what you 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.740
 and the key with which we want to change 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.360
 the position during during the game 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.020
 in the tab of lived the most 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.020
 important 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.890
 here what we have to configure 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.890
 is the video format 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.550
 we click on settings 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.880
 and here in size is an advantage that 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.780
 has this program that we can record to 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.380
 different resolution of which we are 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.380
 Playing 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.220
 it's quite advantageous because we can 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.620
 Record 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.750
 a video that we do not think it has so much 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:22.109
 quality and that even consume us less 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.770
 resources and less space 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.639
 and videos that leave us videos more more 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.050
 light 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.050
 Well, we have this option 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.090
 then the next thing that we will configure in 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.700
 the fps that we want to be recorded by the 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.250
 game 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.250
 I recommend that you record it at 30 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:52.620
 yes yes they will not do 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.139
 slow cameras or some effect like that 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.330
 special 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.789
 at 30 fps 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.629
 there is a pretty fluid video and 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:05.200
 we want to make slow cameras or some 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:09.130
 effect like this 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.200
 complicated because we can not record at 60 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.950
 we will have a video all better 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.660
 quality 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.410
 I always recorded at 30 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:23.830
 is the option that I recommend and then here 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:28.100
 so it 's a very important part 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.980
 I recommend using nothing more than today 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.340
 mp 1o 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.990
 xv and the rest 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.380
 I do not recommend it 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.540
 only these two either of the two is 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.710
 valid 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.900
 another option 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.889
 in the quality that we want to record the 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.110
 video 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:54.870
 I always record one hundred percent if 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.870
 we want us to use less resources 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.720
 and that the videos are lighter 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.330
 well 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.979
 we can lower the quality 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.080
 a very important option so that 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:12.520
 video editing program such as 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.509
 family example 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:20.249
 recognize us sound without problems 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:24.029
 we have to have marked the option 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:28.469
 here we have two options we see mp 1 l 2 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:34.069
 and psm we must mark the psm option 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:36.839
 because otherwise the sound will not recognize it 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:41.099
 the decision programs as per 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:45.050
 example the sony wega does not recognize the 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:50.319
 sound we put it in ccm 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.319
 and will not recognize it correctly 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.270
 we give him ok 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.390
 is already configured 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.460
 here in the picture what we see is how 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:06.170
 we put the key that we have to press 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:10.990
 to take a screenshot on 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.990
 what format we want it and little more 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:18.100
 Well this is all I hope you like and 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.100
 until next time
