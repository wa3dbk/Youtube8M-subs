00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello everyone, Christmas has arrived too 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.910
 at home crimi but to see this 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.910
 problem 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.340
 Hello everyone, so today I'll do it 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.140
 look to see a lot because I adel 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.400
 I find that you really have a marquee 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.790
 more pussies in the world and therefore one 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.259
 very defined eyeliner line but the 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.669
 voice making me a little bit more creative 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.070
 the same I wanted to add that the process 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.040
 of the thai free agents both above 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.140
 which below but below are very discreet 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.880
 but it is a look that shines that 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.190
 capture 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.320
 in short, that stands out and remains 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.079
 but precisely in the plastic cutting in progress 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.059
 then red lips and or there is this 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.980
 link with this line of leaders these 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.910
 I particularly liked the room because 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.960
 they are a shade of long red closed 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.260
 there is a mouse that held a hair towards the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.519
 lighter towards mandarin and is one 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.140
 new maybe it won't do that 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.010
 very white but I think it's really 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.300
 cool white brin celia even with the 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.800
 pines blue lipstick and I'd say start 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.030
 I know right away that it's not a trick 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.290
 particularly the work 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.820
 particularly wow 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.370
 but I have the impression that it is done 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.730
 again but you write me in so many e 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.620
 not solely 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.390
 because you are so grim so I will make a 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.790
 hole a little more portable and then maybe 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.340
 more wow to use dribble both 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.080
 for new year that for the visual of 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.210
 Christmas the day of catalogs and me 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.160
 I wish you all a good preparation 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.230
 for the holidays and you will see the tutorial by 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.130
 this hairstyle then this super 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.300
 gb mega bayern van also stall and 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.550
 in the obvious perfume that you owe yourself 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.140
 wait three days not only given 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.510
 bad from you I will wait only three 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.160
 days ok so i would say stop 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.270
 talk about starting tutorial that 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.820
 I do not verbal as usual 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.310
 let's start with the eye makeup by stretching out one 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.380
 creamy base all over this eyelid 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.760
 I use the bit factory and it creates me 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.760
 also a slight corrective effect 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.280
 then I go to spread over the whole eyelid 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.560
 absolutely cream-colored eyeshadow 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.570
 matt and in the climate between the two eyelids 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.920
 a medium brownish color as you see 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.510
 here I am cleverly released from 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.640
 framing so you do n't understand do 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.510
 also a bit of illuminant 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:35.580
 at the inner corner of the eye and with a 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.590
 cream eyeliner or cream eye shadow 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.570
 red color I'm going to start pulling the 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.650
 my eyeliner line that must be 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.920
 quite thick because obviously 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.480
 below is the black eyeliner line 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.220
 so take your time but al 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.380
 usually the eyeliner as well as let me go 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.239
 completely out of focus I apologize 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.370
 for these crap I do during i 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.620
 video beyond that i want to see out 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.690
 fire and quite anyway 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.090
 complex to pull then what you 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.500
 I can advise you take the 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.610
 your time, don't make a difference 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.610
 because otherwise it is bad 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.400
 keep it a little thicker than that 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.790
 which will make for a black line and 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.460
 start making the black line at 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.770
 below that red I didn't leave 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.450
 lots of space in mouse mode and 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.300
 linda black but i was wrong because i would 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.290
 had to do more special nares ha 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.750
 however then we will see how it goes from 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.100
 to correct 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.970
 make it a normal black line of 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.500
 beautiful thin eyeliner and now with the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.450
 glue for twitter 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.430
 go over the piece of 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.130
 red line left above at this point 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.210
 you tap on the bits 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.800
 you can also directly use one 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.990
 eyeliner bilite born but here we are all 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.340
 office complication simple things 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.140
 no jokes for you i like more 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.900
 to do it this way because of glitter of 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.820
 sbrilluccica of sbrilluccichio in 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.920
 makeup so I like it a lot more 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.600
 for the needle you make particular 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.250
 attention I advise you to draw it 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.160
 first with the glue and then to draw it 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.480
 with the dat treatment and the glue for 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.720
 glitter also in the lower rhyme 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.530
 of the eye and tap vi gods 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.530
 golden glitter 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.599
 if you have excess glitter vi 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.060
 advice to find them with a small brush 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:26.860
 round head impregnated with powder 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.479
 translucent eyes not to leave them 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.650
 the cocaine effect under the eyes you with 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.150
 the kidman quads 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.409
 now at the moment false eyelashes 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.750
 normal false eyelashes is enough 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.550
 voluminous that I go to put 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.569
 at the hairline when they get in 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.639
 line to put false eyelashes 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.860
 particularly easy because it is not from 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.750
 hide the black hairline of the aces 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.860
 the feint therefore in this case not 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.860
 we have particular problems 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.139
 and then fold the false eyelashes if 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.969
 necessary together with the real ones 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.120
 passed in mascara and also passes the 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.120
 fear 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.230
 here's the trick the thing is over 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.270
 nice of this eye makeup is that 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.860
 you can change colors and play 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.540
 depending on how you feel if you don't 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.130
 feel you can put the red you can 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.020
 put a blue and a silver or a 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.640
 true from a silver and a green a gold 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.860
 in short, you can play it depending on the 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.450
 occasions now we do a nice contouring 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.250
 decided because it is very simple 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.350
 eye makeup we can use a little bit 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.210
 in the face and above all since I am 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.080
 very pale I need to sculpt a 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.080
 little my volumes 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.070
 I love this brush that reality 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.160
 it would be eye shadow but I don't know how 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.990
 could be from eyeshadow considering that 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.640
 giant allow the land 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.770
 let's put this camera plugin looks 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.510
 in fact, that much much more rosy 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.490
 face was due to the fact that in reality 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.680
 it's a burgundy red though in cameras 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.220
 it looks like fuchsia pink and we put it on 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.220
 on twins 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.820
 nothing for lips makeup 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:09.340
 transcendental we simply put the 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.890
 perfect pencil in the lip contour 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.050
 which is a corrective pencil you need 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.320
 stem the color and make you stay 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.510
 quiet that during the evening there is 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.120
 the color will come up to under the nose 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.730
 fine lines but it is also a way to 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.060
 lighten your lips to make them look more 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:30.250
 bright luminous 2 luminous 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.360
 now comes from putting a pencil of 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.080
 a lot red 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.010
 how to say very lit up very relevant 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.510
 I particularly like orange juice 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:42.460
 this color in this period goes from 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.050
 draw the outline as usual 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.820
 of the lips that also the interior because 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.390
 the pencil is a great base for the 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.390
 lipstick 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.150
 now I'm going to get a lipstick from 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.310
 same shade and I 'm going to give it 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.070
 simply over 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.320
 et voilà the trick is absolutely 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:21.790
 finished as you see it was very easy 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:25.090
 to be made very classic but with a 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:27.070
 a touch of innovation that we do not mind 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.870
 as I said before if these colors do not 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.460
 you like them because you do n't feel like 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.780
 get red on the eye because a 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.450
 everyone can't like it 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:39.760
 I would say that you can use precisely with a 

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:41.500
 blue blue also orange an fuchsia 

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.210
 in short, all the colors you feel 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:48.610
 just of the christmas can go well and 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:50.500
 for this giant hairstyle and 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.190
 ciccio nissim to me I expect between three 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.050
 days 

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.150
 if this life I liked chat splints 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.240
 and share and tell me what you think 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.380
 of all a big kiss and happy holidays a 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.500
 everyone 

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.500
 Hello 

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:11.419
 hi as you will understand new series of 

00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:13.430
 video this time i hope to be a little 

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:15.830
 more constant than other times when 

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:19.990
 I did other series of videos that later 

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.990
 they are interrupted of the legal type
