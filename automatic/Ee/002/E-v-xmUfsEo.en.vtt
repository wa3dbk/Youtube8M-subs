wrap<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.070> make<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.670> circular<00:01:39.240> if

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
wrap it you can make this circular if

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.760 
wrap it you can make this circular if
you<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.869> kind<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> liked<00:01:40.350> having<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
you want but I kind of liked having the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.109 
you want but I kind of liked having the
oblong<00:01:41.130> shape<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.670> little<00:01:41.880> bit<00:01:41.970> better

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
oblong shape just a little bit better

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.520 
oblong shape just a little bit better
and<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.450> seemed<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.720> little<00:01:42.810> truer<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and it seemed a little truer to the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.639 
and it seemed a little truer to the
original<00:01:43.950> style<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> you're<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
original style so you're just going to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.109

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
wrap that into place and once you have

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.389 
wrap that into place and once you have
it<00:01:48.240> where<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.140> pin<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it where you want it you can pin it and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.010 
it where you want it you can pin it and
you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.640> make<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.090> messy<00:01:51.450> or<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.659> perfect

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you can make this as messy or as perfect

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.569 
you can make this as messy or as perfect
as<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.290> want<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.740> try<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.040> keep<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.369> kind<00:01:53.490> of

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
as you want I try to keep it kind of

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.280 
as you want I try to keep it kind of
like<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.790> nice<00:01:54.000> balance<00:01:54.360> between<00:01:54.390> being<00:01:54.840> messy

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
like a nice balance between being messy

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.080 
like a nice balance between being messy
and<00:01:55.439> being<00:01:55.680> perfect<00:01:56.070> they're<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.969> take

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and being perfect they're going to take

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.030 
and being perfect they're going to take
a<00:01:57.119> small<00:01:57.509> piece<00:01:57.750> from<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.229> bottom<00:01:58.560> ponytail

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and you're going to wrap it around the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.510 
and you're going to wrap it around the
bun<00:02:00.659> however<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.500> fit<00:02:01.530> when<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.250> look<00:02:02.399> at

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
all around so I started out by going

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.619 
all around so I started out by going
around<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.429> outside<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.000> bun<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.390> just

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629

doing kind of a little thing there and

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.520 
doing kind of a little thing there and
then<00:02:11.220> getting

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
then getting

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.140 
then getting
a little<00:02:11.830> bit<00:02:11.950> more<00:02:12.130> creative<00:02:12.459> as<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.850> went<00:02:13.030> on

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
a little bit more creative as I went on

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.670 
a little bit more creative as I went on
but<00:02:13.959> you're<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.170> going<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.350> place<00:02:14.500> it

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680
