00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.590
 indianapolis we eliminated allianz three years ago when we could catch it 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.819
 When we were in Amsterdam it became 0 0 in Greece and Ajax lost 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.650
 lsp thick marker predecessors 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.609
 after a good pass a proposal for a computer that bosman 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.359
 seven minutes is a good start for Ajax's goal 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.429
 the audience starts with traditionally 10 10 10 goals but with those in north 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.819
 Holland have Ajax got chances 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.209
 this one for the transformation by a good header is from marco van basten 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.750
 i'm not blind 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.760
 pace backwards with some luck how is this that the ball can't lie enough 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.160
 making the world cup can sometimes hang nicely 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
 through the Greek population 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.560
 the product 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.210
 there are images from the second half, there is too much injury in the first half 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.210
 don't come back for both teams doing well instead 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.830
 jan wouters 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.510
 or am I am 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.370
 back to wouters 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.370
 and then become 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 but then with the parking space 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.049
 then the draft starts to fear that olympiakos will attack and then 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:29.820
 are the greeks 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.300
 immediately dangerous 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.210
 so do you as the flying goalkeeper could find and the top corner shot loose 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.270
 still to stop but once to let 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.270
 it from a corner for real 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.680
 have organized the dpa supply chain 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.150
 the striker headed 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
 and people trade 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.809
 the best seven minutes before the end of the match 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.479
 I'm not doing that 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:28.499
 the side and now sees the pond on the edge of offside but continue 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.039
 neighbor 4 0 were in it
