00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.930
 coconut 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.290
 number 1 hair conditioner 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.450
 I really do not know how many 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.970
 times tell you there are people to tell you 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.549
 which is the best conditioner that I have 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.250
 had in my life good either 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.040
 We exaggerate but it's very good 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.750
 The only thing you have to do in the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.940
 good nights for example I would 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.780
 apply with a mask to mention 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.330
 that you have to do this 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.100
 constantly once a week or two 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.410
 times like you think you have the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.390
 hair that if you do it once in all 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.030
 your life you come to me and mimic this is that 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.430
 It did not work for me because it does not pull my 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.410
 queen then you put it on the most 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.920
 abused that is like that from here to 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.380
 down at the tips and you have two or 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.320
 make an onion and sleep put a 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.450
 towel on the pillow if it's disgusting 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.270
 that you get stained or put one of the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.400
 caps of the year and give you the month and in the 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.260
 tomorrow you get up you bathe and you're 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.720
 as a man is not your moisturizer for 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.600
 your skin coming off to bathe hold little 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.430
 coconut oil and put it on your skin 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.700
 it's really no joke it's not exaggeration 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.370
 I swear to you that it is so hard believe 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.960
 rich mosquito to put on as cream and 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.900
 right now it's cold not good 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.980
 I know if in your city it's cold for me 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:02.310
 It is cold and Japanese 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:05.489
 and as in August number 3 there are so many 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.269
 girls in the world young girls 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.970
 Ladies, do not forget that you do not know 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.120
 Real makeup remover is really bad 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.390
 very bad the bad one, because if 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.120
 they do not remove their mascara 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.630
 they will gradually lose their 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.240
 strange experiences but 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.630
 then the healthiest and most 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.220
 It is advisable to remove make-up and no longer 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.020
 there are excuses that I do not have to make up 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.910
 t I ran wipes me it's over 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.460
 the liquid ran out I ran out of it 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.220
 it ended because I always say it said 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.860
 they said their past those excuses the oil 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.910
 of coconut is one of the best maquillan 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.360
 which can exist in life number 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.830
 four 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.170
 Exfoliating for the body combine 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.360
 coconut oil and sugar you put in a 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.370
 little bottle and every year they get 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.580
 exfoliates rikishi 57 those that are waxed 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.530
 with creamed with soap cited with that 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.050
 They have their own foam for hair removal and 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.090
 you run out you can use the oil 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:15.430
 coconut you put it like it's your 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.380
 lotion you depilas and ball 6 also another 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.090
 part that hydrates super well are the 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.650
 lips if you do not have league bound 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.410
 I recommend that you use oil 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.760
 Coco I have put it several times and 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:30.230
 if it is very moisturizing 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.230
 number 7 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.340
 If you have a tub in your house, add some 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.910
 droplets of coconut oil before 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:44.010
 bathe and you do not know 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.010
 the skin that you go 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.890
 18 we women are very painted 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.340
 the nails that there are excuse not to 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.440
 I also bring painted but a part 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.270
 very important to paint the nails is 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.820
 before doing the manicure the 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.130
 cuticle removing fingernails 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.950
 cutting the file, not the ones that remain 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.350
 pretty cute monkeys so they can 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.980
 wear the enamel and there are times when no 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.350
 we have or if we have but we do not use the 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.810
 cuticle cream to have some 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.360
 nice nails and if you do not have it you can 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.980
 coconut oil used also for 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.260
 remove cuticle 9 if you're one of those 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.990
 suffers a little 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.440
 Felician hair do not worry your 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.180
 time and your luck are here better than 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.390
 you have to do is add a few 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:40.530
 drops of coconut oil in your hand to 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:43.470
 put on your hair and thus avoid that 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.820
 I expressed it I used it enough 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.630
 times because the weather really 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.030
 monterrey 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.030
 and it is not necessary 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:06:00.530
 10 the coconut oil is one of the 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:04.380
 Better oils to prevent stretch marks 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:07.170
 stretch marks you can use it in the parts 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.560
 where you can possibly get out 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:13.830
 stretch marks and so you avoid them is an oil 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.990
 Very moisturizing and it's great to use 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.450
 I forgot to tell you something super 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:23.660
 important has to be coconut oil 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:27.620
 extra virgin can appreciate it 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:31.430
 I bought it in gmc and it has lasted me 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:35.190
 a lot of rum if you can see it is how they 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.969
 it said it has a consistency 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.999
 half hard 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:42.919
 but it's because right now the weather 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:45.379

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:48.739

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.510
 it smells like the beach here so good 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.700
 these were my 10 favorite ways to 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.160
 use coconut oil if you have 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.260
