00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.490 

and<00:00:15.760> that's<00:00:16.240> where<00:00:16.630> Mik<00:00:16.840> starts<00:00:17.170> and<00:00:17.290> then<00:00:17.380> I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
and that's where Mik starts and then I

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:55.060 
and that's where Mik starts and then I
come<00:00:17.770> in<00:00:17.980> halfway<00:00:18.520> through<00:00:19.030> that<00:00:19.060> with

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:03.670 

and<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.250> there's<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.670> verse<00:00:56.910> riff<00:00:57.180> which<00:00:57.480> is

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:22.080 

me<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.489> basically<00:01:04.640> that's<00:01:05.090> the<00:01:05.239> nature

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.819 

I<00:01:22.320> guess<00:01:23.320> we're<00:01:23.439> going<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.590> talk<00:01:23.799> about

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
I guess we're going to talk about

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.859 
I guess we're going to talk about
psychosocial<00:01:24.640> we're<00:01:25.149> going<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.359> do<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.509> intro

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
psychosocial we're going to do the intro

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.090 
psychosocial we're going to do the intro
and<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:27.549> I<00:01:27.670> can<00:01:27.820> remember<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.270> solo<00:01:28.630> for<00:01:28.899> it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and if I can remember the solo for it

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.499 
and if I can remember the solo for it
uh-huh

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
uh-huh

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.569 
uh-huh
basically<00:01:31.509> this<00:01:31.689> isn't<00:01:31.990> an<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.289> tuning<00:01:32.770> so

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
basically this isn't an a tuning so

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.789 
basically this isn't an a tuning so
would<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.819> be<00:01:33.939> a<00:01:33.969> standard<00:01:34.659> B<00:01:34.899> tuning<00:01:35.439> with<00:01:35.590> the

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
would it be a standard B tuning with the

00:01:35.799 --> 00:02:10.030 
would it be a standard B tuning with the
low<00:01:36.100> string<00:01:36.460> dropped<00:01:36.789> to<00:01:37.479> a

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.900 

that's<00:02:11.040> probably<00:02:11.220> about<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:11.550> good<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:11.790> it's

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
that's probably about as good as it's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:41.440 
that's probably about as good as it's
gonna<00:02:12.030> get<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.660> yeah<00:02:15.870> slower<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:17.670> would<00:02:17.820> be

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.030 

I<00:02:42.129> use<00:02:43.129> slow<00:02:43.340> grind<00:02:43.700> down<00:02:44.000> but<00:02:44.860> anyways<00:02:45.860> that's

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
I use slow grind down but anyways that's

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.720 
I use slow grind down but anyways that's
essentially<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.670> beginning<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.569> uh

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
essentially the beginning of that and uh

00:02:48.730 --> 00:03:08.760 
essentially the beginning of that and uh
whoo<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.209> solo<00:02:50.660> alright

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
something like that

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:30.920 
something like that
sound<00:03:11.750> closed<00:03:14.200> anyways

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:41.230
