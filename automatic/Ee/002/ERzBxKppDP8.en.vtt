00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
orange one it's a little messy but it

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.660 
orange one it's a little messy but it
works<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.680> as<00:04:14.739> long<00:04:14.860> as<00:04:14.950> you<00:04:15.160> keep<00:04:15.340> an<00:04:15.519> eye<00:04:15.640> on

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
works so as long as you keep an eye on

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.289 
works so as long as you keep an eye on
which<00:04:16.140> side<00:04:17.140> that<00:04:17.579> black<00:04:18.579> piece<00:04:18.850> is<00:04:19.030> going<00:04:19.239> to

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
which side that black piece is going to

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.279 
which side that black piece is going to
be<00:04:19.450> on<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:21.220> go<00:04:21.400> under<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:22.030> around<00:04:22.840> and

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
be on and I go under and around and

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.029 
be on and I go under and around and
that's<00:04:23.440> how<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.620> keep<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:24.160> one<00:04:24.310> in<00:04:24.520> place<00:04:26.039> when

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
that's how I keep that one in place when

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.950 
that's how I keep that one in place when
I<00:04:27.070> do<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.520> when<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.000> have<00:04:28.330> one<00:04:28.479> string<00:04:28.690> on<00:04:28.840> each

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
I do this when I have one string on each

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.320 
I do this when I have one string on each
side<00:04:29.229> I<00:04:29.260> always<00:04:29.560> tighten<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.370> then<00:04:30.430> go

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
side I always tighten it and then go

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.860 
side I always tighten it and then go
back<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.750> my<00:04:32.280> right<00:04:33.280> side<00:04:33.520> string<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.240> move<00:04:34.690> it

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
back to my right side string and move it

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.850 
back to my right side string and move it
over<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.260> left<00:04:35.440> side

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.720 

and<00:04:42.860> then<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.370> go<00:04:43.550> back<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.790> my<00:04:44.030> my<00:04:44.990> left<00:04:45.230> side

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
and then I go back to my my left side

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:52.150 
and then I go back to my my left side
move<00:04:46.730> it<00:04:46.880> over<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.270> right<00:04:47.480> side<00:04:51.130> pull<00:04:52.130> it

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
move it over to the right side pull it

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.080 
move it over to the right side pull it
through<00:04:54.910> tighten

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
through tighten

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.920 
through tighten
I<00:04:57.160> don't<00:04:58.160> super<00:04:58.730> super<00:04:59.090> tighten<00:04:59.450> them<00:04:59.570> because

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
I don't super super tighten them because

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.690 
I don't super super tighten them because
then<00:05:00.080> when<00:05:00.170> I<00:05:00.200> get<00:05:00.320> back<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.070> end<00:05:01.280> there'll

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
then when I get back to the end there'll

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.310 
then when I get back to the end there'll
be<00:05:01.730> a<00:05:01.820> little<00:05:02.090> space<00:05:02.390> so<00:05:02.420> I<00:05:02.630> just<00:05:02.930> tighten<00:05:03.230> them

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
be a little space so I just tighten them

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.170 
be a little space so I just tighten them
enough<00:05:03.530> to<00:05:03.650> keep<00:05:03.800> them<00:05:03.950> together<00:05:04.100> without<00:05:04.970> a

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
enough to keep them together without a

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.570 
enough to keep them together without a
space<00:05:05.630> and<00:05:06.640> then<00:05:07.640> I<00:05:07.700> just<00:05:08.000> continue<00:05:08.630> going<00:05:09.580> as

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
space and then I just continue going as

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.760 
space and then I just continue going as
you<00:05:10.730> can<00:05:10.910> see<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.240> nice<00:05:11.390> lacing<00:05:12.260> is<00:05:12.380> starting

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
you can see the nice lacing is starting

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.950 
you can see the nice lacing is starting
there
