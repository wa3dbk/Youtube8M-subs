00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
the beginning of the video you would

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.580 
the beginning of the video you would
have<00:03:34.450> seen<00:03:34.659> it<00:03:34.870> on<00:03:35.019> my<00:03:35.319> son<00:03:35.730> it's<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.909> little

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
have seen it on my son it's a little

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.580 
have seen it on my son it's a little
rigid<00:03:38.590> it's<00:03:39.340> it's<00:03:39.790> very<00:03:39.909> like<00:03:40.480> it's<00:03:41.349> not<00:03:41.530> very

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
rigid it's it's very like it's not very

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.559 
rigid it's it's very like it's not very
soft<00:03:42.159> right<00:03:42.519> now<00:03:42.549> but<00:03:42.909> I'm<00:03:43.000> assuming<00:03:43.269> that

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
soft right now but I'm assuming that

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.319 
soft right now but I'm assuming that
would<00:03:43.690> wear<00:03:43.870> in<00:03:44.019> over<00:03:44.260> time<00:03:44.819> the<00:03:45.819> leather<00:03:46.060> is

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
would wear in over time the leather is

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.190 
would wear in over time the leather is
high<00:03:46.569> quality<00:03:47.370> very<00:03:48.370> nice<00:03:48.579> product<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.359> when

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
high quality very nice product and when

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.099 
high quality very nice product and when
I<00:03:50.230> spoke<00:03:50.620> with<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:51.010> owner<00:03:51.329> they<00:03:52.329> he<00:03:52.810> told<00:03:53.049> me

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
I spoke with the owner they he told me

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.449 
I spoke with the owner they he told me
that<00:03:53.260> if<00:03:53.409> you<00:03:53.440> place<00:03:53.680> an<00:03:53.889> order

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
that if you place an order

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.460 
that if you place an order
it<00:03:54.609> usually<00:03:54.760> takes<00:03:55.000> three<00:03:55.629> to<00:03:55.750> four<00:03:55.959> days<00:03:56.170> to

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
it usually takes three to four days to

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.800 
it usually takes three to four days to
make<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.859> case<00:03:57.099> and<00:03:57.400> then<00:03:58.000> ship<00:03:58.299> them<00:03:58.420> out<00:03:58.599> but

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
make the case and then ship them out but

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.649 
make the case and then ship them out but
if<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:58.989> starts<00:03:59.260> getting<00:03:59.530> back<00:03:59.739> ordered<00:04:00.159> like

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
if you starts getting back ordered like

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.539 
if you starts getting back ordered like
like<00:04:01.659> Luigi<00:04:02.170> with<00:04:02.470> his<00:04:02.620> cases<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.159> may<00:04:03.310> take<00:04:03.519> a

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
like Luigi with his cases it may take a

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.170 
like Luigi with his cases it may take a
little<00:04:03.730> longer<00:04:04.769> it's<00:04:05.769> a<00:04:05.859> great<00:04:06.099> product<00:04:06.430> it's

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
little longer it's a great product it's

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.750 
little longer it's a great product it's
very<00:04:07.540> functional<00:04:07.989> but<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:09.159> all<00:04:09.280> depends<00:04:09.700> on

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
very functional but it all depends on

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.149 
very functional but it all depends on
how<00:04:09.970> you<00:04:10.000> want<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.540> carry<00:04:10.870> your<00:04:11.139> m9<00:04:11.739> some

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
people don't like cases and carrying

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.560 
people don't like cases and carrying
things<00:04:15.370> like<00:04:15.669> this<00:04:15.910> while<00:04:16.180> other<00:04:16.359> people

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
things like this while other people
