00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
batteries removed from this craftsman

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.579 
batteries removed from this craftsman
battery<00:00:10.670> pack<00:00:11.030> the<00:00:11.389> two<00:00:11.630> that<00:00:11.839> I<00:00:11.870> determined

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:12.589 
battery pack the two that I determined

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.510 
battery pack the two that I determined
were<00:00:12.940> dead<00:00:13.940> and<00:00:14.389> then<00:00:15.259> I've<00:00:15.440> got<00:00:15.679> my<00:00:15.710> two<00:00:15.950> new

were dead and then I've got my two new

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.299 
were dead and then I've got my two new
cells<00:00:17.119> I<00:00:17.630> picked<00:00:18.080> up<00:00:18.430> last<00:00:19.430> week<00:00:20.829> and<00:00:21.829> I've<00:00:22.099> got

00:00:22.299 --> 00:00:22.309 
cells I picked up last week and I've got

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:24.880 
cells I picked up last week and I've got
both<00:00:22.700> these<00:00:22.970> charged<00:00:23.540> up<00:00:23.809> and<00:00:24.110> I<00:00:24.200> charged<00:00:24.649> up

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
both these charged up and I charged up

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.380 
both these charged up and I charged up
the<00:00:25.430> other<00:00:25.610> three<00:00:26.180> in<00:00:26.450> there<00:00:27.160> and<00:00:28.270> what<00:00:29.270> I've

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
done is cleaned up the the tabs here got

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.599 
done is cleaned up the the tabs here got
them<00:00:35.660> straightened<00:00:36.199> out<00:00:36.350> after<00:00:36.949> you<00:00:37.519> know

00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:37.609 
them straightened out after you know

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.000 
them straightened out after you know
breaking<00:00:37.879> spot-welds<00:00:38.839> kind<00:00:39.079> of<00:00:39.199> deforms<00:00:39.769> I'm

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
breaking spot-welds kind of deforms I'm

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.630 
breaking spot-welds kind of deforms I'm
sorry<00:00:40.339> I<00:00:40.670> got<00:00:41.480> those<00:00:41.980> flattened<00:00:42.980> out<00:00:43.070> as<00:00:43.370> best

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
sorry I got those flattened out as best

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.540 
sorry I got those flattened out as best
I<00:00:43.820> could<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.570> kind<00:00:44.809> of<00:00:44.899> bent<00:00:45.170> them<00:00:45.440> up<00:00:46.039> so

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
I could and kind of bent them up so

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.569 
I could and kind of bent them up so
they're<00:00:46.730> kind<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.809> sprung<00:00:48.499> into<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.159> battery

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
they're kind of sprung into the battery

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.020 
they're kind of sprung into the battery
and<00:00:50.030> that<00:00:50.089> way<00:00:50.870> then<00:00:51.199> I<00:00:51.320> can<00:00:51.350> put<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.030> new

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
and that way then I can put the new

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.189 
and that way then I can put the new
cells<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.019> they<00:00:54.109> kind<00:00:54.379> of<00:00:54.559> hold<00:00:55.339> the<00:00:55.699> tabs

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
cells in and they kind of hold the tabs

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.649 
cells in and they kind of hold the tabs
down<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:58.989> terminals<00:00:59.989> on<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.199> battery<00:01:00.499> and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
down to the terminals on the battery and

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.439 
down to the terminals on the battery and
just<00:01:02.659> this<00:01:03.499> one<00:01:03.800> here<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:04.699> is<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.940> main

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
just this one here this is the main

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.130 
just this one here this is the main
negative<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.890> come<00:01:07.130> down<00:01:07.310> positive<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.510> then

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
negative you come down positive and then

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.290 
negative you come down positive and then
that<00:01:09.350> hooks<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:09.950> negative<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:10.730> this<00:01:10.970> cell

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
that hooks to the negative of this cell

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.770 
that hooks to the negative of this cell
up<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:12.140> positive<00:01:12.800> and<00:01:13.130> then<00:01:13.910> this<00:01:14.090> last<00:01:14.390> cell

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
up to positive and then this last cell

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.060 
up to positive and then this last cell
is<00:01:15.050> going<00:01:15.230> to<00:01:15.290> go<00:01:15.470> in<00:01:16.300> negative<00:01:17.300> on<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.750> top

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
is going to go in negative on the top

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.250 
is going to go in negative on the top
positive<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.490> then<00:01:20.180> over<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.780> this<00:01:20.960> one

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
positive and then over to this one

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.910 
positive and then over to this one
negative<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:22.310> positive<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:24.140> negative<00:01:24.170> to

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
negative to positive and the negative to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.600 
negative to positive and the negative to
positive<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.760> this<00:01:25.910> is<00:01:26.120> your<00:01:27.610> essentially

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
positive and this is your essentially

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.160 
positive and this is your essentially
the<00:01:28.820> 18<00:01:29.410> 19<00:01:30.410> volts<00:01:31.420> positive<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.840> then<00:01:32.990> this

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
the 18 19 volts positive and then this

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.050 
the 18 19 volts positive and then this
is<00:01:33.380> your<00:01:33.590> negative<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.490> just<00:01:34.640> got<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:34.910> make

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
is your negative so you just got to make

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.050 
is your negative so you just got to make
sure<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.540> get<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.220> get<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.250> cells<00:01:37.610> in<00:01:37.880> there

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
sure you get the get the cells in there

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.760 
sure you get the get the cells in there
properly<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:38.990> all<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.980> these<00:01:40.130> terminals<00:01:40.640> the

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
properly so all of these terminals the

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.970 
properly so all of these terminals the
bridging<00:01:42.770> terminals<00:01:43.340> take<00:01:44.120> the<00:01:44.710> positive<00:01:45.710> to

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
bridging terminals take the positive to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.690 
bridging terminals take the positive to
the<00:01:46.010> next<00:01:46.370> negative<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.680> this<00:01:48.680> one<00:01:48.980> here<00:01:49.400> was

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
the next negative and this one here was

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.570 
the next negative and this one here was
the<00:01:50.060> positive<00:01:50.300> to<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.050> negative<00:01:51.490> so<00:01:52.490> you

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
the positive to this negative so you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.960 
the positive to this negative so you
just<00:01:52.730> have<00:01:52.910> to<00:01:52.940> make<00:01:53.240> sure<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.660> get<00:01:53.840> all<00:01:54.020> those

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
just have to make sure you get all those

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.880 
just have to make sure you get all those
all<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.210> battery<00:01:56.510> alignments<00:01:57.170> straight<00:01:57.530> and

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
all the battery alignments straight and

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.550 
all the battery alignments straight and
then<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.370> can<00:01:58.550> give<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:58.910> a<00:01:59.140> go<00:02:00.140> with<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
then you can give it a go with the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.830 
then you can give it a go with the
soldering<00:02:00.890> iron<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:01.790> I'll<00:02:01.970> I'll<00:02:02.300> come<00:02:02.660> back

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
soldering iron so I'll I'll come back

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.660 
soldering iron so I'll I'll come back
and<00:02:03.170> show<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.380> what<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:03.650> looks<00:02:04.010> like<00:02:04.100> okay

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
and show you what that looks like okay

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.370 
and show you what that looks like okay
I'll<00:02:04.910> see<00:02:05.150> if<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.360> can<00:02:05.600> do<00:02:05.930> this<00:02:06.170> without

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
I'll see if I can do this without

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.339 
I'll see if I can do this without
blocking<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:07.040> camera<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:08.420> what<00:02:08.840> I've<00:02:08.959> found

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
blocking the camera so what I've found

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.819 
blocking the camera so what I've found
that<00:02:09.590> works<00:02:09.679> pretty<00:02:10.099> good<00:02:10.249> is<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:10.999> need<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.870> tin

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
that works pretty good is you need a tin

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:13.600 
that works pretty good is you need a tin
to<00:02:13.189> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
to the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.610 
to the
end<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.840> battery<00:02:15.470> terminal<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:17.440> little<00:02:18.440> bit

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
end of the battery terminal a little bit

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.100 
end of the battery terminal a little bit
of<00:02:18.740> flux<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.460> some<00:02:19.790> solder<00:02:20.120> just<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.750> get<00:02:20.900> that

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
of flux and some solder just to get that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.140 
of flux and some solder just to get that
and<00:02:21.530> then<00:02:21.590> I've<00:02:21.770> tinned<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.370> bottom<00:02:22.790> side<00:02:23.090> of

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
and then I've tinned the bottom side of

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.930 
and then I've tinned the bottom side of
the<00:02:25.330> terminal<00:02:26.330> on<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.810> battery<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:28.160> then

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
the terminal on the battery and then

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.850 
the terminal on the battery and then
what<00:02:29.330> seems<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.080> work<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.680> if<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:32.420> need

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
what seems to work is if you you need

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.160 
what seems to work is if you you need
the<00:02:33.860> soldering<00:02:34.220> iron<00:02:34.430> get<00:02:35.210> that<00:02:35.510> on<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:38.170> wait

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
the soldering iron get that on the wait

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.460 
the soldering iron get that on the wait
till<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.560> melts

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.600 

and<00:02:45.740> then<00:02:46.220> kind<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.730> hold<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.120> down<00:02:47.360> while<00:02:47.990> the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
and then kind of hold it down while the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.000 
and then kind of hold it down while the
solder<00:02:49.610> cools<00:02:50.090> because<00:02:50.960> it's<00:02:51.440> gonna<00:02:51.620> want<00:02:51.860> to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
solder cools because it's gonna want to

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.270 
solder cools because it's gonna want to
spring<00:02:52.340> up<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.640> little<00:02:52.820> bit<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:54.860> repeat

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
spring up a little bit and just repeat

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.500 
spring up a little bit and just repeat
that<00:02:55.490> for<00:02:55.910> all<00:02:56.000> four<00:02:57.580> connections<00:02:58.580> or<00:02:58.910> two<00:02:59.240> for

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
that for all four connections or two for

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.930 
that for all four connections or two for
each<00:02:59.600> battery<00:03:00.080> at<00:03:00.320> least<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.460> I've<00:03:01.640> got<00:03:01.820> two

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
each battery at least so I've got two

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.270 
each battery at least so I've got two
I'll<00:03:02.600> let<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:02.930> cool<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.650> then<00:03:03.800> flip<00:03:04.130> the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
I'll let that cool and then flip the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.330 
I'll let that cool and then flip the
battery<00:03:04.460> over<00:03:05.240> and<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:06.530> got<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.710> solder<00:03:07.040> the

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
battery over and I got a solder the

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.940 
battery over and I got a solder the
other<00:03:07.520> two<00:03:07.850> sides<00:03:08.240> and<00:03:08.750> then<00:03:09.350> it's<00:03:09.560> time<00:03:09.920> to

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
other two sides and then it's time to

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.140 
other two sides and then it's time to
check<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.910> out<00:03:11.000> see<00:03:11.360> if<00:03:11.390> we<00:03:11.600> get<00:03:12.700> around<00:03:13.700> 20

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
check it out see if we get around 20

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.540 
check it out see if we get around 20
volts<00:03:14.510> across<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.140> terminals<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.220> I'll<00:03:16.340> be

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
volts across the terminals so I'll be

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.550 
volts across the terminals so I'll be
back<00:03:16.760> when<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.360> get<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.750> finished<00:03:18.140> oh<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.410> one

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
back when I get that finished oh and one

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.660 
back when I get that finished oh and one
other<00:03:19.360> tip<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.600> found<00:03:20.960> our<00:03:21.500> little<00:03:21.740> pointer<00:03:22.430> is

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
other tip I found our little pointer is

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.820 
other tip I found our little pointer is
to<00:03:23.060> make<00:03:23.270> sure<00:03:23.300> that<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:24.290> because<00:03:24.680> the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
to make sure that the because the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.860 
to make sure that the because the
batteries<00:03:25.250> kind<00:03:25.520> of<00:03:25.610> want<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.820> spring<00:03:26.210> out<00:03:26.540> of

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
batteries kind of want to spring out of

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.770 
batteries kind of want to spring out of
the<00:03:27.020> case<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.710> little<00:03:28.040> bit<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.180> want<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.630> get

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
the case a little bit so you want to get

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.200 
the case a little bit so you want to get
them<00:03:31.000> pushed<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.330> as<00:03:32.690> far<00:03:33.530> as<00:03:33.770> you<00:03:33.920> can

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
them pushed in as far as you can

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.680 
them pushed in as far as you can
prior<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:36.730> soldering<00:03:37.730> them<00:03:37.910> in<00:03:38.090> place<00:03:38.390> because

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
prior to soldering them in place because

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.840 
prior to soldering them in place because
once<00:03:38.930> they're<00:03:39.110> soldered<00:03:39.530> in<00:03:39.680> place<00:03:39.710> and<00:03:40.550> if

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
once they're soldered in place and if

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.090 
once they're soldered in place and if
they're<00:03:41.150> sticking<00:03:42.080> out<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.260> little<00:03:42.410> bit<00:03:42.830> the

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
they're sticking out a little bit the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.640 
they're sticking out a little bit the
the<00:03:43.130> bottom<00:03:43.820> of<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.000> case<00:03:44.210> may<00:03:44.510> not<00:03:44.540> fit<00:03:45.020> on<00:03:45.200> so

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
the bottom of the case may not fit on so

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.050 
the bottom of the case may not fit on so
the<00:03:47.770> you<00:03:48.770> can<00:03:48.830> see<00:03:49.040> this<00:03:49.220> one<00:03:49.430> wants<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.760> pop

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
the you can see this one wants to pop

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.300 
the you can see this one wants to pop
out<00:03:50.300> just<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.750> little<00:03:50.780> bit<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.530> kind<00:03:52.100> of<00:03:52.190> make

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
out just a little bit so kind of make

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.449 
out just a little bit so kind of make
sure<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.910> they're<00:03:53.180> all<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.200> way<00:03:54.320> in<00:03:54.739> before

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
sure that they're all the way in before

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.710 
sure that they're all the way in before
you<00:03:56.709> heat<00:03:57.709> up<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:58.130> solder<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:59.150> get<00:03:59.630> them

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
you heat up the solder and get them

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.620 
you heat up the solder and get them
stuck<00:03:59.989> in<00:04:00.050> place<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:01.430> I'll<00:04:01.580> come<00:04:02.060> back<00:04:02.270> when<00:04:02.600> I

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
stuck in place so I'll come back when I

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.140 
stuck in place so I'll come back when I
have<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.320> rest<00:04:03.920> of<00:04:04.100> them<00:04:04.250> soldered<00:04:04.670> in<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:05.030> we

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
have the rest of them soldered in and we

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.840 
have the rest of them soldered in and we
can<00:04:05.300> check<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.660> out<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.989> went<00:04:06.260> if<00:04:06.470> I<00:04:06.650> found<00:04:07.400> was

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
can check it out and went if I found was

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.370 
can check it out and went if I found was
also<00:04:08.450> too<00:04:08.510> I<00:04:08.959> have<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.310> temperature-controlled

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
also too I have a temperature-controlled

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.020 
also too I have a temperature-controlled
HECO<00:04:12.580> 9:36<00:04:13.580> soldering<00:04:14.120> station<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.110> I<00:04:15.200> had<00:04:15.410> it

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
HECO 9:36 soldering station and I had it

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.509 
HECO 9:36 soldering station and I had it
pretty<00:04:17.030> much<00:04:17.150> turned<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:17.810> up<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.230> think<00:04:18.859> let's

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
pretty much turned it up I think let's

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.690 
pretty much turned it up I think let's
see<00:04:19.669> what<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.500> number<00:04:21.500> is<00:04:21.530> over<00:04:22.010> there<00:04:22.250> I<00:04:22.280> was

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
see what the number is over there I was

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.680 
see what the number is over there I was
up<00:04:22.820> around<00:04:23.470> 450<00:04:24.470> C<00:04:24.980> so<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.550> had<00:04:25.790> it<00:04:25.820> turned<00:04:26.270> up<00:04:26.510> I

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
up around 450 C so I had it turned up I

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.970 
up around 450 C so I had it turned up I
normally<00:04:27.400> run<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.580> around<00:04:29.740> maybe<00:04:30.910> 300<00:04:32.500> 350<00:04:33.500> or

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
normally run it around maybe 300 350 or

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.370 
normally run it around maybe 300 350 or
so<00:04:34.250> is<00:04:34.520> where<00:04:34.760> I<00:04:34.790> usually<00:04:35.090> use<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.780> so<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:36.020> turned

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
so is where I usually use it so I turned

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.310 
so is where I usually use it so I turned
it<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:37.370> know<00:04:37.460> turn<00:04:38.390> it<00:04:38.540> up<00:04:38.660> about<00:04:38.900> as<00:04:39.080> high<00:04:39.290> as

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
it you know turn it up about as high as

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.170 
it you know turn it up about as high as
it<00:04:39.650> would<00:04:39.800> go<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:40.580> then<00:04:41.590> when<00:04:42.590> you're

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
it would go and then when you're

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.330 
it would go and then when you're
soldering<00:04:44.180> I'll<00:04:44.780> swing<00:04:45.410> back<00:04:45.620> over<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:46.220> the

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
soldering I'll swing back over to the

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.159 
soldering I'll swing back over to the
batteries<00:04:46.820> here<00:04:47.150> like<00:04:47.480> I<00:04:47.600> said<00:04:47.630> when<00:04:48.020> you're

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
batteries here like I said when you're

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.860 
batteries here like I said when you're
soldering<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:49.010> tabs<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.760> want<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.300> heat

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
soldering the tabs you want the heat

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.560 
soldering the tabs you want the heat
really<00:04:51.230> high<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:52.160> you<00:04:52.220> heat<00:04:52.700> this<00:04:52.910> up<00:04:53.150> quickly

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
really high so you heat this up quickly

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.529 
really high so you heat this up quickly
and<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:55.250> found<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.729> it<00:04:55.880> actually<00:04:56.330> works

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
and I found that it actually works

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:57.909 
and I found that it actually works
better

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
better

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:05.020 
better
-<00:04:58.159> I've<00:04:59.289> magnifier<00:05:00.289> that<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:01.069> put<00:05:01.340> over<00:05:01.520> and<00:05:04.030> he

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
- I've magnifier that I put over and he

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.409 
- I've magnifier that I put over and he
just<00:05:05.599> until<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.229> see<00:05:06.499> the<00:05:06.830> solder<00:05:07.430> the

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
just until you see the solder the

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.330 
just until you see the solder the
tinning<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.199> put<00:05:09.469> on<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.860> terminal<00:05:10.310> of

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
tinning that you put on the terminal of

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.209 
tinning that you put on the terminal of
the<00:05:10.490> battery<00:05:10.900> just<00:05:11.900> until<00:05:12.289> that<00:05:12.529> liquefies

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:13.219 
the battery just until that liquefies

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.269 
the battery just until that liquefies
and<00:05:13.249> then<00:05:13.759> pull<00:05:14.029> the<00:05:14.300> iron<00:05:14.599> away<00:05:15.009> but<00:05:16.009> you<00:05:16.129> have

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:16.279 
and then pull the iron away but you have

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:20.580 
and then pull the iron away but you have
to<00:05:16.430> leave<00:05:17.110> something<00:05:18.110> on<00:05:18.469> there<00:05:18.830> to<00:05:19.099> keep<00:05:19.340> the

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
to leave something on there to keep the

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.209 
to leave something on there to keep the
terminal<00:05:21.699> or<00:05:22.699> the<00:05:22.879> little<00:05:23.090> tab<00:05:23.870> press<00:05:24.860> down

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:25.219 
terminal or the little tab press down

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:27.399 
terminal or the little tab press down
until<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.969> solder<00:05:26.150> cools<00:05:26.629> because<00:05:27.259> you've

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
until the solder cools because you've

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.439 
until the solder cools because you've
heated<00:05:27.800> up<00:05:27.949> quite<00:05:28.189> a<00:05:28.219> bit<00:05:28.460> of<00:05:28.490> metal<00:05:28.879> there<00:05:29.060> so

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
heated up quite a bit of metal there so

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.029 
heated up quite a bit of metal there so
it<00:05:30.259> takes<00:05:31.569> maybe<00:05:32.569> ten<00:05:32.960> seconds<00:05:33.500> you've<00:05:33.710> got<00:05:33.889> to

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
it takes maybe ten seconds you've got to

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.399 
it takes maybe ten seconds you've got to
hold<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.460> in<00:05:34.610> place<00:05:34.819> or<00:05:35.419> otherwise<00:05:35.990> you'll<00:05:36.259> get

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
hold it in place or otherwise you'll get

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.580 
hold it in place or otherwise you'll get
a<00:05:36.469> cold<00:05:36.800> solder<00:05:37.159> joint<00:05:37.610> there<00:05:37.969> so<00:05:38.840> you<00:05:38.900> you

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
a cold solder joint there so you you

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.589 
a cold solder joint there so you you
want<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:39.830> heat<00:05:40.039> it<00:05:40.189> really<00:05:40.849> hot<00:05:41.060> really<00:05:41.449> fast

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
want to heat it really hot really fast

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:45.820 
want to heat it really hot really fast
and<00:05:42.409> then<00:05:42.699> have<00:05:43.699> something<00:05:44.360> metal<00:05:45.289> there<00:05:45.529> to

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
and then have something metal there to

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.079 
and then have something metal there to
hold<00:05:46.039> it<00:05:46.279> down<00:05:46.539> while<00:05:47.539> the<00:05:47.779> solder<00:05:49.089> solidifies

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:50.089 
hold it down while the solder solidifies

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:52.839 
hold it down while the solder solidifies
and<00:05:51.020> that<00:05:51.710> seemed<00:05:51.979> to<00:05:52.129> work<00:05:52.250> pretty<00:05:52.310> good

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
and that seemed to work pretty good

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.769 
and that seemed to work pretty good
let's<00:05:54.430> put<00:05:55.430> this<00:05:55.550> back<00:05:55.819> together<00:05:56.029> and<00:05:56.539> see

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:56.779 
let's put this back together and see

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.110 
let's put this back together and see
what<00:05:56.960> kind<00:05:57.199> of<00:05:57.289> voltage<00:05:57.409> we<00:05:57.800> get<00:05:58.009> okay<00:05:58.729> I<00:05:58.759> have

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
what kind of voltage we get okay I have

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.969 
what kind of voltage we get okay I have
everything<00:05:59.449> put<00:06:00.080> back<00:06:00.319> together<00:06:02.949> kind<00:06:03.949> of

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
everything put back together kind of

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.490 
everything put back together kind of
tight<00:06:04.219> fit<00:06:04.520> you<00:06:04.699> got<00:06:04.819> to<00:06:04.909> get<00:06:05.029> the<00:06:05.500> batteries

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
tight fit you got to get the batteries

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.249 
tight fit you got to get the batteries
shoved<00:06:06.830> back<00:06:07.099> in<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.430> case<00:06:07.669> get<00:06:08.270> the<00:06:08.479> if<00:06:09.229> you

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 
shoved back in the case get the if you

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.140 
shoved back in the case get the if you
have<00:06:09.409> the<00:06:09.439> fuel<00:06:09.860> gauge<00:06:10.189> get<00:06:10.610> that<00:06:10.789> plugged

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
have the fuel gauge get that plugged

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.369 
have the fuel gauge get that plugged
back<00:06:11.479> in<00:06:11.800> this<00:06:12.800> was<00:06:13.009> the<00:06:13.159> one<00:06:13.339> that<00:06:13.639> was

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 
back in this was the one that was

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.769 
back in this was the one that was
actually<00:06:15.379> it<00:06:15.439> looks<00:06:15.589> like<00:06:15.649> I<00:06:15.889> have<00:06:15.979> a<00:06:16.009> broken

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:16.779 
actually it looks like I have a broken

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.689 
actually it looks like I have a broken
one<00:06:17.779> of<00:06:17.899> the<00:06:17.960> wires<00:06:18.169> didn't<00:06:18.649> like<00:06:18.800> being<00:06:19.339> bent

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
one of the wires didn't like being bent

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.510 
one of the wires didn't like being bent
so<00:06:19.939> I'm<00:06:20.000> gonna<00:06:20.120> have<00:06:20.270> to<00:06:20.360> solder<00:06:20.599> that<00:06:20.750> back<00:06:21.199> in

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
so I'm gonna have to solder that back in

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.309 
so I'm gonna have to solder that back in
imagine<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.610> green<00:06:22.849> LED<00:06:23.479> probably<00:06:23.990> doesn't

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
imagine the green LED probably doesn't

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.389 
imagine the green LED probably doesn't
light<00:06:24.469> up<00:06:24.500> anymore

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:25.399 
light up anymore

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:29.649 
light up anymore
in<00:06:26.029> fact<00:06:26.240> I<00:06:26.389> can<00:06:26.569> check<00:06:26.779> that<00:06:26.810> oh<00:06:27.580> yeah<00:06:28.610> so<00:06:28.909> that

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
in fact I can check that oh yeah so that

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:32.709 
in fact I can check that oh yeah so that
circuit<00:06:30.199> board<00:06:30.399> I've<00:06:31.399> got<00:06:31.669> to<00:06:31.819> take<00:06:32.300> that<00:06:32.509> back

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:32.719 
circuit board I've got to take that back

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:36.730 
circuit board I've got to take that back
apart<00:06:33.110> and<00:06:33.649> check<00:06:34.219> that<00:06:34.399> fuel<00:06:34.789> gauge

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
apart and check that fuel gauge

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.459 
apart and check that fuel gauge
I<00:06:36.819> must<00:06:37.819> not<00:06:38.060> get<00:06:38.300> loose<00:06:38.569> but<00:06:38.839> let's<00:06:39.020> check<00:06:39.229> the

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:39.469 
I must not get loose but let's check the

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:43.269 
I must not get loose but let's check the
batteries<00:06:40.129> so<00:06:40.159> here<00:06:40.759> we<00:06:40.909> go<00:06:41.770> twenty<00:06:42.770> points

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:43.279 
batteries so here we go twenty points

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:48.629 
batteries so here we go twenty points
six<00:06:43.610> volts<00:06:44.830> that<00:06:45.849> sounds<00:06:46.849> like<00:06:47.000> five<00:06:47.360> times

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 
six volts that sounds like five times

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.600 
six volts that sounds like five times
four<00:06:49.639> point<00:06:49.939> one<00:06:50.240> and<00:06:50.689> a<00:06:51.589> little<00:06:51.710> bit<00:06:51.979> so<00:06:52.370> that

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
four point one and a little bit so that

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.499 
four point one and a little bit so that
sounds<00:06:53.089> good

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:53.509 
sounds good

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.670 
sounds good
I'll<00:06:53.779> check<00:06:54.469> the<00:06:55.089> fuel<00:06:56.089> gauge<00:06:56.389> here<00:06:56.899> and<00:06:57.110> see

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
I'll check the fuel gauge here and see

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.999 
I'll check the fuel gauge here and see
what's<00:06:57.889> going<00:06:58.009> on<00:06:58.310> with<00:06:58.550> that<00:06:59.649> this<00:07:00.649> is<00:07:00.830> one<00:07:00.979> of

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.009 
what's going on with that this is one of

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.409 
what's going on with that this is one of
the<00:07:01.219> early<00:07:01.699> fuel<00:07:02.149> gauges<00:07:02.539> so<00:07:03.110> it's<00:07:03.349> I<00:07:04.360> didn't

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419 
the early fuel gauges so it's I didn't

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.869 
the early fuel gauges so it's I didn't
unscrew<00:07:06.139> anything<00:07:06.769> but<00:07:07.159> it<00:07:07.279> looks<00:07:07.459> like<00:07:07.669> it

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:07.879 
unscrew anything but it looks like it

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:10.990 
unscrew anything but it looks like it
jiggled<00:07:08.419> its<00:07:08.599> way<00:07:08.750> loose<00:07:09.199> there<00:07:09.680> so

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 
jiggled its way loose there so

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.330 
jiggled its way loose there so
have<00:07:11.120> to<00:07:11.240> check<00:07:11.510> that<00:07:11.690> out<00:07:12.010> so<00:07:13.010> let's<00:07:13.160> see

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
have to check that out so let's see

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.120 
have to check that out so let's see
what's<00:07:13.520> going<00:07:13.610> on<00:07:13.880> without
