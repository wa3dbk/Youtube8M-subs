00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
going to instance like i'm going to try

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.880 
going to instance like i'm going to try
to<00:00:42.450> be<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.690> simple<00:00:42.930> as<00:00:43.079> possible<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.620> i

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
to be as simple as possible because i

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.380 
to be as simple as possible because i
think<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.250> too<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> vague

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
think it's too is it's the vague

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.810 
think it's too is it's the vague
question<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.140> i<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.129> complex<00:00:47.640> with

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
question and i can get to complex with

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.040 
question and i can get to complex with
it<00:00:47.910> because<00:00:48.059> there's<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.510> many<00:00:48.660> variations

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it because there's so many variations

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.220 
it because there's so many variations
and<00:00:49.559> external<00:00:50.039> factors<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:51.090> Y<00:00:51.420> many<00:00:51.930> sheet

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
and external factors of Y many sheet

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.020 
and external factors of Y many sheet
it's<00:00:52.800> not<00:00:53.010> i<00:00:53.070> don't<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.730> actually

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it's not i don't think you can actually

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.560 
it's not i don't think you can actually
pinpoint<00:00:54.539> why<00:00:55.469> men<00:00:55.920> cheat<00:00:56.090> you<00:00:57.090> know<00:00:57.210> because

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
pinpoint why men cheat you know because

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.229 
pinpoint why men cheat you know because
there's<00:00:58.469> no<00:00:58.649> universal<00:00:59.460> reason<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.059> know<00:01:00.210> i

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
there's no universal reason you know i

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.810 
there's no universal reason you know i
mean<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.600> can't<00:01:00.870> generalize<00:01:01.020> all<00:01:01.710> men<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
mean you can't generalize all men you

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.870 
mean you can't generalize all men you
know<00:01:02.940> i<00:01:03.210> think<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:05.549> know<00:01:05.670> what

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
know i think what you can you know what

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.399 
know i think what you can you know what
i<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:05.970> say<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:06.960> based<00:01:07.170> off<00:01:07.380> my

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
i can say you know based off my

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.140 
i can say you know based off my
knowledge<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.960> we<00:01:09.960> tend<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.880> downplay<00:01:11.880> or

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
knowledge is that we tend to downplay or

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.760 
knowledge is that we tend to downplay or
we<00:01:12.270> tend<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.689> give<00:01:12.930> enough<00:01:13.200> credit<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
we tend to not give enough credit to the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
we tend to not give enough credit to the
power<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.189> influence<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:15.000> think<00:01:15.630> our<00:01:15.780> pears

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
