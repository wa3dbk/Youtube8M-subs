00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 well what do I mean easily? 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.809
 many of you are used to 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.640
 to see the typical video tutorial in which 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.460
 extract files with wilder are copied 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.739
 folders and that and that that sucks 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.659
 sir it sucks personally gives me 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.029
 least to make me the way of Santiago 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:27.060
 before installing a bot voucher is a 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.890
 damn bread and good investigating 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.519
 investigating to find nothing but a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.529
 my friend 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.440
 marchena a page on which to settle 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.969
 night is very simple and good now the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.899
 I will present vale we go to our 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.570
 favorite browser 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.160
 in my case google chrome then we go 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.309
 to the next page that I will leave in 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.239
 the description of the video ww point spray 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.589
 two points with good we click and good 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.710
 student explain a little bit above 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.329
 how does this work, here we see how 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.000
 we are in the area right now 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.580
 we see here some more and good 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.860
 space install what this means 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.480
 then we can choose the version in the 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.949
 which we want to install the world is worth 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.229
 we can choose the one we want here at 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.610
 see versions 1.4 with all no point 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.430
 it's the oldest 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.930
 then maps that mean maps then 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.000
 if you have to observe you can 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.220
 install them this series of maps is worth 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 we have more down here and good you 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.790
 you can install the one and play in the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.369
 next map is ok and good then 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.890
 textures then the basics do not text e for 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.250
 that has nothing else up here 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.810
 where we see here in search we can put 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.020
 what we want is worth it and in this case I'm going 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.050
 to install the tunnel items craft we give 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.550
 click and we waited and good here 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.810
 we see that advice whenever you open 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.030
 the first one I think is the most 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.649
 advisable but good then for 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.020
 open the next page we will have to 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.880
 high command to the title of the text where 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.610
 it puts too many times mod to install form and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.070
 1.6 point 4 where it puts continue rating 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.869
 will appear on the same page it 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.610
 it will just appear right on the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.830
 same then here we see a couple of 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.300
 videos install instructions and here 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.840
 we see mode version for the version that 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.869
 we want to go from this 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.119
 we will not need the semen craft 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.440
 good force is easy to install 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.090
 just go to this page that 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.010
 we have been previously and we put 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.459
 install mode forge and gaspar has nothing 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.129
 more and good here mounted nistal option jay 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.900
 default teacher force equal in 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.239
 we have to install the mode we see here 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.920
 it's easy ok it's like we've gone now to 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.540
 look for the tumen intel but instead of 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.640
 put your mind expose the minecraft for 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.400
 does not have manuals or module how 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.410
 you want then here we see a series of 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.440
 where putting a line this then 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.150
 we will also get this and this is worth it and 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.920
 well I personally is the advice that 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.829
 put the double angel xxi as it is more 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:47.079
 simple and it weighs less then we wait 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:49.420
 to load 5 4 3 2 1 and even jump 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.329
 good advertising we jump advertising and 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.680
 below if the file will appear 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.459
 ok here we see it now it will put us 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.799
 run 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.290
 we click on it then what to do 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.239
 here then simply where you put so much 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.709
 version we have to put this what 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.170
 does this mean if you have the 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.700
 hose force will appear this with a 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.520
 series of numbers in this case I will 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.150
 catch this one 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.440
 then we see it installed and it is 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.570
 accept good this 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.210
 one minute depends on the connection to 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.950
 internet that you have but we go that with 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.660
 tandem doing nothing is the best you can 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.940
 make good the video short and now we 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.190
 we see 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.650

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.630

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.430
 we will install we will be installed 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.260
 a bestial speed is worth and good I've 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.380
 killed to intern approximately 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.180

 install it install it worth it this already 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.670
