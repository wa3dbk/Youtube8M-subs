Allah but again this here is production
and<00:02:27.070> it<00:02:27.250> doesn't<00:02:27.520> really<00:02:27.610> could<00:02:27.850> leave<00:02:28.030> a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
and it doesn't really could leave a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.080 
and it doesn't really could leave a
spout<00:02:28.750> off<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.050> sides<00:02:29.260> because<00:02:29.530> um<00:02:30.090> it's

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
spout off the sides because um it's

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.060 
spout off the sides because um it's
being<00:02:31.360> blocked<00:02:31.480> off<00:02:32.130> but<00:02:33.130> still<00:02:34.740> still<00:02:35.740> coming

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
being blocked off but still still coming

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.970 
being blocked off but still still coming
out<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.310> sides<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.990> top<00:02:39.840> no<00:02:40.840> salt<00:02:41.170> mine<00:02:41.620> I

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
out the sides in the top no salt mine I

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.860 
out the sides in the top no salt mine I
put<00:02:42.280> not<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> lick<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.510> salt<00:02:43.810> in<00:02:43.930> here<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:45.870> for

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
put not a lick of salt in here just for

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.030 
put not a lick of salt in here just for
argument's<00:02:47.440> sake<00:02:48.810> good<00:02:49.810> luck<00:02:49.930> fault

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.490 

all<00:02:53.670> right<00:02:55.819> about<00:02:56.819> side<00:02:57.719> of<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.959> teaspoon<00:02:58.200> of

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
all right about side of a teaspoon of

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.640 
all right about side of a teaspoon of
salt

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.200 

do<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.340> put<00:03:05.579> off<00:03:05.760> anything

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
do you put off anything

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.820 
do you put off anything
you<00:03:07.750> can<00:03:07.840> actually<00:03:07.960> see<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.590> salt

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
you can actually see that the salt

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:22.320 
you can actually see that the salt
brings<00:03:09.130> falling<00:03:09.640> down<00:03:13.200> Sam<00:03:14.200> home<00:03:15.540> okay

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.059 

production<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.260> still<00:03:23.470> pretty<00:03:23.620> steady

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.160 

I<00:03:26.159> mean<00:03:26.819> it<00:03:27.060> may<00:03:27.209> not<00:03:27.359> be<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.569> strong<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.079> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
I mean it may not be that strong on the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.830 
I mean it may not be that strong on the
camera<00:03:28.530> lens<00:03:28.650> but<00:03:29.010> it's<00:03:31.129> really<00:03:32.129> pumping<00:03:32.639> out

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
camera lens but it's really pumping out

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:45.240 
camera lens but it's really pumping out
and

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:04:01.620 

a<00:03:57.360> little<00:03:58.360> tap<00:03:59.140> water<00:04:00.150> see<00:04:01.150> what<00:04:01.270> happens<00:04:01.540> in

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
a little tap water see what happens in

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:13.740 
a little tap water see what happens in
tap<00:04:02.080> water<00:04:02.110> to<00:04:02.530> this<00:04:02.590> process<00:04:12.360> have<00:04:13.360> a<00:04:13.480> theory

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
tap water to this process have a theory

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.370 
tap water to this process have a theory
once<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.560> get<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.800> process<00:04:15.250> going<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:17.230> can

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
once you get the process going you can

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.810 
once you get the process going you can
add<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:17.530> little<00:04:17.650> tap<00:04:17.890> water

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.750 

it's<00:04:22.480> still<00:04:22.720> pumping

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.310 

my<00:04:26.330> me<00:04:26.390> humping<00:04:27.230> yes<00:04:27.740> let's<00:04:28.070> do<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.190> again

my me humping yes let's do that again

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:43.600 
my me humping yes let's do that again
how<00:04:30.320> much<00:04:30.620> time<00:04:30.830> here<00:04:31.070> left

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.390 

and<00:04:44.599> we<00:04:44.780> are<00:04:44.930> still<00:04:45.110> going<00:04:45.590> in<00:04:45.949> fact<00:04:46.189> we're

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
and we are still going in fact we're

and we are still going in fact we're
going<00:04:46.639> low<00:04:46.759> stronger<00:04:47.210> than<00:04:47.300> before

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.450
