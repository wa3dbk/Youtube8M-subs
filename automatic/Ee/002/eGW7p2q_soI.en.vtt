00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.119 

so<00:00:00.450> I<00:00:00.750> think<00:00:00.960> anytime<00:00:01.290> you<00:00:01.469> go<00:00:01.709> on<00:00:01.829> the<00:00:01.949> road

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
so I think anytime you go on the road

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.980 
so I think anytime you go on the road
you<00:00:02.340> come<00:00:02.520> into<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.790> scene<00:00:03.510> like<00:00:03.540> sold-out

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
you come into a scene like sold-out

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.749 
you come into a scene like sold-out
environment<00:00:04.710> like<00:00:04.799> this<00:00:05.009> very<00:00:05.250> hard<00:00:05.490> place<00:00:05.730> to

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
environment like this very hard place to

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.970 
environment like this very hard place to
play<00:00:06.089> obviously<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.779> CX<00:00:07.080> had<00:00:07.259> success<00:00:07.710> over

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
play obviously the CX had success over

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.490 
play obviously the CX had success over
here<00:00:08.540> what<00:00:09.540> shouldn't<00:00:09.750> been<00:00:09.900> undefeated<00:00:10.139> here

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
here what shouldn't been undefeated here

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.690 
here what shouldn't been undefeated here
I<00:00:10.559> think<00:00:10.800> they've<00:00:10.920> won<00:00:11.070> eight<00:00:11.099> or<00:00:11.370> nine<00:00:11.519> in

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
I think they've won eight or nine in

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.339 
I think they've won eight or nine in
general<00:00:12.090> at<00:00:12.179> home<00:00:12.360> because<00:00:12.900> they<00:00:13.049> have<00:00:13.139> great

good first half obviously and the story
of<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> day<00:00:20.880> would<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> defense<00:00:21.750> number

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
of the day would be the defense number

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.050 
of the day would be the defense number
one<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.680> then<00:00:22.949> special<00:00:23.400> teams<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.880> then<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
one and then special teams and then the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
run game and those are the three things

if you're going to win on the road that

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.089 
if you're going to win on the road that
you<00:00:26.880> usually<00:00:27.000> need<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.359> pack<00:00:27.920> phenomenal<00:00:28.920> job

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
you usually need to pack phenomenal job

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.560 
you usually need to pack phenomenal job
our<00:00:29.340> defense<00:00:29.820> especially<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.330> fourth

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
our defense especially in the fourth

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.330

quarter<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.710> know<00:00:31.800> he<00:00:32.009> would<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.189> been

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
quarter you know he would have been

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.650 
quarter you know he would have been
covering<00:00:32.610> us<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.090> know<00:00:33.180> over<00:00:33.329> three<00:00:33.510> years

that's been our issue for the quarter
defense<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.700> thought<00:00:36.420> our<00:00:36.510> guys<00:00:36.630> really

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the ball ran the ball well at times and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.389

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
there wasn't you have to fight that or

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.010 
there wasn't you have to fight that or
sometimes<00:02:02.680> your<00:02:03.680> I<00:02:03.710> do<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.310> do<00:02:04.759> but<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:05.780> think

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
sometimes your I do and I do but I think

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.780 
sometimes your I do and I do but I think
that's<00:02:06.229> where<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.590> know<00:02:06.680> that's<00:02:06.860> that's

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
that's where you know that's that's

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.609 
that's where you know that's that's
where<00:02:08.030> we<00:02:08.119> are<00:02:08.149> because<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.110> way<00:02:09.200> our<00:02:09.319> defense

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
where we are because the way our defense

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.470 
where we are because the way our defense
is<00:02:09.709> playing<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.310> especially<00:02:10.610> in<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.270> game

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
is playing and especially in that game

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.000 
is playing and especially in that game
that<00:02:11.660> felt<00:02:12.020> our<00:02:12.140> defense<00:02:12.470> was<00:02:12.560> really<00:02:12.860> getting

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
that felt our defense was really getting

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.100 
that felt our defense was really getting
after<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.370> quarterback<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:15.050> know

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
after the quarterback and you know

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.420 
after the quarterback and you know
they're<00:02:15.290> pretty<00:02:15.530> beat<00:02:15.650> up<00:02:15.709> on<00:02:15.920> their<00:02:16.069> offense

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
they're pretty beat up on their offense

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.720 
they're pretty beat up on their offense
so

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
so

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.280 
so
you<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.180> every<00:02:18.390> game<00:02:18.540> forever<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.110> not<00:02:19.200> going

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
you know every game forever is not going

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.690 
you know every game forever is not going
to<00:02:19.349> be<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.769> we're<00:02:20.250> going<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.459> have<00:02:20.550> to

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
to be like that we're going to have to

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.180 
to be like that we're going to have to
ask<00:02:21.000> for<00:02:21.120> more<00:02:21.420> at<00:02:21.989> some<00:02:22.200> point

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
ask for more at some point

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.220 
ask for more at some point
we<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:23.790> played<00:02:24.180> some<00:02:24.450> lower<00:02:24.660> rank<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.050> this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
we have played some lower rank on this

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.950 
we have played some lower rank on this
compared<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.830> what's<00:02:25.980> coming<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.910> every<00:02:27.810> game

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
compared to what's coming so every game

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.600 
compared to what's coming so every game
will<00:02:28.110> be<00:02:28.200> different<00:02:28.410> at<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.100> bottom<00:02:29.430> line<00:02:29.580> is

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
will be different at the bottom line is

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.370 
will be different at the bottom line is
to<00:02:29.850> win<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.060> game<00:02:30.090> what<00:02:30.930> did<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.110> think<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380

flame<00:02:31.590> josh<00:02:31.860> schoch<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.490> thought<00:02:33.240> Josh<00:02:33.480> did

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
flame josh schoch I thought Josh did

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.140 
flame josh schoch I thought Josh did
good<00:02:33.900> really<00:02:34.260> go<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.280> fast<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.820> corner

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
good really go in that fast a corner

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.450 
good really go in that fast a corner
that<00:02:36.270> wasn't

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
that wasn't

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.980 
that wasn't
plan<00:02:37.640> we<00:02:38.060> got<00:02:38.180> fortunate<00:02:38.570> into<00:02:38.720> their<00:02:38.840> by

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
plan we got fortunate into their by

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.930 
plan we got fortunate into their by
coming<00:02:39.530> out<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.430> thought<00:02:40.670> he<00:02:40.760> didn't

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
coming out and I thought he didn't

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.550 
coming out and I thought he didn't
really<00:02:41.120> look<00:02:41.210> what<00:02:42.050> does<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.260> mean<00:02:42.410> right

really look what does that mean right

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.960 
really look what does that mean right
and<00:02:42.770> really<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.280> probably<00:02:43.550> should<00:02:43.730> have<00:02:43.760> point
