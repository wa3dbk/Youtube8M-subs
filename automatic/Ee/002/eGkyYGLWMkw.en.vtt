00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
holding a sword now don't get me wrong

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.289 
holding a sword now don't get me wrong
this<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.319> fairly<00:02:08.769> accurate<00:02:09.039> controller<00:02:09.670> but

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
this is a fairly accurate controller but

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.030 
this is a fairly accurate controller but
the<00:02:10.479> fact<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.840> it's<00:02:11.049> just<00:02:11.170> an<00:02:11.349> infrared<00:02:11.709> and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
the fact that it's just an infrared and

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.400 
the fact that it's just an infrared and
not<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.489> camera<00:02:13.030> setting<00:02:13.420> our<00:02:13.540> moments<00:02:14.079> it's<00:02:14.290> a

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
not a camera setting our moments it's a

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:41.600 
not a camera setting our moments it's a
little<00:02:14.799> less<00:02:15.569> accurate

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.020 

now<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.510> does<00:02:43.370> track<00:02:44.370> your<00:02:44.400> moving<00:02:44.760> but<00:02:44.940> it's

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
now it does track your moving but it's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:59.750 
now it does track your moving but it's
not<00:02:45.150> clear<00:02:45.480> one<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:58.490> with<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.640> wii

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
not clear one to one and with the wii

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.030 
not clear one to one and with the wii
motionplus<00:03:00.180> there<00:03:00.630> it's<00:03:00.840> really<00:03:01.350> awkward<00:03:01.620> to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
motionplus there it's really awkward to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.350 
motionplus there it's really awkward to
hold<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.310> because<00:03:02.460> it's<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.670> little<00:03:03.000> bit<00:03:03.090> wobbly

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
hold it because it's a little bit wobbly

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.840 
hold it because it's a little bit wobbly
so<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.380> feels<00:03:04.590> cheap<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.220> looks<00:03:05.400> like<00:03:05.520> building

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
so it feels cheap it looks like building

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.330 
so it feels cheap it looks like building
is<00:03:05.940> going<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.120> break<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.570> it's<00:03:07.340> extremely

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
is going to break and it's extremely

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.100 
is going to break and it's extremely
easy<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.760> knock<00:03:09.390> someone<00:03:09.720> off<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.740> edge<00:03:12.110> it's

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
easy to knock someone off the edge it's

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.440 
easy to knock someone off the edge it's
just<00:03:13.590> really<00:03:13.920> not<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.340> fun<00:03:16.850> at<00:03:17.850> table<00:03:18.240> tennis

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450

um as you can see people in the

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.340 
um as you can see people in the
background<00:05:22.740> become<00:05:23.250> legs<00:05:23.840> but<00:05:24.840> this<00:05:24.960> isn't<00:05:25.200> a

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
background become legs but this isn't a

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.650 
background become legs but this isn't a
test<00:05:26.039> on<00:05:26.160> graphs<00:05:26.460> of<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:26.820> test<00:05:27.030> on<00:05:27.180> quality

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
test on graphs of the test on quality

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.680

and<00:05:27.780> as<00:05:28.229> you<00:05:28.380> can<00:05:28.530> see<00:05:28.610> it's<00:05:29.610> just<00:05:29.760> it<00:05:30.270> takes

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
and as you can see it's just it takes

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.260 
and as you can see it's just it takes
away<00:05:30.990> some<00:05:31.050> of<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.470> realism<00:05:31.950> and<00:05:32.250> it's<00:05:33.030> just

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
away some of the realism and it's just

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.170 
away some of the realism and it's just
not<00:05:33.510> that<00:05:33.950> exciting<00:05:34.950> to<00:05:34.979> play<00:05:35.220> as<00:05:35.550> on<00:05:35.850> the<00:05:35.940> move

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
not that exciting to play as on the move

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.090 
not that exciting to play as on the move
you<00:05:36.450> have<00:05:36.570> a<00:05:36.630> true<00:05:37.020> one<00:05:37.229> to<00:05:37.320> one<00:05:37.500> I<00:05:37.770> actually

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
you have a true one to one I actually

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.909 
you have a true one to one I actually
feels<00:05:38.460> like<00:05:38.580> you're<00:05:38.669> planning<00:05:38.970> a<00:05:39.120> pink<00:05:39.419> punk

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
feels like you're planning a pink punk

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.590 
feels like you're planning a pink punk
but<00:05:40.919> don't<00:05:41.100> get<00:05:41.190> me<00:05:41.250> wrong<00:05:41.490> it's<00:05:42.270> still<00:05:42.419> a

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
but don't get me wrong it's still a

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.040 
but don't get me wrong it's still a
cheap<00:05:42.870> alternative<00:05:42.990> and<00:05:43.710> it's<00:05:43.800> still<00:05:43.979> pretty

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
cheap alternative and it's still pretty

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.330 
cheap alternative and it's still pretty
so<00:05:46.050> as<00:05:46.230> you<00:05:46.350> can<00:05:46.470> see<00:05:46.680> it's<00:05:46.860> really<00:05:47.190> no

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
so as you can see it's really no

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.000 
so as you can see it's really no
comparison<00:05:47.370> between<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.360> move<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.530> you

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
comparison between the move and the you

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.040 
comparison between the move and the you
know<00:05:50.100> the<00:05:50.310> wii<00:05:50.430> remote<00:05:50.730> the<00:05:51.210> move<00:05:51.419> is<00:05:51.570> clearly

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
know the wii remote the move is clearly

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.810 
know the wii remote the move is clearly
the<00:05:52.440> winner<00:05:52.620> not<00:05:52.949> much<00:05:53.130> as<00:05:53.370> saying<00:05:53.669> this

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820
