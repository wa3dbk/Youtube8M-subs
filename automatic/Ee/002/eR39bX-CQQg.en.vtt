across<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:50.370> top<00:00:50.579> side<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.180> feel<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
across and the top side you can feel a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.439 
across and the top side you can feel a
lip<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:53.969> we're<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> do

lip there and so what we're going to do
is<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:55.320> use<00:00:55.530> water<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> get<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.940> stick<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
is we use water to get this to stick to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.590 
is we use water to get this to stick to
our<00:00:57.690> screen<00:00:58.760> I'm<00:00:59.760> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> take<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.390> over

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
our screen I'm going to take this over

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.580 
our screen I'm going to take this over
the<00:01:00.840> sink<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:01.350> mister

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.640 

and<00:01:10.450> this<00:01:10.600> parts<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.990> little<00:01:11.110> tricky<00:01:11.470> because

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
and this parts a little tricky because

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.010 
and this parts a little tricky because
you<00:01:11.890> want<00:01:12.100> enough<00:01:12.940> water<00:01:13.210> but<00:01:13.450> not<00:01:13.660> too<00:01:13.840> much

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
water and so then we're going to take

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.600 
water and so then we're going to take
and<00:01:16.960> just<00:01:17.080> kind<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.380> shake<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.830> out<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.430> get

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
and just kind of shake that out and get

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.260 
and just kind of shake that out and get
the<00:01:21.790> excess<00:01:22.150> water<00:01:22.420> off<00:01:22.750> of<00:01:22.780> there

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.950 
onto there and this part takes a little
bit<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.320> practice<00:02:08.470> because<00:02:08.950> we've<00:02:09.960> enough

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
bit of practice because we've enough

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.190 
bit of practice because we've enough
ways<00:02:11.230> it's<00:02:11.650> not<00:02:11.710> too<00:02:12.070> much<00:02:12.220> water<00:02:16.050> but<00:02:17.050> you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
ways it's not too much water but you

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.880 
ways it's not too much water but you
want<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.440> make<00:02:17.620> sure<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:18.160> get<00:02:18.340> all<00:02:18.520> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
want to make sure that you get all the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:28.290 
want to make sure that you get all the
spots<00:02:20.890> stick<00:02:21.820> into<00:02:22.000> your<00:02:22.270> screen<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:28.000> because

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
spots stick into your screen and because

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.880 
spots stick into your screen and because
this<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.510> like<00:02:28.810> thinking<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.500> got<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.680> real

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
this is like thinking of you got a real

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.650 
this is like thinking of you got a real
safe<00:02:30.130> trip<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:35.610> ok<00:02:36.610> what<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.180> looking<00:02:37.480> pretty

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
safe trip to ok what that looking pretty

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.140 
safe trip to ok what that looking pretty
good<00:02:37.840> there<00:02:41.190> now<00:02:42.190> I'm<00:02:42.400> just<00:02:42.519> gonna<00:02:42.730> pull<00:02:43.000> that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
good there now I'm just gonna pull that

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.310 
good there now I'm just gonna pull that
up<00:02:43.209> make<00:02:43.900> sure<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.260> still<00:02:44.470> looks<00:02:44.709> good<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:50.170> if

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
up make sure it still looks good and if

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.199 
up make sure it still looks good and if
you<00:02:50.470> get<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.680> couple<00:02:51.040> tiny<00:02:51.310> little<00:02:51.550> bad<00:02:51.820> spots

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
you get a couple tiny little bad spots

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:02.630 
you get a couple tiny little bad spots
that's<00:02:52.450> ok<00:02:52.750> we<00:02:52.959> can<00:02:52.989> fix<00:02:53.320> those<00:02:53.560> later

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.130 

and<00:03:03.090> then<00:03:03.270> we're<00:03:03.390> going<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.570> go<00:03:03.690> ahead<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.020> put

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
and then we're going to go ahead and put

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:16.000 
and then we're going to go ahead and put
it<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.350> our<00:03:04.500> YouTube<00:03:04.860> machine<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.360> driver

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.870 

and<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.100> like<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.460> put<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.360> the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
and I like to put it in so the the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.610 
and I like to put it in so the the
backside<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.360> down<00:03:21.600> so<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.110> gravity

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
backside of that is down so that gravity

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.380 
backside of that is down so that gravity
is<00:03:22.650> pushing<00:03:22.950> on<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.400> screen<00:03:23.700> there<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.240> help

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
is pushing on the screen there to help

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.540 
is pushing on the screen there to help
that<00:03:24.510> make<00:03:25.230> sure<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.530> sticks<00:03:25.770> I'll<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:26.340> close

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
that make sure it sticks I'll just close

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.949 
that make sure it sticks I'll just close
that<00:03:26.610> up<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.930> turn<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.860> fan<00:03:29.070> on<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.959> that's

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
that up and turn the fan on and that's

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.140 
that up and turn the fan on and that's
gonna<00:03:31.170> take<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:32.130> know<00:03:32.220> could<00:03:32.700> be<00:03:32.850> anywhere

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
gonna take you know could be anywhere

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.880 
gonna take you know could be anywhere
from<00:03:33.209> fifteen<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.840> thirty<00:03:33.990> minutes<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.590> drive

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
from fifteen to thirty minutes to drive

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.270 
from fifteen to thirty minutes to drive
just<00:03:35.070> depending<00:03:35.520> on<00:03:35.670> how<00:03:35.820> things<00:03:36.030> go
