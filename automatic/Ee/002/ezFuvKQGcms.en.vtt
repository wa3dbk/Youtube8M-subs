00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:07.339
 at a special event in the context of 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.690
 Mobile World Congress has samsung that 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:10.690
 galaxy s 5 presented 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.140
 in advance, there were already numerous 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.340
 speculation about the material of the housing 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.080
 Eventually, the backside is again 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.030
 made of plastic even if this itself 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.550
 this time feels high quality than that 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.830
 smooth plastic in the processes during 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.330
 first touch my feeling on as 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.080
 you would go over the dashboard 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.080
 car delete 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.530
 samsung puts on the galaxy s 5 on one 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.500
 five inch big super amoled screen 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.060
 which dissolves in full-hd compared to the s4 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.460
 So the display is the same 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.840
 grown up to resolution 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.119
 new is that not only the 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.820
 brightness but also the contrast 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.860
 ambient light also adapts itself 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.660
 the brightness of the display on two 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.020
 screw down the channels per square meter 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.670
 a maximum of 500 are in it 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.220
 the processor is a quad core chip 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.390
 for use with 2.5 gigahertz clocks 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.619
 and 2 GB of RAM 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.330
 To fall back on 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.770
 The internal memory has changed in the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.229
 compared to the previous model nothing 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.330
 edited still there is the s5 in 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.330
 a variant with 16 and 32 gb 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.729
 on the back is a 16 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.770
 megapixel camera compared to the s 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.380
 4 a bigger sensor and improved 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.329
 lens technology has gotten as well 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.520
 autofocus has become faster 1 03 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.520
 seconds, the picture is in focus 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.750
 under the camera is not only 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:16.420
 a led completely at night but also 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.980
 a heart rate monitor by the dranhalten the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.599
 Fingers will be the pulse in a few 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.840
 measured in seconds and in the app 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.840
 appropriate 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.600
 Another news is the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.580
 fingerprint scanner in home button 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.380
 about that the device can be unlocked 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.420
 folder with pictures and other files 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.260
 inaccessible to others and per 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.260
 pay by paypal 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.260
 the most meaningful innovation on the galaxy 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.000
 s 5 is the protection against water 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.510
 half-hour bath in one meter deep 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.030
 water does not bother the device 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.670
 galaxy s 5 will be available from april 11th for 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.580
