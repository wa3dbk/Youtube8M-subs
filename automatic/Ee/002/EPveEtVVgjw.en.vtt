00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.410 
kills so there's only 6 kills left in
the<00:01:39.079> entire<00:01:39.140> game<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:39.859> I<00:01:40.100> was<00:01:40.280> at<00:01:40.399> 25<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.270> oh<00:01:41.390> I

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
the entire game and I was at 25 and oh I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.539 
the entire game and I was at 25 and oh I
had<00:01:41.570> 25<00:01:41.960> kills<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:42.469> no<00:01:42.649> deaths<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.189> I<00:01:43.250> figured

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
had 25 kills and no deaths so I figured

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.620 
had 25 kills and no deaths so I figured
there's<00:01:43.700> pretty<00:01:43.850> much<00:01:43.909> no<00:01:44.149> way<00:01:44.299> I'm<00:01:44.390> gonna<00:01:44.509> get

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
there's pretty much no way I'm gonna get

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.510 
there's pretty much no way I'm gonna get
this<00:01:44.750> nuclear<00:01:45.289> so<00:01:45.439> I<00:01:45.469> just<00:01:45.920> decided<00:01:46.189> to<00:01:46.280> rush

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
this nuclear so I just decided to rush

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.310 
this nuclear so I just decided to rush
like<00:01:46.729> crazy<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.359> I<00:01:47.539> actually<00:01:47.719> end<00:01:48.049> up<00:01:48.140> getting

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
like crazy and I actually end up getting

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.050 
like crazy and I actually end up getting
a<00:01:48.500> quad<00:01:48.799> feed<00:01:49.039> and<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.520> stopped<00:01:49.850> and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
a quad feed and that I stopped and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.490 
a quad feed and that I stopped and
focused<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.689> was<00:01:50.810> like<00:01:50.899> dude<00:01:51.079> I<00:01:51.289> could

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
focused and I was like dude I could

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.200 
focused and I was like dude I could
totally<00:01:51.710> still<00:01:52.070> get<00:01:52.250> this<00:01:52.369> nuclear<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:53.180> I

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
totally still get this nuclear and so I

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.399 
totally still get this nuclear and so I
kept<00:01:53.450> on<00:01:53.509> rushing<00:01:53.840> into<00:01:53.990> their<00:01:54.200> spawn

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
kept on rushing into their spawn

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.469 
kept on rushing into their spawn
actually<00:01:54.770> killing<00:01:55.009> one<00:01:55.340> more<00:01:55.579> guy<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.299> what

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
actually killing one more guy and what

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.029 
actually killing one more guy and what
ended<00:01:56.689> up<00:01:56.810> happening<00:01:56.869> is<00:01:57.350> there's<00:01:57.530> one<00:01:57.770> kill

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
ended up happening is there's one kill

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.590 
ended up happening is there's one kill
left<00:01:58.280> in<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.429> entire<00:01:58.520> game<00:01:59.149> for<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.390> whole

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
left in the entire game for the whole

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.810 
left in the entire game for the whole
team<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.289> I<00:02:00.439> asked<00:02:00.710> my<00:02:00.829> team<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.130> uh<00:02:01.340> maybe

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
team and I asked my team to uh maybe

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.160 
team and I asked my team to uh maybe
just<00:02:01.969> hold<00:02:02.119> off<00:02:02.329> on<00:02:02.390> kill<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:02.929> could<00:02:03.079> get

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
just hold off on kill so I could get

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.840 
just hold off on kill so I could get
this<00:02:03.259> last<00:02:03.469> kill<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.859> get<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.009> nuclear<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.549> I

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
this last kill and get the nuclear and I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.090 
this last kill and get the nuclear and I
had<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.060> guy<00:02:05.299> literally<00:02:05.899> in<00:02:06.079> my<00:02:06.409> sight<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.950> was

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
had a guy literally in my sight I was

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.710 
had a guy literally in my sight I was
about<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.579> fire<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.210> then<00:02:08.420> one<00:02:08.600> of<00:02:08.690> my

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
about to fire and then one of my

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.900 
about to fire and then one of my
teammates<00:02:09.080> kill<00:02:09.380> somebody<00:02:09.619> right<00:02:10.039> before<00:02:10.520> and

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
teammates kill somebody right before and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.580 
teammates kill somebody right before and
it<00:02:11.000> turns<00:02:11.210> out<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.510> was<00:02:11.600> actually<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:12.020> viewer<00:02:12.380> in

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
it turns out it was actually a viewer in

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.500 
it turns out it was actually a viewer in
my<00:02:12.770> game<00:02:13.040> so<00:02:13.370> this<00:02:13.550> once<00:02:13.790> again<00:02:13.910> was<00:02:14.240> just<00:02:14.270> like

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
my game so this once again was just like

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.380 
my game so this once again was just like
so<00:02:14.920> unlucky<00:02:15.920> but<00:02:16.340> thankfully<00:02:16.730> even<00:02:17.060> later<00:02:17.270> in

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
so unlucky but thankfully even later in

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.420 
so unlucky but thankfully even later in
the<00:02:17.540> day<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.720> did<00:02:18.230> end<00:02:18.410> up<00:02:18.530> getting<00:02:18.710> it<00:02:18.950> finally

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
the day I did end up getting it finally

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.860 
the day I did end up getting it finally
so<00:02:19.760> since<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.030> know<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.239> lot<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.599> you<00:02:20.690> guys<00:02:20.780> are

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
so since I know a lot of you guys are

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.330 
so since I know a lot of you guys are
going<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.110> be<00:02:21.200> curious<00:02:21.470> as<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.739> what<00:02:21.920> I'm<00:02:22.010> using

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
going to be curious as to what I'm using

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.830 
going to be curious as to what I'm using
I'm<00:02:22.760> going<00:02:22.909> to<00:02:22.970> put<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.180> class<00:02:23.360> right<00:02:23.629> on<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
I'm going to put the class right on the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.730 
I'm going to put the class right on the
screen<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.500> for

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
screen so for

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.470 
screen so for
first<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.890> all<00:02:24.980> obviously<00:02:25.190> I'm<00:02:25.550> using<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.970> xpr

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
first of all obviously I'm using the xpr

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.120 
first of all obviously I'm using the xpr
and<00:02:26.600> I'm<00:02:26.660> using<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:26.990> with<00:02:27.140> ballistic<00:02:27.620> CPU<00:02:27.770> and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
and I'm using it with ballistic CPU and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.890 
and I'm using it with ballistic CPU and
fast<00:02:28.400> mag<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.120> course<00:02:29.270> I'm<00:02:29.510> using<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
fast mag so of course I'm using the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.690 
fast mag so of course I'm using the
ballistic<00:02:30.260> CPU<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.800> fast<00:02:31.040> mag<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.400> use<00:02:31.550> these

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
ballistic CPU and fast mag I use these

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.460 
ballistic CPU and fast mag I use these
on<00:02:31.820> pretty<00:02:32.030> much<00:02:32.150> all<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.570> my<00:02:32.690> sniper<00:02:32.960> classes

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
on pretty much all of my sniper classes

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.620 
on pretty much all of my sniper classes
no<00:02:33.770> need<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.070> really<00:02:34.280> use<00:02:34.520> extended<00:02:35.270> mags<00:02:35.480> on

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
no need to really use extended mags on

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.970 
no need to really use extended mags on
the<00:02:35.660> XP<00:02:35.990> are<00:02:36.110> considering<00:02:36.560> it's<00:02:36.680> already<00:02:36.860> got

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
the XP are considering it's already got

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.040 
the XP are considering it's already got
like<00:02:37.070> tons<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.460> bullets<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.880> one<00:02:38.330> mag<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.900> of

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
like tons of bullets in one mag and of

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.390 
like tons of bullets in one mag and of
course<00:02:39.260> I'm<00:02:39.380> just<00:02:39.530> using<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.920> ballistic<00:02:40.280> CPU

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
course I'm just using the ballistic CPU

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.520 
course I'm just using the ballistic CPU
to<00:02:40.820> steady<00:02:41.240> my<00:02:41.420> aim<00:02:41.660> but<00:02:42.020> then<00:02:42.140> moving<00:02:42.380> on<00:02:42.500> to

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
to steady my aim but then moving on to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.170 
to steady my aim but then moving on to
perks<00:02:42.860> I'm<00:02:43.040> using<00:02:43.220> lightweight<00:02:43.580> toughness

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
perks I'm using lightweight toughness

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.120 
perks I'm using lightweight toughness
scavengers<00:02:44.660> dexterity<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.380> tactical<00:02:45.440> mask

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
scavengers dexterity and tactical mask

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.980 
scavengers dexterity and tactical mask
so<00:02:46.490> for<00:02:46.640> my<00:02:46.730> first<00:02:46.940> perk<00:02:47.330> with<00:02:47.870> these

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
so for my first perk with these

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.990 
so for my first perk with these
challenges<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.560> usually<00:02:49.070> use<00:02:49.430> hardline

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
challenges I usually use hardline

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.460 
challenges I usually use hardline
instead<00:02:50.270> of<00:02:50.360> light<00:02:50.570> weight<00:02:50.780> but<00:02:51.110> using<00:02:51.410> a

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
instead of light weight but using a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.900 
instead of light weight but using a
sniper<00:02:51.710> I<00:02:51.860> knew<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.100> was<00:02:52.250> gonna<00:02:52.340> be<00:02:52.430> jumping<00:02:52.820> off

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
sniper I knew I was gonna be jumping off

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.490 
sniper I knew I was gonna be jumping off
the<00:02:53.000> crap<00:02:53.240> and<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.690> flying<00:02:54.080> everywhere

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
the crap and just flying everywhere

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.050 
the crap and just flying everywhere
pretty<00:02:54.740> much<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.190> do<00:02:55.280> tend<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.640> play<00:02:55.850> really

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
pretty much I do tend to play really

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.690 
pretty much I do tend to play really
weird<00:02:56.390> with<00:02:56.570> snipers<00:02:57.020> um<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.590> kind<00:02:58.070> of<00:02:58.190> jump<00:02:58.550> off

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
weird with snipers um I kind of jump off

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.220 
weird with snipers um I kind of jump off
a<00:02:58.730> stuff<00:02:59.030> all<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.420> time<00:02:59.450> trying<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.900> go<00:03:00.020> for

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
a stuff all the time trying to go for

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.170 
a stuff all the time trying to go for
like<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.440> flashy<00:03:00.920> shots<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.550> all<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.850> so<00:03:02.150> I

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
like a flashy shots and all that so I

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.280 
like a flashy shots and all that so I
knew<00:03:02.330> if<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.480> was<00:03:02.570> going<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.780> be<00:03:02.840> doing<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.260> I

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
knew if I was going to be doing that I

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.480 
knew if I was going to be doing that I
should<00:03:03.470> probably<00:03:03.560> put<00:03:03.800> on<00:03:03.860> light<00:03:04.100> weight<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:04.460> I

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
should probably put on light weight so I

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.800 
should probably put on light weight so I
can<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:05.060> course<00:03:05.330> not

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
can of course not

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.990 
can of course not
die<00:03:05.990> when<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.320> fall<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.860> then<00:03:07.100> for<00:03:07.220> my<00:03:07.310> /<00:03:07.370> -<00:03:07.760> I'm

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
die when I fall and then for my / - I'm

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.940 
die when I fall and then for my / - I'm
using<00:03:08.210> a<00:03:08.480> toughness<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:09.170> scavenger<00:03:09.710> which<00:03:09.830> is

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
using a toughness and scavenger which is

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.010 
using a toughness and scavenger which is
pretty<00:03:10.160> self-explanatory<00:03:10.900> toughness<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:11.990> I

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
pretty self-explanatory toughness so I

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.180 
pretty self-explanatory toughness so I
don't<00:03:12.230> flinch<00:03:12.440> like<00:03:12.650> crazy<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.070> then

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
don't flinch like crazy and then

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.370 
don't flinch like crazy and then
scavenger<00:03:13.910> because<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.210> need<00:03:14.420> scavenger<00:03:15.050> if

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
scavenger because I need scavenger if

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.960 
scavenger because I need scavenger if
I'm<00:03:15.590> going<00:03:15.800> for<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.010> Newt<00:03:16.250> dealer<00:03:16.520> and<00:03:16.700> then

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
I'm going for this Newt dealer and then

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.670 
I'm going for this Newt dealer and then
for<00:03:17.120> perk<00:03:17.300> three<00:03:17.570> I'm<00:03:17.720> using<00:03:17.900> dexterity<00:03:18.560> and

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
for perk three I'm using dexterity and

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.680 
for perk three I'm using dexterity and
tactical<00:03:18.740> mask<00:03:19.280> no<00:03:19.670> dexterity<00:03:20.000> actually<00:03:20.510> came

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
tactical mask no dexterity actually came

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.960 
tactical mask no dexterity actually came
pretty<00:03:21.020> a<00:03:21.110> pretty<00:03:21.470> huge<00:03:21.980> in<00:03:22.160> this<00:03:22.280> game<00:03:22.340> since

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
pretty a pretty huge in this game since

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.700 
pretty a pretty huge in this game since
I<00:03:23.090> was<00:03:23.210> playing<00:03:23.450> mid<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.810> entire<00:03:24.140> game<00:03:24.470> it

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
I was playing mid the entire game it

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.770 
I was playing mid the entire game it
helps<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:25.550> much<00:03:25.790> climbing<00:03:26.300> in<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.510> out<00:03:26.600> of

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
helps so much climbing in and out of

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.360 
helps so much climbing in and out of
stuff<00:03:26.960> really<00:03:27.290> really<00:03:27.620> quickly<00:03:27.830> there<00:03:28.280> was

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
stuff really really quickly there was

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.560 
stuff really really quickly there was
actually<00:03:28.610> a<00:03:28.640> lot<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.790> spots<00:03:29.060> in<00:03:29.240> this<00:03:29.390> game

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
actually a lot of spots in this game

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.360 
actually a lot of spots in this game
where<00:03:29.780> if<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:30.230> wasn't<00:03:30.560> using<00:03:30.680> dexterity<00:03:31.340> I

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
where if I wasn't using dexterity I

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.620 
where if I wasn't using dexterity I
probably<00:03:31.550> have<00:03:31.790> gotten<00:03:31.970> shot<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.420> back

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
probably have gotten shot in the back

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.300 
probably have gotten shot in the back
climbing<00:03:33.110> something<00:03:33.290> but<00:03:33.830> of<00:03:33.920> course<00:03:34.130> with

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
climbing something but of course with

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.190 
climbing something but of course with
the<00:03:34.490> dexterity<00:03:34.910> you<00:03:35.180> mantle<00:03:35.630> stuff<00:03:35.840> super

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
the dexterity you mantle stuff super

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.690 
the dexterity you mantle stuff super
quickly<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.770> it's<00:03:36.860> really<00:03:37.190> really<00:03:37.550> helpful

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
quickly and it's really really helpful

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.370 
quickly and it's really really helpful
and<00:03:38.060> then<00:03:38.270> of<00:03:38.360> course<00:03:38.390> I'm<00:03:38.660> using<00:03:38.810> tactical

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
and then of course I'm using tactical

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.870 
and then of course I'm using tactical
mass<00:03:39.560> which<00:03:39.800> I<00:03:39.830> use<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.400> on<00:03:40.490> like<00:03:40.610> pretty

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
mass which I use that on like pretty

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.460 
mass which I use that on like pretty
much<00:03:40.940> every<00:03:41.420> single<00:03:41.600> class<00:03:41.930> ever

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
much every single class ever

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.230 
much every single class ever
I<00:03:42.500> hate<00:03:43.010> being<00:03:43.370> stunned<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:43.850> not<00:03:43.970> being<00:03:44.120> able

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
I hate being stunned and not being able

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.790 
I hate being stunned and not being able
to<00:03:44.360> move<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.720> getting<00:03:44.840> killed<00:03:45.110> by<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.410> by

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
to move and getting killed by that by

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.590 
to move and getting killed by that by
anyways<00:03:46.070> for<00:03:46.220> this<00:03:46.340> nuclear<00:03:46.550> it<00:03:47.180> was<00:03:47.270> really

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
anyways for this nuclear it was really

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.420 
anyways for this nuclear it was really
really<00:03:47.780> simple<00:03:48.080> I<00:03:48.260> still<00:03:48.470> like<00:03:48.590> what<00:03:48.800> I<00:03:48.830> did<00:03:49.010> to

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
really simple I still like what I did to

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.400 
really simple I still like what I did to
achieve<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.910> literally<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.540> entire<00:03:50.690> game<00:03:51.230> up

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
achieve it literally the entire game up

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.040 
achieve it literally the entire game up
to<00:03:51.560> until<00:03:51.890> like<00:03:52.160> I<00:03:52.370> think<00:03:52.460> 50<00:03:52.940> overall<00:03:53.420> kills<00:03:53.750> I

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
to until like I think 50 overall kills I

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.810 
to until like I think 50 overall kills I
played<00:03:54.410> in<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.650> middle<00:03:54.920> building<00:03:55.130> now<00:03:55.640> this

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
played in the middle building now this

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.460 
played in the middle building now this
area<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.390> played<00:03:56.690> in<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.050> middle<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.350> the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
area that I played in the middle of the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.740 
area that I played in the middle of the
map<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:58.160> whole<00:03:58.460> game<00:03:58.820> to<00:03:59.000> get<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.270> nuclear

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
map this whole game to get this nuclear

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.240 
map this whole game to get this nuclear
is<00:03:59.840> probably<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.230> best<00:04:00.440> place<00:04:00.710> to<00:04:00.740> go<00:04:01.010> for<00:04:01.190> a

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
is probably the best place to go for a

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.060 
is probably the best place to go for a
sniping<00:04:01.610> nucular<00:04:01.940> except<00:04:02.330> for<00:04:02.510> maybe<00:04:03.290> Church

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
sniping nucular except for maybe Church

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.780 
sniping nucular except for maybe Church
on<00:04:04.310> Yemen

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
on Yemen

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.340 
on Yemen
other<00:04:05.060> than<00:04:05.270> Church<00:04:05.540> on<00:04:05.690> Yemen<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.230> is

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
other than Church on Yemen it is

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.590 
other than Church on Yemen it is
definitely<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:06.950> best<00:04:07.130> it<00:04:07.430> is<00:04:07.640> so<00:04:07.940> easy<00:04:08.420> to

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
definitely the best it is so easy to

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.300 
definitely the best it is so easy to
control<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.410> just<00:04:09.560> pick<00:04:09.740> off<00:04:09.890> people<00:04:10.190> from

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
control it and just pick off people from

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.160 
control it and just pick off people from
like<00:04:10.400> a<00:04:10.490> mile<00:04:10.730> away<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.390> can<00:04:11.510> peek<00:04:11.690> from<00:04:11.870> so

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
like a mile away you can peek from so

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.540 
like a mile away you can peek from so
many<00:04:12.440> different<00:04:12.710> spots<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.400> there's

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
many different spots and there's

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.430 
many different spots and there's
actually<00:04:13.850> only<00:04:13.940> like<00:04:14.240> three<00:04:14.810> ways<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.290> get

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
actually only like three ways to get

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.410 
actually only like three ways to get
into<00:04:15.620> there<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.070> for<00:04:16.430> all<00:04:16.640> of<00:04:16.850> them<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.150> have

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
into there and for all of them you have

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.300 
into there and for all of them you have
to<00:04:17.450> mantle<00:04:18.200> or<00:04:18.290> climb<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.590> ladder<00:04:18.799> so<00:04:19.220> you

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
to mantle or climb a ladder so you

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.400 
to mantle or climb a ladder so you
always<00:04:19.640> have<00:04:20.060> time<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.420> kill<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.870> person<00:04:21.020> and

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
always have time to kill the person and

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.900 
always have time to kill the person and
then<00:04:21.590> along<00:04:21.799> with<00:04:21.830> that<00:04:22.190> in<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.490> room<00:04:22.700> there's

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
then along with that in the room there's

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.400 
then along with that in the room there's
actually<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.210> huge<00:04:23.540> wall<00:04:23.870> so<00:04:24.050> you<00:04:24.140> could<00:04:24.290> be

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
actually a huge wall so you could be

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.900 
actually a huge wall so you could be
right<00:04:24.680> next<00:04:24.890> to<00:04:25.040> a<00:04:25.130> person<00:04:25.280> but<00:04:25.640> they<00:04:25.730> don't

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
right next to a person but they don't

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.830 
right next to a person but they don't
realize<00:04:26.120> you're<00:04:26.450> there

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
realize you're there

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.300 
realize you're there
so<00:04:26.990> if<00:04:27.110> you<00:04:27.230> have<00:04:27.380> a<00:04:27.410> good<00:04:27.620> headset<00:04:28.040> and<00:04:28.220> they

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
so if you have a good headset and they

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.860 
so if you have a good headset and they
don't<00:04:28.640> you<00:04:28.820> can<00:04:28.970> hear<00:04:29.150> them<00:04:29.300> behind<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:29.750> and

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
don't you can hear them behind you and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.180 
don't you can hear them behind you and
just<00:04:29.930> go<00:04:30.140> up<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:30.410> knife<00:04:30.590> them<00:04:30.830> or<00:04:30.950> shoot<00:04:31.130> them

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
just go up and knife them or shoot them

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.520 
just go up and knife them or shoot them
and<00:04:31.550> then<00:04:31.790> even<00:04:32.090> on<00:04:32.300> top<00:04:32.630> of<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:32.960> if<00:04:33.229> you<00:04:33.350> go

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
and then even on top of that if you go

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.350 
and then even on top of that if you go
out<00:04:33.740> of<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:34.010> middle<00:04:34.220> building<00:04:34.520> there's<00:04:35.180> two

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
out of that middle building there's two

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.150 
out of that middle building there's two
like<00:04:35.510> concrete<00:04:36.050> barriers<00:04:36.500> on<00:04:36.680> either<00:04:36.860> side<00:04:37.130> of

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
like concrete barriers on either side of

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.930 
like concrete barriers on either side of
the<00:04:37.280> map<00:04:37.460> where<00:04:37.640> you

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
the map where you

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.910 
the map where you
like<00:04:38.030> plant<00:04:38.300> flowers<00:04:38.870> or<00:04:39.050> something<00:04:39.410> that<00:04:39.770> are

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
like plant flowers or something that are

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.010 
like plant flowers or something that are
such<00:04:40.220> a<00:04:40.250> good<00:04:40.640> peaking<00:04:41.060> spot<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.540> actually<00:04:41.780> get

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
such a good peaking spot I actually get

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.660 
such a good peaking spot I actually get
so<00:04:42.290> pissed<00:04:42.500> off<00:04:42.710> when<00:04:42.890> somebody<00:04:43.220> uses<00:04:43.370> it

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
so pissed off when somebody uses it

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.890 
so pissed off when somebody uses it
against<00:04:44.000> me<00:04:44.120> because<00:04:44.420> you<00:04:44.540> can<00:04:44.660> pretty<00:04:44.780> much

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
against me because you can pretty much

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.600 
against me because you can pretty much
only<00:04:45.260> see<00:04:45.440> their<00:04:45.590> head<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.250> people<00:04:46.520> who

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
only see their head and the people who

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.950 
only see their head and the people who
are<00:04:46.730> rushing<00:04:46.940> you<00:04:47.180> can<00:04:47.330> only<00:04:47.480> really<00:04:47.660> peek

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
are rushing you can only really peek

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.750 
are rushing you can only really peek
from<00:04:48.140> two<00:04:48.320> or<00:04:48.470> three<00:04:48.650> places<00:04:48.980> and<00:04:49.400> a<00:04:49.550> lot<00:04:49.730> of

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
from two or three places and a lot of

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.670 
from two or three places and a lot of
the<00:04:49.850> time<00:04:50.030> they<00:04:50.150> just<00:04:50.180> bunch<00:04:50.690> up<00:04:50.930> in<00:04:51.110> one<00:04:51.320> area

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
the time they just bunch up in one area

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.960 
the time they just bunch up in one area
so<00:04:51.710> it's<00:04:51.920> so<00:04:52.070> easy<00:04:52.100> to<00:04:52.460> pick<00:04:52.610> off<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:52.880> know

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
so it's so easy to pick off you know

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.700 
so it's so easy to pick off you know
four<00:04:53.180> or<00:04:53.210> five<00:04:53.450> people<00:04:53.840> at<00:04:53.900> a<00:04:53.960> time<00:04:54.140> but<00:04:54.560> as<00:04:54.680> you
