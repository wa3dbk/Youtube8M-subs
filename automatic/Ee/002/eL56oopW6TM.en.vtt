tomorrow so this is Monday midday most
of<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.460> fronts<00:01:14.760> cleared<00:01:15.000> east<00:01:15.150> which<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.420> can

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
of the fronts cleared east which you can

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.270 
of the fronts cleared east which you can
see<00:01:15.689> heavy<00:01:15.869> bursts<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.320> rain<00:01:16.500> associated<00:01:16.799> with

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
see heavy bursts of rain associated with

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.890 
see heavy bursts of rain associated with
them<00:01:17.430> clearing<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> way<00:01:18.180> east<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.720> well<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
them clearing the way east as well I

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.539 
them clearing the way east as well I
think<00:01:19.049> probably<00:01:19.500> around<00:01:19.680> lunchtime<00:01:20.070> clearing

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
think probably around lunchtime clearing

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.740 
think probably around lunchtime clearing
he's<00:01:20.700> staring<00:01:21.060> through<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.299> southeast

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
he's staring through in the southeast

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.510 
he's staring through in the southeast
then<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.380> another<00:01:22.560> reach<00:01:22.799> building<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.340> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
then we get another reach building in so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.010 
then we get another reach building in so
actually<00:01:23.850> behind<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> wings<00:01:24.630> will<00:01:24.780> drop

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
actually behind it the wings will drop

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.870 
actually behind it the wings will drop
rapidly<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.430> should<00:01:26.610> become

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
rapidly and that we should become

then this fellow here we need to watch

then this fellow here we need to watch
for<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.329> think<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:39.750> will

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
for because I think that what will

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.030 
for because I think that what will
happen<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.229> probably<00:01:40.560> New<00:01:40.710> Year's<00:01:40.920> Eve

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
happen is probably New Year's Eve

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.100 
happen is probably New Year's Eve
becomes<00:01:41.430> drier<00:01:41.729> later<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.299> certainly<00:01:42.899> through

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.660 
becomes drier later on certainly through
midnight<00:01:43.350> looks<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.070> probably

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
midnight looks as if it be probably

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.819 
midnight looks as if it be probably
breezy<00:01:45.420> if<00:01:45.570> some<00:01:45.810> showers<00:01:46.079> ramp<00:01:46.350> tickly<00:01:46.770> in

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
breezy if some showers ramp tickly in

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.590 
breezy if some showers ramp tickly in
the<00:01:46.890> West<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.640> most<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> heavier<00:01:48.360> rain

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the West but most of the heavier rain

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
the West but most of the heavier rain
will<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.840> gone<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.740> your<00:01:49.860> New

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
will have gone and then to your New

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.219 
will have gone and then to your New
Year's<00:01:50.369> Day<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.850> start<00:01:51.119> off<00:01:51.270> fairly<00:01:51.630> bright<00:01:51.930> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
Year's Day we start off fairly bright I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.020 
Year's Day we start off fairly bright I
think<00:01:52.710> always<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.070> risk<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.399> some<00:01:53.610> rain<00:01:53.790> across

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
think always a risk of some rain across

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.580 
think always a risk of some rain across
central<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.600> southern<00:01:54.659> Scotland<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.439> then

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
central and southern Scotland but then

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.200 
central and southern Scotland but then
this<00:01:55.799> feature<00:01:56.040> moves<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.820> bit<00:01:57.119> of

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
this feature moves in a bit of

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.060 
this feature moves in a bit of
uncertainty<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.810> exactly<00:01:58.170> where<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.560> goes<00:01:58.590> it

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
uncertainty of exactly where it goes it

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.530 
uncertainty of exactly where it goes it
tracks<00:01:59.340> eastwards<00:01:59.880> and<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.060> think<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.420> this

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
tracks eastwards and I think what this

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.450 
tracks eastwards and I think what this
is<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.560> bring<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.920> period<00:02:02.369> of

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
is going to do is bring a period of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
is going to do is bring a period of
heavy<00:02:02.790> rain<00:02:03.119> through<00:02:03.420> Wales<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.049> much<00:02:04.200> of

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
heavy rain through Wales and much of

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.200 
heavy rain through Wales and much of
southern<00:02:04.770> England<00:02:04.890> during<00:02:05.460> New<00:02:05.670> Year's<00:02:05.909> Day

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
southern England during New Year's Day

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.270 
southern England during New Year's Day
late<00:02:06.899> morning<00:02:07.290> into<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> afternoon<00:02:07.680> some

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
late morning into the afternoon some

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.699 
late morning into the afternoon some
strong<00:02:08.610> winds<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:09.030> well<00:02:09.060> gusts<00:02:09.929> over<00:02:10.170> 60<00:02:10.200> miles

strong winds as well gusts over 60 miles

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.350 
strong winds as well gusts over 60 miles
an<00:02:10.860> hour<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> think<00:02:11.250> there<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> risk<00:02:12.150> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
an hour and I think there is a risk of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.580 
an hour and I think there is a risk of
some<00:02:12.870> localized

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
some localized

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.559

flooding as well associated with that

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.210 
flooding as well associated with that
rain<00:02:15.750> as<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.319> moves<00:02:16.530> through<00:02:16.650> England<00:02:17.099> and

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
rain as it moves through England and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.970

want you to follow is this little area
down<00:03:04.739> here<00:03:05.069> you<00:03:05.400> see<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.760> purple<00:03:06.120> area<00:03:06.690> down

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
down here you see that purple area down

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.110 
down here you see that purple area down
towards<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.160> southwest<00:03:08.640> that's<00:03:08.879> the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
towards the southwest that's the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.300 
towards the southwest that's the
strongest<00:03:09.599> wings<00:03:09.930> now<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.680> notice<00:03:11.040> how<00:03:11.250> that

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
strongest wings now you notice how that

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.280 
strongest wings now you notice how that
little<00:03:11.879> area<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.150> low<00:03:12.209> pressure<00:03:12.299> knows<00:03:12.780> it's

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
little area of low pressure knows it's

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.670 
little area of low pressure knows it's
up<00:03:13.560> through<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.940> Irish<00:03:15.900> Sea<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.470> is

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
up through the Irish Sea this is

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.860 
up through the Irish Sea this is
basically<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.970> rear<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.420> occluded

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
basically on the rear of the occluded

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.870 
basically on the rear of the occluded
front<00:03:19.109> zipping<00:03:19.470> through<00:03:19.500> now<00:03:19.889> look<00:03:20.549> at<00:03:20.730> that

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
front zipping through now look at that

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.599 
front zipping through now look at that
area<00:03:21.450> there<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:22.109> purple<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:22.980> can<00:03:23.130> see<00:03:23.340> there

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
area there of purple you can see there

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.490 
area there of purple you can see there
that's<00:03:24.239> marked<00:03:24.660> on<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.870> southern<00:03:25.230> edge<00:03:25.350> of

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
that's marked on the southern edge of

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.710 
that's marked on the southern edge of
the<00:03:25.590> high<00:03:25.850> on<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.970> southern<00:03:27.209> edge<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.450> low

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
the high on the southern edge of the low

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.190 
the high on the southern edge of the low
sorry

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
sorry

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.509 
sorry
this<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:30.660> think<00:03:31.349> shows<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.099> sign<00:03:32.310> of

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
this is I think shows all the sign of

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.309 
this is I think shows all the sign of
having<00:03:32.700> what<00:03:32.970> we<00:03:33.000> call<00:03:33.090> sting<00:03:33.780> jet<00:03:34.019> now<00:03:34.200> will

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
having what we call sting jet now will

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.920 
having what we call sting jet now will
distinct<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.859> is<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.459> where<00:03:35.730> cold<00:03:36.510> dense<00:03:36.720> air

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
distinct it is is where cold dense air

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.660 
distinct it is is where cold dense air
descends<00:03:37.349> rapidly<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.160> surface<00:03:38.549> that

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
descends rapidly to the surface that

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.420 
descends rapidly to the surface that
gives<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.150> narrow<00:03:39.780> area<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.319> very<00:03:40.980> strong

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
gives you a narrow area of very strong

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.550 
gives you a narrow area of very strong
winds<00:03:41.760> now<00:03:41.970> typically<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.599> think<00:03:42.810> winds<00:03:43.349> are

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
winds now typically I think winds are

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.050 
winds now typically I think winds are
going<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.739> be<00:03:43.829> gusting<00:03:44.190> at<00:03:44.280> 70<00:03:44.669> miles<00:03:44.849> an<00:03:44.970> hour

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
going to be gusting at 70 miles an hour

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.550 
going to be gusting at 70 miles an hour
across<00:03:45.209> Western<00:03:45.840> than<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.049> southern<00:03:46.349> coast

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
across Western than the southern coast

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.319 
across Western than the southern coast
during<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.310> course<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.669> the<00:03:47.790> early<00:03:47.819> hours<00:03:48.150> of

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
during the course of the early hours of

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.150 
during the course of the early hours of
this<00:03:48.419> morning<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.989> into<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.620> early<00:03:49.739> part<00:03:50.040> of

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
this morning and into the early part of

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.860 
this morning and into the early part of
Monday<00:03:50.519> morning<00:03:50.639> some<00:03:51.209> uncertainty<00:03:51.720> on<00:03:51.840> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
Monday morning some uncertainty on the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.020 
Monday morning some uncertainty on the
timings<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.370> think<00:03:53.639> what's<00:03:53.819> going<00:03:53.970> to

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
timings but I think what's going to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.659 
timings but I think what's going to
happen<00:03:54.389> is<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:55.230> this<00:03:55.530> sting<00:03:55.919> jet<00:03:56.190> here

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
happen is that this sting jet here

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.309 
happen is that this sting jet here
during<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.510> course<00:03:57.690> tomorrow<00:03:57.989> morning

southwestern and western coast of Wales
you<00:04:09.630> see<00:04:09.840> here<00:04:10.169> at<00:04:10.349> nine<00:04:10.620> o'clock<00:04:10.799> look<00:04:11.280> in

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.360 
you see here at nine o'clock look in
here<00:04:12.329> so<00:04:12.630> it's<00:04:13.200> going<00:04:13.380> across<00:04:13.590> western<00:04:14.160> coast

be<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.789> narrow<00:04:21.030> band<00:04:21.329> of<00:04:21.479> very<00:04:21.870> strong<00:04:22.380> winds<00:04:22.710> it

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
be a narrow band of very strong winds it

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.920 
be a narrow band of very strong winds it
may<00:04:23.250> be<00:04:23.310> no<00:04:23.610> more<00:04:23.820> than<00:04:24.000> sort<00:04:24.330> of<00:04:24.360> 20<00:04:24.690> miles

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
may be no more than sort of 20 miles

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.790 
may be no more than sort of 20 miles
across<00:04:25.380> wraps<00:04:25.770> even<00:04:26.039> less<00:04:26.190> than<00:04:26.370> that

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
across wraps even less than that

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.629 
across wraps even less than that
but<00:04:27.460> it's<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.699> very<00:04:28.090> strong<00:04:28.710> band<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:30.009> very

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
but it's a very strong band a very

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.999 
but it's a very strong band a very
narrow<00:04:30.879> band<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.389> very<00:04:31.750> strong<00:04:32.229> winds<00:04:32.530> that

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
narrow band of very strong winds that

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.930 
narrow band of very strong winds that
can<00:04:33.250> do<00:04:33.400> damage<00:04:34.199> to<00:04:35.199> trees<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:36.009> some<00:04:36.729> minor

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
can do damage to trees and some minor

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.610 
can do damage to trees and some minor
structural<00:04:37.180> damage<00:04:37.629> to<00:04:37.750> buildings<00:04:38.080> but<00:04:38.470> only

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
structural damage to buildings but only

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.710 
structural damage to buildings but only
in<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.800> very<00:04:38.830> narrow<00:04:39.250> area<00:04:39.789> so<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:40.330> think<00:04:40.569> this

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
in a very narrow area so I think this

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.779 
in a very narrow area so I think this
area<00:04:40.960> is<00:04:41.440> gonna<00:04:41.650> be<00:04:41.740> pulling<00:04:42.129> away<00:04:42.250> northeast

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
area is gonna be pulling away northeast

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.550 
area is gonna be pulling away northeast
was<00:04:42.970> look<00:04:43.150> by<00:04:43.330> midday<00:04:43.599> tomorrow<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.259> low<00:04:44.409> bees

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
was look by midday tomorrow the low bees

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.529 
was look by midday tomorrow the low bees
across<00:04:44.830> northern<00:04:45.190> England<00:04:45.490> our<00:04:45.699> area<00:04:46.479> of

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
across northern England our area of

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.360 
across northern England our area of
strongest<00:04:47.080> wings<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:47.740> I<00:04:47.800> think<00:04:48.009> still<00:04:48.250> the

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
potential for a sting jet to be in there

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.529

again the CFS had a wobble yesterday but
look<00:06:10.900> it's<00:06:11.169> going<00:06:11.379> in<00:06:11.560> for<00:06:11.710> this<00:06:11.770> colder<00:06:12.250> slot

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
look it's going in for this colder slot

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.610 
look it's going in for this colder slot
again<00:06:13.060> from<00:06:13.389> around<00:06:13.629> the<00:06:13.810> 11th<00:06:14.169> onwards<00:06:14.500> this

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
again from around the 11th onwards this

fall-off in temperatures not making it

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.839 
fall-off in temperatures not making it
last<00:06:16.750> very<00:06:16.990> long<00:06:17.169> it<00:06:17.440> warms<00:06:17.800> it<00:06:17.889> up<00:06:18.009> again<00:06:18.340> by

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
last very long it warms it up again by

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:21.360 
last very long it warms it up again by
about<00:06:18.969> the<00:06:19.240> 24th<00:06:20.080> I'm<00:06:20.409> wondering<00:06:21.009> if<00:06:21.069> that's<00:06:21.250> a

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
about the 24th I'm wondering if that's a

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.939 
about the 24th I'm wondering if that's a
bit<00:06:22.120> too<00:06:22.300> soon<00:06:22.539> I<00:06:22.719> wonder<00:06:23.139> if<00:06:23.259> that<00:06:23.289> could<00:06:23.740> be

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
bit too soon I wonder if that could be

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.809 
bit too soon I wonder if that could be
perhaps<00:06:24.129> the<00:06:24.430> 28th<00:06:24.879> or<00:06:25.120> 29th<00:06:25.930> but<00:06:26.650> again<00:06:27.159> CFS

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
perhaps the 28th or 29th but again CFS

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.570 
perhaps the 28th or 29th but again CFS
going<00:06:28.060> for<00:06:28.210> this<00:06:28.300> idea<00:06:28.690> of<00:06:28.779> a<00:06:29.139> chillier<00:06:29.800> middle

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
going for this idea of a chillier middle

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.300 
going for this idea of a chillier middle
part<00:06:30.819> to<00:06:31.210> January<00:06:31.750> and<00:06:32.529> interesting<00:06:33.069> just<00:06:33.219> to

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
part to January and interesting just to

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.070 
part to January and interesting just to
look<00:06:33.490> ahead<00:06:33.639> at<00:06:33.969> the<00:06:34.120> CFS<00:06:34.629> a<00:06:34.659> little<00:06:34.990> bit

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
look ahead at the CFS a little bit

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.719 
look ahead at the CFS a little bit
further<00:06:35.380> as<00:06:35.649> well<00:06:35.860> that<00:06:36.070> would<00:06:36.190> just<00:06:36.370> zoom<00:06:36.550> in

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
further as well that would just zoom in

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.230 
further as well that would just zoom in
a<00:06:36.820> little<00:06:36.940> bit

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
a little bit

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.520 
a little bit
now<00:06:38.570> of<00:06:38.690> course<00:06:38.810> you've<00:06:39.020> got<00:06:39.140> to<00:06:39.230> treat<00:06:39.380> this

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
now of course you've got to treat this

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.170 
now of course you've got to treat this
with<00:06:39.710> an<00:06:39.800> absolute<00:06:40.310> pinch<00:06:40.520> of<00:06:40.670> salt<00:06:40.820> haven't

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
with an absolute pinch of salt haven't

briefest of cold snaps in here early
February<00:06:56.330> then<00:06:56.870> it<00:06:57.020> does<00:06:57.200> it<00:06:57.320> again<00:06:57.530> look<00:06:57.740> in

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.890 
February then it does it again look in

February then it does it again look in
the<00:06:58.010> middle<00:06:58.160> of<00:06:58.570> February<00:06:59.570> and<00:07:00.050> then<00:07:00.410> again

the middle of February and then again

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.040 
the middle of February and then again
interestingly<00:07:01.190> looked<00:07:01.880> in<00:07:02.090> the<00:07:02.570> middle<00:07:02.840> part

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
interestingly looked in the middle part

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.600 
interestingly looked in the middle part
of<00:07:03.290> March<00:07:03.560> but<00:07:03.770> you<00:07:03.890> notice<00:07:04.250> through<00:07:04.430> all<00:07:04.490> that

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
of March but you notice through all that

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.330 
of March but you notice through all that
no<00:07:05.210> real<00:07:05.540> prolong<00:07:06.080> spell<00:07:06.530> of<00:07:06.710> bitterly<00:07:07.100> cold

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
no real prolong spell of bitterly cold

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.160 
no real prolong spell of bitterly cold
weather<00:07:07.550> according<00:07:07.970> to<00:07:08.030> the<00:07:08.120> CFS<00:07:08.480> in<00:07:08.840> fact

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170 
weather according to the CFS in fact

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.290 
weather according to the CFS in fact
temperatures<00:07:09.590> are<00:07:09.890> kind<00:07:10.370> of<00:07:10.490> up<00:07:10.640> and<00:07:10.880> Daniel

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.300 
temperatures are kind of up and Daniel

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.510 
temperatures are kind of up and Daniel
all<00:07:11.450> over<00:07:11.990> the<00:07:12.080> place<00:07:12.320> and<00:07:12.650> kind<00:07:13.310> of<00:07:13.400> how

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
all over the place and kind of how

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.030 
all over the place and kind of how
they've<00:07:13.730> been<00:07:13.910> really<00:07:14.840> or<00:07:15.260> either<00:07:15.410> about<00:07:15.830> to

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040 
they've been really or either about to

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.680 
they've been really or either about to
be<00:07:16.130> from<00:07:16.370> now<00:07:16.550> onwards<00:07:17.000> where<00:07:17.150> we<00:07:17.240> just<00:07:17.390> slip

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690 
be from now onwards where we just slip

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.230 
be from now onwards where we just slip
into<00:07:18.020> the<00:07:18.320> colder<00:07:18.680> side<00:07:18.890> of<00:07:19.220> the<00:07:19.610> lows<00:07:19.790> at<00:07:20.030> time

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
into the colder side of the lows at time

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.090 
into the colder side of the lows at time
but<00:07:20.270> then<00:07:20.600> at<00:07:21.320> times<00:07:21.560> were<00:07:21.710> on<00:07:21.770> the<00:07:21.860> warm<00:07:22.010> side

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100 
but then at times were on the warm side

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.040 
but then at times were on the warm side
so<00:07:22.460> actually<00:07:23.030> this<00:07:23.090> idea<00:07:23.270> of<00:07:23.510> up<00:07:23.630> and<00:07:23.780> down<00:07:23.900> in

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 
so actually this idea of up and down in

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.500 
so actually this idea of up and down in
temperatures<00:07:24.470> is<00:07:24.620> one<00:07:25.040> that<00:07:25.220> CFS<00:07:25.490> is<00:07:26.030> tending

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.510 
temperatures is one that CFS is tending

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.690 
temperatures is one that CFS is tending
to<00:07:26.660> stick<00:07:26.900> with<00:07:27.050> a<00:07:27.080> no<00:07:27.290> real<00:07:27.590> prolonged<00:07:28.250> spell

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700 
to stick with a no real prolonged spell

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.760 
to stick with a no real prolonged spell
of<00:07:28.850> dry<00:07:29.090> weather<00:07:29.270> look<00:07:29.540> showing<00:07:30.140> up<00:07:30.290> in<00:07:30.500> there

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:30.770 
of dry weather look showing up in there

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.650 
of dry weather look showing up in there
really<00:07:31.100> the<00:07:31.220> most<00:07:31.700> blong<00:07:31.970> spell<00:07:32.270> is<00:07:32.390> the<00:07:32.510> one

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:32.660 
really the most blong spell is the one

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.580 
really the most blong spell is the one
that<00:07:32.780> it's<00:07:32.960> saying<00:07:33.110> for<00:07:33.290> the<00:07:33.350> middle<00:07:33.530> of

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590 
that it's saying for the middle of

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.140 
that it's saying for the middle of
January<00:07:34.010> when<00:07:34.130> high<00:07:34.490> pressure<00:07:34.730> could<00:07:34.970> build

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 
January when high pressure could build

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.750 
January when high pressure could build
in<00:07:35.270> it<00:07:35.420> may<00:07:35.540> be<00:07:35.600> coming<00:07:35.840> a<00:07:35.900> little<00:07:35.990> bit<00:07:36.140> dry<00:07:36.760> so

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:37.760 
in it may be coming a little bit dry so

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.820 
in it may be coming a little bit dry so
