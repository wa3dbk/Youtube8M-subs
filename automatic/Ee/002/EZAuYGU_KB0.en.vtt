00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
some things to be careful of when you do

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.899 
some things to be careful of when you do
this<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.860> ring<00:01:17.040> appears<00:01:17.369> where<00:01:17.580> you're<00:01:17.670> going

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
this a ring appears where you're going

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.910 
this a ring appears where you're going
to<00:01:17.970> land<00:01:18.150> enemy<00:01:18.900> players<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
to land enemy players can see this and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.280 
to land enemy players can see this and
you'll<00:01:20.070> most<00:01:20.280> likely<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.610> camped<00:01:21.290> sometimes

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you'll most likely be camped sometimes

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.510 
you'll most likely be camped sometimes
it's<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.530> better<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> swim<00:01:23.070> your<00:01:23.220> way<00:01:23.250> back

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
it's just better to swim your way back

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.399 
it's just better to swim your way back
so<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.479> careful<00:01:24.869> where<00:01:24.990> you're<00:01:25.080> landing

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
so just be careful where you're landing

so just be careful where you're landing
and<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> flip<00:01:26.250> side<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.729> could<00:01:27.000> use<00:01:27.150> this

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and on the flip side you could use this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.789 
and on the flip side you could use this
to<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.479> advantage<00:01:27.570> by<00:01:28.020> camping<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> enemy

do not forget to use your sub weapons
I<00:01:36.299> recommend<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> inkzooka<00:01:37.200> seekers<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
I recommend the inkzooka seekers and the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.459 
I recommend the inkzooka seekers and the
ink<00:01:38.369> strike<00:01:38.670> which<00:01:38.969> is<00:01:39.119> my<00:01:39.240> favorite<00:01:39.689> when

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
ink strike which is my favorite when

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:41.990 
ink strike which is my favorite when
your<00:01:40.590> special<00:01:40.920> meter<00:01:41.069> fills<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.520> try<00:01:41.789> to<00:01:41.850> use

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
your special meter fills up try to use

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.999 
your special meter fills up try to use
it<00:01:42.119> quickly<00:01:42.210> before<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.750> die<00:01:42.929> a<00:01:43.229> good

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
it quickly before you die a good

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.709 
it quickly before you die a good
strategy<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.729> inkzooka<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.359> to<00:01:45.479> use<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
strategy for the inkzooka is to use it

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.330 
strategy for the inkzooka is to use it
right<00:01:45.869> after<00:01:45.929> an<00:01:46.259> enemy<00:01:46.469> player<00:01:46.679> uses<00:01:47.100> there's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
right after an enemy player uses there's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.669 
right after an enemy player uses there's
also<00:01:48.030> use<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.539> inkzooka<00:01:48.780> directly<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
also use the inkzooka directly on the

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.289 
also use the inkzooka directly on the
splat<00:01:49.920> zone<00:01:50.159> as<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.549> generally<00:01:50.789> fills<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.209> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
splat zone as it generally fills up the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.600 
splat zone as it generally fills up the
entire<00:01:51.329> area

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
entire area

now<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.000> overwhelming<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> enemy<00:01:54.899> this

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
now as for overwhelming the enemy this

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.230 
now as for overwhelming the enemy this
is<00:01:55.289> your<00:01:55.560> strategy<00:01:55.770> holding<00:01:56.700> down<00:01:56.819> the<00:01:57.000> splat

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
is your strategy holding down the splat

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.459 
is your strategy holding down the splat
zone<00:01:57.450> could<00:01:57.689> end<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:57.929> into<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> back-and-forth

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
zone could end up into a back-and-forth

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.010 
zone could end up into a back-and-forth
of<00:01:59.100> who's<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.429> control<00:01:59.819> which<00:02:00.509> could<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.840> turn

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
of who's in control which could in turn

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.709 
of who's in control which could in turn
caused<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.619> lose<00:02:01.649> by<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.039> few<00:02:02.340> seconds<00:02:02.850> so

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
caused you to lose by a few seconds so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.389 
caused you to lose by a few seconds so
instead<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.170> focusing<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> splat<00:02:05.159> zone

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
instead of focusing on the splat zone

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.370 
instead of focusing on the splat zone
find<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.209> balance<00:02:06.539> of<00:02:06.599> eliminating<00:02:07.140> players

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
find a balance of eliminating players

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.589 
find a balance of eliminating players
hitting<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> splat<00:02:08.610> zone<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.119> spraying

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
hitting the splat zone and spraying

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.509 
hitting the splat zone and spraying
paint<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.079> their<00:02:10.259> side<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.039> enemy<00:02:11.340> would<00:02:11.430> have

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
paint on their side the enemy would have

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.280 
paint on their side the enemy would have
to<00:02:11.640> repaint<00:02:12.000> certain<00:02:12.329> areas<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.780> travel<00:02:13.110> back

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
to repaint certain areas to travel back

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.289 
to repaint certain areas to travel back
to<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.560> splat<00:02:13.829> zone<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.760> turn<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.150> get

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
to the splat zone so in turn you get

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.670 
to the splat zone so in turn you get
some<00:02:15.450> time<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.720> lock<00:02:15.870> down<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.110> splat<00:02:16.440> zone

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
some time to lock down the splat zone

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.740 
some time to lock down the splat zone
this<00:02:17.430> might<00:02:17.670> seem<00:02:17.849> like<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.060> minimal<00:02:18.450> effect

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
this might seem like a minimal effect

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.449 
this might seem like a minimal effect
but<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.349> actually<00:02:19.650> very<00:02:19.680> helpful<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.340> my

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
but it's actually very helpful in my

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.610 
but it's actually very helpful in my
experience<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.239> lot<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.810> players<00:02:22.110> seem<00:02:22.379> to<00:02:22.410> be

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
experience a lot of players seem to be

and try to shoot each other which again

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:39.710 
and try to shoot each other which again
could<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.160> lead<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.579> back<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.000> forth

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
some people use the paint roller and

don't<00:02:55.090> forget<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.510> test<00:02:55.720> weapons<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.410> see<00:02:56.560> how

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
don't forget to test weapons to see how

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.950 
don't forget to test weapons to see how
much<00:02:56.860> damage<00:02:56.920> they<00:02:57.460> drink<00:02:57.670> up<00:02:57.850> also<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.630> good

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
much damage they drink up also a good

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.600 
much damage they drink up also a good
weapon<00:02:59.140> could<00:02:59.530> take<00:02:59.770> some<00:02:59.950> getting<00:03:00.220> used<00:03:00.250> to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
weapon could take some getting used to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.980 
weapon could take some getting used to
because<00:03:00.940> weapons<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.480> strengths<00:03:01.810> and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
because weapons have strengths and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.380 
because weapons have strengths and
weaknesses<00:03:02.830> so<00:03:03.040> test<00:03:03.550> them<00:03:03.670> out<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:03.910> turf<00:03:04.120> war

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
weaknesses so test them out in turf war

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.500 
weaknesses so test them out in turf war
before<00:03:04.750> going<00:03:04.930> into<00:03:05.140> right<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:07.390> the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
before going into right I like the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.300 
before going into right I like the
splatter<00:03:07.840> shop<00:03:08.080> Pro<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.770> arrow<00:03:08.920> spray

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
splatter shop Pro and the arrow spray

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.160 
splatter shop Pro and the arrow spray
the<00:03:09.820> splatter<00:03:10.120> shot<00:03:10.330> is<00:03:10.450> more<00:03:10.570> accurate<00:03:11.020> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
the splatter shot is more accurate and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.690 
the splatter shot is more accurate and
the<00:03:11.230> arrow<00:03:11.410> spray<00:03:11.740> allows<00:03:12.160> me<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.490> lay<00:03:12.670> down

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
the arrow spray allows me to lay down

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.730 
the arrow spray allows me to lay down
more<00:03:13.150> paint<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.720> it's<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.900> very<00:03:14.110> fast<00:03:14.410> firing

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
more paint and it's a very fast firing

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.130 
more paint and it's a very fast firing
