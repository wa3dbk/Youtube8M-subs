he was raised by trolls and lives in the

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.249 
he was raised by trolls and lives in the
wilderness<00:00:15.639> and<00:00:16.270> so<00:00:16.450> he<00:00:16.570> doesn't<00:00:16.750> have<00:00:16.930> a<00:00:16.990> lot

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259 
wilderness and so he doesn't have a lot

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.820 
wilderness and so he doesn't have a lot
of<00:00:17.290> social<00:00:18.250> graces<00:00:19.150> and<00:00:19.570> he's<00:00:19.689> not<00:00:20.380> great<00:00:20.680> with

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
people and he's sort of charming but he

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.779 
people and he's sort of charming but he
doesn't<00:00:23.680> realize<00:00:23.860> that<00:00:24.040> he's<00:00:24.340> charming

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
doesn't realize that he's charming

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.609 
doesn't realize that he's charming
because<00:00:25.210> he<00:00:25.750> spent<00:00:26.019> so<00:00:26.080> much<00:00:26.320> of<00:00:26.380> his<00:00:26.590> time

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
because he spent so much of his time

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.540 
because he spent so much of his time
alone<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.750> so<00:00:29.140> watching<00:00:29.500> him<00:00:29.890> sort<00:00:30.189> of<00:00:30.310> come

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
alone and so watching him sort of come

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.810 
alone and so watching him sort of come
back<00:00:30.580> into<00:00:31.060> society<00:00:31.539> and<00:00:32.019> and<00:00:32.610> interact<00:00:33.610> with

to<00:02:33.030> her<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.600> think<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.930> Kristen<00:02:34.320> that's<00:02:35.310> a

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489

to her and I think that Kristen that's a
lot<00:02:35.790> do<00:02:36.060> -<00:02:36.300> Kristen<00:02:36.720> Bell<00:02:36.930> as<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.709> know<00:02:37.830> who

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
she is an actress and who she is as a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.589 
she is an actress and who she is as a
comedian

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.740 

it's<00:02:46.469> funny<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.250> romantic<00:02:48.000> it's

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
it's funny it's romantic it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.810 
it's funny it's romantic it's
adventure<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:50.130> top<00:02:50.730> talent<00:02:51.360> voicing<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.020> and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
adventure it's top talent voicing it and

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.270 
adventure it's top talent voicing it and
then<00:02:53.820> it's<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.450> story<00:02:54.900> truly<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.470> think<00:02:55.560> that

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
then it's a story truly I think that

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.210 
then it's a story truly I think that
hasn't<00:02:56.850> been<00:02:57.240> told<00:02:57.480> yet<00:02:57.630> about<00:02:58.200> two<00:02:58.710> sisters

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
hasn't been told yet about two sisters

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.660 
hasn't been told yet about two sisters
and<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:01.080> think<00:03:01.500> they<00:03:01.710> also<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.310> movie

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
and I think they also in this movie

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.199 
and I think they also in this movie
redefine<00:03:03.270> what<00:03:03.900> true<00:03:04.260> love<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.800> in<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.730> way<00:03:05.880> that

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
redefine what true love is in a way that

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.100 
redefine what true love is in a way that
has<00:03:06.450> been<00:03:07.370> defined<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.970> its<00:03:09.120> in<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.570> certain

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
has been defined in its in a certain

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.050 
has been defined in its in a certain
specific<00:03:10.410> way<00:03:10.890> for<00:03:11.190> every<00:03:11.459> other<00:03:11.640> Disney

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
specific way for every other Disney

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.150 
specific way for every other Disney
movie<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.480> we've<00:03:12.570> all<00:03:12.750> seen<00:03:13.020> before<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.709> I

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
movie that we've all seen before and I

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.900 
movie that we've all seen before and I
think<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.550> in<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:14.880> movie<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:16.910> expressed

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
think that in this movie it's expressed

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.320 
think that in this movie it's expressed
true<00:03:18.450> love<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.990> expressed<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.580> really

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
true love is expressed in a really

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.070 
true love is expressed in a really
exciting<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.170> surprising<00:03:22.320> new<00:03:22.890> way
