and I just wasn't quick enough today I
wasted<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.770> time<00:01:46.890> running<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.030> areas

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
wasted a lot of time running to areas

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.219 
wasted a lot of time running to areas
that<00:01:48.509> were<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.990> no<00:01:49.140> good<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:51.000> know

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
that were just no good so you know

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.330 
that were just no good so you know
abandon<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.320> lot<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.560> stuff<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.130> so

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
tomorrow I'll have a lot more fishing I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.080 
tomorrow I'll have a lot more fishing I
notice<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.890> local<00:01:56.340> knowledge<00:01:56.520> probably<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
notice a local knowledge probably is a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.399 
notice a local knowledge probably is a
bit<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.360> an<00:01:57.450> advantage<00:01:57.689> here<00:01:58.049> i<00:01:58.079> think<00:01:58.170> there's

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
bit of an advantage here i think there's

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.620 
bit of an advantage here i think there's
about<00:01:58.439> six<00:01:59.189> or<00:01:59.310> seven<00:01:59.460> Californians<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.509> the

mile<00:02:33.890> an<00:02:33.920> hour<00:02:34.099> zones<00:02:34.519> it<00:02:34.730> makes<00:02:34.940> for<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.180> long

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
mile an hour zones it makes for a long

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.509 
mile an hour zones it makes for a long
run<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:35.840> from<00:02:36.290> where<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.709> furthest<00:02:37.159> i<00:02:37.280> ran

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
run and from where the furthest i ran

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.430 
run and from where the furthest i ran
into<00:02:37.549> back<00:02:37.940> was<00:02:38.180> probably<00:02:38.510> an<00:02:38.599> hour<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:38.989> 45

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
into back was probably an hour and 45

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.380 
into back was probably an hour and 45
minutes<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.519> James<00:02:40.819> River<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.359> the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
minutes and the James River is the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.140 
minutes and the James River is the
longest<00:02:41.989> knit<00:02:42.170> cinelli<00:02:42.530> 70<00:02:43.129> mile<00:02:43.340> run<00:02:43.609> but<00:02:44.120> you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
longest knit cinelli 70 mile run but you

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.930 
longest knit cinelli 70 mile run but you
can<00:02:44.420> do<00:02:44.569> 70<00:02:45.109> to<00:02:45.200> 74<00:02:45.680> yet<00:02:45.890> because<00:02:46.099> danger<00:02:46.670> be<00:02:46.849> at

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
can do 70 to 74 yet because danger be at

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.970 
can do 70 to 74 yet because danger be at
empty<00:02:47.209> everything<00:02:47.510> out<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.810> do<00:02:48.019> 75<00:02:48.440> miles<00:02:48.859> an

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
empty everything out to do 75 miles an

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.280 
empty everything out to do 75 miles an
hour<00:02:49.129> you'd<00:02:49.700> get<00:02:49.909> there<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.540> about<00:02:50.750> an<00:02:50.900> hour<00:02:51.019> so

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
hour you'd get there in about an hour so

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.890 
hour you'd get there in about an hour so
that's<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.159> longest<00:02:52.400> run<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:53.299> is<00:02:53.540> just

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
that's the longest run this is just

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.229 
that's the longest run this is just
pretty<00:02:54.200> hectic<00:02:54.590> it's<00:02:55.040> like<00:02:55.430> scary<00:02:55.849> knowing

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
pretty hectic it's like scary knowing

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.020 
pretty hectic it's like scary knowing
ran<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.709> exact<00:02:58.069> run<00:02:58.370> no<00:02:58.670> one<00:02:58.849> knew
