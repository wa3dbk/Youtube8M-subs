00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
the USB bus output power here is 5 volts

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.699 
the USB bus output power here is 5 volts
and<00:02:36.209> that's<00:02:36.329> excellent<00:02:36.840> because<00:02:37.109> it<00:02:37.319> will

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
and that's excellent because it will

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.240 
and that's excellent because it will
power<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.340> lot<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.090> smaller<00:02:39.629> USB<00:02:40.500> 3<00:02:40.859> devices

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
power a lot of the smaller USB 3 devices

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.209 
power a lot of the smaller USB 3 devices
and<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.879> course<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.450> will<00:02:42.689> charge<00:02:43.170> tablets<00:02:44.010> and

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
and of course it will charge tablets and

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.979 
and of course it will charge tablets and
smartphones<00:02:44.579> with<00:02:45.030> ease<00:02:45.209> not<00:02:45.599> only<00:02:45.810> does<00:02:45.959> it

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
smartphones with ease not only does it

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.849 
smartphones with ease not only does it
have<00:02:46.200> 2<00:02:46.560> high<00:02:46.950> speed<00:02:47.340> USB<00:02:47.659> 3<00:02:48.659> external<00:02:49.200> ports

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
have 2 high speed USB 3 external ports

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.479 
have 2 high speed USB 3 external ports
but<00:02:50.189> it<00:02:50.609> also<00:02:50.909> has<00:02:51.510> an<00:02:51.840> internal<00:02:52.590> one<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.280> this

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
but it also has an internal one and this

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.819 
but it also has an internal one and this
USB<00:02:53.909> 3<00:02:54.450> internal<00:02:54.930> connector<00:02:55.260> will<00:02:55.530> really

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
USB 3 internal connector will really

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.979 
USB 3 internal connector will really
come<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.129> handy<00:02:56.159> like<00:02:56.639> for<00:02:56.879> example<00:02:57.389> if<00:02:57.659> you

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
come in handy like for example if you

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.039 
come in handy like for example if you
are<00:02:58.019> using<00:02:58.250> your<00:02:59.250> onboard<00:02:59.819> USB<00:03:00.510> connector<00:03:00.989> and

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
are using your onboard USB connector and

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.440 
are using your onboard USB connector and
maybe<00:03:01.409> you<00:03:01.769> have<00:03:02.129> another<00:03:02.609> memory<00:03:03.180> card

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
maybe you have another memory card

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.000 
maybe you have another memory card
reader<00:03:03.659> or<00:03:03.989> something<00:03:04.019> lot<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.620> those<00:03:04.739> lines

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
reader or something lot of those lines

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.520 
reader or something lot of those lines
that<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.549> have<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.299> case<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.930> well<00:03:07.349> you

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
that you have in the case and well you

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.490 
that you have in the case and well you
don't<00:03:07.799> have<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.430> connection<00:03:08.849> for<00:03:09.389> it<00:03:09.599> so<00:03:09.840> this

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
don't have a connection for it so this

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.319 
don't have a connection for it so this
would<00:03:10.950> be<00:03:11.069> perfect<00:03:11.280> for<00:03:11.609> that<00:03:11.669> so<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.090> could

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
would be perfect for that so you could

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.750 
would be perfect for that so you could
connect<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.079> here<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:13.980> then<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.579> could

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
connect it to here and then you could

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.670 
connect it to here and then you could
still<00:03:15.030> use<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:16.019> external<00:03:16.799> 2<00:03:17.810> USB<00:03:18.810> 3<00:03:19.349> ports

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
still use the external 2 USB 3 ports

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.530 
still use the external 2 USB 3 ports
that<00:03:19.859> are<00:03:19.979> on<00:03:20.099> this<00:03:20.220> device<00:03:20.609> because<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.150> lot<00:03:21.510> of

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
that are on this device because a lot of

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.259 
that are on this device because a lot of
these<00:03:21.750> cards<00:03:22.260> either<00:03:22.500> have<00:03:22.859> one<00:03:23.069> or<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:23.849> other

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
these cards either have one or the other

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.930 
these cards either have one or the other
and<00:03:24.540> very<00:03:24.870> few<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.440> them<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.949> both<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.639> that's

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
and very few of them have both so that's

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.819 
and very few of them have both so that's
excellent<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.479> here's<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.959> closer<00:03:28.290> look<00:03:28.650> at

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
excellent and here's a closer look at

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.270 
excellent and here's a closer look at
that<00:03:28.859> 19<00:03:29.760> pen<00:03:30.209> USB<00:03:31.049> internal<00:03:31.709> connector<00:03:31.979> this

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
PCI Express 2 USB 3 card is a perfect

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.569 
PCI Express 2 USB 3 card is a perfect
solution<00:03:35.970> for<00:03:36.569> anybody<00:03:37.169> really<00:03:37.620> even<00:03:38.010> if<00:03:38.489> you

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
solution for anybody really even if you

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.879 
solution for anybody really even if you
have<00:03:38.699> a<00:03:38.729> motherboard<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.389> has<00:03:39.540> USB<00:03:39.959> 3<00:03:40.530> ports

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
have a motherboard that has USB 3 ports

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.759 
have a motherboard that has USB 3 ports
on<00:03:41.040> currently<00:03:41.849> then<00:03:42.419> you<00:03:42.690> might<00:03:43.049> want<00:03:43.409> to<00:03:43.590> have

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
on currently then you might want to have

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.530 
on currently then you might want to have
some<00:03:44.129> more<00:03:44.489> maybe<00:03:44.909> you<00:03:45.060> have<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.209> motherboard

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
some more maybe you have a motherboard

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.439 
some more maybe you have a motherboard
that<00:03:45.750> doesn't<00:03:46.409> have<00:03:46.620> any<00:03:46.859> USB<00:03:47.549> 3<00:03:47.849> ports<00:03:48.209> on<00:03:48.389> it

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
that doesn't have any USB 3 ports on it

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.050 
that doesn't have any USB 3 ports on it
well<00:03:49.019> this<00:03:49.530> would<00:03:49.739> be<00:03:49.949> a<00:03:50.129> really<00:03:50.519> inexpensive

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
well this would be a really inexpensive

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.110 
well this would be a really inexpensive
quick<00:03:52.019> solution<00:03:52.859> because<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.400> alternative

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
quick solution because the alternative

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.899 
quick solution because the alternative
of<00:03:54.239> course<00:03:54.299> is<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.900> upgrade<00:03:55.169> the<00:03:55.909> motherboard
