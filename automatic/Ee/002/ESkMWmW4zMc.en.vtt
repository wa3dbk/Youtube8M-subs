00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.279 
go this is the longshot planet ace I
believe<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:58.010> clay<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.750> wanted<00:01:00.750> something<00:01:01.140> kind

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
believe in clay I wanted something kind

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.490 
believe in clay I wanted something kind
of<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.559> nudie<00:01:02.149> spring<00:01:03.149> color<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.140> would<00:01:04.290> go

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
of a nudie spring color that would go

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.910 
of a nudie spring color that would go
with<00:01:04.739> everything

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
with everything

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.300 
with everything
and<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.979> believe<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:10.130> small<00:01:11.270> size

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
and I believe this is in the small size

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.399 
and I believe this is in the small size
they<00:01:14.310> only<00:01:14.460> had<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:14.990> sizes<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
they only had two sizes in this

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.530 
they only had two sizes in this
particular<00:01:17.000> one<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.270> color<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.860> wanted<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
particular one in color and I wanted the

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.289 
particular one in color and I wanted the
smaller<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.080> I'm<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.320> exactly<00:01:22.619> sure<00:01:23.299> what

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
smaller one so I'm not exactly sure what

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.580 
smaller one so I'm not exactly sure what
size<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.540> there's<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.110> name<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
size it is and there's the name of the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.020 
size it is and there's the name of the
bag

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.750 

and<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.080> this<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.860> perfect

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
and I think this is going to be perfect

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.100 
and I think this is going to be perfect
for<00:01:36.770> spring<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.950> summer<00:01:38.540> it's<00:01:39.540> kind<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.080> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
for spring in summer it's kind of like a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.620 
for spring in summer it's kind of like a
rough<00:01:40.530> leather<00:01:41.160> on<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> back<00:01:44.270> hold<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
rough leather on the back hold on a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:57.800 
rough leather on the back hold on a
second<00:01:50.420> there's<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:54.170> logo<00:01:55.170> zipper<00:01:55.740> again<00:01:56.810> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
second there's the logo zipper again and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.630 
second there's the logo zipper again and
it's<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.410> to<00:01:58.470> focus<00:02:01.010> and<00:02:02.010> Suns<00:02:02.400> in

it's not going to focus and Suns in
there<00:02:05.479> but<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.960> think<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.920> be

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
there but I just think it's going to be

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.310 
there but I just think it's going to be
perfect<00:02:09.360> perfect<00:02:09.570> and<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:11.040> course<00:02:11.340> here<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.880> oh
