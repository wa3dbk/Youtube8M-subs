00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
basics tutorial and then there'll be a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.950 
basics tutorial and then there'll be a
couple<00:00:16.230> more<00:00:16.460> afterwards<00:00:17.460> with<00:00:18.449> various

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
couple more afterwards with various

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.160 
couple more afterwards with various
different<00:00:19.939> sections<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.060> industrial<00:00:21.869> craft

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
different sections of industrial craft

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.920 
different sections of industrial craft
which<00:00:22.800> aren't<00:00:23.220> really<00:00:24.119> very<00:00:24.150> well<00:00:24.570> documented

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
which aren't really very well documented

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.980 
which aren't really very well documented
and<00:00:25.500> these<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.580> things<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.060> I've<00:00:27.210> been<00:00:27.390> done

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
and these are things that I've been done

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.339 
and these are things that I've been done
through<00:00:28.260> trial<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.590> error<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.279> just

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
through trial and error and just

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.810 
through trial and error and just
scavenge<00:00:31.349> from<00:00:31.529> various<00:00:31.920> parts<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.460> internet

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
scavenge from various parts the internet

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.049 
scavenge from various parts the internet
found<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:33.930> works<00:00:34.200> except<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:34.980> etc<00:00:35.370> so

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
found out what works except for etc so

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.680 
found out what works except for etc so
this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.750> going<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.020> be<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> basics<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:39.239> basic

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
this is going to be a basics so basic

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.200 
this is going to be a basics so basic
basic<00:00:40.110> change<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.710> Industrial<00:00:41.460> Craft<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
basic change of Industrial Craft is that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.180 
basic change of Industrial Craft is that
now<00:00:43.100> power<00:00:44.100> isn't<00:00:44.399> sent<00:00:45.530> per<00:00:46.530> tick<00:00:46.890> it's

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
now power isn't sent per tick it's

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.979 
now power isn't sent per tick it's
they're<00:00:47.969> sentient<00:00:48.450> packets<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.960> there'll<00:00:51.960> be

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
they're sentient packets so there'll be

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.240 
they're sentient packets so there'll be
a<00:00:52.110> certain<00:00:52.559> buffer<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:54.289> then<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.710> will<00:00:55.949> send

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
a certain buffer and then it will send

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.760 
a certain buffer and then it will send
out<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.850> packet<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.739> a<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.690> what<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.020> means<00:01:01.410> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
out a packet of a you what this means is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.359 
out a packet of a you what this means is
that<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.690> say<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:05.670> can't<00:01:06.470> have<00:01:07.470> loads<00:01:08.189> of

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that if you say you can't have loads of

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.070 
that if you say you can't have loads of
generators<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> bat<00:01:09.570> box<00:01:09.810> anymore

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
generators up to a bat box anymore

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.800 
generators up to a bat box anymore
because<00:01:10.860> you're<00:01:11.610> sending<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.330> you're<00:01:12.659> not

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
because you're sending a you're not

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.410 
because you're sending a you're not
sending<00:01:13.140> an<00:01:13.380> lv<00:01:13.860> signal<00:01:14.549> anymore<00:01:15.000> you're

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
sending an lv signal anymore you're

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.850 
sending an lv signal anymore you're
sending<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.960> packet<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.530> information<00:01:18.770> but<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
sending a packet of information but the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.880 
sending a packet of information but the
web<00:01:20.009> best<00:01:20.280> way<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> show<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.259> with

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
web best way to show you this is with

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
web best way to show you this is with
generators<00:01:24.619> table<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> back<00:01:26.009> box<00:01:27.020> so

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
generators table in the back box so

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.050 
generators table in the back box so
quick<00:01:28.439> thing<00:01:28.650> about<00:01:28.770> cables<00:01:29.280> now<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.880> will

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
quick thing about cables now they will

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.910 
quick thing about cables now they will
all<00:01:30.329> say<00:01:30.840> how<00:01:31.799> much<00:01:31.979> EU<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.920> with

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
all say how much EU they can with

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.080 
all say how much EU they can with
withstand<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.360> 10<00:01:36.960> cable<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:37.770> useful<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
withstand so 10 cable is now useful it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
withstand so 10 cable is now useful it
can<00:01:39.150> hold<00:01:40.340> 32<00:01:41.340> e<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:42.829> that<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.950> might<00:01:44.100> end<00:01:44.280> up

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
can hold 32 e you that you might end up

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.350 
can hold 32 e you that you might end up
just<00:01:44.670> using<00:01:44.820> copper<00:01:45.420> anyway<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:47.820> start<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.240> I

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
just using copper anyway to start with I

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389 
just using copper anyway to start with I
have<00:01:48.570> been<00:01:48.750> using<00:01:48.869> tin<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.470> tin<00:01:49.710> cables<00:01:50.189> are

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
have been using tin and tin cables are

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.149 
have been using tin and tin cables are
now<00:01:50.759> used<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:52.170> sort<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.770> tier<00:01:53.100> 1<00:01:53.310> recipes<00:01:55.159> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
now used in a sort of tier 1 recipes the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.010 
now used in a sort of tier 1 recipes the
recipes<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.820> also<00:01:57.119> changed<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.840> worth

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
recipes have also changed so it's worth

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.440 
recipes have also changed so it's worth
just<00:01:58.320> looking<00:01:58.680> at<00:01:58.770> your<00:01:58.860> any<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.189> just<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.299> make

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
just looking at your any I just to make

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.020 
just looking at your any I just to make
sure<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.930> you've<00:02:01.079> got<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:02.460> know<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.880> put

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
sure that you've got you know if you put

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.399 
sure that you've got you know if you put
you<00:02:03.180> are<00:02:03.329> having<00:02:03.509> problems<00:02:03.689> making<00:02:04.110> something

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
you are having problems making something

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.730 
you are having problems making something
that<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.740> are<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> few<00:02:05.159> years<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
that you are a few years in the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.639 
that you are a few years in the
I<00:02:05.799> speak<00:02:06.100> because<00:02:06.310> things<00:02:06.790> have<00:02:07.030> changed<00:02:07.649> so

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
I speak because things have changed so

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.780 
I speak because things have changed so
what<00:02:09.069> we<00:02:09.220> are<00:02:09.489> going<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:10.000> have<00:02:10.239> here<00:02:10.680> is<00:02:11.790> cable

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
what we are going to have here is cable

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.150 
what we are going to have here is cable
back<00:02:13.180> box<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:14.310> for<00:02:15.660> generators<00:02:16.800> now<00:02:17.800> the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
back box and for generators now the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.610 
back box and for generators now the
backbox<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:20.020> output<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.950> thus<00:02:21.190> input<00:02:22.620> 32e

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
backbox can output and thus input 32e

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.600 
backbox can output and thus input 32e
you<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.310> tip<00:02:25.050> that's<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.230> that's<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.220> maximum

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
you a tip that's the that's the maximum

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.839 
you a tip that's the that's the maximum
amount<00:02:27.849> of<00:02:28.330> packet<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.769> can<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.430> accept

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
amount of packet that can it can accept

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.780 
amount of packet that can it can accept
and<00:02:31.230> that's<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.470> maximum<00:02:32.800> packet<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.640> it

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
and that's the maximum packet that it

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.570 
and that's the maximum packet that it
will<00:02:33.970> output<00:02:34.349> so<00:02:35.349> it<00:02:35.560> will<00:02:35.709> wait<00:02:35.920> for<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.550> to

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
will output so it will wait for it to

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.670 
will output so it will wait for it to
have<00:02:37.000> 32<00:02:37.599> EU<00:02:38.230> before<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.010> sends<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.340> on<00:02:40.680> each

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
have 32 EU before it sends it on each

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.259 
have 32 EU before it sends it on each
generator<00:02:42.600> has<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> power<00:02:44.019> output<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.680> 10<00:02:45.130> EU<00:02:45.549> at

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
generator has a power output of 10 EU at

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.180 
generator has a power output of 10 EU at
the<00:02:46.450> max<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:48.010> if<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:49.150> have<00:02:49.360> three<00:02:50.190> generators

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
the max so if you have three generators

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.610 
the max so if you have three generators
output<00:02:51.850> into<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.090> bat<00:02:52.330> box<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.900> are<00:02:53.049> sending

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
output into a bat box you are sending

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.470 
output into a bat box you are sending
the<00:02:53.739> bat<00:02:53.920> box<00:02:54.220> 30<00:02:54.880> EU<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:56.860> for<00:02:57.280> each<00:02:57.400> packet<00:02:57.880> if

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
the bat box 30 EU it for each packet if

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.289 
the bat box 30 EU it for each packet if
you've<00:02:59.350> got<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.860> fourth<00:03:00.370> generate<00:03:00.790> one<00:03:01.030> there

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
you've got a fourth generate one there

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.280 
you've got a fourth generate one there
it's<00:03:01.930> going<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.440> send<00:03:03.060> 40<00:03:04.060> EU<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:04.900> it's<00:03:05.170> going

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
it's going to send 40 EU and it's going

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.750 
it's going to send 40 EU and it's going
to<00:03:05.349> blow<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.709> bat<00:03:05.860> box<00:03:06.099> because<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.519> black

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
to blow the bat box because the black

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.030 
to blow the bat box because the black
box<00:03:07.060> can<00:03:07.330> only<00:03:07.450> accept<00:03:07.840> certain<00:03:08.530> or<00:03:09.280> 32<00:03:10.049> so<00:03:11.049> has

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
box can only accept certain or 32 so has

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.979 
box can only accept certain or 32 so has
a<00:03:12.430> much<00:03:12.970> more<00:03:14.910> obvious<00:03:15.910> way<00:03:16.359> of<00:03:16.420> doing<00:03:16.810> things

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
a much more obvious way of doing things

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.759 
a much more obvious way of doing things
so<00:03:17.680> let's<00:03:17.980> just<00:03:18.310> set<00:03:18.579> this<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.600> 16<00:03:20.410> in<00:03:20.560> there

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
so let's just set this so 16 in there

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.050 
so let's just set this so 16 in there
that's<00:03:21.519> fine<00:03:21.820> 16<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.290> fine<00:03:23.730> 16<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:24.820> there

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
that's fine 16 that is fine 16 in there

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.900 
that's fine 16 that is fine 16 in there
it's<00:03:25.510> fine<00:03:25.810> that's<00:03:26.230> all<00:03:26.350> generating<00:03:26.799> power<00:03:27.010> 16

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
it's fine that's all generating power 16

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.680 
it's fine that's all generating power 16
in<00:03:28.090> there<00:03:28.269> most<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:28.840> our<00:03:28.900> box<00:03:29.549> so<00:03:30.549> what<00:03:31.450> this

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
in there most of our box so what this

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.900 
in there most of our box so what this
means<00:03:31.959> for<00:03:32.109> you<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.440> that<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.340> be<00:03:33.519> a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
means for you is that you have to be a

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.750 
means for you is that you have to be a
lot<00:03:34.720> more<00:03:34.750> conscious<00:03:35.470> of<00:03:35.620> how<00:03:36.130> you're<00:03:36.370> setting

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
lot more conscious of how you're setting

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.270 
lot more conscious of how you're setting
up<00:03:36.940> your<00:03:37.920> electrical<00:03:38.920> networks<00:03:41.010> it's<00:03:42.010> no

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
up your electrical networks it's no

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.490 
up your electrical networks it's no
longer<00:03:42.519> separated<00:03:43.359> into<00:03:43.540> Watson<00:03:44.519> lv<00:03:45.519> 8<00:03:45.819> MV<00:03:46.500> hv

longer separated into Watson lv 8 MV hv

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.000 
longer separated into Watson lv 8 MV hv
and<00:03:47.829> EV<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:48.970> much<00:03:49.329> more<00:03:49.569> separated<00:03:50.079> into<00:03:50.319> how

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
and EV it's much more separated into how

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.319 
and EV it's much more separated into how
much<00:03:51.250> power<00:03:51.519> you're<00:03:51.790> putting<00:03:52.030> through<00:03:52.209> the

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
much power you're putting through the

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.170 
much power you're putting through the
network<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:52.989> where<00:03:53.920> things<00:03:54.190> are<00:03:54.549> going<00:03:54.609> as<00:03:55.120> a

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
network and where things are going as a

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.300 
network and where things are going as a
result<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:56.709> can<00:03:56.790> have<00:03:57.790> a<00:03:59.100> transformers<00:04:00.100> on

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
result you can have a transformers on

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.400 
result you can have a transformers on
there<00:04:00.519> you<00:04:01.090> can<00:04:01.120> have<00:04:01.420> transformed<00:04:01.930> former

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
there you can have transformed former

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.500 
there you can have transformed former
upgrades<00:04:02.859> in<00:04:03.069> your<00:04:03.310> machines<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.910> make<00:04:04.060> to

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
upgrades in your machines to make to

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.840 
upgrades in your machines to make to
allow<00:04:04.840> them<00:04:05.079> to<00:04:05.380> accept<00:04:05.769> a<00:04:06.450> larger<00:04:07.450> packets<00:04:07.780> of

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
allow them to accept a larger packets of

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.550 
allow them to accept a larger packets of
EU<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:11.019> that's<00:04:11.319> all<00:04:11.500> something<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.549> take<00:04:12.670> into

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
EU so that's all something to take into

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.670 
EU so that's all something to take into
count<00:04:13.709> but<00:04:14.450> yeah<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.510> have<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.840> be<00:04:16.049> very<00:04:16.079> very

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
count but yeah you have to be very very

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.400 
count but yeah you have to be very very
aware<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.400> what<00:04:17.910> how<00:04:18.750> much<00:04:18.930> power<00:04:19.139> you're

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
aware of what how much power you're

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.930 
aware of what how much power you're
producing<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.160> how<00:04:20.310> much<00:04:20.459> power<00:04:20.639> you<00:04:20.760> could

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
producing and how much power you could

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.120 
producing and how much power you could
hold<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.570> how<00:04:22.049> much<00:04:22.200> power<00:04:22.470> your<00:04:22.680> machines

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
hold and how much power your machines

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.740 
hold and how much power your machines
and<00:04:23.460> your<00:04:23.610> storage<00:04:23.880> units<00:04:24.240> can<00:04:24.389> actually

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
and your storage units can actually

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.250 
and your storage units can actually
stand<00:04:25.490> so<00:04:26.490> on<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.180> server<00:04:27.540> contrary<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.200> makes

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
stand so on the server contrary it makes

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.490 
stand so on the server contrary it makes
the<00:04:28.680> service<00:04:29.040> down<00:04:29.220> but<00:04:29.730> on<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:31.080> serve<00:04:31.320> the

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
the service down but on the serve the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.690 
the service down but on the serve the
Dom<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:31.919> play<00:04:32.550> on<00:04:32.730> I<00:04:33.169> use<00:04:34.169> reactors<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:35.520> they've

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
Dom I play on I use reactors and they've

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.810 
Dom I play on I use reactors and they've
got<00:04:35.730> variable<00:04:36.419> output<00:04:37.130> so<00:04:38.130> I've<00:04:38.370> got<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.639> think

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
got variable output so I've got to think

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.740 
got variable output so I've got to think
about<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.300> as<00:04:39.600> well<00:04:39.810> how<00:04:40.800> much<00:04:40.980> power<00:04:41.310> that

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
about that as well how much power that

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.129 
about that as well how much power that
the<00:04:43.400> reactor<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.580> outputting<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:45.690> I<00:04:45.720> don't<00:04:45.960> go

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
the reactor is outputting so I don't go

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.290 
the reactor is outputting so I don't go
and<00:04:46.320> blow<00:04:46.530> something<00:04:47.010> further<00:04:47.700> one<00:04:47.970> down<00:04:48.150> the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
and blow something further one down the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.870 
and blow something further one down the
chain<00:04:49.340> which<00:04:50.340> is<00:04:50.490> fun<00:04:52.220> industrialcraft<00:04:53.220> also

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
chain which is fun industrialcraft also

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.790 
chain which is fun industrialcraft also
adds<00:04:54.120> that<00:04:54.810> they've<00:04:54.990> changed<00:04:55.229> the<00:04:55.440> storage

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
adds that they've changed the storage

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.850 
adds that they've changed the storage
units<00:04:56.190> around<00:04:56.520> so<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.389> box<00:04:57.930> is<00:04:58.229> your

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
units around so that box is your

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:06.469 
units around so that box is your
standard<00:04:59.250> 40,000<00:05:00.320> you<00:05:01.320> have<00:05:03.350> CSU<00:05:04.940> yeah<00:05:05.940> this

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
standard 40,000 you have CSU yeah this

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.550 
standard 40,000 you have CSU yeah this
thing<00:05:06.750> which<00:05:07.380> is<00:05:07.650> basically<00:05:08.250> your<00:05:08.639> old<00:05:09.030> it's

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
thing which is basically your old it's

thing which is basically your old it's
half<00:05:11.090> what<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.330> MFE<00:05:13.020> helped<00:05:13.500> but<00:05:13.650> it's<00:05:13.800> um

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
half what the MFE helped but it's um

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:23.930 
half what the MFE helped but it's um
does<00:05:14.880> your<00:05:15.240> 128<00:05:16.229> packets<00:05:17.990> your<00:05:19.010> f<00:05:20.010> e<00:05:21.440> is<00:05:22.940> now

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
does your 128 packets your f e is now

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.100 
does your 128 packets your f e is now
four<00:05:24.600> million<00:05:24.840> EU<00:05:25.410> and<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.800> outputs<00:05:25.979> 512<00:05:27.110> and

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
four million EU and it outputs 512 and

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.700 
four million EU and it outputs 512 and
yes<00:05:28.919> I<00:05:29.070> do<00:05:29.130> use<00:05:29.490> that<00:05:29.840> I've<00:05:30.840> got<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.140> reactor

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
yes I do use that I've got a reactor

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.370 
yes I do use that I've got a reactor
outputting<00:05:32.370> into<00:05:32.610> an<00:05:32.729> MFE<00:05:33.150> that<00:05:33.450> outputs<00:05:34.140> to

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
outputting into an MFE that outputs to

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.219 
outputting into an MFE that outputs to
an<00:05:34.500> upgraded<00:05:35.310> a<00:05:35.789> thermal<00:05:36.630> centrifuge<00:05:37.050> but

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
an upgraded a thermal centrifuge but

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.140 
an upgraded a thermal centrifuge but
we'll<00:05:37.350> get<00:05:37.500> into<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.860> into<00:05:38.160> that<00:05:38.340> stuff<00:05:38.880> in

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
we'll get into the into that stuff in

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.950 
we'll get into the into that stuff in
the<00:05:39.630> next<00:05:39.870> video<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:41.389> we<00:05:42.389> have<00:05:42.720> our<00:05:43.080> m<00:05:43.440> FSU

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
the next video and we have our m FSU

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:53.719 
the next video and we have our m FSU
which<00:05:45.960> outputs<00:05:49.430> 2048<00:05:51.560> packets<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:52.770> it's<00:05:53.520> got

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
which outputs 2048 packets and it's got

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.950 
which outputs 2048 packets and it's got
that<00:05:54.690> 400<00:05:55.350> million<00:05:55.650> 4<00:05:56.070> million<00:05:56.370> tonight<00:05:56.960> yeah
