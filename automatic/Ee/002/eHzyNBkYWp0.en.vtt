00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
from work so I can begin to do the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.529 
from work so I can begin to do the
fuller<00:00:16.410> pans<00:00:16.740> let<00:00:16.949> me<00:00:17.039> show<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.300> the<00:00:18.300> reason

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
fuller pans let me show you the reason

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.779 
fuller pans let me show you the reason
why<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:19.020> cars<00:00:19.650> rusty<00:00:19.980> floors<00:00:20.279> now<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.550> car

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
why this cars rusty floors now this car

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.700 
why this cars rusty floors now this car
has<00:00:20.939> been<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.840> Kansas<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.439> then<00:00:22.560> also

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
has been was in Kansas and then also

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.340 
has been was in Kansas and then also
mostly<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.340> Texas<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.910> reason<00:00:24.240> why<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
mostly in Texas and the reason why the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.400 
mostly in Texas and the reason why the
floors<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:25.980> rest<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.400> can<00:00:26.699> see<00:00:27.000> is

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
floors are so rest as you can see is

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.800 
floors are so rest as you can see is
because<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.680> leaks<00:00:29.010> into<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.179> car<00:00:30.510> because

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
because it leaks into the car because

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.120 
because it leaks into the car because
the<00:00:30.869> weather<00:00:31.050> stripping<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.500> totally<00:00:31.890> shot

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
the weather stripping is totally shot

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610 
the weather stripping is totally shot
okay<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.480> think<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> main<00:00:34.230> reasons

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
okay and I think one of the main reasons

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.889 
okay and I think one of the main reasons
if<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.890> look<00:00:35.100> at<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:36.329> strip<00:00:36.780> right

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
if you look at this this strip right

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.750 
if you look at this this strip right
here<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.320> mean<00:00:37.500> there's<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.340> weather

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
here I mean there's the weather

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.490 
here I mean there's the weather
stripping<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.480> totally<00:00:39.930> missing<00:00:40.350> it's

totally gone and it's like that all the
way<00:00:42.780> around<00:00:43.079> all<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.590> whole<00:00:44.070> rest<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> car

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
way around all the whole rest of the car

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.940 
way around all the whole rest of the car
is<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> same<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> worst<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.739> these

back the back floors are a little better
under<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.899> seat<00:00:52.199> there's<00:00:52.440> some<00:00:52.590> rest<00:00:52.800> tools

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
under the seat there's some rest tools

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.520 
under the seat there's some rest tools
you<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.550> right<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.539> there<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:54.750> these

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you can see right in there but these

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.310 
you can see right in there but these
back<00:00:55.770> rockers<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.640> replaced<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.320> as

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
back rockers have to be replaced but as

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:11.240 
back rockers have to be replaced but as
you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.190> got<00:01:00.149> floor<00:01:01.020> pans<00:01:08.030> side<00:01:10.250> sink

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.220 
you can see I got floor pans side sink
and<00:01:11.460> deal

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.140 

so<00:01:16.230> definitely<00:01:16.830> rest<00:01:17.190> from<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> inside<00:01:17.940> out

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
so definitely rest from the inside out

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.600 
so definitely rest from the inside out
which<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.780> shame<00:01:19.140> considering<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.310> rest<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
which is a shame considering the rest of

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.790 
which is a shame considering the rest of
the<00:01:20.700> car<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.000> totally<00:01:21.360> solid<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.530> rocker

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
the car is totally solid this rocker

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.230 
the car is totally solid this rocker
also<00:01:23.280> has<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.230> little<00:01:25.230> bit<00:01:26.090> bubbling<00:01:27.090> up

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
also has just a little bit bubbling up

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.930 
also has just a little bit bubbling up
but<00:01:27.450> hopefully<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.260> will<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.470> somewhat<00:01:28.940> easy

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
but hopefully that will be somewhat easy

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.530 
but hopefully that will be somewhat easy
to<00:01:30.210> replace<00:01:31.790> another<00:01:32.790> thing<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.180> want<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:33.420> show
