00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
guys in my other video that i did get

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.450 
guys in my other video that i did get
about<00:05:12.550> an<00:05:12.699> inch<00:05:12.819> of<00:05:12.939> new<00:05:13.089> growth<00:05:13.240> so<00:05:14.460> it

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
about an inch of new growth so it

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.399 
about an inch of new growth so it
basically<00:05:15.580> evens<00:05:16.210> out<00:05:16.330> because<00:05:16.779> before<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.139> put

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
basically evens out because before I put

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.999 
basically evens out because before I put
my<00:05:17.439> braids<00:05:17.770> in<00:05:18.009> I<00:05:18.310> had<00:05:18.819> cut<00:05:19.060> about<00:05:19.389> an<00:05:19.539> inch<00:05:19.689> off

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
my braids in I had cut about an inch off

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.879 
my braids in I had cut about an inch off
at<00:05:21.009> the<00:05:21.249> end<00:05:21.400> because<00:05:21.699> I<00:05:21.969> wanted<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.710> take<00:05:23.710> off

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
at the end because I wanted to take off

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.469 
at the end because I wanted to take off
the<00:05:24.099> split<00:05:24.370> end<00:05:24.550> before<00:05:24.849> up<00:05:25.060> with<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.240> braids

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
the split end before up with the braids

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.240 
the split end before up with the braids
in<00:05:25.719> and<00:05:25.930> that<00:05:26.020> would<00:05:26.169> help<00:05:26.289> promote<00:05:26.710> on<00:05:26.979> better

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
in and that would help promote on better

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.140 
in and that would help promote on better
growth<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:27.909> I<00:05:28.180> did<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.669> so<00:05:30.669> I<00:05:30.699> did<00:05:30.909> get<00:05:31.029> my
