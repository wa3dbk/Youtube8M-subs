00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
you've seen the Qi crystals before and

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.840 
you've seen the Qi crystals before and
it<00:06:05.870> can<00:06:06.560> move<00:06:06.770> because<00:06:07.130> it's<00:06:07.280> simply<00:06:07.669> on<00:06:07.820> a

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
it can move because it's simply on a

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.870 
it can move because it's simply on a
ball<00:06:08.180> and<00:06:08.780> socket<00:06:09.590> joint<00:06:09.620> a<00:06:10.160> bit<00:06:10.340> like<00:06:10.490> they
