00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.890

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.800
 perfectly safe before applying we 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.099
 disinfect and degrease skin 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:34.289
 special solutions or 

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:36.560
 antiseptics then using 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:41.810
 special fluid 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.810
 we transfer the pattern on the skin 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.200

 measurements and it is painted on the henna body in 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.230
 Unlike tattoo biota, is 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.190

 about two weeks 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.000

 countries and still enjoys great 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.460
 popular acquiring modern 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.890
 ways of expression and diversity in 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.510
 performance of the window itself does not cause allergies

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.440
 without disturbing the skin 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.540
 biota can be excellent temporarily 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.430
