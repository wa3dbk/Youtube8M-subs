00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
I believe yeah he's made him fazil um I

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.190 
I believe yeah he's made him fazil um I
like<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:28.430> vanish<00:01:29.430> because<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.960> dries

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
like this vanish because as it dries

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.090 
like this vanish because as it dries
fast<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.310> not<00:01:33.090> sticky

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
fast and it is not sticky

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.130 
fast and it is not sticky
you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.250> after<00:01:35.909> when<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.329> dry<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.960> doesn't

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
you know after when it's dry it doesn't

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.510 
you know after when it's dry it doesn't
have<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.470> sticky<00:01:37.770> feel<00:01:39.259> it<00:01:40.259> dries<00:01:40.710> within<00:01:41.220> five

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
have a sticky feel it dries within five

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.580 
have a sticky feel it dries within five
or<00:01:41.549> ten<00:01:42.150> minutes<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:45.210> depends<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.200> are

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
or ten minutes so it depends if you are

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.480 
or ten minutes so it depends if you are
in<00:01:47.040> an<00:01:47.340> enclosed<00:01:48.329> area<00:01:48.840> where<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.070> wind<00:01:50.340> is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
in an enclosed area where if the wind is

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.830 
in an enclosed area where if the wind is
blowing<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.290> believe<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.500> five<00:01:52.770> minutes

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
blowing I believe it in five minutes

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.490 
blowing I believe it in five minutes
it's<00:01:54.840> gonna<00:01:55.049> dry<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.689> our<00:01:57.689> key<00:01:58.049> legs<00:02:00.500> gloss
