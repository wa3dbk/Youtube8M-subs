 our destination account to start 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.360

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.370
 Your username 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.000
 the language would probably leave him 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.000
 and activating and activating that I'm not a 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.610
 course 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.900

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.820
 confirmation message in our 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.170
