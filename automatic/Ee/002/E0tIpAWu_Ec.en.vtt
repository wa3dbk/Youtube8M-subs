00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.929
 the beginning of the match could imagine that 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.230
 double digit will be the score but not developed 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.750
 the end result is sibiri 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.160
 it became better to play against you or you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.160
 may be tired or whale others 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:32.369
 profiles of the tiger game.com Shalygin 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.100
 but the truth is your words are 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.230
 really when we succeeded 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.020
 a great start we abandoned so much 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.670
 Shya write literally the first ten 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 minutes of the match was hard to maintain 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.620
 same enthusiasm same attacked 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.300
 throughout the rest of the game we are well 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.280
 willy-nilly slowed down a little 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.570
 but overall I think we had a game 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.340
 at a high level cool ska plays already 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.559
 the beggar season has essentially not begun but 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.460
 the team is running does not look great 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.970
 it is so cool to look fit sing 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.570
 im play all orders are you guys are the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.570
 mentality 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.000
 if the ring format is some kind of fishing line then not 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.580
 I think that there is reason to worry, we 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.740
 I do not really agree with you now! 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.650
 play well but we can play on 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.479
 much better and we have a lot of newbies 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.520
 who need to join the team 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.170
 we all need put a single team and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.380
 now 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.079
 called up boy once for this and need 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.009
 with a big score can be rivals 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:50.700
 need stronger will be more interesting in the market 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:52.250
 , Pollock environment bio Defarge Africa, we do not 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.670
 I guess, that 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.380
 you are right really protection can 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.470
 mislead but today we 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.920
 lucky today we played well tomorrow 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.020
 the game will be completely different i know u 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.780
 they were almost absent 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.940
 composed the first link and not absolutely 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.120
 it is not clear how tomorrow may be 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.120
 match
