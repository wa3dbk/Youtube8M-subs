00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.900
 nan 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.900
 dare 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.369
 It is everyone Hello your Tama of low rampage 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.779
 q We will introduce you to the last Shift Justice Hunter. 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.779
 It is a date Tomarsh monster 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.460
 This shift Mercy monster body is early in the morning 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:35.160
 The part of clear purple tire is clear green 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.780
 This design is exactly the same as Gumpard of the Goshinja Sentai Go-onger. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:44.110
 This is what a motif I think a dog 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.110
 I thought it would be a bit good but maybe I think it's en 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.710
 Seeing this sticker, you 're en until now shift card 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.739
 I can run this 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.739
 Interlocking play with the drive driver makes a great spin 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:07.490
 It is such feeling when arranging shift cards until now 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.320
 What does it mean? If the program starts and it gathers like this 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.479
 At that time of Takeru 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:18.380
 This reminds me of how it works 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.950
 Come on next is a sound gimmick It is three familiar until now 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.250
 Acceleration and special move in tire change shift up 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.730
 Come on it in the First bilingual 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.420
 Exchange is good 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.420
 It is a representative exchange 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.000
 It looks like this now told suffered 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:10.709
 It seems that you will attack wildly , and then accelerate with shift up. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.709
 Go you shift up 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.150
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.840
 Come on last is a special move 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.840
 Oh 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.940
 me 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.210
 So this time open shift car set zero one shift well 4 divisions so 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.440
 Review 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:08.730
 I wonder if it would be a kind of wild attack 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.720
 I really look forward to working in the play 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.129
