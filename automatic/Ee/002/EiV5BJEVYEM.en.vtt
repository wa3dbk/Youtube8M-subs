00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
close to the racetrack gives us just

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.530 
close to the racetrack gives us just
kind<00:01:09.470> of<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.740> safety<00:01:10.430> net<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:10.759> we<00:01:11.119> can<00:01:11.300> see

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
kind of a safety net that we can see

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.420 
kind of a safety net that we can see
these<00:01:11.720> lights<00:01:12.050> flash<00:01:12.410> and<00:01:12.440> lets<00:01:13.100> us<00:01:13.190> know

in other words that would be a yellow
light<00:04:08.919> for<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.280> corner<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:09.940> if<00:04:10.599> we<00:04:10.690> were<00:04:10.750> to

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
light for that corner and if we were to

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.689 
light for that corner and if we were to

touch in this case this light we have a

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.270 
touch in this case this light we have a
full-course<00:04:13.150> yellow<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.690> this<00:04:14.530> sends<00:04:15.069> out<00:04:15.250> a

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
full-course yellow and this sends out a

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.819 
full-course yellow and this sends out a
digital<00:04:15.790> signal<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.479> is<00:04:16.570> encrypted<00:04:17.049> miles

typically a solid yellow and they can

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.379 
typically a solid yellow and they can
easily<00:04:24.010> touch<00:04:24.280> it<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.550> second<00:04:24.880> time<00:04:24.910> for<00:04:25.360> a

flashing red a flashing yellow and the
flashing<00:04:27.760> would<00:04:27.880> emulate<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.449> waving<00:04:28.990> flag

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
flashing would emulate a waving flag

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.279 
flashing would emulate a waving flag
correct<00:04:29.830> it's<00:04:30.099> it's<00:04:30.340> basically<00:04:31.289> doubling

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
correct it's it's basically doubling

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.689 
correct it's it's basically doubling
your<00:04:32.560> attention<00:04:33.070> so<00:04:33.370> when<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.550> red<00:04:33.669> flag

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
your attention so when the red flag

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.969 
your attention so when the red flag
flies<00:04:34.300> or<00:04:34.660> in<00:04:34.720> this<00:04:34.810> case<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.380> red<00:04:35.500> light<00:04:35.680> goes

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
flies or in this case the red light goes

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.029 
flies or in this case the red light goes
on<00:04:36.130> it<00:04:36.699> is<00:04:36.729> immediate<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.620> as<00:04:38.620> some<00:04:38.919> of<00:04:38.949> the
