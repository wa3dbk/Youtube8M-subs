back here let's say I may have R a

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.630 
back here let's say I may have R a
conference<00:00:48.320> with<00:00:48.500> a<00:00:48.560> parent<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:49.160> can<00:00:49.520> go

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
conference with a parent I can go

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.670 
conference with a parent I can go
download<00:00:49.940> reports<00:00:50.570> I<00:00:50.780> could<00:00:51.440> check<00:00:51.650> off

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680
