00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and that was just because we got fed a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.440 
and that was just because we got fed a
lot<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.619> then<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.310> couldn't<00:01:41.610> really<00:01:41.790> contain

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
lot and then I couldn't really contain

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.120 
lot and then I couldn't really contain
myself<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.079> kind<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.470> became<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
myself and it kind of just became a a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.700 
myself and it kind of just became a a
joke<00:01:44.670> almost<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.299> well<00:01:45.810> below<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.350> never

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
stops eating you know and so so then you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.539
