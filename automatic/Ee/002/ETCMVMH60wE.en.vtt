after<00:00:44.420> surgery<00:00:45.199> I<00:00:46.300> invented<00:00:47.300> this<00:00:47.510> with<00:00:48.350> two

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
after surgery I invented this with two

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.790 
after surgery I invented this with two
veterinarians<00:00:49.780> we<00:00:50.780> put<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.020> contour<00:00:51.590> in<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
veterinarians we put a contour in the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.340 
veterinarians we put a contour in the
neck<00:00:51.980> so<00:00:52.609> the<00:00:52.760> animal<00:00:53.180> has<00:00:53.390> some<00:00:53.660> mobility<00:00:53.960> up

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
neck so the animal has some mobility up

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.459 
neck so the animal has some mobility up
and<00:00:54.559> down<00:00:54.710> just<00:00:55.399> not<00:00:55.609> side<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:55.940> side<00:00:56.390> we've<00:00:57.260> got

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
and down just not side to side we've got

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.410 
and down just not side to side we've got
holes<00:00:57.769> for<00:00:58.100> ventilation<00:00:58.129> so<00:00:58.879> their<00:00:59.030> hair<00:00:59.269> and

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
holes for ventilation so their hair and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.020 
holes for ventilation so their hair and
skin<00:00:59.600> can<00:00:59.989> breathe<00:01:00.140> it's<00:01:00.920> made<00:01:01.190> of<00:01:01.309> soft<00:01:01.609> cloth

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
skin can breathe it's made of soft cloth

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.030 
skin can breathe it's made of soft cloth
so<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.600> animal<00:01:03.050> if<00:01:03.500> anything<00:01:03.859> gets

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
so the animal if anything gets

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.490 
so the animal if anything gets
underneath<00:01:04.340> it'll<00:01:04.970> absorb<00:01:05.200> it's<00:01:06.200> got

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
underneath it'll absorb it's got

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.340 
underneath it'll absorb it's got
adjustable<00:01:07.370> velcro<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.120> buckles<00:01:08.690> for<00:01:08.930> extra

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
adjustable velcro and buckles for extra

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.130 
adjustable velcro and buckles for extra
security<00:01:09.670> there's<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.759> harness<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.900> goes

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
security there's a harness that goes

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.690 
security there's a harness that goes
around<00:01:12.320> their<00:01:12.619> belly<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.040> up<00:01:13.159> back<00:01:13.430> around

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
the side up to the top so they can't

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.710 
the side up to the top so they can't
take<00:01:16.100> their<00:01:16.280> back<00:01:16.460> paws<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:17.000> kick<00:01:17.180> it<00:01:17.299> up<00:01:17.390> over

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
cone and was up all night long so I had

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.490 
cone and was up all night long so I had
decided<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.450> there<00:01:47.810> should<00:01:47.840> be<00:01:48.200> maybe

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
decided that there should be maybe

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.260 
decided that there should be maybe
another<00:01:48.860> alternative<00:01:49.460> out<00:01:49.610> there<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:50.090> this

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
another alternative out there to this

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.899 
another alternative out there to this
cone<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.350> that's<00:01:52.009> how<00:01:52.189> we<00:01:52.250> came<00:01:52.460> up<00:01:52.640> with<00:01:52.820> the

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
cone and that's how we came up with the

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.390 
cone and that's how we came up with the
stop<00:01:53.149> bite<00:01:53.360> collar

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400
