00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:14.160
 So I 'm going back to another video and I 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.180
 I'm taking the mold in doing these 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.949
 parts here in resin is freddy 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.100
 krueger the base of it an arm and here it is 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.689
 by hand with claws 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.489
 so I did what mine here 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.940
 ours can see a scheme that is easy 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.899
 to make and use clamp where this clamp is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.800
 question staple of carpenter and ne 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.489
 I'm not done four ways in l with 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.520
 a flag here to be able to be 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.129
 in that other part and is adjustable to 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.579
 my base here 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.129
 She's 53 by 53 and the height is from here. 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.079
 with 20 centimeters 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.689
 so it was a little trick that neither is 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.880
 This one I'm taking out is even with the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.880
 suffocation so you can see from the sides 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.179
 That your mother does not fit here right? 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.499
 but to get a big piece is a 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:18.719
 wonderful 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:23.189
 I will not be worried about the dog. 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:26.340
 I do not know how to do this. 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.679
 I even had a lot of trouble with a do 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.499
 a mold with a back with box 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.909
 cardboard a silicone leak leg 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:38.189
 of material 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.709
 I think it's cool that me here until there is no 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.859
 youtube is one in a video with one 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:48.929
 American who did not take mole with a 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:50.429
 model of this one only that it was smaller 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.389
 lower 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:57.270
 I ended up choosing to make it bigger here. 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:02:02.039
 make big right pieces then you have this 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.329
 base here all and 53 centimeters where only 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:09.019
 to set you right now in the 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:12.239
 mold can stay up to this size here 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.940
 and here's a helping hand from the Fed's house 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.319
 rime 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.569
 already forbidden 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.170
 I'm just going to have to release the game. 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.670
 silicone to make the underside of the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.989
 Okay, okay, and then bet on 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.890
 video and with other pieces already in 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:38.780
 in this bed made here in bulk and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:44.099
 using this ball after a nice kick here 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.860
 Mayor, this is his bed at Angle 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:56.670
 in acr and this belief that I used for the hand 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:03:02.940
 here is a designer with hardness 10 in 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:06.049
 10 call while you move it 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.739
 It gets soft but now those eca 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:14.640
 let it in the air it gets hard so it's good 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.970
 to pull pieces are very fine pig 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:23.030
 I tried to make a hand here in the 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:27.209
 normal club on aal soft on radio and 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.880
 they all broke the gaza 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.230
 It's the pressure, I'll do it later, I'll go 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.230
 show how it will look
