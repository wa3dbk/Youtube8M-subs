why I seem to see most post about people
actually<00:00:15.000> playing<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:16.260> turned<00:00:16.500> into<00:00:16.680> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
actually playing this turned into a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.710 
actually playing this turned into a
slightly<00:00:17.070> scary<00:00:17.609> journey<00:00:18.029> though<00:00:18.359> not

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
slightly scary journey though not

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.330 
slightly scary journey though not
necessarily<00:00:18.840> because<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.650> interdictions<00:00:20.189> or

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
necessarily because of interdictions or

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.189 
necessarily because of interdictions or
player<00:00:20.520> issues<00:00:21.000> but<00:00:21.210> because<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.689> chose<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
player issues but because I chose the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.529 
player issues but because I chose the
fastest<00:00:22.859> route<00:00:23.100> not<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> most<00:00:23.609> economical<00:00:24.330> in

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
fastest route not the most economical in

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.290 
fastest route not the most economical in
my<00:00:25.230> Viper<00:00:25.769> which<00:00:26.160> doesn't<00:00:26.550> historically<00:00:27.029> have

some help with a couple of you know org
mates<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.520> playing<00:00:35.640> with<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.800> you

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
mates that I was playing with and you

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
mates that I was playing with and you
know<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:37.920> making<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.879> careful<00:00:39.270> choice<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
know just making a careful choice and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.330 
know just making a careful choice and
kind<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.140> risky<00:00:40.440> gamble<00:00:40.680> at<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> end<00:00:41.250> I

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
kind of a risky gamble at the end I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.940 
kind of a risky gamble at the end I
ended<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.640> surviving<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.829> certainly<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
ended up surviving it but certainly a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.990 
ended up surviving it but certainly a
journey<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.850> puckered<00:00:45.059> me<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.469> so<00:00:46.550> I<00:00:47.550> guess<00:00:47.910> I

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
journey that puckered me up so I guess I

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.430 
journey that puckered me up so I guess I
wanted<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> put<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.480> out<00:00:48.629> there<00:00:48.660> kind<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
wanted to put this out there kind of is

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
wanted to put this out there kind of is
a<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:50.070> word<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.760> caution<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.420> learn<00:00:51.600> from<00:00:51.870> my

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
a a word of caution and to learn from my

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.650 
a a word of caution and to learn from my
almost<00:00:52.379> big<00:00:52.620> mistake<00:00:53.149> if<00:00:54.149> you're<00:00:54.329> starting<00:00:54.510> to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
almost big mistake if you're starting to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.810 
almost big mistake if you're starting to
get<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.840> trouble<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.199> you're<00:00:55.379> scooping<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
get in trouble if you're scooping or you

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.639 
get in trouble if you're scooping or you

have these sorts of issues I would

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.900 
have these sorts of issues I would
probably<00:00:59.100> consider<00:00:59.250> choosing<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
probably consider choosing the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.250 
probably consider choosing the
economical<00:01:00.480> route<00:01:00.629> even<00:01:00.960> though<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.140> may<00:01:01.230> not

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
economical route even though it may not

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.799 
economical route even though it may not
be<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.649> fastest<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.550> hope<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.329> guys<00:01:03.480> enjoy

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
you can kind of guess what kind of start

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.170 
you can kind of guess what kind of start
is<00:02:52.860> FB<00:02:53.850> dash<00:02:54.180> X<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.769> space<00:02:55.769> one<00:02:56.220> destined<00:02:59.180> it
