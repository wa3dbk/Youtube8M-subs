00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
me and the red-tailed catfish I managed

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.219 
me and the red-tailed catfish I managed
to<00:01:37.909> catch<00:01:38.090> him<00:01:38.299> a<00:01:38.360> little<00:01:38.600> bit<00:01:38.720> because<00:01:38.869> quite

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
to catch him a little bit because quite

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.109 
to catch him a little bit because quite
shy<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.799> war<00:01:39.950> loggers<00:01:40.310> were<00:01:40.430> too<00:01:40.640> full<00:01:40.909> so

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
shy and the war loggers were too full so

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.330 
shy and the war loggers were too full so
they<00:01:41.210> just<00:01:41.360> didn't<00:01:41.600> want<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.780> eat<00:01:41.960> but<00:01:42.229> I

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
they just didn't want to eat but I

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.889 
they just didn't want to eat but I
thinking<00:01:43.340> perhaps<00:01:43.880> catch<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.420> war<00:01:44.570> loggers

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
thinking perhaps catch the war loggers

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.450 
thinking perhaps catch the war loggers
in<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.110> next<00:01:45.470> clip<00:01:45.770> because<00:01:46.009> then<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.310> can

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
in the next clip because then you can

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:55.540 
in the next clip because then you can

massive fish I'm not quite ready for the
pond<00:02:11.340> yet<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:12.150> I'm<00:02:12.420> predicting<00:02:13.340> maybe<00:02:14.340> 6<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:15.030> 6

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
the camera in and just leave it there so

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.380 
the camera in and just leave it there so
that<00:03:09.890> they<00:03:10.130> would<00:03:10.280> be<00:03:10.310> scared<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.240> won't

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
that they would be scared and it won't

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.690 
that they would be scared and it won't
be<00:03:11.540> spooked<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.170> they<00:03:12.320> still<00:03:12.560> eat<00:03:12.830> we<00:03:13.430> managed

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
be spooked so they still eat we managed

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.880

really<00:03:27.470> get<00:03:27.770> the<00:03:27.950> are<00:03:28.070> many<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.490> the<00:03:28.580> other

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
really get the are many of the other

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.560 
really get the are many of the other
fish<00:03:29.000> like<00:03:29.210> that

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
fish like that

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.750 
fish like that
ready<00:03:29.840> l<00:03:30.050> cannot<00:03:30.350> imagine<00:03:30.710> Kenan<00:03:31.100> wants<00:03:31.550> and

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
ready l cannot imagine Kenan wants and

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.610 
ready l cannot imagine Kenan wants and
their<00:03:31.940> cars<00:03:32.210> and<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.540> want<00:03:32.810> because<00:03:33.470> the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
their cars and you want because the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.190 
their cars and you want because the
lighting<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:34.010> not<00:03:34.250> great<00:03:34.550> but<00:03:34.910> my<00:03:35.540> new<00:03:35.870> pond

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
lighting is not great but my new pond

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.720 
lighting is not great but my new pond
there's<00:03:36.590> definitely<00:03:37.160> something<00:03:37.460> to<00:03:37.490> consider

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
there's definitely something to consider

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.730 
there's definitely something to consider
because<00:03:38.150> I'm<00:03:38.330> really<00:03:38.720> gonna<00:03:38.840> enhance<00:03:39.320> the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
because I'm really gonna enhance the

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.980 
because I'm really gonna enhance the
night<00:03:40.400> lighting<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.120> new<00:03:41.300> pond<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:41.870> that

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
night lighting of the new pond so that

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.750 
night lighting of the new pond so that
when<00:03:42.110> I<00:03:42.140> capture<00:03:42.620> footage<00:03:42.860> it'll<00:03:43.340> be<00:03:43.460> amazing

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
when I capture footage it'll be amazing

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.070 
when I capture footage it'll be amazing
I'll<00:03:44.120> probably<00:03:44.300> be<00:03:44.480> able<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.690> get<00:03:44.900> like

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
I'll probably be able to get like

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.200 
I'll probably be able to get like
distant<00:03:45.800> shots<00:03:46.040> not<00:03:46.280> just<00:03:46.520> close-ups<00:03:47.000> like

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
distant shots not just close-ups like

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.000 
distant shots not just close-ups like
this<00:03:47.390> you<00:03:47.960> can<00:03:48.110> see<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.410> red<00:03:48.560> tail<00:03:48.770> can

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
this you can see the red tail can

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.560 
this you can see the red tail can
traveling<00:03:49.430> down<00:03:49.550> a<00:03:49.580> bit<00:03:49.880> but<00:03:50.120> he's<00:03:50.240> a<00:03:50.330> little

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
traveling down a bit but he's a little

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.080 
traveling down a bit but he's a little
bit<00:03:50.660> shy<00:03:50.990> Dominika<00:03:51.980> sees<00:03:52.250> time<00:03:52.580> right<00:03:52.790> kind<00:03:53.030> of

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
bit shy Dominika sees time right kind of

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.690 
bit shy Dominika sees time right kind of
dashes<00:03:53.510> off<00:03:53.690> plus<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:54.920> only<00:03:55.130> managed<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.520> put

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
dashes off plus I only managed to put

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.970 
dashes off plus I only managed to put
the<00:03:55.790> camera<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.270> the<00:03:56.420> light<00:03:56.630> and<00:03:57.410> as<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.800> know

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
the camera in the light and as you know

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.310 
the camera in the light and as you know
a<00:03:58.010> lot<00:03:58.280> of<00:03:58.310> my<00:03:58.490> fish<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:58.880> actually<00:03:59.000> nocturnal<00:03:59.840> so

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
a lot of my fish I actually nocturnal so

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.960 
a lot of my fish I actually nocturnal so
they<00:04:00.860> don't<00:04:01.040> actually<00:04:01.160> like<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.670> light<00:04:01.820> at

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
they don't actually like the light at

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.660 
they don't actually like the light at
all<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.620> that's<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.800> problem<00:04:04.040> because<00:04:04.459> when

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
all so that's the problem because when

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.130 
all so that's the problem because when
the<00:04:04.760> cameras<00:04:05.150> in<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.360> dog<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:05.720> can't<00:04:05.930> see

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
the cameras in the dog you can't see

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.390 
the cameras in the dog you can't see
anything<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.680> when<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:06.860> cameras<00:04:07.190> in<00:04:07.310> the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
anything and when the cameras in the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.130 
anything and when the cameras in the
light<00:04:07.610> most<00:04:08.000> of<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.270> fish<00:04:08.480> other<00:04:08.780> than<00:04:08.989> that

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
light most of the fish other than that

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.470 
light most of the fish other than that
our<00:04:09.170> Palmer<00:04:09.560> run<00:04:09.920> away<00:04:10.130> from<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.550> so<00:04:10.730> that's<00:04:11.390> a

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
our Palmer run away from it so that's a

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.000 
our Palmer run away from it so that's a
little<00:04:11.630> bit<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.020> conundrum<00:04:12.680> that<00:04:12.709> way<00:04:12.950> and

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
little bit of the conundrum that way and

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.280 
little bit of the conundrum that way and
now<00:04:13.280> but<00:04:13.580> that<00:04:14.000> should<00:04:14.180> be<00:04:14.209> fixed<00:04:14.630> my<00:04:14.810> new<00:04:14.989> pod

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
now but that should be fixed my new pod

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.590 
now but that should be fixed my new pod
cuz<00:04:15.500> I'm<00:04:15.620> I'm<00:04:15.800> taking<00:04:16.010> all<00:04:16.340> these<00:04:16.459> ideas<00:04:17.330> and

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
cuz I'm I'm taking all these ideas and

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.060 
cuz I'm I'm taking all these ideas and
then<00:04:17.780> just<00:04:17.959> like<00:04:18.109> you<00:04:18.230> know<00:04:18.320> implementing<00:04:18.980> a

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
then just like you know implementing a

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.729 
then just like you know implementing a
new<00:04:19.220> system<00:04:19.250> of<00:04:19.910> how<00:04:20.359> I<00:04:20.390> could<00:04:20.720> fill<00:04:21.109> my<00:04:21.410> fish

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
new system of how I could fill my fish

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.890 
new system of how I could fill my fish
and<00:04:22.070> how<00:04:22.220> do<00:04:22.280> they<00:04:22.520> function

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.690 

and<00:04:28.900> as<00:04:29.110> for<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.440> new<00:04:29.620> pond<00:04:30.010> I've<00:04:30.280> gone<00:04:30.550> to

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
and as for the new pond I've gone to

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.970 
and as for the new pond I've gone to
visit<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.090> land<00:04:31.270> once<00:04:31.600> and<00:04:32.110> of<00:04:32.350> them<00:04:32.650> really

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
visit the land once and of them really

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.310 
visit the land once and of them really
