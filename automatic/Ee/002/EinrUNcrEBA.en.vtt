00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
ideal for a bomb thrower but bombs are

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.620 
ideal for a bomb thrower but bombs are
flexible<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.020> themselves<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.329> that<00:01:51.329> makes

so<00:04:11.700> why<00:04:11.940> do<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.150> own<00:04:12.420> cannon<00:04:12.780> well<00:04:13.079> it's<00:04:13.290> easy<00:04:13.530> to

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
so why do I own cannon well it's easy to

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.530 
so why do I own cannon well it's easy to
use<00:04:13.950> proximity<00:04:14.549> mines<00:04:14.730> on<00:04:14.910> higher<00:04:15.090> pilot

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
use proximity mines on higher pilot

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.599 
use proximity mines on higher pilot
skills<00:04:15.780> since<00:04:15.989> they<00:04:16.140> haven't<00:04:16.440> moved<00:04:16.620> yet<00:04:16.919> you

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
skills since they haven't moved yet you

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.430 
skills since they haven't moved yet you
can<00:04:17.760> drop<00:04:17.940> them<00:04:18.090> on<00:04:18.359> them<00:04:18.630> or<00:04:18.810> on<00:04:19.049> their<00:04:19.229> lap

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
can drop them on them or on their lap

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.219 
can drop them on them or on their lap
but<00:04:19.950> lower<00:04:20.160> pilot<00:04:20.609> skills<00:04:20.880> will<00:04:21.120> be<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:22.109> know

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
but lower pilot skills will be you know

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.589 
but lower pilot skills will be you know
will<00:04:22.530> be<00:04:22.620> quite<00:04:22.919> hard<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:23.520> this<00:04:24.180> allows<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.570> to

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
will be quite hard so this allows you to

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.390 
will be quite hard so this allows you to
control<00:04:24.930> them<00:04:25.200> for<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.470> next<00:04:25.680> turn<00:04:26.039> shoot

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
control them for the next turn shoot

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.620 
control them for the next turn shoot
them<00:04:26.520> with<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.640> ion<00:04:26.940> cannon<00:04:27.270> then

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
them with the ion cannon then

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.900 
them with the ion cannon then
dictate<00:04:27.930> where<00:04:28.320> they<00:04:28.740> go<00:04:29.250> so<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.580> can<00:04:29.730> drop

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
dictate where they go so you can drop

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.320 
dictate where they go so you can drop
bombs<00:04:30.150> on<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.570> next<00:04:30.990> turn<00:04:31.790> quite<00:04:32.790> handy<00:04:33.210> so

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
bombs on the next turn quite handy so

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.020 
bombs on the next turn quite handy so

so<00:04:56.400> far<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:56.850> pretty<00:04:57.120> done<00:04:57.540> it's<00:04:57.990> a<00:04:58.140> lot<00:04:58.320> of<00:04:58.350> fun

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
so far is pretty done it's a lot of fun

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.410 
so far is pretty done it's a lot of fun
to<00:04:58.800> fly<00:04:59.070> and<00:04:59.280> you'll<00:04:59.400> have<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.640> blast<00:04:59.850> trying<00:05:00.330> to

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
to fly and you'll have a blast trying to

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.770

where and how to drop your bombs in

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.340 
where and how to drop your bombs in
creative<00:05:05.580> places<00:05:06.150> you'll<00:05:06.690> have<00:05:06.900> three<00:05:07.200> of

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
creative places you'll have three of

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.620 
creative places you'll have three of
them<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:07.800> you'll<00:05:08.190> be<00:05:08.310> using<00:05:08.460> them<00:05:08.670> a<00:05:08.730> lot<00:05:08.760> it

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
them and you'll be using them a lot it

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.120 
them and you'll be using them a lot it
allows<00:05:09.900> you<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.140> dictate<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.620> feel<00:05:10.860> through

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
allows you to dictate the feel through

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.040 
allows you to dictate the feel through
bomb<00:05:11.430> placement<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.570> ion<00:05:12.840> cannon

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
bomb placement and the ion cannon

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.250 
bomb placement and the ion cannon
because<00:05:13.830> you<00:05:14.220> get<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.520> drop<00:05:14.700> bombs<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.260> shoot

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
because you get to drop bombs and shoot

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.870 
because you get to drop bombs and shoot
in<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.680> same<00:05:16.890> term<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.400> you<00:05:17.460> get<00:05:17.610> to<00:05:17.700> shoot

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
in the same term and you get to shoot

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.550 
in the same term and you get to shoot
out<00:05:18.030> of<00:05:18.060> your<00:05:18.270> front<00:05:18.540> Ark<00:05:18.900> and<00:05:19.140> out<00:05:19.290> of<00:05:19.410> your

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
out of your front Ark and out of your

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.900 
out of your front Ark and out of your
rear<00:05:19.800> Ark<00:05:20.070> so<00:05:20.280> there's<00:05:20.460> a<00:05:20.550> lot<00:05:20.790> of

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
rear Ark so there's a lot of

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.750 
rear Ark so there's a lot of
possibilities<00:05:21.510> for<00:05:21.540> doing<00:05:21.900> damage<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.760> comes

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
possibilities for doing damage it comes

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.730 
possibilities for doing damage it comes

let's<00:05:38.190> theorize<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.850> bit<00:05:39.180> let<00:05:39.780> me<00:05:39.870> know<00:05:39.960> what

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
let's theorize a bit let me know what

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.780 
let's theorize a bit let me know what
you<00:05:40.170> think<00:05:40.350> about<00:05:40.620> this<00:05:40.740> in<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:40.950> comments<00:05:41.370> so

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
you think about this in the comments so

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.390 
you think about this in the comments so
let's<00:05:42.030> add<00:05:43.730> experimental<00:05:44.730> interface<00:05:46.400> coming

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
let's add experimental interface coming

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.270 
let's add experimental interface coming
in<00:05:47.550> at<00:05:47.760> three<00:05:48.240> points<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:48.750> it<00:05:48.870> reads<00:05:49.140> once<00:05:50.040> per

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
in at three points and it reads once per

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.980 
in at three points and it reads once per
round<00:05:50.460> after<00:05:51.060> you<00:05:51.120> perform<00:05:51.270> an<00:05:51.570> action<00:05:51.780> you

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
round after you perform an action you

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.260 
round after you perform an action you
may<00:05:52.260> perform<00:05:52.680> one<00:05:53.010> free<00:05:53.370> action<00:05:53.820> from<00:05:54.150> an

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
may perform one free action from an

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.990 
may perform one free action from an
equipped<00:05:54.890> upgrade<00:05:55.890> card<00:05:56.190> with<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.520> action

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
equipped upgrade card with the action

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.050 
equipped upgrade card with the action
header<00:05:57.210> then<00:05:57.660> receive<00:05:58.080> one<00:05:58.530> stress<00:05:58.980> token<00:05:59.340> so

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
header then receive one stress token so

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.670 
header then receive one stress token so
since<00:06:00.270> all<00:06:00.390> of<00:06:00.450> our<00:06:00.630> bombs<00:06:00.900> have<00:06:01.140> just<00:06:01.440> that

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
since all of our bombs have just that

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.780 
since all of our bombs have just that
upgrade<00:06:02.610> cards<00:06:02.910> with<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.540> action<00:06:04.230> header<00:06:04.790> we

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
upgrade cards with the action header we

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.030 
upgrade cards with the action header we
get<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.060> do<00:06:06.180> actions<00:06:06.690> like<00:06:06.900> focus<00:06:07.380> evade<00:06:07.770> and

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
get to do actions like focus evade and

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.550 
get to do actions like focus evade and
target<00:06:08.370> locks<00:06:08.580> and<00:06:08.760> still<00:06:09.000> drop<00:06:09.270> bombs<00:06:09.660> for

target locks and still drop bombs for

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.760 
target locks and still drop bombs for
stress<00:06:10.860> pretty<00:06:11.670> good<00:06:11.850> right<00:06:12.350> this<00:06:13.350> helps<00:06:13.680> a

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
stress pretty good right this helps a

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.800 
stress pretty good right this helps a
lot<00:06:13.950> and<00:06:14.190> should<00:06:14.430> make<00:06:14.640> the<00:06:14.760> Andraste<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.330> lot

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.680 
lot and should make the Andraste a lot

right why not get some something out of
it<00:06:37.110> when<00:06:37.320> we<00:06:37.350> were<00:06:37.590> leaving<00:06:37.950> that<00:06:37.980> stress<00:06:38.370> like

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
it when we were leaving that stress like

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.730 
it when we were leaving that stress like
a<00:06:38.790> free<00:06:39.030> target<00:06:39.450> lock<00:06:39.600> freeing<00:06:40.200> up<00:06:40.320> that<00:06:40.500> part

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
a free target lock freeing up that part

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.730 
a free target lock freeing up that part
to<00:06:40.860> take<00:06:40.980> focus<00:06:41.400> or<00:06:41.550> evade<00:06:41.880> so<00:06:42.870> all<00:06:43.200> in<00:06:43.620> all

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740
