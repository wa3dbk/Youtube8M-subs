00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:05.710
 hi how are you I hope you are very very 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.360
 well today I have something 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.120
 quite different from what I normally 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.889
 They raise the channel and I hope you like it 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.230
 very much the truth is that this kind of 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.720
 videos I love watching it on other channels 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.490
 because they seem super useful to me so 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.220
 I said why do not I also do it in the 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.680
 me if I like it so much pull 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.510
 a personal opinion and what to me 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.670
 it works could it be that you do not or 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.250
 vice versa but I think of all 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.379
 ways this type of videos is very very 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.570
 useful so I hope you like it 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.219
 very much and we will start and good the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.159
 product of which I want to make you this 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:42.039
 review is of this make-up remover 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.499
 no idea as you know they can 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.329
 find super easily in any 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:48.940
 supermarket and it's also a very price 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.420
 accessible with a description says that 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.329
 It is eye make-up remover for the area 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.309
 sensitive and that will remove products 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.190
 which are waterproof in a way 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.989
 easy 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.250
 so let's go oh well this is 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.829
 maquillan t obviously have already used 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.299
 several times but before giving them my 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.759
 I want you to see it with 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.970
 his own eyes here I have some 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.350
 eye products this is a pencil a 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.270
 mask for eyelashes 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.979
 this is a shadow in cream and a 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.960
 liquid eyeliner so all this what 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.790
 let's apply in the hand let's 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.790
 start with the mask for eyelashes 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:34.280
 here 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:37.900
 and now this pencil for eyes this shadow 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 in cream that I like a lot 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.280
 I am a beautiful color 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.080
 and finally this eyeliner 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.100
 let's let it dry a little while 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.860
 and now we are going to try to remove 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.170
 obviously I will try to do it 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.270
 a delicate way because it is for the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.490
 area of â€‹â€‹the eyes then I will take out 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.459
 as I usually do in my eyes without 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.459
 make a lot of pressure or stretch it a lot 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.720
 I remove almost all the mascara and 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.720
 is that 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.770
 Y 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.099
 Y 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.430
 ah 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.430
 ah 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.860
 with a few things and that 's how it is and 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.630
 well you see the cotton quoted ok now it goes my 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.910
 also personal opinion if 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.060
 we would buy again the truth is that 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.850
 no and well the question is because despite 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.700
 that can be achieved very easily 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.640
 has a good price works well for me in 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.520
 the personal irritates me very much the eyes 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.860
 I am not a person with a very skin 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.330
 sensitive indeed the truth is that it is the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.250
 first of the makeup that to me 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.769
 irritates despite that in the description 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.550
 says it's for the delicate area of â€‹â€‹the 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.130
 eyes to me personally puts me super 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.050
 red all the eyelid and it itches if 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.730
 we are going to two before this is 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.130
 they make up and they had the same reaction 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.500
 that I or a completely different one 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.870
 would love to be told in the part 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.000
 of the comments and if this video 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.220
 liked it or found it useful I would appreciate 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.500
 very much that they gave me 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.660
 up if the channel has not been subscribed 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.910
 I invite you to do so and before 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.150
 I want to show you a dressing that I 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.670
 villalta Evin sent a t - shirt 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.100
 he did his son and I already told him 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.930
 super pretty and was inspired by the video 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.910
 gone so if they have not seen it 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.130

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.830
 description and also the recommendation to 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.260
