00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:57.010 

you're<00:01:45.570> thinking<00:01:45.660> gain<00:01:45.990> access<00:01:46.200> from<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.650> top

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.400 

by<00:01:59.690> other<00:02:00.690> animals<00:02:02.120> you<00:02:03.120> want<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.510> draw<00:02:04.350> the

by other animals you want to draw the
spiking

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
spiking

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
spiking
at<00:02:06.790> least<00:02:07.060> one<00:02:07.360> if<00:02:07.540> not<00:02:07.570> two<00:02:07.780> into<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.680> front

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.120 
at least one if not two into the front

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.120 
at least one if not two into the front
so<00:02:10.120> you<00:02:10.210> don't<00:02:10.390> catch<00:02:10.630> any<00:02:11.130> non-target

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
so you don't catch any non-target

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.370 
so you don't catch any non-target
species<00:02:12.430> like<00:02:13.090> hedgehogs<00:02:17.010> gardener's<00:02:18.010> friend
