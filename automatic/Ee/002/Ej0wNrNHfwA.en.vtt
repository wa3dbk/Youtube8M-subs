00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.979
 why I think that for all the circuits of the team a little bit begins to see we are going to 

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:29.979
 see the future and for the bread 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.900
 well the first thing you have to keep in mind 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.630
 is the area where they are going to do it 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.410
 the attention of will make this comfortable for you 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.610
 it can be the same 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.610
 for all the sand 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.410
 It is very important that you take into account the distance of the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.120
 up to the wall 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.530
 as if 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.660
 is very close to the time to catch can be pasted on the wall 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.660
 and cause an accident 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.210
 here the key in him 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.450
 the movement of renewal 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.450
 is high 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.640
 innovations 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.070
 which can also have accidents 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.649
 citi points towards the wall 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.260
 and not up 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.800
 I could keep in mind that this one towards them 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.780
 the legislators 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.780
 the feet 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.610
 manolo santana 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.440
 must be done 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.439
 this movement 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.990
 also keep in mind 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.390
 that the country chin 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.000
 into 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.990
 reaches the knees to the chest 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.990
 head 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.050
 another thing is the race 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.110
 I usually weight curien 2 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.909
 and a lot 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.870
 they do stop 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.860
 the season you have to be 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.680
 firmer on the ground 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.450
 press themes 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.890
 so that you have more strength instead if you do it running you have more 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.899
 possibilities 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:15.069
 pickets as fast 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.839
 well need both 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.889
 So I'm going to give you a demonstration of the clip of unemployed bread and 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.279
 paper 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.060
 it's worth nothing 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.519
 remember that we must take into account the reality of the population 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.619
 closer to 10 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.619
 Air Force 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.430
 to follow the example I hope you have served 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.200
 but the step
