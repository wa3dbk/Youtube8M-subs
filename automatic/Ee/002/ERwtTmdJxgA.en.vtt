out the Osmo learning system today this
is<00:00:12.900> something<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.200> bought<00:00:13.410> through<00:00:13.679> a

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
is something I bought through a

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.259 
is something I bought through a
crowdfunding<00:00:14.429> thing<00:00:14.610> on<00:00:14.730> their<00:00:14.880> website<00:00:15.240> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
crowdfunding thing on their website a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.580 
crowdfunding thing on their website a
few<00:00:15.480> months<00:00:15.660> ago<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:15.990> finally<00:00:16.170> showed<00:00:16.560> up

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
few months ago and it finally showed up

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.470 
few months ago and it finally showed up
and<00:00:16.949> what's<00:00:17.369> cool<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.359> it

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
and what's cool about this is that it

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.050 
and what's cool about this is that it
combines<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.140> best<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.500> screen<00:00:19.980> time<00:00:20.310> with

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
combines the best of screen time with

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.029 
combines the best of screen time with
physical<00:00:21.539> objects<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.500> an<00:00:22.619> app<00:00:22.769> that

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
physical objects so you have an app that

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.279 
physical objects so you have an app that
runs<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.430> your<00:00:23.670> iPad<00:00:24.090> but<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.630> can<00:00:24.930> detect

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
runs on your iPad but it can detect

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.109 
runs on your iPad but it can detect
little<00:00:25.650> shapes<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.160> letters<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.910> comes

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
little shapes and letters that it comes

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.910 
little shapes and letters that it comes
with<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.990> put<00:00:28.199> down<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.529> front<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
with that you put down in front of the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.950 
with that you put down in front of the
iPad<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.699> will<00:00:29.789> actually<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.720> those

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
iPad and it will actually have those

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
iPad and it will actually have those
things<00:00:31.199> appear<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> screen<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.460> kind

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
things appear on the screen so you kind

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.700 
things appear on the screen so you kind
of<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.510> best<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> both<00:00:34.050> worlds<00:00:34.500> where<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
of get the best of both worlds where you

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.290 
of get the best of both worlds where you
get<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.980> immediate<00:00:35.219> feedback<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.850> an<00:00:36.120> app

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
get that immediate feedback of an app

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.209 
get that immediate feedback of an app
but<00:00:36.989> you're<00:00:37.110> actually<00:00:37.260> manipulating<00:00:38.010> real

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
but you're actually manipulating real

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.040 
but you're actually manipulating real
physical<00:00:38.760> objects<00:00:39.239> which<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.510> pretty<00:00:39.719> cool<00:00:39.989> so

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
physical objects which is pretty cool so

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
physical objects which is pretty cool so
let's<00:00:40.350> see<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:40.890> about<00:00:40.920> you've

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
let's see what this is all about you've

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.100 
let's see what this is all about you've
got<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:42.090> bass<00:00:42.239> stand<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.960> will

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
got a little bass stand here that will

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.470 
got a little bass stand here that will
take<00:00:43.260> any<00:00:43.530> iPad<00:00:44.070> 2<00:00:44.370> or<00:00:44.550> above<00:00:44.579> basically<00:00:45.360> if

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
take any iPad 2 or above basically if

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.060 
take any iPad 2 or above basically if
your<00:00:45.600> iPad<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> front-facing<00:00:46.500> camera

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
your iPad is a front-facing camera

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.619 
your iPad is a front-facing camera
you're<00:00:47.520> good<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> go<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> little

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629

mirror here that you put on the top and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.850 
mirror here that you put on the top and
then<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.390> boot<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.079> load<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
then you boot it up and load one of the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.650 
then you boot it up and load one of the
apps<00:00:53.100> now<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> first<00:00:53.879> app<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> actually<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
apps now the first app is actually the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.939 
apps now the first app is actually the
coolest<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.289> they<00:00:55.379> include<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
coolest one that they include in the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.069 
coolest one that they include in the
package<00:00:56.340> called<00:00:56.550> Newton<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.960> is

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
package called Newton and here it is

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.510 
package called Newton and here it is
running<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.829> doesn't<00:00:59.190> use<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
running right now it doesn't use the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.459 
running right now it doesn't use the
shapes<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.910> come<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:01.140> you're

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
shapes that come with it because you're

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.810 
shapes that come with it because you're
going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> make<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:02.010> own<00:01:02.190> shape<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.699> what

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
going to make your own shape so what

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.070 
going to make your own shape so what
we've<00:01:02.940> got<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> little<00:01:03.719> ball<00:01:04.049> that's

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
we've got here is a little ball that's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.469 
we've got here is a little ball that's
falling<00:01:04.680> from<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.489> top<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> screen<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
falling from the top of the screen and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.359 
falling from the top of the screen and
whatever<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.900> put<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.350> front<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> iPad<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
whatever I put in front of the iPad it

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.429 
whatever I put in front of the iPad it
will<00:01:08.520> pretty<00:01:09.240> much<00:01:09.420> put<00:01:09.689> into<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
will pretty much put into here and the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.020 
will pretty much put into here and the
balls<00:01:10.680> will<00:01:10.920> interact<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> lines<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
balls will interact with the lines is

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.310 
balls will interact with the lines is
you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.210> see<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> balls<00:01:12.659> now<00:01:12.810> are<00:01:12.930> bouncing

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
you can see the balls now are bouncing

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.840 
you can see the balls now are bouncing
off<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.590> top<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> remote<00:01:14.189> control<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.700> I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
off the top of the remote control that I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
off the top of the remote control that I
put<00:01:15.060> down<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:15.930> recommend<00:01:16.140> using<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
put down now I do recommend using a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.260 
put down now I do recommend using a
blank<00:01:17.070> piece<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.310> paper<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.119> this

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
blank piece of paper when you do this

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.660 
blank piece of paper when you do this
because<00:01:18.720> things<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:19.619> wood<00:01:19.860> grain<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.310> marble

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
because things like wood grain or marble

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.190 
because things like wood grain or marble
countertops<00:01:21.180> will<00:01:21.390> throw<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> off<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.080> does

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
countertops will throw it off so does

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.780 
countertops will throw it off so does
the<00:01:22.380> blank<00:01:22.860> piece<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.100> paper<00:01:23.250> should<00:01:23.640> work

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the blank piece of paper should work

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.999 
the blank piece of paper should work
pretty<00:01:24.030> well<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.780> what<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
pretty well here and what we can do is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.230 
pretty well here and what we can do is
and<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.430> looks<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.790> inadvertently

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and we looks like we inadvertently

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
and we looks like we inadvertently
passed<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.110> test<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.530> already

can move my paper around as you can see
and<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.100> moving<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> line<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.000> go<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and it's moving the line as we go it's a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.660 
and it's moving the line as we go it's a
pretty<00:01:46.049> cool<00:01:46.350> way<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.979> kind<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.640> know

things physically on a piece of paper
and<00:01:52.380> things<00:01:53.070> are<00:01:53.189> happening<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.880> see

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and things are happening as you can see

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.760 
and things are happening as you can see
I<00:01:54.030> trap<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:54.780> ball<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.619> well

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
I trap that one ball in there as well

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
I trap that one ball in there as well
and<00:01:56.040> again<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.670> put<00:01:56.820> down<00:01:56.969> physical

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and again you can put down physical

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.880 
and again you can put down physical
objects<00:01:57.780> also<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:58.469> those<00:01:58.649> might<00:01:58.860> have

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
objects also and see if those might have

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.770 
objects also and see if those might have
some<00:01:59.280> kind<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.549> impact<00:01:59.700> on<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.270> now<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> next

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
some kind of impact on it now the next

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.969 
some kind of impact on it now the next
game<00:02:00.869> we're<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.140> check<00:02:01.320> out<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.680> called

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
game we're going to check out is called

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.649 
game we're going to check out is called
words<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.640> they<00:02:02.700> give<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.090> box<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
words and they give you this box of

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.200 
words and they give you this box of
letter<00:02:04.079> tiles<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.100> well<00:02:05.219> these<00:02:05.850> will

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
letter tiles in here as well these will

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.880 
letter tiles in here as well these will
get<00:02:06.540> lost<00:02:06.960> these<00:02:07.259> are<00:02:07.409> all<00:02:07.560> over<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.860> place

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
get lost these are all over the place

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.520 
get lost these are all over the place
already<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.209> not<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:09.509> duplicates<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.259> if

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
already you do not get duplicates so if

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.260 
already you do not get duplicates so if
you<00:02:10.679> lose<00:02:10.920> them<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.160> are<00:02:11.400> out<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> luck<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
you lose them you are out of luck but it

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.970 
you lose them you are out of luck but it
is<00:02:12.390> pretty<00:02:12.629> cool<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.989> plop<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> letter<00:02:13.470> down

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
is pretty cool you plop a letter down

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.860 
is pretty cool you plop a letter down
and<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.400> try<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.610> spell<00:02:14.940> what<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.209> see<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and you try to spell what you see on the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.360 
and you try to spell what you see on the
screen<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.650> see<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.890> detected<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.310> I

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
screen so you can see it detected the I

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.640 
screen so you can see it detected the I
if<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.239> put<00:02:18.420> down<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.629> incorrect<00:02:19.290> letter<00:02:19.470> here

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
if I put down a incorrect letter here

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.190 
if I put down a incorrect letter here
like<00:02:19.769> an<00:02:19.890> R<00:02:20.129> it<00:02:20.610> will<00:02:20.670> put<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.870> wrong

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
like an R it will put that in the wrong

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.199 
like an R it will put that in the wrong
category<00:02:22.560> there<00:02:23.099> now<00:02:23.519> I<00:02:23.550> have<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.940> right<00:02:24.060> now

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
category there now I have it right now

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.910 
category there now I have it right now
in<00:02:24.420> verses<00:02:24.660> mode<00:02:25.050> where<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.379> detects<00:02:25.769> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
in verses mode where it detects the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.040 
in verses mode where it detects the
color<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.760> letter<00:02:27.090> as<00:02:27.330> well<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.930> can

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
color of the letter as well so you can

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.630 
color of the letter as well so you can
do<00:02:28.200> kind<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.440> like<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> vs.<00:02:29.099> thing<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.400> see<00:02:29.519> who

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
do kind of like a vs. thing to see who

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.280 
do kind of like a vs. thing to see who
can<00:02:29.760> spell<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.239> word<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.660> fastest<00:02:31.140> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
can spell the word the fastest the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.170 
can spell the word the fastest the
problem<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.550> put<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:33.150> know

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
problem is that if you put you know

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.910 
problem is that if you put you know
basically<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.750> two<00:02:33.989> letters<00:02:34.410> down<00:02:34.560> from<00:02:34.800> both

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
basically the two letters down from both

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.100 
basically the two letters down from both
teams<00:02:35.160> at<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.430> same<00:02:35.610> time<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:36.810> kind<00:02:37.019> of

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
teams at the same time it just kind of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.930 
teams at the same time it just kind of
arbitrarily<00:02:37.590> figures<00:02:37.980> out<00:02:38.190> who<00:02:38.489> gets<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
arbitrarily figures out who gets the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.000 
arbitrarily figures out who gets the
score<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.599> I<00:02:40.049> just<00:02:40.470> feel<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:40.920> going

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
score and I just feel like this is going

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.530 
score and I just feel like this is going
to<00:02:41.069> lead<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.310> fights<00:02:41.700> no<00:02:41.940> question<00:02:42.269> about<00:02:42.360> it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
to lead to fights no question about it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.750 
to lead to fights no question about it
especially<00:02:42.930> if<00:02:43.260> two<00:02:43.920> siblings<00:02:44.160> are<00:02:44.489> playing

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
especially if two siblings are playing

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.460 
especially if two siblings are playing
and<00:02:44.940> they<00:02:45.000> disagree<00:02:45.510> with<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.900> arbiter<00:02:46.319> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
and they disagree with the arbiter the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.380 
and they disagree with the arbiter the
iPad<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.580> who<00:02:47.670> put<00:02:47.819> their<00:02:47.970> letter<00:02:48.180> down

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
iPad as to who put their letter down

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.120 
iPad as to who put their letter down
first<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.019> an<00:02:49.260> example<00:02:49.560> where<00:02:49.799> yeah<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
first this is an example where yeah the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.949 
first this is an example where yeah the
technology<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.730> pretty<00:02:50.910> cool<00:02:51.150> but<00:02:51.420> as<00:02:51.630> far<00:02:51.810> as

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
technology is pretty cool but as far as

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.630 
technology is pretty cool but as far as
the<00:02:52.079> game<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.440> concerned<00:02:52.500> from<00:02:53.069> a<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.549> know

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
the game is concerned from a you know

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.039 
the game is concerned from a you know
educational<00:02:54.239> standpoint<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.780> don't<00:02:54.930> really

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
educational standpoint I don't really

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.140 
educational standpoint I don't really
see<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> lot<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.709> value<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.519> here<00:02:56.819> beyond

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
see a lot of value to this here beyond

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.089 
see a lot of value to this here beyond
the<00:02:57.299> g-wiz<00:02:57.690> factor<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.290> having<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.650> letter<00:02:58.890> be

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
the g-wiz factor of having a letter be

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.640 
the g-wiz factor of having a letter be
detected<00:02:59.640> by<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.170> iPad<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.200> think<00:03:01.470> they<00:03:01.530> could

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
detected by the iPad I think they could

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.229 
detected by the iPad I think they could
have<00:03:01.739> done<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.920> little<00:03:02.069> bit<00:03:02.280> better<00:03:02.579> design<00:03:03.060> of

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
have done a little bit better design of

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.000 
have done a little bit better design of
the<00:03:03.329> game<00:03:03.569> thought<00:03:04.380> about<00:03:04.620> some<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.890> these

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
the game thought about some of these

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.190 
the game thought about some of these
issues<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.940> tiebreaker<00:03:06.450> or<00:03:06.690> something<00:03:07.049> when

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
issues of a tiebreaker or something when

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.930 
issues of a tiebreaker or something when
both<00:03:07.709> people<00:03:07.860> put<00:03:08.130> both<00:03:08.280> pieces<00:03:08.489> down<00:03:08.760> at<00:03:08.849> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
both people put both pieces down at the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.580 
both people put both pieces down at the
same<00:03:09.120> time<00:03:09.390> or<00:03:09.599> come<00:03:09.720> up<00:03:09.780> with<00:03:09.900> some<00:03:10.049> other<00:03:10.200> way

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
same time or come up with some other way

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.830 
same time or come up with some other way
to<00:03:11.430> kind<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:11.940> score<00:03:12.269> this<00:03:12.420> because<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.810> just

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
to kind of score this because it just

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.690 
to kind of score this because it just
doesn't<00:03:13.200> feel<00:03:13.349> like<00:03:13.410> they<00:03:13.799> put<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.280> lot<00:03:14.489> into

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
doesn't feel like they put a lot into

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.520 
doesn't feel like they put a lot into
the<00:03:14.910> game<00:03:15.150> at<00:03:15.630> least<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.959> didn't<00:03:16.140> put<00:03:16.290> as<00:03:16.380> much

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
the game at least it didn't put as much

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.319 
the game at least it didn't put as much
into<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.890> game<00:03:17.069> as<00:03:17.220> they<00:03:17.340> put<00:03:17.579> into<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
into the game as they put into the

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.030 
into the game as they put into the
technology<00:03:18.959> behind<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.470> now<00:03:19.650> it's<00:03:19.739> next<00:03:19.889> up

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
technology behind it now it's next up

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.140 
technology behind it now it's next up
we're<00:03:20.130> going<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.280> take<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.459> look<00:03:20.670> at<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:20.940> called

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
we're going to take a look at is called

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.940 
we're going to take a look at is called
tangram<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.930> they<00:03:21.989> give<00:03:22.139> you<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:22.319> box<00:03:22.590> of

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
tangram and they give you this box of

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.250 
tangram and they give you this box of
shapes<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.400> make<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.450> with<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.930> what<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.139> do

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
shapes to make it with and what you do

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.870 
shapes to make it with and what you do
is<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:25.560> put<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.920> shapes<00:03:26.130> down<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.579> front

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
is you just put the shapes down in front

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.660 
is you just put the shapes down in front
and<00:03:27.120> as<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.810> start<00:03:27.989> building<00:03:28.290> your<00:03:28.670> structure

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
and as you start building your structure

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.280 
and as you start building your structure
here<00:03:29.880> will<00:03:30.060> tell<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.359> if<00:03:30.690> you've<00:03:30.870> got<00:03:31.139> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
here will tell you if you've got the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.050 
here will tell you if you've got the
right<00:03:31.500> thing<00:03:31.769> in<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.220> right<00:03:32.400> place<00:03:32.700> which<00:03:32.940> is

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
right thing in the right place which is

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.550 
right thing in the right place which is
pretty<00:03:33.269> cool<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.569> as<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.900> can<00:03:34.019> see<00:03:34.139> we've<00:03:34.319> got

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
pretty cool so as you can see we've got

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.800 
pretty cool so as you can see we've got
the<00:03:35.130> first<00:03:35.310> leg<00:03:35.639> here<00:03:35.880> done<00:03:36.090> correctly<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.600> am

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
the first leg here done correctly I am

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.349 
the first leg here done correctly I am
really<00:03:37.260> bad<00:03:37.500> at<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:37.859> stuff<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:38.430> it's<00:03:39.150> kind

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
really bad at this stuff but it's kind

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.670 
really bad at this stuff but it's kind
of<00:03:39.389> neat<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.569> can<00:03:39.780> ask<00:03:39.959> for<00:03:40.200> hints<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.590> then

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
of neat you can ask for hints and then

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.440 
of neat you can ask for hints and then
kind<00:03:40.889> of<00:03:40.950> go<00:03:41.069> from<00:03:41.100> there<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.850> think<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.389> is

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
kind of go from there so I think this is

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.050 
kind of go from there so I think this is
probably<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:43.019> best<00:03:43.230> app<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.220> collection

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
probably the best app in the collection

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.449 
probably the best app in the collection
at<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.299> moment<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:46.319> that<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.590> does<00:03:46.769> have<00:03:47.430> a

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
at the moment just that it does have a

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.250 
at the moment just that it does have a
little<00:03:47.880> bit<00:03:47.970> more<00:03:48.209> challenge<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:49.109> than

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
little bit more challenge to it than

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.900 
little bit more challenge to it than
some<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.590> other<00:03:49.769> things<00:03:50.010> do<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.519> tried

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
some of the other things do that I tried

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.210 
some of the other things do that I tried
so<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.959> is<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.230> good<00:03:52.470> thing<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.069> can

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
so that is a good thing and you can

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.379 
so that is a good thing and you can
really<00:03:53.370> spend<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.730> lot<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.940> time<00:03:54.090> trying<00:03:54.299> to

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
really spend a lot of time trying to

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.330 
really spend a lot of time trying to
figure<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.750> out<00:03:54.930> great<00:03:55.650> for<00:03:55.829> kids<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.130> want

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
figure this out great for kids that want

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.220 
figure this out great for kids that want
a<00:03:56.400> good<00:03:56.579> puzzle<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:57.030> play<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.720> do<00:03:57.780> like<00:03:58.109> the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
a good puzzle to play and I do like the

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.870 
a good puzzle to play and I do like the
fact<00:03:58.380> that<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.650> think<00:03:58.709> their<00:03:58.950> vision<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.519> having

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
fact that I think their vision of having

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.170 
fact that I think their vision of having
you<00:04:00.239> know<00:04:00.269> 3d<00:04:00.750> objects<00:04:01.349> interact<00:04:01.950> on<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.639> table

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
you know 3d objects interact on a table

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.059 
you know 3d objects interact on a table
with<00:04:03.420> something<00:04:03.900> on<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.049> screen<00:04:04.470> is<00:04:04.739> really

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
with something on the screen is really

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.490 
with something on the screen is really
best<00:04:05.310> realized<00:04:05.790> through<00:04:06.150> tangram<00:04:06.660> I<00:04:06.900> was

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
best realized through tangram I was

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.720 
best realized through tangram I was
impressed<00:04:07.859> with<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.130> word<00:04:08.310> app<00:04:08.459> from<00:04:08.639> a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
impressed with the word app from a

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.030 
impressed with the word app from a
technological<00:04:09.510> standpoint<00:04:09.720> but<00:04:10.620> not<00:04:10.769> from<00:04:10.950> an

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
technological standpoint but not from an

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.069 
technological standpoint but not from an
educational<00:04:11.549> standpoint<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.780> Newton

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
educational standpoint and the Newton

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.870 
educational standpoint and the Newton
game<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:13.470> OK<00:04:13.739> it's<00:04:13.950> kind<00:04:14.099> of<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.250> cool<00:04:14.430> thing<00:04:14.489> but

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
game is OK it's kind of a cool thing but

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.900 
game is OK it's kind of a cool thing but
again<00:04:14.970> more<00:04:15.900> gee-whiz<00:04:16.560> than<00:04:16.950> something<00:04:17.669> of

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
again more gee-whiz than something of

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.120 
again more gee-whiz than something of
educational<00:04:18.599> value<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:19.410> think<00:04:19.680> this<00:04:19.919> is<00:04:20.039> a

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
educational value so I think this is a

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.710 
educational value so I think this is a
neat<00:04:20.370> system<00:04:20.579> it's<00:04:20.849> got<00:04:20.940> potential<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.660> do

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
neat system it's got potential I do

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.300 
neat system it's got potential I do
think<00:04:22.049> they<00:04:22.140> spent<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.500> little<00:04:22.680> too<00:04:22.919> much<00:04:23.039> time

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
think they spent a little too much time

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.550 
think they spent a little too much time
focused<00:04:24.180> on<00:04:24.360> getting<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.780> technology<00:04:25.080> right

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
focused on getting the technology right

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.680 
focused on getting the technology right
and<00:04:25.770> not<00:04:25.890> so<00:04:26.130> much<00:04:26.310> building<00:04:27.000> apps<00:04:27.270> around

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
and not so much building apps around

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.510 
and not so much building apps around
that<00:04:27.960> resulted<00:04:28.470> in<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.710> really<00:04:29.190> compelling

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
that resulted in a really compelling

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.030 
that resulted in a really compelling
educational<00:04:30.270> experience<00:04:30.750> but<00:04:30.840> now<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.650> stuff

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
educational experience but now the stuff

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.860 
educational experience but now the stuff
is<00:04:32.190> built<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.700> I<00:04:32.790> think<00:04:32.970> as<00:04:33.090> they<00:04:33.240> get<00:04:33.390> funded

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
is built and I think as they get funded

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.840 
is built and I think as they get funded
and<00:04:33.960> begin<00:04:34.320> getting<00:04:35.040> this<00:04:35.220> stuff<00:04:35.460> out<00:04:35.640> there<00:04:35.820> I

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
and begin getting this stuff out there I

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.910 
and begin getting this stuff out there I
think<00:04:36.090> they<00:04:36.150> can<00:04:36.330> improve<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.870> apps<00:04:37.110> without

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
think they can improve the apps without

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.010 
think they can improve the apps without
having<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.400> change<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.940> physical<00:04:39.090> objects<00:04:39.960> so

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
having to change the physical objects so

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.560 
having to change the physical objects so
that's<00:04:40.200> a<00:04:40.380> good<00:04:41.010> sign<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:41.640> potential<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.390> come

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
that's a good sign of potential to come

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.820 
that's a good sign of potential to come
but<00:04:42.720> at<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.900> moment<00:04:43.080> it<00:04:43.290> just<00:04:43.320> doesn't<00:04:43.710> feel

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
but at the moment it just doesn't feel

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.800 
but at the moment it just doesn't feel
like<00:04:43.890> it's<00:04:44.280> quite<00:04:44.610> ready<00:04:44.910> for<00:04:45.150> me<00:04:45.270> just<00:04:45.450> yet

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
like it's quite ready for me just yet

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.460 
like it's quite ready for me just yet
this<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.200> LAN<00:04:46.350> Simon<00:04:46.800> thanks<00:04:47.040> for<00:04:47.160> watching
