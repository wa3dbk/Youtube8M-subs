00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.130
 commenting and I bring you gameplay of 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.410
 modern warfare 3 and as you are seeing is 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.420
 a game of team duel with the 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.940
 Gold app 90 effectively as 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.559
 you are seeing here I have benefit 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.539
 hard line, stable aim and 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.820
 large chargers there to shoot what 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.249
 they buy races back good yes crazy 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.109
 I already shut up then good is what you 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.599
 I come to talk today is a bit of a topic 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.069
 more serious a little bit I hope that what 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.409
 listen with your ears wide open 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:31.899
 because I come to talk about the subject of 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.760
 upload videos to my channel videos that do not 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.550
 they are mine not right now I will have more than 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.580
 700 videos to the channel which I have 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.460
 remembered I have personally climbed 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.440
 let's say that all of them except 10 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.780
 15 20 I do not know exactly to the best 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.330
 they are only 5 I do not know but of cases 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.610
 that have been few and not the main 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.620
 reason for that is that good in case not 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.810
 you know every announcement that you enter and 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.660
 You see in YouTube all that ad that 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.460
 you see and there is a video and before the video 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.690
 there is an announcement then this announcement 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.250
 means that the person who is 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.449
 uploading the video charges for it say 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 depending on the people who watch the video 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.580
 so he charges an amount for 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.830
 that is to say for example all my videos 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.960
 how are you seeing you have ads 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.940
 I charge for them I upload some videos yo - 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.370
 curro and depending on the people who 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.140
 see are one thousand ten thousand five hundred thousand 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.390
 I eat according to her not then 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.729
 which is to achieve funny so to speak 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.010
 from this they had a video so that 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.330
 see people have to be a good video 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.560
 I have to create good content for 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.610
 that people still want to enter the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.990
 channel but of course what happens when that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.780
 good content I do not do 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.430
 imagine that a company or a chain 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.649
 I compose television 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.940
 example antenna 3 antenna 3 pick is a 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.580
 chain that has a very good 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.520
 audience and yet he takes and he 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.229
 find a channel singapore a program 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.910
 television in singapore which will 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.660
 like and in singapore see it five thousand 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.800
 people and good catch antenna 3 what 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.649
 otherwise said to be 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.390
 understand Spanish and upload it with a day 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.490
 on television in his chain trains three 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.670
 and instead of five thousand people they catch and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.160
 they see it three million depending on that 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.690
 antenna3 the would win a lot more than 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.770
 money and only what he would have done 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.570
 it has been 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.870
 a bit of audio over what 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.840
 I want to arrive is that if I for example 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.370
 I have a video that I have not done 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.430
 nothing of him is to say 4 send me a 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.460
 video you have 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.890
 320 500 in a game and I take it up 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.850
 to my channel that I have made for them 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.940
 say I played myself 10 hours 20 300 he 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.010
 been sweating to get me 3 max or 200 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.510
 modes in a game to be a 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.520
 good video generate good content 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.870
 for you to see or just 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.350
 I did nothing and only put my 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.140
 video for 5 15 minutes that lasts each 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.480
 departure is to say honestly I do not 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.160
 I would have done nothing to deserve say 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.860
 that so many people watched the video because 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.180
 it's clear that it 's a game like that and it's going to 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.490
 it's worth it and I'll see it a lot 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.980
 people who happen that that game is not mine 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.860
 That game has not even worked for me. 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.500
 done nothing so that many people see it 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.820
 when really the one who has worked 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.550
 he's just going to see people because people 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.930
 I came to see him on my channel then here 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.090
 is what I want to get 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.920
 get to what 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.690
 how did you know a long time ago 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.849
 and those who do good because it is high 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.400
 those who have known me for a long time 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.890
 long ago you know that I am a 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.500
 person, we have always seen 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.099
 I tried to talk to you tell you 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.230
 everything I could and I do not know how I like it 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.970
 be above all sincere and we are not going 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.690
 much less would I count it could welcome and 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.010
 create me a channel only one 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.290
 impression this channel stop uploading my 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.190
 videos, I do not say it's wrong, but I say 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.920
 that I like to say let me know 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.590
 recognize my own work and not choose 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.900
 and take advantage, so to speak, of 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.220
 other's work however good there is 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.140
 very good channels that are channels 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.610
 community and which have that 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.980
 function but my function is not that my 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.450
 function is to upload my videos that I have 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.549
 created and you are the ones who finally 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.090
 afterwards you like it is not clear that as 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.769
 I tell you I had 30 megas every day 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.380
 of I do not know here in 30 years of I do not know how much 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.729
 a game that has finished 200 to 0 does not 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.889
 I would be very good to you you would like 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.810
 try it a moment say yes 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.760
 is winning that person who 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.170
 really it is healing the video is 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.750
 playing a lot of time 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.150
 then it arrived was in 10 minutes not 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.860
 I had a lot of people and only for 10 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.810
 she commented on a video 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.790
 I kept winning that money is already 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.050
 you would be having those people who see your 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.000
 videos when you have not really done 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.510
 nothing then that is the point of which 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.150
 I want to arrive 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.840
 I personally do not know if you think 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.760
 rare that you will seem absurd but I do not know 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.900
 how to say it but to me it gives me pure 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.509
 that is, not 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.820
 I do not serve for this does not work for 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.520
 take and upload me upload a video of 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.310
 someone who has not done anything is 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.010
 tell 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.630
 I would not feel comfortable so to speak 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.120
 I would feel comfortable uploading a video in the 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.640
 that I have not been involved in fact a couple 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.250
 of times I stopped doing it quite 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.770
 time as it happened with the issue of uploading 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.419
 your videos 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.120
 parties are very good that at last, 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.379
 out people are going to see a lot and if that 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.780
 people see my channel will not give it in the 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:24.780
 yours and after all let's say that 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.310
 I would not feel comfortable as I am 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.840
 saying then what do I do 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.900
 many times those who follow me in 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.060
 twitter I have more than 80 thousand followers 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.610
 on twitter then when I like a 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.020
 video what do I put it on twitter be 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.080
 from someone who sees me the videos that do not 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.000
 be spanish english if I see a video 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.740
 I like what I put on twitter and if 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.539
 I see obviously if it is a video which 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.639
 few people have seen I do not see that it's a 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.289
 video that few people have seen that can 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.880
 like and oysters because it made sense has been 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.909
 I've been working on the video a lot 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.569
 there and surely people like it 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:59.039
 then let's say that I finish a time that 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.780
 people that person get lots of 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.370
 visits a lot of subscribers and 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.400
 others but because it has been because they have 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.349
 seen their video is to say they have not seen their 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.969
 video which I have retouched not have not 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.520
 entered they have seen their video has 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.780
 liked and have stayed is not that point 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.000
 I want to get there so good 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.620
 I hope you understand it better you think 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.969
 I'm crazy but good with this 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.920
 dismissal I hope yes to like the video 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:22.970
 that you vote, I like favorites 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.970
 the next goodbye
