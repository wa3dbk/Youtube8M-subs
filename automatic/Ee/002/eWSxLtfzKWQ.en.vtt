we'll<00:05:07.870> just<00:05:08.080> opened<00:05:08.590> it<00:05:08.819> those<00:05:10.560> on<00:05:11.560> this<00:05:11.770> side

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
we'll just opened it those on this side

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.769 
we'll just opened it those on this side
it's<00:05:12.490> something<00:05:12.789> it's<00:05:13.509> the<00:05:13.689> same<00:05:13.900> but<00:05:15.659> on<00:05:16.659> the

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
it's something it's the same but on the

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:22.050 
it's something it's the same but on the
front<00:05:17.020> there's<00:05:17.349> a<00:05:19.349> 250<00:05:20.349> I<00:05:20.590> guessed<00:05:21.099> it<00:05:21.279> it's

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
front there's a 250 I guessed it it's

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.100 
front there's a 250 I guessed it it's
the<00:05:22.240> engine<00:05:22.569> size<00:05:22.870> but<00:05:24.150> on<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.330> back<00:05:25.569> we<00:05:26.080> have

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
the engine size but on the back we have

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.860 
the engine size but on the back we have
the<00:05:26.409> muslin<00:05:28.199> back<00:05:29.199> lamps<00:05:29.590> there<00:05:29.800> and<00:05:30.099> I<00:05:30.870> know

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
the muslin back lamps there and I know

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.709 
the muslin back lamps there and I know
where's<00:05:32.319> the<00:05:32.409> exhaust<00:05:32.889> system

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
where's the exhaust system

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.800 
where's the exhaust system
yes<00:05:34.719> I<00:05:34.990> guess<00:05:35.409> that's<00:05:35.590> so<00:05:36.340> they're<00:05:36.639> not<00:05:37.599> really

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
yes I guess that's so they're not really

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.610 
yes I guess that's so they're not really
designed<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:39.340> here<00:05:39.639> we<00:05:39.759> have<00:05:39.939> Mustang<00:05:40.360> logo

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:16.029 
these ones and I thought it would be too

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:18.839 
these ones and I thought it would be too
much<00:06:16.060> very<00:06:16.750> like<00:06:16.960> but<00:06:17.259> this<00:06:18.009> is<00:06:18.099> actually<00:06:18.460> nice

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849

for collectors and of course it has to

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.379 
for collectors and of course it has to
hold<00:06:23.560> back<00:06:23.740> action

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389
