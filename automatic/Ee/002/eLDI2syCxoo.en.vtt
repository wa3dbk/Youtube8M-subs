00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
I believe before they just had 15 and in

I believe before they just had 15 and in
addition<00:00:57.909> to<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:58.390> I<00:00:58.420> also<00:00:58.629> found<00:00:58.899> that

exporting 640 by 480 files actually

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.140 
exporting 640 by 480 files actually
translates<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.429> better<00:01:03.609> quality<00:01:04.030> on<00:01:04.120> a

proper for you to because they don't do
widescreen<00:02:02.409> videos<00:02:02.770> i'm<00:02:02.950> sure<00:02:03.100> they<00:02:03.250> will<00:02:03.340> in

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
widescreen videos i'm sure they will in

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.950 
widescreen videos i'm sure they will in
the<00:02:03.549> future<00:02:03.579> but<00:02:04.060> right<00:02:04.119> now<00:02:04.420> it's<00:02:04.570> just<00:02:04.840> a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
the future but right now it's just a

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.050 
the future but right now it's just a
letterbox<00:02:05.380> style<00:02:05.859> and<00:02:06.070> it's<00:02:06.640> got<00:02:06.759> a<00:02:06.789> frames

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
letterbox style and it's got a frames

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.499 
letterbox style and it's got a frames
per<00:02:07.390> second<00:02:07.750> of<00:02:07.869> 30<00:02:08.320> now<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.580> can<00:02:09.700> also<00:02:09.880> do<00:02:10.300> a

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
per second of 30 now you can also do a

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.170 
per second of 30 now you can also do a
video<00:02:11.260> for<00:02:11.710> lan<00:02:12.010> which<00:02:12.490> is<00:02:12.610> actually<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.970> little

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
video for lan which is actually a little

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.260 
video for lan which is actually a little
better<00:02:13.390> quality<00:02:14.010> which<00:02:15.010> will<00:02:15.160> be<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.310> 1<00:02:15.850> megabit

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
better quality which will be a 1 megabit

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.590 
better quality which will be a 1 megabit
per<00:02:16.330> second<00:02:16.870> instead<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.290> 768<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:19.330> may<00:02:19.480> not

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
per second instead of 768 you may not

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.960 
per second instead of 768 you may not
notice<00:02:19.840> too<00:02:20.110> much<00:02:20.260> difference<00:02:20.800> when<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:21.819> do

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
notice too much difference when you do

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.880 
notice too much difference when you do
this<00:02:22.150> sometimes<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.290> will<00:02:23.470> if<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.739> have

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
this sometimes you will if you have

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.960 
this sometimes you will if you have
really<00:02:24.280> intricate<00:02:24.610> video<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.420> has<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.569> lot<00:02:25.780> of

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
really intricate video that has a lot of

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.640 
really intricate video that has a lot of
smaller<00:02:26.180> stuff<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:26.750> maybe<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.410> want<00:02:27.560> to

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
smaller stuff in it maybe you want to

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.240 
smaller stuff in it maybe you want to
try<00:02:28.490> this<00:02:28.550> one<00:02:28.880> if<00:02:29.090> not<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.840> can<00:02:29.960> do<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.250> 768

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
try this one if not you can do the 768

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.180 
try this one if not you can do the 768
and<00:02:31.430> you'll<00:02:31.670> be<00:02:31.820> just<00:02:31.850> fine<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:33.410> go<00:02:33.650> anywhere

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
and you'll be just fine to go anywhere

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.100 
and you'll be just fine to go anywhere
above<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.820> really<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.480> not<00:02:35.630> going<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.900> make<00:02:36.080> a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
above that really is not going to make a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.320 
above that really is not going to make a
difference<00:02:36.380> on<00:02:36.650> youtube<00:02:37.010> but<00:02:37.250> 768<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.150> 1

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
difference on youtube but 768 in 1

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.040 
difference on youtube but 768 in 1
megabit<00:02:38.980> compared<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.160> lower<00:02:40.400> bit<00:02:40.640> rates

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
megabit compared to the lower bit rates

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.990 
megabit compared to the lower bit rates
it<00:02:42.050> totally<00:02:42.440> makes<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.710> difference<00:02:43.010> i<00:02:43.220> notice<00:02:43.790> a

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
it totally makes a difference i notice a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.060 
it totally makes a difference i notice a
humongous<00:02:44.540> jump<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:44.960> quality<00:02:45.230> from<00:02:45.740> one<00:02:45.950> to

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
humongous jump in quality from one to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.050 
humongous jump in quality from one to
the<00:02:46.100> other<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:46.970> video<00:02:47.480> for<00:02:47.690> lance<00:02:47.840> 768<00:02:48.590> kbps<00:02:49.520> is

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
the other so video for lance 768 kbps is

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.690 
the other so video for lance 768 kbps is
going<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.360> be<00:02:50.450> fine<00:02:50.690> i'll<00:02:50.900> make<00:02:51.770> sure<00:02:51.800> that

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
going to be fine i'll make sure that

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.940 
going to be fine i'll make sure that
your<00:02:53.150> video<00:02:53.450> does<00:02:53.660> not<00:02:53.690> exceed<00:02:54.080> 100<00:02:54.530> megabytes

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
your video does not exceed 100 megabytes

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.980 
your video does not exceed 100 megabytes
else<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.640> won't<00:02:55.790> be<00:02:55.910> accepted<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.570> obviously

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
else it won't be accepted and obviously

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.720 
else it won't be accepted and obviously
don't<00:02:57.320> let<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.770> go<00:02:57.890> over<00:02:58.010> 10<00:02:58.280> minutes<00:02:58.459> because

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
don't let it go over 10 minutes because

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.670 
don't let it go over 10 minutes because
youtube<00:02:59.120> only<00:02:59.390> allows<00:02:59.600> 10<00:02:59.870> minute<00:03:00.140> videos<00:03:00.470> at

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
the present time so that's it so instead

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.000 
the present time so that's it so instead
of<00:03:03.709> my<00:03:03.890> previous<00:03:04.100> recommendation<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.180> 512<00:03:06.010> go

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
of my previous recommendation of 512 go

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.800 
of my previous recommendation of 512 go
ahead<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.280> go<00:03:07.370> with<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.490> 768<00:03:08.330> or<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.660> one

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
ahead and go with the 768 or the one

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.170 
ahead and go with the 768 or the one
megabit<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:10.070> will<00:03:10.160> work<00:03:10.310> out<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:10.490> fine<00:03:10.760> and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
megabit it will work out just fine and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.150 
megabit it will work out just fine and
your<00:03:11.480> videos<00:03:11.780> will<00:03:11.990> look<00:03:12.290> better<00:03:12.560> on<00:03:12.680> YouTube

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160
