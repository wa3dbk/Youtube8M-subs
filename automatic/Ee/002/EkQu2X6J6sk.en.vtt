00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.600
 although it is occupied by Israel 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.040
 that's it 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.730
 directly from one of the finals to my 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.130
 side 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.080
 the coaching of the two teams here on the side 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.300
 left filipe on my right side, right? 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.580
 each one will define their team improved the 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.410
 which is now in your head - each 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.540
 book if we can not attract birds 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.250
 cars face in the face now nothing happens 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.110
 I already did my work that is to pass 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.480
 the preparation of the game and now is at hand 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.940
 of them is one of them so it 's obvious that I 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.559
 I'm very nervous stayed in 26 05 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.360
 very very very nervous that I can not 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.980
 do nothing i can not say things 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.050
 I'm seeing and what they have to 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.580
 sure the time you phillip how 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.980
 that so much attention all the staff of the series 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.840
 b it's up the game and okay 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.090
 passing to that keyboard noise 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.710
 It's the most that you can keep for months. 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.240
 It's the worst time for us to 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.800
 does a job before coming to himself 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.240
 even and we can not say is that the 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.329
 people can do nothing now 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.329
 So just twist I know by now the 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.520
 My heart is racing in looks. 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.170
 doubts that they from the outside up 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.369
 Our cry is good, we'll see the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.229
 field on this move 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.689
 if it were not product time already of deception 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.399
 because it's too much pretension is too much 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.020
 The difficult moment has a moment that has already 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.850
 Think, man, I'd like it instead. 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.310
 them face 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.229
 every game is that we do not have to 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.539
 necessary but every game in favor of 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.189
 Maybe we could not in one place. 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.439
 but he had to go out with him 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.600
 talking to them could be very good and 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.009
 Do not you ever think about it once? 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.560
 My God, my God, I need a place. 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.929
 them face to face I sure do 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.689
 had a position well inside the tsd 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.219
 specter in the game and is certainly giving 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.350
 an overlord there coordinating the 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.200
 things of our chaos that is something that 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.280
 It started very well so far here 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.689
 Yes, of course. 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.229
 You need to have a good view of the game. 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.299
 a good game theory and to be a good 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.590
 player you do not necessarily need 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.639
 It needs better mechanics as well. 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.560
 positioning 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:58.659
 so you have a good game vision and 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.060
 they have the marriage positioning 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.310
 perfect for any good strategy 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.409
 message and Felipe will face the game 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.969
 Rolling my face, I do not have to say anything to 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.160
 People are going to end up winning so I just 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.500
 I think it's okay there for the mayor. 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.020
 secondly Felipe which is the replica 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.960
 It's good, this game is good because you know 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.120
 we won is now 3-1 here 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.100
 is so apprehensive so lost there are all 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.450
 17 positions in front of new 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.760
 second time they are showing that 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.830
 started the game the game when the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.230
 people can get finalized recently 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.360
 this time and show you if you are 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.310
 eating that you 're scared is like stopping 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.670
 here you forget the previous game 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.320
 for 2 to 1 was the same story does not stop 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.290
 around here because it 's warming the climate 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.250
 here directly from the arena x5 bgl arena 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.250
