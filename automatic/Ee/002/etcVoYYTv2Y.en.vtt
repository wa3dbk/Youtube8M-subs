day<00:01:34.350> long<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.830> have<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.009> worry<00:01:35.190> about

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
day long and I have to worry about

day long and I have to worry about
monitoring<00:01:36.200> it's<00:01:37.200> made<00:01:37.440> to<00:01:37.650> run<00:01:37.830> 24<00:01:38.490> hours<00:01:38.820> so

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
monitoring it's made to run 24 hours so

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.490 
monitoring it's made to run 24 hours so
we'll<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.660> be<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> thousand<00:01:40.200> pounds<00:01:40.440> a

we'll do that to be a thousand pounds a

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.219 
we'll do that to be a thousand pounds a
day<00:01:41.300> so<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.390> grain<00:01:42.570> comes<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.080> bin

through<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.479> bottom<00:05:11.780> screens<00:05:12.110> are<00:05:12.530> smaller

through the bottom screens are smaller
than<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.430> sunflowers<00:05:13.970> so<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.930> smaller

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
than the sunflowers so the the smaller

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.140 
than the sunflowers so the the smaller
particles<00:05:15.620> fall<00:05:16.039> through<00:05:16.340> but<00:05:16.520> it<00:05:16.669> holds<00:05:16.970> the

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.209

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:27.980 
and then there's airflow through this

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
again and then the Queen seeds drop off

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.220 
again and then the Queen seeds drop off
