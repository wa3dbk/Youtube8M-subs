00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.750
 let's prepare mushroom cream 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.390
 with crunchy ham ingredients 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.030
 that we are going to need are 500 grams of 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.190
 clean mushrooms a potato a leek 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.540
 a clove of garlic 3 slices of ham 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.150
 serrano fine oil salt and pepper for 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.810
 start in an express pot we will 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.410
 a little oil 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.849
 we put it to heat and sautÃ© the 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.849
 leek and garlic clove 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.870
 it does not matter if you brown a little 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.310
 we add the split mushrooms 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.300
 bits 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.300
 we salt 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.640
 and pepper 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.550
 and we fry it all together 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.550
 we add the potato cut into pieces 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.240
 we cover with water 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.890
 and we close the pot 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.840
 we put it in maximum pressure and when 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.680
 Let's steam down the fire to the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.200
 medium 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.230
 meanwhile we will put the ham 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.230
 microwave two minutes at maximum power 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.790
 we will set aside in another dish so that 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.790
 cool a little 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.440
 after 10 minutes we will bring the pot 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.440
 of the fire and we will remove the steam 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.670
 we open it and we take a little water 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.899
 that we will reserve in case we need to 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.899
 the time to crush 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.650
 we will remove all the water that is 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.860
 necessary since then we can add 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.860
 plus 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.039
 with an arm blender to crush them 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.769
 we have very well 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.019
 and in case we have a blender 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.019
 we crush it in it 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.750
 so we will be much finer 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.240
 We cut the ham 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.610
 and we leave it in the removes and what 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.060
 we use to sprinkle on top of 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.280
 our cream the ham prepared from this 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.640
 way gives a delicious touch to this 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.640
 cream
