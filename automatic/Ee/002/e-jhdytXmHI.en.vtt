00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.039 
awareness you're pretty much entirely
quiet<00:03:04.850> but<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:05.940> still<00:03:06.150> make<00:03:06.299> mounting<00:03:06.750> noises

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
quiet but you still make mounting noises

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.240 
quiet but you still make mounting noises
when<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.260> come<00:03:07.380> over<00:03:07.590> things<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:07.980> reload

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
when you come over things and reload

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.520 
when you come over things and reload
sounds<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.700> all<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.269> that's<00:03:10.260> kind<00:03:10.500> of

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
sounds and all that so that's kind of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.800 
sounds and all that so that's kind of
important<00:03:10.970> all<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.180> all<00:03:12.299> I<00:03:12.330> would<00:03:12.600> recommend

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
important all in all I would recommend

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.750 
important all in all I would recommend
using<00:03:13.350> super<00:03:13.739> crunch<00:03:13.980> dependent<00:03:14.459> but

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
using super crunch dependent but

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.070 
using super crunch dependent but
depending<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:15.180> your<00:03:15.239> headset<00:03:15.720> because<00:03:15.870> my

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
depending on your headset because my

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.410 
depending on your headset because my
headset<00:03:16.410> allows<00:03:16.950> me<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.310> drop<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:18.000> loud

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
headset allows me to drop the loud

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.690 
headset allows me to drop the loud
sounds<00:03:18.989> in<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.440> game<00:03:19.470> volume<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.190> boost<00:03:20.519> up

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
sounds in the game volume and boost up

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.759 
sounds in the game volume and boost up
the<00:03:20.880> low<00:03:21.030> sounds<00:03:21.450> which<00:03:22.290> makes<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.530> little<00:03:22.620> bit

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
the low sounds which makes a little bit

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.020 
the low sounds which makes a little bit
easier<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.040> hear<00:03:23.250> footsteps<00:03:23.489> if<00:03:23.850> you're<00:03:24.000> a

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
easier to hear footsteps if you're a

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.370 
easier to hear footsteps if you're a
headset<00:03:24.390> doesn't<00:03:24.540> allow<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.870> do<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:25.200> I

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
headset doesn't allow you to do that I

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.680 
headset doesn't allow you to do that I
would<00:03:26.010> say<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.670> should<00:03:26.790> decide<00:03:27.450> between

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
would say you should decide between

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.140 
would say you should decide between
super<00:03:28.260> crunch<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.769> high<00:03:29.340> boost<00:03:29.670> on<00:03:29.880> your<00:03:30.030> own

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
super crunch and high boost on your own

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.130 
super crunch and high boost on your own
of<00:03:30.360> course<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.690> should<00:03:30.810> go<00:03:30.840> through<00:03:30.930> all

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
of course you should go through all

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.479 
of course you should go through all
these<00:03:31.260> settings<00:03:31.440> yourself<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.130> see<00:03:32.250> what<00:03:32.280> you

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
these settings yourself and see what you

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.520 
these settings yourself and see what you
prefer<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.269> what<00:03:33.420> what<00:03:33.989> works<00:03:34.200> for<00:03:34.410> you

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
prefer and what what works for you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.360 
prefer and what what works for you
because<00:03:34.620> everybody's<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.160> little<00:03:35.250> bit
