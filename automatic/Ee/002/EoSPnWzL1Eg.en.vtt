mayweather-pacquiao fight wasn't made I

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.080 
mayweather-pacquiao fight wasn't made I
really<00:01:14.950> don't<00:01:15.100> think<00:01:15.190> it<00:01:15.430> boiled<00:01:15.729> down<00:01:15.759> the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
really don't think it boiled down the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.999 
really don't think it boiled down the
drug<00:01:16.450> test<00:01:16.750> but<00:01:16.869> I<00:01:17.050> think<00:01:17.229> Manny<00:01:17.440> was<00:01:17.680> willing

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
drug test but I think Manny was willing

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.859 
drug test but I think Manny was willing
to<00:01:18.070> take<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.369> drug<00:01:18.580> test<00:01:18.610> okay<00:01:19.030> I<00:01:19.390> think<00:01:19.750> it

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
to take the drug test okay I think it

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.990 
to take the drug test okay I think it
boiled<00:01:20.200> down<00:01:20.229> to<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.590> fact<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.920> Bob<00:01:21.610> Arum

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
boiled down to the fact that Bob Arum

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.660 
boiled down to the fact that Bob Arum
did<00:01:22.179> not<00:01:22.360> want<00:01:22.720> to<00:01:22.780> be<00:01:22.960> talked<00:01:23.770> down<00:01:24.039> to<00:01:24.100> or
