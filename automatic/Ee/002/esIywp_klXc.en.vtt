00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the part of the lead and the owners in

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.400 
the part of the lead and the owners in

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
extend the deadline and I don't think

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.790 
extend the deadline and I don't think
anybody<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:24.930> expecting<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.500> was<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
anybody was expecting that was going to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.429 
anybody was expecting that was going to
happen<00:00:25.920> today<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:28.140> know<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.320> think

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
happen today and so you know I think

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.259 
happen today and so you know I think
they'd<00:00:28.740> met<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> respectable<00:00:29.760> amount<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.119> time

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
they'd met a respectable amount of time

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
they'd met a respectable amount of time
so<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.570> both<00:00:30.869> sides<00:00:31.109> say<00:00:31.500> they<00:00:31.529> they<00:00:32.369> showed

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
so that both sides say they they showed

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.520 
so that both sides say they they showed
up<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.000> they<00:00:33.090> talked<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.660> couldn't<00:00:34.290> do<00:00:34.380> what

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
up and they talked and couldn't do what

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.100 
up and they talked and couldn't do what
they<00:00:34.649> wanted<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.040> do<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.570> result<00:00:36.809> I

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
they wanted to do and as a result I

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.119 
they wanted to do and as a result I
think<00:00:37.290> everybody's<00:00:37.649> known<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> long<00:00:38.070> time

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
think everybody's known for a long time

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.799 
think everybody's known for a long time
that<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:38.700> would<00:00:38.969> be<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.149> lockout<00:00:39.540> tonight

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
that there would be a lockout tonight

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.690 
that there would be a lockout tonight

let's take a closer look right now what
the<00:00:41.820> key<00:00:42.030> issues<00:00:42.480> are<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.809> these<00:00:43.020> two<00:00:43.260> sides

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the key issues are that these two sides

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.470 
the key issues are that these two sides
are<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.010> clear<00:00:44.309> disagreement<00:00:44.969> about<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.390> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the amount for which contracts can be

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.570 
the amount for which contracts can be
guaranteed<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.000> now<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.110> are

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
guaranteed so now that they are

obviously<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:09.090> looks<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.570> are<00:01:09.600> going

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
obviously it looks like they are going

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
obviously it looks like they are going
to<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.200> locking<00:01:10.439> out<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.740> players<00:01:11.130> what<00:01:11.549> do

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
to be locking out the players what do

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.210 
to be locking out the players what do
you<00:01:11.909> think<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.689> biggest<00:01:13.070> bone<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
you think is the biggest bone of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.039 
you think is the biggest bone of
contention<00:01:14.250> between<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.479> sides<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:15.900> now

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
contention between the sides right now

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.080 
contention between the sides right now
there's<00:01:16.439> no<00:01:16.590> question<00:01:17.070> simple<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.640> seems

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
there's no question simple as it seems

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.969 
there's no question simple as it seems
that<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.630> biggest<00:01:18.990> owner<00:01:19.259> contention<00:01:19.860> is

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
that the biggest owner contention is

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.580 
that the biggest owner contention is
money<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.509> most<00:01:21.590> collective

obviously the the owners feel that that

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.609 
obviously the the owners feel that that
number<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.740> now<00:01:37.979> way<00:01:38.579> too<00:01:38.640> high<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:40.079> players<00:01:40.350> I

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
number is now way too high the players I

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.929 
number is now way too high the players I
think<00:01:40.650> I've<00:01:40.979> indicated<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.700> they're

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
think I've indicated that they're

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.289 
think I've indicated that they're
willing<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.409> shave<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.590> down<00:01:43.649> somewhat<00:01:44.430> but

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
willing to shave that down somewhat but

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.819 
willing to shave that down somewhat but
nowhere<00:01:45.600> near<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> owners<00:01:46.439> are<00:01:46.530> looking

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
nowhere near what the owners are looking

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.350 
nowhere near what the owners are looking
for<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.159> until<00:01:47.399> they<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.700> settle<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.149> issue

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
for and until they can settle that issue

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.810 
for and until they can settle that issue
almost<00:01:49.259> nothing<00:01:49.439> else<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:50.250> matters<00:01:50.430> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
almost nothing else really matters I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.300 
almost nothing else really matters I
think<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.270> once<00:01:51.659> they<00:01:51.869> could<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.350> do

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
think and I think once they could and do

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.710 
think and I think once they could and do
decide<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.880> settle<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.270> which<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:54.570> will

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
decide to settle it which they will

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.230 
decide to settle it which they will
someday<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.710> think<00:01:56.549> everything<00:01:56.850> else<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.119> going

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
someday I think everything else is going

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.880 
someday I think everything else is going
to<00:01:57.299> fall<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:57.570> place<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.869> lot<00:01:58.140> easier<00:01:58.320> with

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
to fall into place a lot easier with

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.249 
to fall into place a lot easier with
those<00:01:59.159> talks<00:01:59.460> breaking<00:01:59.909> down<00:02:00.119> many<00:02:00.869> hours

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
those talks breaking down many hours

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.999 
those talks breaking down many hours
ahead<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.340> CBA<00:02:02.700> expiring<00:02:03.390> tonight<00:02:04.009> you've

ahead of the CBA expiring tonight you've

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.190 
ahead of the CBA expiring tonight you've
been<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> part<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.820> before<00:02:06.540> what<00:02:07.170> was

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
been a part of this before what was

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.710 
been a part of this before what was
taking<00:02:07.829> place<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.459> those<00:02:08.910> hotel<00:02:09.330> rooms<00:02:09.360> in

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720

those conference rooms today well I

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.920 
those conference rooms today well I
would<00:02:11.550> guess<00:02:11.790> there's<00:02:12.209> probably<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.540> lot<00:02:12.720> less

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
would guess there's probably a lot less

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.910 
would guess there's probably a lot less
taking<00:02:13.290> place<00:02:13.500> than

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
taking place than

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.890 
taking place than

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
people realize when you get down to this

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.930 
people realize when you get down to this
kind<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.230> stage<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.770> negotiations<00:02:17.459> often<00:02:17.819> when

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
kind of stage in negotiations often when

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.820 
kind of stage in negotiations often when
the<00:02:18.030> parties<00:02:18.360> are<00:02:18.390> together<00:02:18.620> they<00:02:19.620> probably

the parties are together they probably

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.440 
the parties are together they probably
spend<00:02:20.130> two-thirds<00:02:20.459> at<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.760> time<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.090> separate

probably nothing's going to happen now

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.780 
probably nothing's going to happen now
for<00:03:19.019> for<00:03:19.560> several<00:03:19.890> days<00:03:20.070> i<00:03:20.220> think<00:03:20.430> i<00:03:20.549> read

for for several days i think i read
recently<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.359> not<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.350> i<00:03:22.410> could<00:03:22.590> remember

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
recently that not that i could remember

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.229 
recently that not that i could remember
but<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.820> last<00:03:24.000> time<00:03:24.329> in<00:03:24.560> 98<00:03:26.030> once<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
but that the last time in 98 once the

but that the last time in 98 once the

would guess we're going to see the month
of<00:03:33.870> july<00:03:34.140> go<00:03:34.380> by<00:03:34.560> before<00:03:34.799> there's<00:03:35.730> any<00:03:35.880> serious

of july go by before there's any serious

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.360 
of july go by before there's any serious
effort<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.530> try<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:37.829> get<00:03:37.920> together<00:03:38.070> again

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370

effort to to try and get together again
and<00:03:38.700> this<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.030> little<00:03:39.269> bit<00:03:39.390> different<00:03:39.780> than

and this is a little bit different than

season was reduced to 50 games and you

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.720 
season was reduced to 50 games and you
just<00:03:48.120> mentioned<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.540> they<00:03:48.660> didn't<00:03:48.870> meet<00:03:49.079> for

just mentioned that they didn't meet for
36<00:03:50.730> days<00:03:50.820> from<00:03:51.690> what<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.109> know<00:03:52.290> about<00:03:52.470> what's

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
36 days from what you know about what's

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.890 
36 days from what you know about what's
going<00:03:52.859> on<00:03:53.130> right<00:03:53.430> now<00:03:53.459> do<00:03:54.359> you<00:03:54.510> anticipate

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
going on right now do you anticipate

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.900 
going on right now do you anticipate
seeing<00:03:55.440> perhaps<00:03:55.859> maybe<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.220> repeat<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.730> what

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
seeing perhaps maybe a repeat of what

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.940 
seeing perhaps maybe a repeat of what
happened<00:03:56.970> back<00:03:57.359> in<00:03:57.390> 98<00:03:57.900> well<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.500> hope<00:03:58.739> there's

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
happened back in 98 well I hope there's

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.740 
happened back in 98 well I hope there's
not<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.100> repeat<00:03:59.489> where<00:03:59.609> you<00:03:59.730> lose<00:03:59.850> 50<00:04:00.299> games<00:04:00.540> I

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
not a repeat where you lose 50 games I

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.319 
not a repeat where you lose 50 games I
certainly<00:04:01.440> do<00:04:01.709> see<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.519> there's<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:03.000> definite

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
certainly do see that there's a definite

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.750 
certainly do see that there's a definite
possibility<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:04.230> losing<00:04:04.590> some<00:04:05.220> games<00:04:05.489> at<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
possibility to losing some games at the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.309 
possibility to losing some games at the
start<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.299> season<00:04:06.510> but<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.109> know<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.230> think

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
start of the season but you know I think

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.410 
start of the season but you know I think
people<00:04:07.709> put<00:04:08.340> too<00:04:08.489> much<00:04:08.609> emphasis<00:04:09.120> on<00:04:09.239> how<00:04:09.359> many

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
people put too much emphasis on how many

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.090 
people put too much emphasis on how many
days<00:04:09.750> are<00:04:09.989> left<00:04:10.049> i<00:04:10.350> mean<00:04:10.500> when<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.739> parties

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
days are left i mean when the parties

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.099 
days are left i mean when the parties
are<00:04:11.130> ready<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.670> make<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.850> deal<00:04:12.120> they<00:04:12.750> can<00:04:12.930> make<00:04:13.079> a
