 seemed to have had no effect all this 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.269
 done without a door then violently 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.400
 he was about to slaughter the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.900
 scholars when teleporting to 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.940
 suddenly several kilometers from 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.549
 there a smirk appeared on 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.040
 his face when he realized that his 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.510

 and especially the bettors so far all to 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.340
 does this to avoid 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.290
 inescapable reunion with the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.560
 doctor misses but he knows full well 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.940
 that the confrontation approaches the future 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.069
