00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
having just six timeouts you'll notice

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.650 
having just six timeouts you'll notice
there's<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> little<00:01:01.320> bit<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> give<00:01:02.100> here<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
there's a little bit of give here and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750 
there's a little bit of give here and
it's<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.260> hear<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.739> wind<00:01:05.220> blowing

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it's you can hear the the wind blowing

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.230 
it's you can hear the the wind blowing
and<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.780> see<00:01:07.729> how<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.880> there's<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and you can see how it's there's a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.359 
and you can see how it's there's a
little<00:01:09.420> bit<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.540> give<00:01:09.720> there<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.130> want

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
little bit of give there but if you want

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
little bit of give there but if you want
a<00:01:11.490> much<00:01:11.700> tighter<00:01:11.970> pitch<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.479> whatever<00:01:12.630> reason

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
a much tighter pitch for whatever reason

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.469 
a much tighter pitch for whatever reason
then<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.350> could<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.710> tie<00:01:14.040> outs<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
then you could go with a tie outs so you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.880 
then you could go with a tie outs so you
have<00:01:15.600> two<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.900> each<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> sides<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
have two on each of the sides here I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.850 
have two on each of the sides here I
don't<00:01:17.189> mind<00:01:17.369> I'm<00:01:17.909> fine<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.740> just<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
don't mind I'm fine with the just the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.940 
don't mind I'm fine with the just the
six<00:01:20.150> but<00:01:21.150> let's<00:01:21.360> go<00:01:22.430> inside<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.729> check<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.970> out

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
six but let's go inside and check it out

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
six but let's go inside and check it out
here<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> Z<00:01:26.340> packs<00:01:26.580> logo<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
here is the Z packs logo this is a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.539 
here is the Z packs logo this is a
neuron<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> blue<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.759> noticed<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:31.549> this

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
neuron with the blue I noticed and this

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.249 
neuron with the blue I noticed and this
is<00:01:32.729> how<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> also<00:01:33.180> differentiate<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.960> front

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
is how I also differentiate the front

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.260 
is how I also differentiate the front
from<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.950> back<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.460> could<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.939> wanted<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
from the back I could if I wanted to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.690 
from the back I could if I wanted to
this<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.840> kind<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.439> simple<00:01:38.009> if<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
this is just kind of like a simple if I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.289 
this is just kind of like a simple if I
was<00:01:38.850> out<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.960> know<00:01:40.439> overnight<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.909> would<00:01:42.090> be

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
was out you know overnight this would be

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.690 
was out you know overnight this would be
if<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:43.079> was<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.380> passing<00:01:43.799> showers<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.460> light

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
if it was just passing showers or light

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.139 
if it was just passing showers or light
rain<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.170> kind<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.590> simple<00:01:46.770> setup

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
rain this is just kind of a simple setup

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.330 
rain this is just kind of a simple setup

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
where you can check out different

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.710 
where you can check out different
configuring<00:01:52.829> configurations<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:54.329> gonna<00:01:54.479> set

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
configuring configurations I'm gonna set

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.359 
configuring configurations I'm gonna set
this<00:01:54.810> up<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.290> several<00:01:55.950> different

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this up and do it several different

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.760 
this up and do it several different
configurations<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.290> see<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.500> have

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
below to my blog I will have kind of a

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.370 
below to my blog I will have kind of a
rationale<00:04:31.070> behind<00:04:31.220> why<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.570> chose<00:04:33.080> this

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
rationale behind why I chose this

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.370 
rationale behind why I chose this
particular<00:04:33.790> setup<00:04:34.790> and<00:04:35.090> then<00:04:35.720> how<00:04:36.020> things<00:04:36.260> are

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
particular setup and then how things are

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.400 
particular setup and then how things are
different<00:04:36.530> in<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.780> other<00:04:38.780> half<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.290> year

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
different in the other half of the year

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.850 
different in the other half of the year
I<00:04:39.440> divided<00:04:39.980> into<00:04:40.280> two<00:04:40.810> different<00:04:41.810> like<00:04:42.560> parts

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
I divided into two different like parts

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.800 
I divided into two different like parts
of<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.070> year

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
of the year

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.000 
of the year
like<00:04:44.810> when<00:04:44.960> it's<00:04:45.080> colder<00:04:45.440> temperatures<00:04:45.860> and

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
like when it's colder temperatures and

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.780 
like when it's colder temperatures and
when<00:04:46.160> it's<00:04:46.280> warmer<00:04:46.580> temperatures<00:04:47.060> so<00:04:47.780> yeah

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
when it's warmer temperatures so yeah

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.790 
when it's warmer temperatures so yeah
this<00:04:49.790> one<00:04:50.330> just<00:04:50.480> quick<00:04:50.630> note<00:04:50.900> this<00:04:51.230> will<00:04:51.620> be

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
this one just quick note this will be

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.830 
this one just quick note this will be
used<00:04:52.280> without<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.610> bivy<00:04:52.940> because<00:04:53.150> as<00:04:53.330> you've

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
used without a bivy because as you've

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.510 
used without a bivy because as you've
seen<00:04:54.050> here<00:04:54.350> there's<00:04:54.560> plenty<00:04:54.830> of<00:04:55.070> room<00:04:55.340> I'm

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
seen here there's plenty of room I'm

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.460 
seen here there's plenty of room I'm
sitting<00:04:55.700> up<00:04:55.970> you<00:04:56.510> know<00:04:56.630> my<00:04:56.780> head<00:04:56.960> is<00:04:57.080> barely

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
sitting up you know my head is barely

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.070 
sitting up you know my head is barely
poking<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.920> top<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.280> I<00:04:58.340> got<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.490> hat<00:04:58.670> on<00:04:58.820> but<00:04:59.540> I

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
poking the top and I got a hat on but I

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.730 
poking the top and I got a hat on but I
would<00:05:00.860> in<00:05:01.340> not<00:05:01.730> be<00:05:01.880> using<00:05:02.270> this<00:05:03.260> tarp<00:05:03.560> with<00:05:03.710> a

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
would in not be using this tarp with a

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.470 
would in not be using this tarp with a
bivy<00:05:04.160> I<00:05:04.190> think<00:05:04.460> it's<00:05:04.580> plenty<00:05:04.970> of<00:05:05.060> space<00:05:05.300> I

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
bivy I think it's plenty of space I

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
I could double up the guidelines or even

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.810 
I could double up the guidelines or even
stake<00:05:12.500> one<00:05:12.770> side<00:05:13.040> you<00:05:13.340> know<00:05:13.490> down<00:05:13.670> to<00:05:13.700> the
