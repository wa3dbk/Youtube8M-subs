00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.420
 the bambuco 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.040
 the bambuco is one of the rhythmic forms 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.590
 most beautiful of South America and 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.019
 characteristic of the zone of colombia 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.119
 has a great pair in tesco with others 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.280
 rhythms that later we will see 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.980
 venezuela as well as ecuador 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.350
 all that area is influenced by the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.130
 presence of the black race and that gives 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.650
 a certain special feature to your 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.210
 already mestiza music with respect to the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.330
 music that existed before and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.200
 Spanish influence we have chosen a 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.840
 beautiful bambuco called the greedy cat 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.170
 that has the following chords 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.170
 higher 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.620
 my minor 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.559
 the seventh 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.410
 re 7a 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.740
 and sun greater 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.479
 followed by minor sun 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.290
 those are the chords that we're going to 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.950
 use note that the positions of 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.110
 re major and re seventh 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.400
 They are made the way 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.180
 alternative as we have already seen when 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.750
 we list the chords because to 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.910
 keep the sixth string from blowing 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.740
 and that produces that sensation 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.620
 unpleasant that we already talked about that happens 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.229
 in the network chords therefore the re 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.330
 we're going to do it this way and 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.680
 the seventh we're going to do this 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.590
 way 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:50.070
 the bambuco taking the greater re that is the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.070
 tonal center as a reference sounds like this 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.240
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta is subdivided 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:09.190
 in three times each of its compasses 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:13.120
 a 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 points 3 and in detail 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.000
 the right hand is used like this 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 one ruled down one up 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.190
 a click and then a quick 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.190
 up and another down 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.170
 using the chords that we have 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.200
 mentioned let's practice 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.489
 corresponding to how you play with the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.489
 right hand a bambuco 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.920
 and now with the help of another instrument 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.950
 making the melodic line let's listen to 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.080
 fragment of this beautiful subject called the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.500
 greedy cat 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.500
 i 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.439
 Y 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.190
 Y
