this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.310> unpasteurized<00:00:27.060> miso<00:00:27.630> which<00:00:28.289> is

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
this is unpasteurized miso which is

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.009 
this is unpasteurized miso which is
really<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:29.369> flavor<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.880> also<00:00:30.330> because<00:00:30.689> miso

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
really for flavor and also because miso

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.380 
really for flavor and also because miso
is<00:00:31.080> very<00:00:31.260> nutritious<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
is very nutritious but I think the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.650 
is very nutritious but I think the
confusion<00:00:33.600> came<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.520> a<00:00:35.520> lot<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> us<00:00:36.420> think

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
confusion came from a lot of us think

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.479 
confusion came from a lot of us think
that<00:00:36.780> that's<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.320> creates<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> bacterial

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
that that's what creates the bacterial

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.440 
that that's what creates the bacterial
cultures<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:40.460> that<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.820> don't<00:00:41.969> even<00:00:42.120> need<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
cultures and that we don't even need the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.160 
cultures and that we don't even need the
miso<00:00:42.809> at<00:00:42.930> all

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
miso at all

which we're going to start to

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.580 
which we're going to start to
proliferate<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.760> culture<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.410> I've

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
proliferate as we culture it so I've

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.990 
proliferate as we culture it so I've
just<00:01:01.620> taken<00:01:01.859> some<00:01:02.309> salt<00:01:02.579> which<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
just taken some salt which is going to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.969 
just taken some salt which is going to
give<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> some<00:01:03.359> flavor<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:04.619> bit<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
give it some flavor a little bit of

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.880 
give it some flavor a little bit of
shapes<00:01:05.510> through<00:01:06.510> I'm<00:01:06.750> sprinkling<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.590> through

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
shapes through I'm sprinkling it through

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.710 
really press the cabbage down what we're
doing<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.490> we're<00:01:53.640> compressing<00:01:54.000> out<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.479> air

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
doing is we're compressing out the air

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.530 
doing is we're compressing out the air
and<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.310> really<00:01:56.549> important<00:01:57.299> as

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
and that's really really important as

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.420 
and that's really really important as
we're<00:01:57.750> making<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:58.110> salad<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.950> want<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> go

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
we're making the salad so you want to go

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.660 
we're making the salad so you want to go
in<00:01:59.759> stages<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.540> layers<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.369> you<00:02:02.369> want<00:02:02.549> to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
in stages and layers and you want to

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.320 
in stages and layers and you want to
just<00:02:02.790> keep<00:02:03.090> pressing<00:02:03.900> down<00:02:04.580> quite<00:02:05.580> firmly<00:02:05.909> and

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
just keep pressing down quite firmly and

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.199 
just keep pressing down quite firmly and
just<00:02:06.570> pushing<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> air<00:02:07.560> out<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.800> there<00:02:08.149> it's<00:02:09.149> a

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
just pushing the air out of there it's a

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.229 
just pushing the air out of there it's a
big<00:02:10.130> one<00:02:11.130> of<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.280> biggest<00:02:11.640> things<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.090> see

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
big one of the biggest things I see

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.090 
big one of the biggest things I see
people<00:02:12.600> doing<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.200> they're<00:02:13.380> not<00:02:13.560> packing

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
people doing is that they're not packing

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.250 
people doing is that they're not packing
their<00:02:14.340> salad<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:15.030> enough<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.810> then<00:02:15.959> too<00:02:16.080> much

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
their salad in enough and then too much

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.750 
their salad in enough and then too much
air<00:02:16.500> gets<00:02:16.770> in<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:18.330> could<00:02:18.510> create<00:02:19.340> mold<00:02:20.340> and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
air gets in and it could create mold and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.650 
air gets in and it could create mold and
other<00:02:20.880> issues<00:02:21.470> okay<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.970> final<00:02:24.480> layer

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
other issues okay so this final layer

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.190 
other issues okay so this final layer
here<00:02:25.110> I'm<00:02:25.560> doing<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.519> this<00:02:26.610> mini<00:02:27.540> little<00:02:27.930> jar

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
here I'm doing for this mini little jar

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.590 
here I'm doing for this mini little jar
maybe<00:02:28.530> I'll<00:02:28.769> do<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.130> little<00:02:29.220> bit<00:02:29.489> more<00:02:29.820> keep

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
maybe I'll do it a little bit more keep

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.050 
maybe I'll do it a little bit more keep
pressing<00:02:30.930> down<00:02:31.610> there's<00:02:32.610> many<00:02:32.820> different

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
pressing down there's many different

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.059 
pressing down there's many different
ways<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:34.220> do<00:02:35.220> culture<00:02:36.739> cabbage<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.950> other

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
ways to do culture cabbage and other

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.309 
ways to do culture cabbage and other
vegetables<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.290> I

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
vegetables but this is the one that I

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.370 
vegetables but this is the one that I
like<00:02:40.620> because<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.580> keeps<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.000> nice<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.050> secure

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
like because it keeps it nice and secure

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.840 
like because it keeps it nice and secure
in<00:02:45.080> when<00:02:46.080> you're<00:02:46.200> storing<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.700> can

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
in when you're storing it and you can

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.940 
in when you're storing it and you can
actually<00:02:48.030> it'll<00:02:48.930> be<00:02:49.140> right<00:02:49.319> in<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.500> couple<00:02:49.769> days

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
actually it'll be right in a couple days

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.650 
actually it'll be right in a couple days
but<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.700> batch<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.180> there<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.569> I've

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
but I have a batch in there that I've

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.890 
but I have a batch in there that I've
been<00:02:51.780> keeping<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.470> couple<00:02:53.010> weeks<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.660> just

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
been keeping a couple weeks you can just

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.530 
been keeping a couple weeks you can just
know<00:02:55.739> one<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.220> four<00:02:56.430> weeks<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.940> how<00:02:56.970> long<00:02:57.299> you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
know one to four weeks is how long you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.840 
know one to four weeks is how long you
can<00:02:57.720> keep<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.079> if<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.440> go<00:02:58.980> away<00:02:59.190> for<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.549> couple

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
can keep it if you go away for a couple

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.490 
can keep it if you go away for a couple
days<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.329> it's<00:03:00.570> something<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.870> can<00:03:01.140> take<00:03:01.350> a

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
days so it's something that can take a

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.660 
days so it's something that can take a
little<00:03:01.620> bit<00:03:01.829> more<00:03:01.980> time<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:03.510> culture<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:05.160> when

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
little bit more time to culture and when

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.759 
little bit more time to culture and when
it's<00:03:05.820> in<00:03:06.000> jars<00:03:06.299> like<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.200> keeps<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.650> nice

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
it's in jars like this it keeps it nice

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.060 
it's in jars like this it keeps it nice
and<00:03:07.829> secure<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.720> sealed<00:03:09.720> off<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.680> now<00:03:10.890> I've

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
and secure and sealed off so now I've

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.789 
and secure and sealed off so now I've
got<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> couple<00:03:11.489> inches<00:03:11.730> from<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.120> top<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.650> what

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
got a couple inches from the top so what

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.979 
got a couple inches from the top so what
I'm<00:03:13.950> going<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.130> do<00:03:14.340> now<00:03:14.579> is<00:03:14.970> I'm<00:03:15.540> going<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.750> take

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
I'm going to do now is I'm going to take

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.160 
I'm going to do now is I'm going to take
this<00:03:16.230> filtered<00:03:17.220> water<00:03:17.630> never<00:03:18.630> use<00:03:18.900> tap<00:03:19.140> water

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
this filtered water never use tap water

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.140 
this filtered water never use tap water
for<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:19.829> because<00:03:20.100> tap<00:03:20.519> water<00:03:20.730> has<00:03:20.970> some

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
for this because tap water has some

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.610 
for this because tap water has some
chlorine<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.690> elements<00:03:22.049> which<00:03:22.230> might<00:03:22.410> kill

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
chlorine and elements which might kill

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.319 
chlorine and elements which might kill
the<00:03:22.769> natural<00:03:23.070> probiotics<00:03:23.609> and<00:03:24.000> we're<00:03:24.209> going

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
the natural probiotics and we're going

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.920 
the natural probiotics and we're going
to<00:03:24.359> cover<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.829> level<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.690> top

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
to cover it just to the level of the top

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.990 
to cover it just to the level of the top
of<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.170> cabbage<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.130> this<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.790> going<00:03:29.940> to

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
of the cabbage and this is going to

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.420 
of the cabbage and this is going to
start<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.269> make<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> nice<00:03:30.660> brine<00:03:31.019> we<00:03:31.980> know<00:03:32.160> now

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
start to make a nice brine we know now

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.310 
start to make a nice brine we know now
that<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.850> salt<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.480> going<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.690> also<00:03:33.959> draw<00:03:34.170> out

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
that the salt is going to also draw out

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.380 
that the salt is going to also draw out
more<00:03:34.500> moisture<00:03:34.950> from<00:03:35.100> the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
more moisture from the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.510 
more moisture from the
savage<00:03:35.690> but<00:03:36.260> everything<00:03:36.650> is<00:03:36.740> going<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:37.040> expand

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
savage but everything is going to expand

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.520 
savage but everything is going to expand
we<00:03:37.790> don't<00:03:38.000> need<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.270> do<00:03:38.450> any<00:03:38.630> more<00:03:38.930> water<00:03:39.260> than

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
we don't need to do any more water than

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.550 
we don't need to do any more water than
that<00:03:40.570> before<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:41.780> started<00:03:42.110> shredding<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
that before I started shredding the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.440 
that before I started shredding the
cabbage<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:43.070> took<00:03:43.520> some<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.910> nice<00:03:44.060> whole

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
cabbage I took some of the nice whole

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.230 
cabbage I took some of the nice whole
leaves<00:03:44.780> here<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.440> what<00:03:46.280> I'm<00:03:46.370> going<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.580> do<00:03:46.790> is

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
leaves here and what I'm going to do is

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.690

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
I'm going to start to roll them tightly

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.750 
I'm going to start to roll them tightly
and<00:03:50.270> I'm<00:03:51.230> going<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.560> pack<00:03:51.800> them<00:03:52.100> in<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.640> the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
and I'm going to pack them in to the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.120 
and I'm going to pack them in to the
rest<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.210> space<00:03:53.620> again<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:54.770> is<00:03:54.950> all

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
rest of the space again this is all

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.650 
rest of the space again this is all
going<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:56.200> compress<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.530> change<00:03:57.830> as<00:03:58.130> the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
going to compress and change as the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.410 
going to compress and change as the
probiotics<00:03:59.660> start<00:03:59.930> to<00:04:00.200> proliferate

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
probiotics start to proliferate

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.280 
probiotics start to proliferate
everything's<00:04:02.420> going<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.570> start<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.870> expand

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
everything's going to start to expand

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.500 
everything's going to start to expand
this<00:04:03.800> is<00:04:03.980> going<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.250> push<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.580> leaves<00:04:04.820> up<00:04:05.030> and

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
this is going to push the leaves up and

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.170 
this is going to push the leaves up and
the<00:04:06.290> leaves<00:04:06.530> are<00:04:06.740> actually<00:04:06.890> in<00:04:07.370> contact<00:04:07.640> with

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
the leaves are actually in contact with

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.990 
the leaves are actually in contact with
some<00:04:08.450> air<00:04:08.720> at<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.959> top<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.400> really<00:04:10.700> common

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
some air at the top so a really common

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.620 
some air at the top so a really common
question<00:04:11.360> I<00:04:11.480> get<00:04:11.540> is<00:04:11.959> oh<00:04:13.000> there's<00:04:14.000> black<00:04:14.270> spots

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
question I get is oh there's black spots

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.370 
question I get is oh there's black spots
on<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.930> leaves

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
on the leaves

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.890 
on the leaves
does<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:15.980> spoil<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.489> whole<00:04:16.640> jar<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.329> say

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
does it spoil the whole jar I say

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.170 
does it spoil the whole jar I say
generally<00:04:18.380> no<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:19.459> has<00:04:19.609> to<00:04:19.760> do<00:04:19.910> with<00:04:20.060> the

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
generally no that has to do with the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.080 
generally no that has to do with the
contact<00:04:20.720> with<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.079> air<00:04:21.320> be<00:04:22.280> sure<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.520> smell

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
contact with the air be sure to smell

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
contact with the air be sure to smell
your<00:04:24.040> salad<00:04:25.040> before<00:04:25.400> you<00:04:25.520> try<00:04:25.790> it<00:04:25.990> use<00:04:26.990> your

your salad before you try it use your

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.600 
your salad before you try it use your
common<00:04:27.470> sense<00:04:27.500> if<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:27.919> smells<00:04:28.130> like<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:28.460> gone

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
common sense if it smells like it's gone

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.120 
common sense if it smells like it's gone
off<00:04:28.820> for<00:04:29.000> some<00:04:29.150> reason<00:04:29.419> don't<00:04:29.540> eat<00:04:29.780> it<00:04:30.010> but<00:04:31.010> in

off for some reason don't eat it but in

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.800 
off for some reason don't eat it but in
general<00:04:31.610> because<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.030> contact<00:04:32.450> of<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.600> air

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
general because the contact of the air

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.510 
general because the contact of the air
there's<00:04:33.230> just<00:04:33.500> some<00:04:33.680> black<00:04:33.860> spots<00:04:34.040> in<00:04:34.400> the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
there's just some black spots in the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.850 
there's just some black spots in the
upper<00:04:34.550> leaves<00:04:35.120> you<00:04:35.780> can<00:04:35.900> discard<00:04:36.380> them<00:04:36.680> and

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
upper leaves you can discard them and

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.920 
upper leaves you can discard them and
then<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.160> rest<00:04:37.400> of<00:04:37.610> your<00:04:37.820> mixture<00:04:38.510> which<00:04:38.750> is

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
then the rest of your mixture which is

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.250 
then the rest of your mixture which is
safe<00:04:39.169> in<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.620> anaerobic<00:04:40.630> Brian<00:04:41.630> underneath

safe in the anaerobic Brian underneath
the<00:04:42.440> water<00:04:42.650> should<00:04:43.280> still<00:04:43.520> be<00:04:43.669> okay<00:04:43.970> okay<00:04:44.810> so<00:04:44.870> I

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
the water should still be okay okay so I

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.710 
the water should still be okay okay so I
packed<00:04:45.470> in<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.979> leaves<00:04:46.300> pack<00:04:47.300> them<00:04:47.510> up<00:04:47.570> as

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
packed in the leaves pack them up as

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.360 
packed in the leaves pack them up as
much<00:04:47.870> as<00:04:48.020> you<00:04:48.050> can<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.470> do<00:04:48.710> one<00:04:48.890> more<00:04:48.919> to<00:04:49.310> the

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
much as you can and do one more to the

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.590 
much as you can and do one more to the
top<00:04:50.830> great<00:04:52.720> so<00:04:53.720> now<00:04:53.930> I'm<00:04:54.410> going<00:04:54.590> to<00:04:54.680> firmly

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
top great so now I'm going to firmly

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.909 
top great so now I'm going to firmly
place<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.780> top<00:04:56.990> on<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:58.270> jar<00:04:59.270> and<00:04:59.919> usually

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
place the top on the jar and usually

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.050 
place the top on the jar and usually
what<00:05:01.040> I<00:05:01.070> do<00:05:01.160> is<00:05:01.250> I<00:05:01.400> take<00:05:01.520> a<00:05:01.580> piece<00:05:01.820> of<00:05:01.850> masking

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
what I do is I take a piece of masking

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.719 
what I do is I take a piece of masking
tape<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.720> I<00:05:02.840> write<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.500> date<00:05:03.830> that<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.130> started

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
tape and I write the date that I started

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.050 
tape and I write the date that I started
the<00:05:05.360> batch<00:05:05.560> now<00:05:06.560> we're<00:05:07.370> coming<00:05:07.520> into<00:05:07.760> summer

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
the batch now we're coming into summer

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.940 
the batch now we're coming into summer
so<00:05:08.330> there's<00:05:08.510> a<00:05:08.600> lot<00:05:08.840> of<00:05:09.020> air<00:05:09.169> conditioning<00:05:09.770> I

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
so there's a lot of air conditioning I

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.210 
so there's a lot of air conditioning I
use

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
use

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.840 
use

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
cool dark cabinet I use these

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.540 
cool dark cabinet I use these
temperature<00:05:18.510> controlled<00:05:18.900> bags<00:05:19.190> just<00:05:20.190> because

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
temperature controlled bags just because

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.130 
temperature controlled bags just because
there's<00:05:20.850> a<00:05:20.910> lot<00:05:21.030> of<00:05:21.150> fluctuation<00:05:21.780> here<00:05:21.810> in<00:05:22.050> the

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
there's a lot of fluctuation here in the

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.080 
there's a lot of fluctuation here in the
house<00:05:22.350> with<00:05:22.820> air-conditioner<00:05:23.820> and<00:05:23.850> this

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
house with air-conditioner and this

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.790 
house with air-conditioner and this
keeps<00:05:24.300> them<00:05:24.480> at<00:05:24.600> a<00:05:24.630> nice<00:05:24.840> temperature<00:05:25.230> you

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
keeps them at a nice temperature you

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.940 
keeps them at a nice temperature you
want<00:05:25.920> to<00:05:26.070> take<00:05:26.220> them<00:05:26.370> about<00:05:26.490> 70<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.500> 75<00:05:28.500> degrees

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
want to take them about 70 to 75 degrees

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.250 
want to take them about 70 to 75 degrees
is<00:05:29.100> ideal<00:05:29.460> so<00:05:29.820> actually<00:05:30.600> store<00:05:30.870> them<00:05:31.050> in<00:05:31.140> my

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
is ideal so actually store them in my

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.370 
is ideal so actually store them in my
little<00:05:31.560> bags<00:05:31.740> my<00:05:32.610> which<00:05:33.510> is<00:05:33.660> quite<00:05:33.930> convenient

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
little bags my which is quite convenient

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.140 
little bags my which is quite convenient
and<00:05:34.710> I<00:05:34.770> keep<00:05:34.980> them<00:05:35.160> in<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.370> other<00:05:35.520> room<00:05:35.790> and<00:05:36.030> it

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
and I keep them in the other room and it

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.300 
and I keep them in the other room and it
keeps<00:05:36.780> them<00:05:36.930> at<00:05:37.050> a<00:05:37.080> nice<00:05:37.230> temperature<00:05:37.800> you<00:05:38.160> can

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
keeps them at a nice temperature you can

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.360 
keeps them at a nice temperature you can
also<00:05:38.460> check<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:38.850> temperature<00:05:39.420> of<00:05:39.450> course

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
also check the temperature of course

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.070 
also check the temperature of course
this<00:05:41.370> is<00:05:41.580> uh<00:05:41.610> I<00:05:42.120> have<00:05:42.420> another<00:05:42.480> mixture<00:05:43.020> in

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
this is uh I have another mixture in
