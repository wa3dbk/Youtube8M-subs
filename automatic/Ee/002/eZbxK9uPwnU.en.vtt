00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.039 

now<00:01:34.640> if<00:01:34.790> you<00:01:34.909> watch<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.330> gauge<00:01:35.479> closely

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
now if you watch the gauge closely

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.020 
now if you watch the gauge closely
you'll<00:01:36.409> see<00:01:36.500> we<00:01:36.830> hit<00:01:36.979> our<00:01:37.009> low<00:01:37.310> boost<00:01:37.549> level<00:01:37.909> of

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
you'll see we hit our low boost level of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.499 
you'll see we hit our low boost level of
8<00:01:38.210> psi<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.520> then<00:01:40.520> after<00:01:40.820> we<00:01:40.939> hit<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.240> switch

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
8 psi and then after we hit the switch

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:51.580 
8 psi and then after we hit the switch
boost<00:01:42.350> jumps<00:01:42.740> up<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.130> 13<00:01:43.580> psi

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.100 

you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
you

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.180 
you
and<00:01:53.970> our<00:01:54.970> log<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.510> can<00:01:55.660> see<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.990> base<00:01:56.200> 8<00:01:56.530> psi

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
and our log you can see the base 8 psi

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.130 
and our log you can see the base 8 psi
boost<00:01:57.490> curve<00:01:57.790> with<00:01:58.240> our<00:01:58.390> scramble<00:01:58.930> boost

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
curve overlay it on top of it and you

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.120 
curve overlay it on top of it and you
can<00:02:01.870> obviously<00:02:02.020> see<00:02:02.470> where<00:02:02.710> we<00:02:02.860> hit<00:02:03.010> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
can obviously see where we hit the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.640 
can obviously see where we hit the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
remember that scramble boost is

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.270 
remember that scramble boost is
essentially<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.450> third<00:02:07.900> running<00:02:08.320> mode<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.770> it

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
essentially a third running mode and it

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.800 
essentially a third running mode and it
can<00:02:09.399> be<00:02:09.490> set<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.790> either<00:02:09.820> increase<00:02:10.570> or
