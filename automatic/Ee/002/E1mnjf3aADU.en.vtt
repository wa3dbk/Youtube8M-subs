00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello today with you again marina 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.429
 and we will cook goulash in a slow cooker 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.910
 for the goulash in the slow cooker we need 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.450
 300 grams of pork did not take the pork neck 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.970
 1 medium sized onion 1 slice 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.869
 garlic large bay leaf black 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.710
 bell pepper 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:29.029
 tomato paste a couple tablespoons of flour 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.029
 and water first diced meat 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.110
 the meat we have streaked fat is nothing 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.100
 scary if there are things or something 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.230
 the skin on it is necessary to remove cut 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.260
 not very big cubes somewhere 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.590
 centimeters they 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.590
 centimeter evil 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.200
 something like this 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:25.399
 while we cut meat we include the crock-pot 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.399
 pour the oil so that it is heated 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.250
 turn on the slow cooker on the frying mode 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.810
 also cut for chop the meat onions 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:53.069
 You can add more cubes to your wish. 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:58.159
 carrots instead of tomato paste can 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:58.159
 use ketchup or tomatoes 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:20.450
 so many people will deal with meat immediately 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:25.200
 cutting only oil will heat up 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:29.760
 put there meat and fry until 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.590
 the meat will not become a light color so 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.069
 garlic we need too fine 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.879
 we chop it will fry together 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.879
 with onion 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:58.580
 we have everything prepared left only 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:04.420
 fry and so the slow cooker reported that 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.420
 she has already heated down we put meat there and 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.740
 fry until those pieces take 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:17.720
 light such a tariff color and then 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:21.140
 add garlic and flour in tomato paste 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.040
 Five minutes passed and became two of the most 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:31.960
 uniform gray add there 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.960
 onion and garlic and fry with meat 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.180
 pork cooks faster than beef and 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:04.150
 so the meat along with the onions fry more 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:08.170
 5-6 minutes now we add flour 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.170
 somewhere tablespoon 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.500
 we mix to us to thicken 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:42.060
 so that our kulash was not liquid right away 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:45.600
 imbibed the oil flour as such is not visible 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.600
 liquid is gone 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:05:05.390
 as we include the mode of frying we add 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:08.240
 tomato paste and a half two tablespoons 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:18.290
 spoons spoon 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:21.520
 with a walk and add salt spices for 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:25.100
 such meat you like 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:31.250
 so i'm adding pepper pepper mix to me 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:34.390
 where that half a teaspoon of black we are here 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:42.620
 white and allspice and red 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:47.780
 then add salt tea incomplete 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:50.380
 spoon pour it all with boiling water pour 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.380
 boiling water 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.870
 now let's see 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:30.460
 add bay leaf pepper and 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:32.590
 We put the stew for 1 hour looking well if 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:41.490
 you will cook it must be sweet 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:41.490
 longer so close the day carcass mode 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:07:02.740
 start an hour has passed let's see what u 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:05.440
 got us if you think that 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.280
 only you are watery i.e. gravy 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.740
 watery 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.139
 can add one teaspoon 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.979
 starch diluted in a tablespoon 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:19.169
 water it all literally on minutes 5 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:22.419
 boil then you will thicken 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:26.169
 for me from goulash normal 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:28.500
 consistency well served with boiled 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:31.960
 rice in speech 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.000
