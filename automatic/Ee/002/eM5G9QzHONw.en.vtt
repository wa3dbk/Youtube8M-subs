wedding between two men yeah and I'm

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.760 
wedding between two men yeah and I'm
wondering<00:04:38.730> how<00:04:39.000> you<00:04:39.420> think<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.960> media<00:04:40.200> can

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
wondering how you think the media can

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.280 
wondering how you think the media can
make<00:04:40.950> an<00:04:41.070> impact<00:04:41.250> in<00:04:41.820> terms<00:04:41.880> of<00:04:42.300> more

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
make an impact in terms of more

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.140 
make an impact in terms of more
acceptance<00:04:43.830> for<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.130> LGBT<00:04:44.580> community<00:04:45.060> I

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
acceptance for the LGBT community I

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.530 
acceptance for the LGBT community I
think<00:04:45.890> just<00:04:46.890> with<00:04:47.130> all<00:04:47.340> social<00:04:47.790> issues<00:04:48.300> on

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
think just with all social issues on

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.260 
think just with all social issues on
visibility<00:04:49.020> I<00:04:49.590> think<00:04:50.130> is<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.460> real<00:04:50.940> big

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
visibility I think is a real big

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.080 
visibility I think is a real big
catalyst<00:04:51.870> for<00:04:52.020> change<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:52.680> so<00:04:53.430> I<00:04:53.460> think<00:04:53.550> the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
catalyst for change and so I think the

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.260 
catalyst for change and so I think the
media<00:04:54.320> you<00:04:55.320> know<00:04:55.470> has<00:04:55.980> a<00:04:56.010> responsibility<00:04:56.610> to

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
media you know has a responsibility to

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.300 
media you know has a responsibility to
help<00:04:57.419> move<00:04:57.840> forward<00:04:58.530> for<00:04:58.919> social<00:04:59.280> change

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
help move forward for social change

help move forward for social change
