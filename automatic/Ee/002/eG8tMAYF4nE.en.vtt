00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
oh so taking that into consideration

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.470 
oh so taking that into consideration
like<00:03:59.960> knowing<00:04:00.320> how<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.950> animated<00:04:01.940> models<00:04:02.300> you

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
like knowing how the animated models you

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.600 
like knowing how the animated models you
know<00:04:02.540> operate<00:04:02.960> in<00:04:03.050> that<00:04:03.200> world<00:04:03.440> does<00:04:04.370> that

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
know operate in that world does that

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.210 
know operate in that world does that
translate<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.720> some<00:04:06.380> of<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.530> helm<00:04:06.770> work<00:04:07.010> you

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
translate to some of the helm work you

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.400 
translate to some of the helm work you
do<00:04:07.370> like<00:04:07.850> really<00:04:08.570> does<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:09.140> stuff<00:04:09.260> together

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
do like really does that stuff together

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.470 
do like really does that stuff together
like<00:04:09.560> like<00:04:09.860> bearing<00:04:10.160> in<00:04:10.250> mind<00:04:10.280> where<00:04:10.730> I<00:04:11.090> lines

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
like like bearing in mind where I lines

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.820 
like like bearing in mind where I lines
are<00:04:11.630> going<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.810> be<00:04:11.990> how<00:04:12.290> it's<00:04:12.440> going<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.620> move

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
are going to be how it's going to move

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.040 
are going to be how it's going to move
on<00:04:13.010> a<00:04:13.040> neck<00:04:13.310> I<00:04:13.610> do<00:04:13.820> a<00:04:13.910> lot<00:04:14.090> of<00:04:14.150> measuring<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:14.900> is

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
on a neck I do a lot of measuring it is

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.840 
on a neck I do a lot of measuring it is
a<00:04:15.080> little<00:04:15.380> technical<00:04:15.770> but<00:04:16.040> I<00:04:16.250> have<00:04:16.520> gotten<00:04:16.760> to

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
a little technical but I have gotten to

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.210 
a little technical but I have gotten to
the<00:04:17.000> point<00:04:17.150> where<00:04:17.330> I<00:04:17.720> tend<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:18.530> more<00:04:18.739> yeah

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
the point where I tend to I it more yeah

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
the point where I tend to I it more yeah
um<00:04:19.489> but<00:04:20.060> it's<00:04:20.300> like<00:04:20.510> working<00:04:20.690> in<00:04:20.930> your<00:04:21.080> X<00:04:21.230> Y<00:04:21.440> Z

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
um but it's like working in your X Y Z

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.870 
um but it's like working in your X Y Z
parameters<00:04:23.240> in<00:04:23.780> like<00:04:24.170> a<00:04:24.350> 3d<00:04:24.770> programming<00:04:25.430> like

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
parameters in like a 3d programming like

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.520 
parameters in like a 3d programming like
you<00:04:26.330> see<00:04:26.510> these<00:04:26.630> guys<00:04:26.810> who<00:04:27.020> didn't<00:04:27.260> do<00:04:27.380> the

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
you see these guys who didn't do the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.490 
you see these guys who didn't do the
shape<00:04:27.770> ways<00:04:28.040> I<00:04:28.340> think<00:04:28.940> its<00:04:29.180> shape<00:04:29.450> ways<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.960> the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
shape ways I think its shape ways I the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.650 
shape ways I think its shape ways I the
3d<00:04:31.010> printed<00:04:31.160> so<00:04:31.490> yes<00:04:31.670> you<00:04:31.700> see<00:04:32.030> them<00:04:32.210> they

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
3d printed so yes you see them they

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.900 
3d printed so yes you see them they
model<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:33.260> first<00:04:33.560> in<00:04:34.190> their<00:04:34.310> 3d<00:04:34.550> programs

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
model that first in their 3d programs

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.760 
model that first in their 3d programs
and<00:04:35.090> then<00:04:35.180> they<00:04:35.300> have<00:04:35.420> it<00:04:35.540> 3d<00:04:35.780> printed<00:04:36.170> in<00:04:36.320> my

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
and then they have it 3d printed in my

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.280 
and then they have it 3d printed in my
mind<00:04:37.190> when<00:04:37.520> I<00:04:37.550> work<00:04:37.820> on<00:04:37.970> helm<00:04:38.240> hats<00:04:38.450> it's<00:04:38.750> much

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
mind when I work on helm hats it's much

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.990 
mind when I work on helm hats it's much
the<00:04:39.320> same<00:04:39.500> thing<00:04:39.710> only<00:04:40.010> it's<00:04:40.160> in<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.490> physical

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
the same thing only it's in a physical

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.660 
the same thing only it's in a physical
aspect<00:04:41.450> yeah<00:04:41.870> so<00:04:42.440> it's<00:04:42.830> like<00:04:43.040> it's<00:04:43.250> sculpting

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
aspect yeah so it's like it's sculpting

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.300 
aspect yeah so it's like it's sculpting
really<00:04:44.330> it's<00:04:44.750> as<00:04:44.900> type<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.290> sculpting<00:04:45.740> and

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
really it's as type of sculpting and

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.620 
really it's as type of sculpting and
with<00:04:46.760> your<00:04:46.880> Helms<00:04:47.120> like<00:04:47.240> what<00:04:47.390> kind<00:04:47.570> of

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
with your Helms like what kind of

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.570 
with your Helms like what kind of
materials<00:04:48.200> do<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:48.440> use<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:49.070> put<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.400> stuff

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
materials do you use to put that stuff

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.610 
materials do you use to put that stuff
together<00:04:49.730> um<00:04:50.090> well<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:50.780> fuse<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.410> phone

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
together um well I fuse the phone

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.400 
together um well I fuse the phone
together<00:04:51.860> with<00:04:52.430> a<00:04:52.460> with<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.000> glue<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:54.230> they<00:04:54.350> do

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
together with a with a glue so they do

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.530 
together with a with a glue so they do
not<00:04:54.620> come<00:04:54.800> undone<00:04:55.100> they<00:04:55.760> are<00:04:55.880> made<00:04:56.030> of<00:04:56.180> craft

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
not come undone they are made of craft

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.750 
not come undone they are made of craft
foam<00:04:56.630> so<00:04:57.140> I<00:04:57.170> by<00:04:57.410> craft<00:04:57.770> foam<00:04:57.890> sheets<00:04:58.280> they're

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
foam so I by craft foam sheets they're

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.330 
foam so I by craft foam sheets they're
flat<00:04:59.090> so<00:04:59.840> what<00:05:00.050> I<00:05:00.080> do<00:05:00.170> is<00:05:00.290> I<00:05:00.530> draw<00:05:00.740> my<00:05:00.770> patterns

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
flat so what I do is I draw my patterns

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.030 
flat so what I do is I draw my patterns
and<00:05:01.640> I<00:05:01.940> usually<00:05:02.270> build<00:05:02.510> like<00:05:02.870> a<00:05:03.140> pattern<00:05:03.710> first

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
and I usually build like a pattern first

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.850 
and I usually build like a pattern first
and<00:05:04.820> then<00:05:05.090> I<00:05:05.120> take<00:05:05.630> that<00:05:05.840> pattern<00:05:06.230> and<00:05:06.440> I<00:05:06.620> use

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
and then I take that pattern and I use

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.070 
and then I take that pattern and I use
it<00:05:06.890> to<00:05:07.340> make<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:07.610> final<00:05:07.910> hat<00:05:08.090> okay<00:05:08.810> so<00:05:08.900> it's

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
it to make the final hat okay so it's

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.500 
it to make the final hat okay so it's
it's<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.500> step<00:05:09.710> process<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.490> i<00:05:11.120> also<00:05:11.300> get

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
it's a step process and i also get

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.570 
it's a step process and i also get
examples<00:05:12.020> while<00:05:12.440> i'm<00:05:12.680> working<00:05:12.860> on<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.430> Hat

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
examples while i'm working on the Hat

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.640 
examples while i'm working on the Hat
building<00:05:14.060> my<00:05:14.210> pattern<00:05:14.690> i'm<00:05:15.110> always<00:05:15.500> looking

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
building my pattern i'm always looking

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.050 
building my pattern i'm always looking
back<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.130> forth<00:05:16.340> at<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.580> pictures<00:05:16.940> from

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
back and forth at the pictures from

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.910 
back and forth at the pictures from
different<00:05:17.450> angles<00:05:17.810> so<00:05:18.230> that<00:05:18.260> way<00:05:18.500> i<00:05:18.530> try<00:05:18.860> to

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
different angles so that way i try to

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.920 
different angles so that way i try to
get<00:05:19.100> it<00:05:19.190> as<00:05:19.250> accurate<00:05:19.730> as<00:05:19.820> possible<00:05:19.930> okay

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
get it as accurate as possible okay

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.130 
get it as accurate as possible okay
character<00:05:21.550> and<00:05:22.550> so<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:22.850> see<00:05:23.060> like<00:05:23.660> really

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
character and so I see like really

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.510 
character and so I see like really
clearly<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:24.590> motivations<00:05:25.130> that<00:05:25.190> leads<00:05:25.400> you

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
clearly the motivations that leads you

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.870 
clearly the motivations that leads you
to<00:05:25.670> do<00:05:25.820> art<00:05:26.030> in<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.450> 2d<00:05:27.430> medium<00:05:28.430> as<00:05:28.580> well<00:05:28.730> as<00:05:28.850> a

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
to do art in the 2d medium as well as a

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.230 
to do art in the 2d medium as well as a
helm<00:05:29.450> physical<00:05:30.050> medium<00:05:30.520> so<00:05:31.520> with<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:32.000> the

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
helm physical medium so with the the

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.460 
helm physical medium so with the the
jewelry<00:05:32.660> side<00:05:32.870> of<00:05:33.050> what<00:05:33.170> you're<00:05:33.260> putting

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
jewelry side of what you're putting

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.320 
jewelry side of what you're putting
together<00:05:33.590> what<00:05:34.460> what<00:05:34.820> does<00:05:34.970> that<00:05:35.000> come<00:05:35.300> from

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
together what what does that come from
