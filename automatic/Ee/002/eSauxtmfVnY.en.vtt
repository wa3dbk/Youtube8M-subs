00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.850
 hello today we will consider the node 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.850
 which is called 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.700
 grapevine still call it double 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.660
 fishing use it for bonding 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.570
 two ropes 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.419
 the same diameter and so we have 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.000
 our two rope ends are parallel to each other 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.779
 a friend so that the rope is on the left 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.480
 is coming 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.559
 there was a rope closest to us which 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.730
 goes to the right was farthest from us and so 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.280
 take our two ropes in your left hand 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.820
 push your thumb and near end 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.839
 ropes 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.699
 here we do a full circle around the finger and 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.329
 ropes like this one more time 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.190
 turnover 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.069
 just not here and cross like this 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:04.010
 push our finger big and instead 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:04.010
 him from left to right we pass our end 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:17.310
 so after that we change our ropes 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.890
 parties and doing the same with 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.370
 the other end is doing a full turn 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.400
 around the rope of the finger do the second 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:31.830
 turn our fingers out and cross out 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.660
 instead we pass the end of the rope here 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.760
 so it turns out we have such two here 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:44.930
 knot 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:46.620
 now we connect them like this and 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.910
 it turns out ready 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.460
 knot very strong reliable knot which 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.960
 called grapevine 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.140
 subscribe to my channel further we 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.740
 consider many more interesting nodes to 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.740
 new meetings
