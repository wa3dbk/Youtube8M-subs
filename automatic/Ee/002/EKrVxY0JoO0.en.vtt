00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
 Chile the matches are won because it is the goal and Chile and only remained as author 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.610
 Pressure 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.610
 he believes so he congratulated him congratulated chile 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:13.669
 to gore their players their leaders 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.589
 and another thing is we have to think we are real now in rooms 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.140
 irun 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 what I'm not willing to accept the labels that kind of life of the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.759
 labels 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.890
 but that's why I'm fine 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.320
 that the media of journalists and even technicians who put up signs 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.800
 both the tired of that 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.239
 so from now on I'm going to start answering when 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.910
 when the signs come 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.260
 because I think it's unfair and deserved kept good night 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.840
 aguirre tested sports 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.030
 last Sunday 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.100
 Goodnight 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.230
 first just minutes please good what do you mean with a resounding yes 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.190
 when we listen I'm second 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.580
 yes 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.920
 lilian tintori sting 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.550
 could have presented the opportunity martín says baldwin and has a little 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.550
 more strength in the mark in the midfield 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.680
 always all that power they forget to link 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.720
 we give a purpose independently 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.660
 to win the match 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.050
 purpose that I have to see these guys 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.190
 give the opportunity to lokarri a potion of tarrío can 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.580
 in which I think it could have hurt us we made a change to win the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.670
 match and not to tie it 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.840
 so that was the volta to the província is possible able but I 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.100
 I mistakenly admit it 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.290
 this 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.360
 but the idea was to try to win the game with 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.180
 with a center forward and two ends that although they were picked up a little they were 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.430
 capable of 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.430
 of creating danger that was the idea 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.480
 you know what it is to win to talk about more 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.480
 When the time comes I will answer to Quintero who 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.420
 rosary beads 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.680
 but they are very very clear 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.900
 it is very clear what of the resounding 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.320
 there are coaches who are offensive coaches who are not 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.250
 aware that they are mice have me rotten with that 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.210
 but rotten lying 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.210
 I'm not going to admit it anymore I'm going to unmask it 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.379
 it is clear 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.089
 and this does not end in all of Chile 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:22.619
 I think there will be from the Midwest of South America and Peru especially in 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:23.709
 everywhere 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.339
 It exists in all countries 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:28.729
 it is very easy to put signs 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:31.599
 too easy 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.090
 you have to be pragmatic to do it better than one can do for the federation 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.450
 who hires him for the team that hires him 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.129
 to deal with the material that the armed struggle wants to take forward 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.169
 already 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.169
 and not make that goal and guessed vote 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.879
 it's very easy when you have the players in the hierarchy that you have 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.039
 devious and offensive 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.099
 I'm tired of it 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.370
 enough already we start to see football in another dimension analyze it from another 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.829
 way 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.430
 good the irab too 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.270
 then I for now chili for channel 13 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.210
 percent and full culture to the chilibroste theme of a well-known our 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.390
 own with the u in a great championship I do not know what it is to go what the antoniano was 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.699
 champion with the u November but what is said 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.739
 afraid that they have put the lots there was not that photo the working university in 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.019
 an incredible championship c 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.019
 hired some championship there 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.699
 to this he said not knowing well what when against all I'm saying contract 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.249
 here the oaks matricida is the deep desire of epic cut to say that chile 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.070
 it was the team that had the best football associated as a liar 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.579
 there is a very strong current 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.109
 type of lominchar and in the Chilean medium says that it can be is the great 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.500
 opportunity for the first time in the public america cup, connoisseur of the medium 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.500
 I think it's your turn to be a champion 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.189
 if I know I do not know anything 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.000
 soccer expressed 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 in his surprise Argentina has just put together a way 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.259
 came out of the way with a victory like yesterday and now it's going to be 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:10.169
 It's going to be very hard I do not know what I can about Brazil and Paraguay if they win tomorrow 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.899
 they will also be a candidate in troja uruguay if they win is also a candidate 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.559
 milestones we already have back to the five of always 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.720
 And also in this I'm going to be a little touch 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.529
 I feel yes 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.529
 the time also started 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.509
 and before that the time also that things are more even at the level of 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.969
 arbitrations 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.719
 it's called parejitas 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.229
 the time has come 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.229
 we are going to start fighting also in that area we do not shut up malabo 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.789
 because I create carbon and did not deserve the expulsion 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.680
 we did it 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.620
 and that changes the outcome of the game 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.620
 he could not contain 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.069
 com 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.430
 another question are the reasons 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.050
 if not only for their opinion but behind them we would not have taken that 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.259
 I just said 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.629
 the first yellow to roe this review and fao power 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.879
 ni fao was 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.879
 what are we talking about 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.930
 so far so are things even if it's small 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:28.139
 apple wants to see 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.080
 I think 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.879
 the stages that comes as much coach have said and got it with 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:35.849
 it does not 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.659
 I think now the cup begins not always happens in the worlds too 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:39.689
 the 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:41.490
 to a world cup they start 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.460
 when we passed eighth 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.230
 and the cup ends america I think I start at the lowest in additional quarters 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.020
 hand to hand are Iñigo's match 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.020
 of death, the one who loses stays out and and there they go to see them 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.219
 they get from the team what is best prepared 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.909
 Thank you
