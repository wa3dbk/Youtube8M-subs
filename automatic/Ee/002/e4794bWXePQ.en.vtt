00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
say 45 minutes ago and whether it's a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.730 
say 45 minutes ago and whether it's a
lot<00:02:32.270> less<00:02:32.450> now<00:02:32.720> or<00:02:32.900> about<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.260> same<00:02:33.470> if<00:02:33.650> you

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
can give us some estimates on that I'd

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.750 
can give us some estimates on that I'd
give<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.500> guesstimate

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
give a guesstimate

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.910

again<00:02:38.150> we're<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.420> speculating<00:02:39.260> here<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.650> about

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
again we're a speculating here of about

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.030 
again we're a speculating here of about
maybe<00:02:40.150> 10,000<00:02:41.150> when<00:02:41.360> everything<00:02:42.350> got<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.860> its

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
maybe 10,000 when everything got to its

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.010 
maybe 10,000 when everything got to its
peak<00:02:43.340> maybe<00:02:43.580> an<00:02:43.730> hour<00:02:43.880> after<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.480> game<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:44.900> I

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
peak maybe an hour after the game like I

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.160 
peak maybe an hour after the game like I
said<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.500> triangle<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.490> Clark<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.240> Aniston
