00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
the other gorilla glues do which is nice

and<00:01:12.290> make<00:01:13.219> sure<00:01:13.399> you<00:01:13.520> have<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.670> lot<00:01:14.000> of<00:01:14.030> clamps

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
and make sure you have a lot of clamps

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.469 
and make sure you have a lot of clamps
way<00:01:15.140> more<00:01:15.380> than<00:01:15.530> 4<00:01:15.759> so<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.880> first<00:01:17.119> step<00:01:17.360> in

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
way more than 4 so the first step in

way more than 4 so the first step in
actually<00:01:17.659> making<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.439> long<00:01:18.649> board<00:01:18.889> is<00:01:19.039> gluing

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280

the boards together you're going to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.590

the<00:02:22.790> jigsaw<00:02:23.150> was<00:02:23.330> perfect<00:02:23.780> for<00:02:23.930> getting<00:02:24.050> those

this<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.569> one<00:02:35.840> part<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.290> process<00:02:36.740> that<00:02:36.860> you

this is one part of the process that you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.490 
this is one part of the process that you

definitely don't want to rush take your
time<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:39.950> make<00:02:39.980> nice<00:02:40.370> precise<00:02:40.970> cuts<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:43.760> round

time and make nice precise cuts to round

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.059 
time and make nice precise cuts to round
out<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.239> edges<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.780> fix<00:02:45.020> any<00:02:45.170> imperfections

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
out the edges and fix any imperfections

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.170 
out the edges and fix any imperfections
in<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.310> shape<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.700> board

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
in the shape of the board

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.390 
in the shape of the board
I<00:02:47.209> used<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.870> sixty<00:02:48.260> grit<00:02:48.470> on<00:02:48.620> an<00:02:48.739> orbital<00:02:49.190> sander

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
I used a sixty grit on an orbital sander

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.720 
I used a sixty grit on an orbital sander
I<00:02:49.840> then<00:02:50.840> switched<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.410> 120<00:02:52.370> grit<00:02:52.550> on<00:02:52.700> the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
I then switched to a 120 grit on the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.900 
I then switched to a 120 grit on the
orbital<00:02:53.150> sander<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.870> smooth<00:02:54.110> out<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.320> edges

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
orbital sander to smooth out the edges

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.030 
orbital sander to smooth out the edges
to<00:02:55.910> finish<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:56.450> sanded<00:02:57.170> down<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.500> whole<00:02:57.769> thing

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
to finish I sanded down the whole thing

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.580 
to finish I sanded down the whole thing
by<00:02:58.190> hand<00:02:58.489> all<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.120> edges<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.540> took<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.410> while

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
by hand all the edges and took a while

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.479 
by hand all the edges and took a while
but<00:03:00.800> it<00:03:00.890> was<00:03:00.950> worth<00:03:01.160> it

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
but it was worth it

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.729 
but it was worth it
the<00:03:02.120> next<00:03:02.420> step<00:03:02.570> is<00:03:02.750> staining<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:03.410> first

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
the next step is staining so first

and waiting for what was left to dry I

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.310 
and waiting for what was left to dry I
flipped<00:03:26.329> it<00:03:26.420> over<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.720> stained<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.110> other

flipped it over and stained the other

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.740 
flipped it over and stained the other
side<00:03:27.590> as<00:03:27.860> you<00:03:28.760> can<00:03:28.880> see<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.239> brings<00:03:29.420> out<00:03:29.600> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
side as you can see it brings out the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.289 
side as you can see it brings out the
nice<00:03:29.959> natural<00:03:30.440> grain<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.190> wood<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:32.090> looks

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
nice natural grain of the wood it looks

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.810 
nice natural grain of the wood it looks
great<00:03:32.570> when<00:03:32.750> you're<00:03:32.900> done<00:03:33.370> once<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.489> was<00:03:34.640> sure

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
great when you're done once I was sure

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.970 
great when you're done once I was sure
the<00:03:34.970> stain<00:03:35.239> had<00:03:35.450> fully<00:03:35.690> dried<00:03:36.079> I<00:03:36.290> traced<00:03:36.860> the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
the stain had fully dried I traced the

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.420 
the stain had fully dried I traced the
template<00:03:37.549> of<00:03:37.579> my<00:03:37.880> design<00:03:38.269> onto<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.810> board<00:03:39.079> I

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
template of my design onto the board I

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.310 
template of my design onto the board I
decided<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.610> do<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:41.060> yin<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:41.780> yang<00:03:41.989> design

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
decided to do a yin and yang design

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.350 
decided to do a yin and yang design
using<00:03:42.620> two<00:03:42.799> different<00:03:42.950> colors<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.400> stain<00:03:43.790> but

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
using two different colors of stain but

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.810 
using two different colors of stain but
you<00:03:44.480> can<00:03:44.630> do<00:03:44.750> whatever<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:45.140> want<00:03:45.380> paint<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.250> it

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
you can do whatever you want paint it it

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.259 
you can do whatever you want paint it it
whatever<00:03:47.209> just<00:03:47.600> let<00:03:47.720> your<00:03:47.840> creativity<00:03:48.200> flow

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
whatever just let your creativity flow

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.000 
whatever just let your creativity flow
to<00:03:50.269> further<00:03:50.540> outline<00:03:51.140> it<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:51.500> make<00:03:51.890> the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
to further outline it and make the

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.880 
to further outline it and make the
design<00:03:52.370> really<00:03:52.549> pop<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.269> used<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:54.140> wood<00:03:54.470> burner<00:03:54.739> I

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
design really pop I used a wood burner I

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.140 
design really pop I used a wood burner I
had<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.760> burn<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.329> design<00:03:56.690> into<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.049> wood

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
had to burn the design into the wood

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.640 
had to burn the design into the wood
doing<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.299> also<00:03:59.540> served<00:03:59.900> another<00:04:00.200> purpose

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
doing this also served another purpose

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.949 
doing this also served another purpose
it<00:04:01.220> served<00:04:01.489> as<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.700> barrier<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.540> darker

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
it served as a barrier that the darker

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.470 
it served as a barrier that the darker
stain<00:04:03.200> couldn't<00:04:03.620> really<00:04:03.739> get<00:04:03.950> past<00:04:04.359> it's<00:04:05.359> a

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
stain couldn't really get past it's a

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.990 
stain couldn't really get past it's a
very<00:04:05.690> time-consuming<00:04:06.019> process<00:04:06.790> but<00:04:07.790> if<00:04:07.880> you

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
very time-consuming process but if you

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.699 
very time-consuming process but if you
have<00:04:08.180> access<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.840> wood<00:04:09.140> burner<00:04:09.320> I<00:04:09.560> would

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
have access to a wood burner I would

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.080 
have access to a wood burner I would
definitely<00:04:10.160> recommend<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:10.730> as<00:04:10.820> it<00:04:11.000> really

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
definitely recommend it as it really

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.740 
definitely recommend it as it really
brings<00:04:11.510> out<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.870> design<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:13.480> then<00:04:14.480> applied

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
brings out the design I then applied

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.630 
brings out the design I then applied
masking<00:04:15.290> tape<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.650> areas<00:04:15.980> where<00:04:16.130> I<00:04:16.190> really

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
masking tape to areas where I really

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.120 
masking tape to areas where I really
didn't<00:04:16.940> want<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.150> get<00:04:17.299> stained<00:04:17.570> on<00:04:17.950> you<00:04:18.950> might

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
didn't want to get stained on you might

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.740 
didn't want to get stained on you might
think<00:04:19.400> you<00:04:19.519> don't<00:04:19.640> need<00:04:19.789> masking<00:04:20.269> tape<00:04:20.510> but

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
think you don't need masking tape but

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.529 
think you don't need masking tape but
most<00:04:20.989> likely<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:21.530> do<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:22.610> stain<00:04:22.880> really<00:04:23.120> runs

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
most likely you do the stain really runs

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.529 
most likely you do the stain really runs
and<00:04:23.810> bleeds<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.410> lot<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.680> times<00:04:24.950> so<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:26.120> masking

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
and bleeds a lot of times so the masking

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.490 
and bleeds a lot of times so the masking
tape<00:04:26.570> usually<00:04:27.229> helps<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:27.590> prevent<00:04:27.919> that<00:04:28.100> we

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
tape usually helps to prevent that we

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.779 
tape usually helps to prevent that we
then<00:04:30.500> stain<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.890> appropriate<00:04:31.400> parts<00:04:31.640> of<00:04:31.729> the

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
then stain the appropriate parts of the

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.210 
then stain the appropriate parts of the
board<00:04:32.060> using<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.539> dark<00:04:32.810> red<00:04:33.169> oak<00:04:33.320> stain

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
board using a dark red oak stain

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.630 
board using a dark red oak stain
and<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.730> was<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:34.910> lot<00:04:35.270> darker<00:04:35.540> than<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:35.990> expected

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
and it was a lot darker than I expected

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.010 
and it was a lot darker than I expected
the<00:04:37.640> color<00:04:37.850> actually<00:04:38.060> lightened<00:04:38.570> up<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.840> lot

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
the color actually lightened up a lot

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.840 
the color actually lightened up a lot
though<00:04:39.230> after<00:04:39.530> removing<00:04:39.920> excess<00:04:40.370> stain<00:04:40.610> from

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
though after removing excess stain from

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.240 
though after removing excess stain from
the<00:04:40.970> board<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:42.110> way<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.470> stain<00:04:42.710> was<00:04:42.860> removed

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
the board the way the stain was removed

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.520 
the board the way the stain was removed
actually<00:04:43.820> created<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.330> sort<00:04:44.570> of<00:04:44.660> vintage<00:04:45.140> look

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
actually created a sort of vintage look

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.100 
actually created a sort of vintage look
to<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.920> board<00:04:46.190> which<00:04:46.880> was<00:04:47.030> unexpected<00:04:47.330> but<00:04:47.810> in

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
to the board which was unexpected but in

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.500 
to the board which was unexpected but in
a<00:04:48.230> good<00:04:48.320> way

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
a good way

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.700 
a good way
we<00:04:50.510> then<00:04:50.690> removed<00:04:50.990> all<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:51.170> masking<00:04:51.680> tape

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
we then removed all the masking tape

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.270 
we then removed all the masking tape
from<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.220> board<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:54.320> finish<00:04:54.560> up<00:04:54.680> this<00:04:54.830> process

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
from the board to finish up this process

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.220 
from the board to finish up this process
we<00:04:55.520> touched<00:04:55.790> up<00:04:56.000> any<00:04:56.150> spots<00:04:56.450> we<00:04:56.720> missed<00:04:56.990> and

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
we touched up any spots we missed and

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.620 
we touched up any spots we missed and
also<00:04:57.950> used<00:04:58.190> mineral<00:04:58.670> spirits<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.150> remove<00:04:59.450> any

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
also used mineral spirits to remove any

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.960 
also used mineral spirits to remove any
blemishes<00:05:00.200> from<00:05:00.230> the<00:05:00.440> board<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:01.550> stuff's<00:05:01.880> a

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
blemishes from the board that stuff's a

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.630 
blemishes from the board that stuff's a
miracle<00:05:02.710> to<00:05:03.710> protect<00:05:04.040> the<00:05:04.160> board<00:05:04.400> in<00:05:04.520> the

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
miracle to protect the board in the

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.950 
miracle to protect the board in the
stain<00:05:04.910> sprayed<00:05:05.810> both<00:05:06.020> sides<00:05:06.410> with<00:05:06.800> a<00:05:06.830> spray-on

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
stain sprayed both sides with a spray-on

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.620 
stain sprayed both sides with a spray-on
polyurethane<00:05:09.640> heed<00:05:10.640> my<00:05:10.850> advice<00:05:11.240> though<00:05:11.480> when

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
polyurethane heed my advice though when

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.660 
polyurethane heed my advice though when
I<00:05:11.660> say<00:05:11.990> wait<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:13.040> the<00:05:13.160> stain<00:05:13.400> is<00:05:13.610> completely

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
I say wait to the stain is completely

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.480 
I say wait to the stain is completely
dry<00:05:14.630> we<00:05:15.380> apparently<00:05:15.860> didn't<00:05:16.100> wait<00:05:16.220> long

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
dry we apparently didn't wait long

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.880 
dry we apparently didn't wait long
enough<00:05:16.520> and<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.120> stain<00:05:17.330> got<00:05:17.510> all<00:05:17.690> blotchy<00:05:18.020> so

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
enough and the stain got all blotchy so

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.440
