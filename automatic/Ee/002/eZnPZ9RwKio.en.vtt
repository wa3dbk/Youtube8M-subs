00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
and they probably just take maybe like

and they probably just take maybe like
minutes<00:03:26.169> I<00:03:26.260> think<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:27.120> like<00:03:28.120> this<00:03:28.329> one<00:03:28.510> as<00:03:28.659> a

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.009 

alright<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.730> first<00:03:42.760> time<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.329> fit<00:03:43.599> in<00:03:43.719> is

puppies<00:03:46.480> but<00:03:47.319> surprise<00:03:47.650> attacks<00:03:49.680> they<00:03:50.680> start

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:51.009 
puppies but surprise attacks they start

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.550 
puppies but surprise attacks they start
to<00:03:51.220> like<00:03:51.509> get<00:03:52.509> real<00:03:52.720> brown<00:03:52.930> on<00:03:53.049> one<00:03:53.079> side<00:03:53.229> you

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
to like get real brown on one side you

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.249 
to like get real brown on one side you
might<00:03:53.680> have<00:03:53.889> to<00:03:54.069> kind<00:03:54.280> of<00:03:54.310> flip<00:03:54.519> them<00:03:54.699> over<00:03:55.259> but

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:56.259 
might have to kind of flip them over but

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.629 
might have to kind of flip them over but
you<00:03:56.470> don't<00:03:56.620> want<00:03:56.799> to<00:03:56.889> strain<00:03:57.159> them<00:03:57.280> directly

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
you don't want to strain them directly

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.710 
you don't want to strain them directly
on<00:03:57.849> paper<00:03:58.209> towels<00:03:58.449> because<00:03:58.689> the<00:03:59.019> this<00:04:00.720> steam

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
on paper towels because the this steam

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.229 
on paper towels because the this steam
from<00:04:02.259> their<00:04:02.439> heat<00:04:02.709> will<00:04:03.069> make<00:04:03.250> them<00:04:03.489> get<00:04:03.879> soggy

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
from their heat will make them get soggy

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.689 
from their heat will make them get soggy
faster<00:04:04.810> so<00:04:05.109> when<00:04:06.009> you're<00:04:06.129> frying<00:04:06.340> stuff

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
faster so when you're frying stuff

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.610 
faster so when you're frying stuff
that's<00:04:06.970> letting<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.359> cool<00:04:07.629> on<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.139> rack<00:04:08.169> is

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
that's letting it cool on the rack is

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.229 
that's letting it cool on the rack is
actually<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.189> best<00:04:09.400> for<00:04:10.389> getting<00:04:10.599> sake<00:04:12.239> I'm

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239
