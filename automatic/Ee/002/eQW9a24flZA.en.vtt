00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.080 

okay<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:01.469> here<00:00:01.740> we're<00:00:01.890> gonna<00:00:01.979> use<00:00:02.070> our<00:00:02.550> double

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay so here we're gonna use our double

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.999 
okay so here we're gonna use our double
angle<00:00:03.449> identity<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.110> simplify<00:00:04.620> down<00:00:04.799> this

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
angle identity to simplify down this

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.080 
angle identity to simplify down this
expression<00:00:05.509> 1<00:00:06.509> minus<00:00:06.540> 16<00:00:07.490> sine<00:00:08.490> squared<00:00:08.880> x

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
expression 1 minus 16 sine squared x

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.720 
expression 1 minus 16 sine squared x
times<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.540> cosine<00:00:09.900> squared<00:00:09.960> X<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.710> all<00:00:11.580> I'm

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
times the cosine squared X and all I'm

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.209 
times the cosine squared X and all I'm
really<00:00:11.880> gonna<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.480> just<00:00:12.690> rewrite<00:00:13.219> this

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
really gonna do is just rewrite this

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.340 
really gonna do is just rewrite this
expression<00:00:14.429> sine<00:00:15.120> squared<00:00:15.450> X<00:00:15.630> times<00:00:15.809> cosine

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
expression sine squared X times cosine

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.250 
expression sine squared X times cosine
squared<00:00:16.379> X<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.980> little<00:00:17.220> differently<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:18.260> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
squared X a little differently so the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.660 
squared X a little differently so the
first<00:00:19.439> thing<00:00:19.619> I'm<00:00:19.710> gonna<00:00:19.859> notice<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.369> really

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
first thing I'm gonna notice is really

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.450 
first thing I'm gonna notice is really
we<00:00:20.789> could<00:00:20.939> write<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.270> as<00:00:21.330> 4<00:00:21.990> times<00:00:22.260> sine<00:00:23.160> x

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
we could write this as 4 times sine x

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.310 
we could write this as 4 times sine x
times<00:00:23.820> cosine<00:00:24.810> X<00:00:25.320> quantity<00:00:26.010> squared<00:00:26.570> I<00:00:27.570> mean

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
times cosine X quantity squared I mean

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.109 
times cosine X quantity squared I mean
if<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.189> square<00:00:29.429> everything<00:00:29.760> we'll<00:00:29.910> get<00:00:30.029> our

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
if you square everything we'll get our

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.849 
if you square everything we'll get our
16<00:00:30.570> our<00:00:30.720> sine<00:00:30.929> squared<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.349> our<00:00:31.410> cosine

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
16 our sine squared in our cosine

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.160 
16 our sine squared in our cosine
squared<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.570> could<00:00:33.750> rewrite<00:00:33.930> this

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
squared so really we could rewrite this

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.470 
squared so really we could rewrite this
as<00:00:34.440> 4<00:00:35.430> times<00:00:35.790> sine<00:00:36.450> x<00:00:36.750> times<00:00:36.930> cosine<00:00:37.440> X<00:00:38.480> well

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
as 4 times sine x times cosine X well

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.610 
as 4 times sine x times cosine X well
times<00:00:39.870> another<00:00:40.200> 4<00:00:40.800> times<00:00:41.250> sine<00:00:41.910> X<00:00:42.620> times

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
times another 4 times sine X times

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.220 
times another 4 times sine X times
cosine<00:00:44.010> X<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:46.190> ok<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.730> am<00:00:47.940> remembering<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
cosine X and ok so I am remembering the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.979 
cosine X and ok so I am remembering the
thing<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:49.590> thinking<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.989> recall

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
thing I'm thinking about here is recall

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.990 
thing I'm thinking about here is recall
that<00:00:52.320> sine<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> 2<00:00:53.610> X<00:00:55.399> that's<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> same<00:00:56.579> thing

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that sine of 2 X that's the same thing

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.900 
that sine of 2 X that's the same thing
as<00:00:57.180> 2<00:00:57.539> sine<00:00:58.289> x<00:00:58.620> times<00:00:59.300> cosine<00:01:00.300> X<00:01:01.550> well<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.760> don't

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
as 2 sine x times cosine X well we don't

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.210 
as 2 sine x times cosine X well we don't
have<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.239> 2<00:01:03.690> sine<00:01:04.049> X<00:01:04.290> cosine<00:01:04.409> X<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
have a 2 sine X cosine X in the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.580 
have a 2 sine X cosine X in the
parenthesis<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.479> 4<00:01:06.869> sine<00:01:07.229> x<00:01:07.470> times

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
parenthesis we have a 4 sine x times

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.090 
parenthesis we have a 4 sine x times
cosine<00:01:08.010> X<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.750> multiply<00:01:09.990> both<00:01:10.350> sides<00:01:10.860> by

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
cosine X but if I multiply both sides by

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.530 
cosine X but if I multiply both sides by
2

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
2

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.200 
2
so<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.260> multiply<00:01:13.440> both<00:01:13.800> sides<00:01:14.310> by<00:01:14.460> two<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so if I multiply both sides by two if I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.150 
so if I multiply both sides by two if I
multiply<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:15.720> left<00:01:16.020> side<00:01:16.110> by<00:01:16.260> two<00:01:16.470> I'll<00:01:16.920> get

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
multiply the left side by two I'll get

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.970 
multiply the left side by two I'll get
two<00:01:17.370> sine<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.670> 2x<00:01:18.000> if<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.200> multiply<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.680> right

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
two sine of 2x if I multiply the right

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.330 
two sine of 2x if I multiply the right
side<00:01:20.010> by<00:01:20.280> two<00:01:20.490> well<00:01:21.180> I'll<00:01:21.360> get<00:01:21.510> four<00:01:22.040> sine<00:01:23.040> x

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
side by two well I'll get four sine x

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.630 
side by two well I'll get four sine x
times<00:01:23.900> cosine<00:01:24.900> X<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.010> now<00:01:26.160> what<00:01:26.340> I'm<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
times cosine X so now what I'm going to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.680 
times cosine X so now what I'm going to
do<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.120> simply<00:01:27.510> replace<00:01:28.610> each<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:30.120> sine<00:01:30.420> X

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
do is simply replace each for sine X

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.350 
do is simply replace each for sine X
cosine<00:01:31.260> X<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:31.980> value<00:01:32.880> two<00:01:33.660> sine<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.320> 2x

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
cosine X with this value two sine of 2x

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.200 
cosine X with this value two sine of 2x
so<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.450> says<00:01:36.660> really<00:01:36.930> we're<00:01:37.230> going<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:38.210> one

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so it says really we're going to get one

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.360 
so it says really we're going to get one
-<00:01:39.720> okay<00:01:40.110> I'm<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:40.800> to<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.010> rid<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
- okay I'm going to get rid of the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.390 
- okay I'm going to get rid of the
brackets<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.690> says<00:01:42.900> for<00:01:43.230> sine<00:01:43.560> X<00:01:43.830> cosine<00:01:44.340> X

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
brackets it says for sine X cosine X

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.250 
brackets it says for sine X cosine X
that's<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> same<00:01:45.150> thing<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.600> 2<00:01:46.470> sine<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.280> 2x

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
that's the same thing as 2 sine of 2x

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.900 
that's the same thing as 2 sine of 2x
squeeze<00:01:49.260> it<00:01:49.410> in<00:01:49.500> there<00:01:49.680> then<00:01:50.610> we'll<00:01:50.790> have

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
squeeze it in there then we'll have

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.750 
squeeze it in there then we'll have
another<00:01:51.180> two<00:01:51.750> sine<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.979> 2x<00:01:55.070> all<00:01:56.070> right<00:01:56.220> well<00:01:56.490> if

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
another two sine of 2x all right well if

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.360 
another two sine of 2x all right well if
we<00:01:57.000> rewrite<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.229> more<00:01:58.350> time<00:01:58.650> this<00:01:59.160> would

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
we rewrite this one more time this would

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.310 
we rewrite this one more time this would
be<00:01:59.490> 1<00:01:59.729> minus<00:02:00.180> 2<00:02:00.450> times<00:02:00.660> 2<00:02:00.960> would<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.380> 4<00:02:03.080> sine<00:02:04.080> of

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
be 1 minus 2 times 2 would be 4 sine of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.680 
be 1 minus 2 times 2 would be 4 sine of
2x<00:02:04.650> times<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.250> sine<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.520> 2x<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.330> going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.570> be

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
2x times the sine of 2x is going to be

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.930 
2x times the sine of 2x is going to be
sine<00:02:07.110> squared<00:02:07.650> of<00:02:08.010> 2x<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:10.490> you<00:02:11.490> know<00:02:11.610> at<00:02:11.820> this

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
sine squared of 2x and you know at this

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.270 
sine squared of 2x and you know at this
point<00:02:12.180> there's<00:02:12.420> really<00:02:12.450> not<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.870> lot<00:02:13.110> left<00:02:14.040> a

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
point there's really not a lot left a

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.890 
point there's really not a lot left a
lot<00:02:14.490> left<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:15.209> do<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.540> terms<00:02:15.690> of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
lot left that you can do in terms of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.320 
lot left that you can do in terms of
simplification<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.709> think<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.300> we<00:02:18.300> have

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
simplification I think so we have

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.940 
simplification I think so we have
cleaned<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.810> up<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:19.020> little<00:02:19.200> bit<00:02:19.380> maybe<00:02:19.590> you

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
cleaned it up a little bit maybe you

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.199 
cleaned it up a little bit maybe you
know<00:02:20.070> we've<00:02:20.220> gotten<00:02:20.520> rid<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.790> at<00:02:20.880> least<00:02:21.090> a

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
know we've gotten rid of at least a

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.430 
know we've gotten rid of at least a
couple<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.600> trig<00:02:21.840> functions

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
couple of trig functions

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.130 
couple of trig functions
now<00:02:22.890> we're<00:02:23.100> only<00:02:23.250> simply<00:02:23.760> using<00:02:24.239> instead<00:02:25.020> of

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
now we're only simply using instead of

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.590 
now we're only simply using instead of
having<00:02:25.290> sines<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.950> cosines<00:02:26.120> at<00:02:27.120> least<00:02:27.360> now<00:02:27.510> at

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
having sines and cosines at least now at

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.600 
having sines and cosines at least now at
this<00:02:27.780> point<00:02:28.080> we<00:02:28.260> only<00:02:28.290> have<00:02:28.620> signs<00:02:28.890> floating

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
this point we only have signs floating

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.510 
this point we only have signs floating
around<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.060> problem
