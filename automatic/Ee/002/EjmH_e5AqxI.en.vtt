the best way to do a bench press to

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
you normally would but instead of

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.530 
you normally would but instead of
pushing<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.040> right<00:00:08.069> back<00:00:08.370> up<00:00:08.429> you're<00:00:09.269> going<00:00:09.420> to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
pushing it right back up you're going to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.509 
pushing it right back up you're going to
stop<00:00:09.750> for<00:00:09.929> three<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.170> five<00:00:10.320> seconds<00:00:10.800> before

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
stop for three to five seconds before

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.669 
stop for three to five seconds before
pushing<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.910> ball<00:00:12.090> back<00:00:12.269> up<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:13.500> really

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
pushing the ball back up so really

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.470 
pushing the ball back up so really
you're<00:00:14.460> doing<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.730> bench<00:00:14.969> press<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.330> way<00:00:15.420> you

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
you're doing a bench press the way you

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.390 
you're doing a bench press the way you
normally<00:00:15.750> would<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:16.980> time<00:00:17.190> at<00:00:17.310> you

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
normally would but this time at you

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.310 
normally would but this time at you
lower<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> ball<00:00:17.820> down<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.240> your<00:00:18.359> chest<00:00:18.660> you're

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
lower the ball down to your chest you're

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.929 
lower the ball down to your chest you're
going<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.560> stop<00:00:19.800> for<00:00:19.980> three<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.310> five<00:00:20.460> seconds

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
going to stop for three to five seconds

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.450 
going to stop for three to five seconds
before<00:00:21.449> pressing<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.020> ball<00:00:22.109> back<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
before pressing the ball back up and the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.710 
before pressing the ball back up and the
reason<00:00:23.699> why<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:23.939> better<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.359> do<00:00:24.510> bench

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
reason why it's better to do bench

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.230 
reason why it's better to do bench
presses<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.470> that's<00:00:26.130> because<00:00:26.519> when

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
presses like this that's because when

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.849 
presses like this that's because when
you<00:00:27.330> do<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> regular<00:00:27.689> bench<00:00:27.960> press<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.590> just

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
you do a regular bench press we just

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.080 
you do a regular bench press we just
press<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> ball<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.699> down<00:00:29.849> without

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
press the ball up and down without

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.080 
press the ball up and down without
stopping<00:00:30.599> you're<00:00:31.289> mainly<00:00:31.500> using<00:00:31.890> momentum<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
stopping you're mainly using momentum to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.490 
stopping you're mainly using momentum to
bounce<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.450> ball<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.930> down<00:00:34.050> off<00:00:34.320> your

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
bounce the ball up and down off your

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.530 
bounce the ball up and down off your
chest<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.760> takes<00:00:36.000> away<00:00:36.210> from<00:00:36.239> your

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
chest and just takes away from your

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.380 
chest and just takes away from your
chest<00:00:36.780> workout<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.850> when<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.059> your<00:00:39.180> bench

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
chest workout but when you do your bench

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.209 
chest workout but when you do your bench
presses<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:39.989> doing<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> video<00:00:40.559> where

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
presses like I'm doing the video where

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.530 
presses like I'm doing the video where
you<00:00:41.309> stop<00:00:41.520> at<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> bottom<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.149> three<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> five

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
you stop at the bottom of three to five

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.420 
you stop at the bottom of three to five
seconds<00:00:42.989> before<00:00:43.500> pushing<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> ball<00:00:44.040> back<00:00:44.219> up

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
seconds before pushing the ball back up

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.060 
seconds before pushing the ball back up
your<00:00:45.210> chest<00:00:45.450> muscles<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.200> work<00:00:46.379> since

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
your chest muscles do all the work since

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.190 
your chest muscles do all the work since
you<00:00:47.100> can't<00:00:47.370> use<00:00:47.520> any<00:00:47.879> momentum<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.840> bounce<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
you can't use any momentum to bounce the

you can't use any momentum to bounce the
ball<00:00:49.230> off<00:00:49.530> your<00:00:49.710> chest<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.670> make<00:00:50.850> sure

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
ball off your chest and just make sure

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.220 
ball off your chest and just make sure
you<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> contract<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.870> squeeze<00:00:52.140> your

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you have to contract and squeeze your

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.439 
you have to contract and squeeze your
chest<00:00:52.440> muscles<00:00:52.800> even<00:00:52.890> harder<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:54.120> push<00:00:54.300> your

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
chest muscles even harder to push your

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.810 
chest muscles even harder to push your
bar<00:00:54.600> back<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:56.250> gives<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> much
