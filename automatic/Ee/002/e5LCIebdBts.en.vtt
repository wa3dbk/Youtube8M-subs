very<00:01:38.770> easily<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:43.060> reckon<00:01:43.390> just<00:01:43.509> as<00:01:43.660> a<00:01:43.690> test

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
very easily and I reckon just as a test

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.930 
very easily and I reckon just as a test
let's<00:01:44.770> see<00:01:44.979> if<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.190> dog<00:01:45.369> actually<00:01:45.729> will<00:01:45.820> want

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
to eat it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.999 
to eat it
tinting<00:01:49.289> get<00:01:50.289> it<00:01:50.410> ah<00:01:52.289> success

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
tinting get it ah success

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:03.779 
tinting get it ah success
it<00:01:54.340> obviously<00:01:54.460> tastes<00:01:54.910> good<00:02:02.580> let's<00:02:03.580> now<00:02:03.729> take

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
it obviously tastes good let's now take

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.120 
it obviously tastes good let's now take
a<00:02:04.030> little<00:02:04.210> look<00:02:04.509> of<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.020> different<00:02:05.380> sizes<00:02:05.619> of

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
a little look of the different sizes of

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.160 
a little look of the different sizes of

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
first of all let's take a look at trips

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.560 
first of all let's take a look at trips
there's<00:02:11.230> two<00:02:11.739> sizes<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.300> smaller

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
there's two sizes you have the smaller

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.780 
there's two sizes you have the smaller
size<00:02:13.810> which<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:14.500> around<00:02:14.680> 75<00:02:15.220> grams<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.760> you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
size which is around 75 grams and you

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.350 
size which is around 75 grams and you
have<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.060> bigger<00:02:16.300> size<00:02:16.570> which<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.050> around<00:02:17.260> 450

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
have the bigger size which is around 450

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.910 
have the bigger size which is around 450
you<00:02:19.360> can<00:02:19.510> see<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.930> size<00:02:20.140> difference<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.709> two

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
you can see the size difference in two

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.550 
you can see the size difference in two
then<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:22.180> one<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.540> great<00:02:22.840> if<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.200> just<00:02:23.350> want
