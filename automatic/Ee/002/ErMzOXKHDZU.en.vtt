00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
single hard drive in my case I have

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.420 
single hard drive in my case I have
around<00:00:39.480> about<00:00:39.660> 300<00:00:40.110> thousand<00:00:40.770> photos<00:00:40.980> they

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
around about 300 thousand photos they

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.430 
around about 300 thousand photos they
consume<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.210> about<00:00:42.360> 4<00:00:42.629> terabytes<00:00:43.260> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
storage space but they're all on a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.630

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
single hard drive and when I accumulate

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.160 
single hard drive and when I accumulate
more<00:00:47.789> photos<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.539> point<00:00:48.750> where<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.020> no

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
more photos to the point where they no

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.229 
more photos to the point where they no
longer<00:00:49.200> fit<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.070> hard<00:00:50.309> drive<00:00:50.370> I'll<00:00:50.789> go

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
longer fit on this hard drive I'll go

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.450 
longer fit on this hard drive I'll go
buy<00:00:51.420> an<00:00:51.690> even<00:00:51.989> bigger<00:00:52.170> hard<00:00:52.530> drive<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.920> copy

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
buy an even bigger hard drive and copy

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.369 
buy an even bigger hard drive and copy
all<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.059> photos<00:00:54.270> from<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.719> Drive<00:00:55.020> to

all of the photos from this Drive to
that<00:00:55.559> drive<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.129> will<00:00:56.340> become<00:00:56.489> my

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
that drive and that will become my

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.170 
that drive and that will become my
master<00:00:57.390> drive<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.289> photos<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.219> idea<00:00:59.609> here<00:01:00.000> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
master drive for photos the idea here is

that<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.449> want<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.960> single<00:01:01.559> place<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.149> my

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that I want a single place for all of my

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.210 
that I want a single place for all of my
photos<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.989> stored<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.860> when<00:01:05.100> I'm

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
photos to be stored so that when I'm

drive that I use for storing my photos I

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.760 
drive that I use for storing my photos I
might<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> hard<00:01:13.020> time<00:01:13.170> figuring<00:01:13.590> out

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
might have a hard time figuring out

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
might have a hard time figuring out
which<00:01:14.040> folder<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> image<00:01:15.090> I'm<00:01:15.240> looking<00:01:15.570> for

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
which folder the image I'm looking for

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.899 
which folder the image I'm looking for
is<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.290> which<00:01:16.439> keywords<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.280> assigned<00:01:17.640> or

other<00:01:18.060> metadata<00:01:18.509> values<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.170> might<00:01:19.350> be

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
other metadata values that might be

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.890 
other metadata values that might be
associated<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.400> those<00:01:21.180> images<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.810> I'm

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
associated with those images that I'm

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.960 
associated with those images that I'm
looking<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> always<00:01:23.280> know<00:01:23.520> exactly

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
looking for but I always know exactly

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.399 
looking for but I always know exactly
where<00:01:24.330> they're<00:01:24.540> stored<00:01:24.840> they're<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.140> this

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
where they're stored they're on this

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.499 
where they're stored they're on this
hard<00:01:25.710> drive<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.340> I'll<00:01:26.610> use<00:01:26.790> other<00:01:27.030> hard<00:01:27.299> drives

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
hard drive so I'll use other hard drives

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.569 
hard drive so I'll use other hard drives
for<00:01:27.720> backing<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.350> my<00:01:28.500> photos<00:01:28.920> I'll<00:01:29.189> use<00:01:29.369> other

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
for backing up my photos I'll use other

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.460 
for backing up my photos I'll use other
hard<00:01:29.820> drives<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.270> different<00:01:30.689> data<00:01:30.869> hard
