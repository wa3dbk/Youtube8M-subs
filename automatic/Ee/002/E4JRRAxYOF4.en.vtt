00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.150 

and<00:00:07.210> this<00:00:07.420> is<00:00:07.600> what<00:00:07.780> the<00:00:07.900> EGR<00:00:08.260> looks<00:00:08.620> like<00:00:08.890> this

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160 
and this is what the EGR looks like this

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.730 
and this is what the EGR looks like this
is<00:00:09.340> the<00:00:09.370> EGR<00:00:09.910> valve<00:00:10.240> yeah<00:00:11.050> we're<00:00:11.380> going<00:00:11.559> to<00:00:11.620> be

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
is the EGR valve yeah we're going to be

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.359 
is the EGR valve yeah we're going to be
changing<00:00:12.219> this<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.790> whole<00:00:15.940> thing<00:00:16.209> actually

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
changing this the whole thing actually

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.960 
changing this the whole thing actually
if<00:00:18.369> you<00:00:18.580> had<00:00:18.760> an<00:00:18.880> oil<00:00:19.119> leak<00:00:19.360> or<00:00:19.540> something<00:00:19.990> so

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
if you had an oil leak or something so

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.019 
if you had an oil leak or something so
we're<00:00:21.970> on<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.150> process<00:00:22.690> of<00:00:22.810> finishing<00:00:23.020> it

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
we're on the process of finishing it

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.210 
we're on the process of finishing it
there<00:00:25.029> we<00:00:25.210> go

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
there we go

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.380 
there we go
I<00:00:26.250> started<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.240> take<00:00:27.390> apart<00:00:27.750> everything

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.330 

and<00:00:30.750> once<00:00:31.020> that's<00:00:31.230> complete<00:00:31.680> hopefully<00:00:32.130> it's

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
and once that's complete hopefully it's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:44.220 
and once that's complete hopefully it's
going<00:00:32.490> to<00:00:32.580> solve<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.970> problem

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.260 

that's<00:00:44.800> a<00:00:44.950> cooler

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
that's a cooler

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.290 
that's a cooler
positive<00:00:47.020> cooling<00:00:47.350> system<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.980> world<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
positive cooling system the world and

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.660 
positive cooling system the world and
the<00:00:51.750> turbo<00:00:52.750> spine<00:00:54.570> coming<00:00:55.570> back<00:00:55.899> with<00:00:56.199> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the turbo spine coming back with this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.660 
the turbo spine coming back with this
EGR<00:00:57.670> valve<00:00:58.829> okay<00:00:59.829> we<00:01:00.760> got<00:01:00.940> it<00:01:00.969> out

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
EGR valve okay we got it out

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.690 
EGR valve okay we got it out
pretty<00:01:02.940> much<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.369> kind<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.460> small

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
pretty much this is the kind of small

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700 
pretty much this is the kind of small
manager<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> manifold<00:01:06.960> connected<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
manager like a manifold connected to the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.800 
manager like a manifold connected to the
valve<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> valve<00:01:09.060> that's<00:01:09.509> a<00:01:09.600> pretty

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
valve this is the valve that's a pretty

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.830 
valve this is the valve that's a pretty
old<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.380> looks<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.770> very<00:01:11.070> very<00:01:11.430> old<00:01:11.840> as

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
old one it looks like very very old as

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.039 
old one it looks like very very old as
you<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> oil<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.950> leaking<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:15.049> this

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
you can see the oil is leaking and this

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.160 
you can see the oil is leaking and this
is<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
is the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.099 
is the
Colonel<00:01:18.439> throttle

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.109 

works<00:01:21.590> like<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.859> corporator

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.100 

that's<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.659> pretty<00:01:25.900> much<00:01:26.080> looks<00:01:26.350> what<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.710> say

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.330 

why<00:01:30.410> how<00:01:31.070> terrible<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:31.790> is<00:01:33.130> extra<00:01:34.130> work

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
why how terrible this is extra work

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.880 
why how terrible this is extra work
extra<00:01:34.910> time<00:01:35.150> suffering

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
extra time suffering

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.020 
extra time suffering
it<00:01:37.340> is<00:01:37.490> what<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:39.460> pretty<00:01:40.460> soon<00:01:40.700> we're<00:01:40.909> going

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
it is what it is pretty soon we're going

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.140 
it is what it is pretty soon we're going
to<00:01:41.120> fly<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.600> moon<00:01:41.720> without<00:01:42.110> an<00:01:42.409> engine

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.750 

anyway<00:01:45.660> so<00:01:45.930> these<00:01:46.080> two<00:01:46.260> what<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.670> what

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
anyway so these two what it is so what

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.270 
anyway so these two what it is so what
it<00:01:47.910> looks<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.240> an<00:01:48.390> EGR<00:01:48.980> hopefully<00:01:49.980> this<00:01:50.130> is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
it looks like an EGR hopefully this is

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.640 
it looks like an EGR hopefully this is
going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> solve<00:01:50.730> the<00:01:50.940> problem<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.870> it's

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
going to solve the problem and it's

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.649 
going to solve the problem and it's
going<00:01:52.830> to<00:01:52.890> make<00:01:53.010> us<00:01:53.040> work

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
going to make us work

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.160 
going to make us work
and<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.170> where<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> sensor<00:01:55.920> goes

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.220 

that's<00:01:59.710> it<00:01:59.920> yeah
