00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.910 
then it's going to last 3,000 cycles and
possibly<00:02:20.739> eight<00:02:21.010> years<00:02:22.230> there's<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.350> downside

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
possibly eight years there's a downside

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.449 
possibly eight years there's a downside
to<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.280> idea<00:02:24.700> if<00:02:25.390> you're<00:02:25.780> only<00:02:25.930> using<00:02:26.310> 20%<00:02:27.310> of

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
to this idea if you're only using 20% of

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.850 
to this idea if you're only using 20% of
your<00:02:27.610> battery<00:02:28.030> bank<00:02:28.209> capacity<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.500> to

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
your battery bank capacity you have to

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.640 
your battery bank capacity you have to
buy<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> much<00:02:30.400> bigger<00:02:30.670> battery<00:02:31.150> bank<00:02:31.360> and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
buy a much bigger battery bank and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.850 
buy a much bigger battery bank and
batteries<00:02:32.650> are<00:02:32.680> expensive<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.670> have<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> life

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
batteries are expensive and have a life

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.650 
batteries are expensive and have a life
so<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:35.890> expanded<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.670> battery<00:02:37.030> bank<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.510> make

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
so I expanded the battery bank to make

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.800 
so I expanded the battery bank to make
it<00:02:37.840> up<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:37.989> 48<00:02:38.530> volts<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.250> did<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.239> by<00:02:40.510> joining

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
it up to 48 volts I did this by joining

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.250 
it up to 48 volts I did this by joining
the<00:02:41.110> batteries<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.739> series<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.600> most<00:02:43.600> days<00:02:43.840> I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
the batteries in series on most days I

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.479 
the batteries in series on most days I
take<00:02:44.769> my<00:02:44.950> batteries<00:02:45.430> down<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.970> being<00:02:46.150> 80%<00:02:47.050> full

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
take my batteries down to being 80% full

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.400 
take my batteries down to being 80% full
so<00:02:48.489> my<00:02:48.700> battery<00:02:49.150> bank<00:02:49.360> is<00:02:49.600> much<00:02:49.840> bigger<00:02:50.110> than

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
so my battery bank is much bigger than

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.190 
so my battery bank is much bigger than
it<00:02:50.500> really<00:02:50.530> needs<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.250> I've<00:02:52.200> calculated

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
it really needs to be I've calculated

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.949 
it really needs to be I've calculated
that<00:02:53.680> each<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:54.100> my<00:02:54.250> battery<00:02:54.489> banks<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.630> store

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
that each of my battery banks can store

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.210 
that each of my battery banks can store
10.8<00:02:56.830> kilowatts<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:59.019> one<00:02:59.350> battery<00:02:59.739> bank<00:02:59.920> is

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
10.8 kilowatts and one battery bank is

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.490 
10.8 kilowatts and one battery bank is

kilowatt<00:03:43.329> battery<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:45.100> Tesla<00:03:45.549> battery<00:03:45.700> is

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
kilowatt battery the Tesla battery is

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.970 
kilowatt battery the Tesla battery is
being<00:03:46.390> offered<00:03:46.810> with<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:47.019> 10-year<00:03:47.530> warranty

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
being offered with a 10-year warranty

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.630 
being offered with a 10-year warranty
which<00:03:48.940> is<00:03:49.120> quite<00:03:49.329> remarkable<00:03:50.370> it's<00:03:51.370> also

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
which is quite remarkable it's also

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.910 
which is quite remarkable it's also
being<00:03:52.030> pitched<00:03:52.420> at<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.959> very<00:03:53.200> reasonable<00:03:53.620> price

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
being pitched at a very reasonable price

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.300 
being pitched at a very reasonable price
so<00:03:54.959> let's<00:03:55.959> see<00:03:56.260> if<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.530> battery<00:03:56.890> is<00:03:56.920> any<00:03:57.100> good

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
so let's see if the battery is any good

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.479 
so let's see if the battery is any good
for<00:03:57.549> me<00:03:57.670> in<00:03:58.440> theory<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.470> could<00:03:59.650> run<00:04:00.100> on<00:04:00.280> one

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
for me in theory I could run on one

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.150 
for me in theory I could run on one
battery<00:04:00.910> bank<00:04:01.170> but<00:04:02.170> this<00:04:02.319> means<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.829> would<00:04:02.980> be

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
battery bank but this means it would be

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.870 
battery bank but this means it would be
used<00:04:03.489> up<00:04:03.760> in<00:04:04.000> four<00:04:04.630> years<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:06.190> in<00:04:06.340> theory<00:04:06.670> I

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
used up in four years so in theory I

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.629 
used up in four years so in theory I
would<00:04:07.060> consume<00:04:07.720> two<00:04:08.049> battery<00:04:08.470> banks<00:04:08.920> in<00:04:09.130> eight

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
would consume two battery banks in eight

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.180 
would consume two battery banks in eight
years<00:04:09.840> whereas<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:10.959> Tesla's<00:04:11.470> warranty<00:04:12.010> is

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
years whereas the Tesla's warranty is

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.700 
years whereas the Tesla's warranty is
good<00:04:12.549> for<00:04:12.760> 10<00:04:12.970> years<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:14.769> price<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.040> very

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
good for 10 years and the price is very

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.240 
good for 10 years and the price is very
milah<00:04:16.540> so<00:04:17.540> based<00:04:17.840> on<00:04:18.050> that<00:04:18.320> are<00:04:18.530> really<00:04:19.010> quite

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
milah so based on that are really quite

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.080 
milah so based on that are really quite
like<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.580> powerwall

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
like the powerwall

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.480 
like the powerwall
and<00:04:20.330> if<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.930> add<00:04:21.080> the<00:04:21.230> fact<00:04:21.470> that<00:04:21.680> it<00:04:21.950> fits<00:04:22.280> on

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
and if you add the fact that it fits on

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.610 
and if you add the fact that it fits on
the<00:04:22.610> wall<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:23.120> don't<00:04:23.660> have<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:24.080> top<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:24.470> up<00:04:24.590> with

the wall I don't have to top it up with

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.890 
the wall I don't have to top it up with
water<00:04:25.040> this<00:04:25.940> becomes<00:04:26.360> really<00:04:26.600> quite

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
water this becomes really quite

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.240 
water this becomes really quite
