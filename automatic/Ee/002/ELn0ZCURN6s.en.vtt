want and in fact this one back room and
it's<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.810> bottom<00:04:07.580> so<00:04:08.580> it's<00:04:08.700> patience<00:04:09.180> has

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
it's the bottom so it's patience has

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:17.740 
it's the bottom so it's patience has
some<00:04:09.570> engines<00:04:11.090> loads<00:04:12.090> easier<00:04:12.390> lasers<00:04:12.840> and

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.390 

their<00:04:18.750> two<00:04:18.959> antennas<00:04:19.560> which<00:04:19.739> are<00:04:19.890> supposed<00:04:20.340> to

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
their two antennas which are supposed to

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.900 
their two antennas which are supposed to
be<00:04:20.489> lasers

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
be lasers

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.800 
be lasers
so<00:04:23.780> it's<00:04:23.960> a<00:04:24.080> very<00:04:24.470> very<00:04:24.980> nice<00:04:25.510> spaceship<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.750> I
