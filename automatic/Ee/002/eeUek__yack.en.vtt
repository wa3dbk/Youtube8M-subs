00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.930 

traveling<00:01:38.480> in<00:01:38.840> style<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.500> comfort<00:01:39.790> at<00:01:40.790> the

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.820 

and<00:01:49.420> then<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.890> have<00:01:51.130> so<00:01:51.880> what<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.330> k900<00:01:52.830> for

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
and then you have so what the k900 for

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.450 
and then you have so what the k900 for
the<00:01:53.890> first<00:01:54.160> time<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:54.490> believe<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:56.380> are<00:01:56.560> tries

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460
