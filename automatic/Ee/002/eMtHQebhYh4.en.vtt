00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
don't really believe that I mean that's

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.940 
don't really believe that I mean that's
not<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.790> Armenian<00:02:46.150> music<00:02:46.300> yes<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.410> believe

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
not the Armenian music yes I believe

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.680 
not the Armenian music yes I believe
that<00:02:48.720> because<00:02:49.720> God<00:02:50.320> sees<00:02:51.190> ahead<00:02:51.520> of<00:02:51.670> us<00:02:51.820> he

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
that because God sees ahead of us he

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.020 
that because God sees ahead of us he
knows<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.500> best<00:02:53.709> then<00:02:53.890> I'll<00:02:54.220> rather<00:02:54.550> say<00:02:54.820> that

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
knows the best then I'll rather say that

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.860 
knows the best then I'll rather say that
he<00:02:55.270> chooses<00:02:56.110> us<00:02:56.320> rather<00:02:57.130> than<00:02:57.280> we<00:02:58.270> choose<00:02:58.600> him

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
he chooses us rather than we choose him

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.870 
he chooses us rather than we choose him
of<00:02:59.050> course<00:02:59.260> he<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.770> giving<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.310> us<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.670> choice

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
of course he is giving it us the choice

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.030 
of course he is giving it us the choice
to<00:03:01.540> be<00:03:01.690> able<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.050> choose<00:03:02.260> him<00:03:02.470> we<00:03:02.740> need<00:03:02.920> to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
to be able to choose him we need to

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.260

chapter<00:05:37.500> 8<00:05:37.919> that<00:05:38.430> those<00:05:38.699> recording<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.240> flesh

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
chapter 8 that those recording the flesh

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.450 
chapter 8 that those recording the flesh
cannot<00:05:39.870> do<00:05:40.110> what<00:05:40.289> is<00:05:40.380> pleasing<00:05:40.590> to<00:05:40.979> God<00:05:41.220> well

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
cannot do what is pleasing to God well

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.890 
cannot do what is pleasing to God well
certainly<00:05:41.789> we<00:05:41.849> wouldn't<00:05:42.090> argue<00:05:42.330> that<00:05:42.599> the

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
certainly we wouldn't argue that the

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.960 
certainly we wouldn't argue that the
repentance<00:05:43.530> is<00:05:43.710> not<00:05:43.740> pleasing<00:05:44.159> to<00:05:44.340> God<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:44.849> so

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
repentance is not pleasing to God and so

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.879 
repentance is not pleasing to God and so
those<00:05:45.120> are<00:05:45.300> according<00:05:45.630> to<00:05:45.659> the<00:05:45.720> flesh<00:05:46.020> they

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
those are according to the flesh they

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.350 
those are according to the flesh they
cannot<00:05:47.130> do<00:05:47.370> what<00:05:47.580> is<00:05:47.669> pleasing<00:05:47.789> to<00:05:48.060> God<00:05:48.240> they

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
cannot do what is pleasing to God they

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.850 
cannot do what is pleasing to God they
cannot<00:05:48.570> submit<00:05:48.960> themselves<00:05:49.169> in<00:05:49.560> that<00:05:49.680> way<00:05:49.800> so

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
cannot submit themselves in that way so

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.339 
cannot submit themselves in that way so
