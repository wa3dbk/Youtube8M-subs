00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.029 
believer in following a low sugar way of
eating<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> question<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.350> often<00:00:25.529> get<00:00:25.830> is

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
eating so the question I often get is

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.089 
eating so the question I often get is
what<00:00:26.580> about<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.090> sugar<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.720> fruit<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.859> eating

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
what about the sugar in fruit can eating

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.609 
what about the sugar in fruit can eating
too<00:00:29.429> much<00:00:29.609> fruit<00:00:29.939> actually<00:00:30.179> make<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.289> fat

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
too much fruit actually make you fat

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.319 
too much fruit actually make you fat
well<00:00:32.070> first<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:32.460> eating<00:00:32.790> too<00:00:33.000> much<00:00:33.149> of

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
well first of all eating too much of

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.420 
well first of all eating too much of
anything<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:34.920> when<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.070> say<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
anything can do that but when I say to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.639 
anything can do that but when I say to
cut<00:00:35.670> down<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.000> sugar<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.630> most<00:00:37.079> cases<00:00:37.350> I'm

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
cut down on sugar in most cases I'm

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.590 
cut down on sugar in most cases I'm
specifically<00:00:38.370> referring<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:39.059> processed

of natural forms of fructose from fruit

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.799 
of natural forms of fructose from fruit
could<00:00:50.190> cause<00:00:50.460> health<00:00:50.789> problems<00:00:50.850> you'd<00:00:51.600> have

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
could cause health problems you'd have

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.229 
could cause health problems you'd have
to<00:00:51.960> eat<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.350> stupid<00:00:53.129> amount<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.670> fruit<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
to eat a stupid amount of fruit for that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.600 
to eat a stupid amount of fruit for that
to<00:00:54.390> happen<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.289> highly<00:00:55.890> doubt<00:00:56.070> you'll<00:00:56.489> be

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
to happen so I highly doubt you'll be

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.279 
to happen so I highly doubt you'll be
able<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> overload<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.570> liver<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:58.020> enough

fructose from whole fruit to actually
get<00:01:01.109> fat<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:02.129> also<00:01:02.399> important<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.120> able

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
get fat it's also important to be able

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.270

will go on record saying that is a lot

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.190 
will go on record saying that is a lot
easier<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.100> fat<00:01:20.400> drinking<00:01:21.330> pasteurized

fruit juice from your grocery store why

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
fruit juice from your grocery store why
because<00:01:25.200> here's<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> difference<00:01:25.950> whole

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
because here's the difference whole

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.910 
because here's the difference whole
fruit<00:01:26.820> contains<00:01:27.270> fiber<00:01:27.630> which<00:01:28.200> will<00:01:28.470> slow<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
fruit contains fiber which will slow the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.260 
fruit contains fiber which will slow the
release<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.159> sugar<00:01:29.310> into<00:01:29.759> your<00:01:30.000> bloodstream

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
release of sugar into your bloodstream

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.260 
release of sugar into your bloodstream
and<00:01:30.750> liver<00:01:31.530> fiber<00:01:31.979> will<00:01:32.189> also<00:01:32.610> make<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.909> fill

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and liver fiber will also make you fill

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.420 
and liver fiber will also make you fill
up<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.630> lot<00:01:33.990> faster<00:01:34.619> which<00:01:34.979> makes<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> almost

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
up a lot faster which makes it almost

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.940 
up a lot faster which makes it almost
impossible<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:36.240> over<00:01:36.600> consume<00:01:36.930> fruit<00:01:37.439> plus
