said<00:03:15.910> it's<00:03:16.690> at<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.870> vvt-i<00:03:17.410> motor<00:03:17.830> which<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.160> a

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
said it's at the vvt-i motor which is a

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
cam cam adjusting has to go through the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.539 
cam cam adjusting has to go through the
power<00:03:23.319> of<00:03:23.440> an<00:03:23.560> power<00:03:23.920> van<00:03:24.129> there<00:03:24.310> gives<00:03:24.519> you

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
power of an power van there gives you

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.789 
power of an power van there gives you
more<00:03:24.700> power<00:03:24.760> by<00:03:25.120> advancing<00:03:25.659> the<00:03:25.690> cam<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.230> now

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
more power by advancing the cam so now

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.140 
more power by advancing the cam so now
if<00:03:26.890> we're<00:03:27.010> four<00:03:27.220> cylinder<00:03:27.519> it<00:03:27.730> does<00:03:27.879> get<00:03:28.060> up

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
if we're four cylinder it does get up

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.420 
if we're four cylinder it does get up
and<00:03:28.269> go<00:03:28.390> moves<00:03:28.660> pretty<00:03:28.900> good<00:03:29.129> like<00:03:30.129> I<00:03:30.190> said

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
and go moves pretty good like I said

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.530 
and go moves pretty good like I said
though<00:03:30.549> it<00:03:30.579> does<00:03:30.790> need<00:03:30.940> those<00:03:31.060> valve<00:03:31.269> guides

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
though it does need those valve guides

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.180
