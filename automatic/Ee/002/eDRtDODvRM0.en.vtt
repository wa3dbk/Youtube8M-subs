00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030 
reptile so um I'll explain to you about
the<00:01:48.390> lighting<00:01:48.720> if<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.110> guys<00:01:49.229> are<00:01:49.409> confused<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the lighting if you guys are confused it

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.810 
the lighting if you guys are confused it
and<00:01:53.060> here<00:01:54.060> are<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.780> thermometers<00:01:55.619> here's<00:01:56.610> one

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and here are the thermometers here's one

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.609 
and here are the thermometers here's one
for<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.030> cool<00:01:57.299> side<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> tank<00:01:57.990> use<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
for the cool side of the tank use a

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.359 
for the cool side of the tank use a
thermometer<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.380> digital<00:02:01.890> thermometer

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
thermometer it's a digital thermometer

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.690 
thermometer it's a digital thermometer
and<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:05.270> stick<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.770> inside<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.129> cage<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
and you stick that inside the cage and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.370 
and you stick that inside the cage and
it<00:02:09.739> tells<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.510> temperature<00:02:12.510> so

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
it tells the temperature so

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.120 
it tells the temperature so
you<00:02:13.560> could<00:02:13.710> also<00:02:13.890> switch<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.640> Celsius<00:02:16.130> and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
you could also switch it to Celsius and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.390 
you could also switch it to Celsius and
right<00:02:18.090> now<00:02:18.210> it's<00:02:18.360> nighttime<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.260> a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
right now it's nighttime and this is a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.260 
right now it's nighttime and this is a
unappropriate<00:02:20.400> nighttime<00:02:20.760> temperature

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
unappropriate nighttime temperature

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.970 
unappropriate nighttime temperature
since<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.810> night<00:02:22.350> temperature<00:02:22.800> should<00:02:22.920> be

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
since the night temperature should be

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.250 
since the night temperature should be
around<00:02:23.510> sixty<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.630> seventy<00:02:24.750> five<00:02:25.110> degrees

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
around sixty or seventy five degrees

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.370 
around sixty or seventy five degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:27.300> lighting<00:02:27.720> I'm<00:02:27.870> using<00:02:28.080> a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
Fahrenheit and the lighting I'm using a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.640 
Fahrenheit and the lighting I'm using a
full-spectrum<00:02:29.630> fluorescent<00:02:30.980> fixture<00:02:33.650> it's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
full-spectrum fluorescent fixture it's

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.590 
full-spectrum fluorescent fixture it's
UVA<00:02:35.190> UVB<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:36.980> about<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.280> green<00:02:38.850> anoles<00:02:39.330> need

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
UVA UVB and about that green anoles need

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.790 
UVA UVB and about that green anoles need
this<00:02:39.840> or<00:02:40.490> any<00:02:41.490> reptile<00:02:42.090> needs<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.690> UVB<00:02:43.200> if<00:02:43.560> they

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
this or any reptile needs a UVB if they

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.050 
this or any reptile needs a UVB if they
are<00:02:43.950> diurnal<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:45.960> green<00:02:46.170> anole<00:02:47.060> needs

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
are diurnal so this green anole needs

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.230 
are diurnal so this green anole needs
this<00:02:48.330> um<00:02:49.100> what's<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.220> called<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.640> fluorescent

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
this um what's it called a fluorescent

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.550 
this um what's it called a fluorescent
bulb<00:02:52.130> which<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.280> right<00:02:53.430> there<00:02:54.590> it's<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.890> fixture

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
bulb which is right there it's a fixture

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.480 
bulb which is right there it's a fixture
it's<00:02:58.560> UVA<00:02:58.980> UVB<00:02:59.130> without<00:03:00.090> UVB<00:03:01.280> without<00:03:02.280> this

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
it's UVA UVB without UVB without this

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.900 
it's UVA UVB without UVB without this
fixture<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:04.200> anole<00:03:04.530> would<00:03:04.890> get<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.340> disease

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
fixture the anole would get a disease

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.040 
fixture the anole would get a disease
that's<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.190> bones<00:03:08.430> it's<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:09.270> bone

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
that's that is in the bones it's a bone

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.760 
that's that is in the bones it's a bone
disease<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:11.030> actually<00:03:12.230> can<00:03:13.230> kill<00:03:13.530> your

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
disease that actually can kill your

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.010 
disease that actually can kill your
reptile<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.210> very<00:03:15.390> important<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.960> have

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
reptile so it's very important to have

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.750 
reptile so it's very important to have
this<00:03:16.260> UV<00:03:16.730> be<00:03:17.730> fixture<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:19.490> yeah<00:03:20.490> so<00:03:20.700> you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
this UV be fixture and yeah so you

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.670 
this UV be fixture and yeah so you
should<00:03:21.090> get<00:03:21.240> one<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.720> it's<00:03:22.080> also<00:03:22.260> important

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
should get one and it's also important

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.960 
should get one and it's also important
to<00:03:22.710> have<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:24.290> basking<00:03:25.290> spot<00:03:25.560> lamp<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.700> right

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
to have a basking spot lamp and right

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.690 
to have a basking spot lamp and right
now<00:03:27.090> it's<00:03:27.270> nighttime<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:28.070> um<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.940> know<00:03:30.150> Lee<00:03:30.210> I

don't know if you can see it's right and
there's<00:03:34.860> someone<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:36.290> basking<00:03:37.290> spot<00:03:37.590> lamp

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
there's someone and basking spot lamp

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.260 
there's someone and basking spot lamp
right<00:03:38.700> here<00:03:39.170> this<00:03:40.790> nano<00:03:41.790> Lee<00:03:41.850> bass<00:03:42.090> right

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
right here this nano Lee bass right

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.880 
right here this nano Lee bass right
there<00:03:42.330> does<00:03:42.630> this<00:03:42.720> basking<00:03:43.230> spot<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:45.530> this<00:03:46.530> is

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
there does this basking spot and this is

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.250 
there does this basking spot and this is
the<00:03:47.130> thermometer<00:03:47.430> again<00:03:48.420> for<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.780> basking

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
the thermometer again for the basking

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.800 
the thermometer again for the basking
spot<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.820> vesting<00:03:51.180> spot<00:03:51.450> should<00:03:51.630> be

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
spot and the vesting spot should be

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.540 
spot and the vesting spot should be
around<00:03:52.700> 85<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:54.709> 95<00:03:55.709> degrees<00:03:56.160> so<00:03:56.610> make<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.820> and

miss your green anole several times
during<00:05:44.620> the<00:05:44.830> day<00:05:45.010> I<00:05:45.220> use<00:05:45.580> this<00:05:47.070> mister<00:05:48.070> I<00:05:48.280> fill

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
during the day I use this mister I fill

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.529 
during the day I use this mister I fill
it<00:05:48.639> up<00:05:48.700> with<00:05:48.820> water<00:05:49.030> and<00:05:49.210> just<00:05:49.479> simply<00:05:51.539> spray

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
it up with water and just simply spray

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.529 
it up with water and just simply spray
your<00:05:53.139> are<00:05:53.410> you<00:05:53.650> and<00:05:54.340> it<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:55.030> keeps<00:05:55.210> moisture

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
your are you and it it keeps moisture

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:00.540 
your are you and it it keeps moisture
and<00:05:56.610> cage<00:05:57.610> and<00:05:58.830> um<00:05:59.830> I<00:05:59.919> don't<00:06:00.250> have<00:06:00.430> a

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
and cage and um I don't have a

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.689 
and cage and um I don't have a
hydrometer<00:06:01.000> but<00:06:01.979> you<00:06:02.979> can<00:06:03.160> use<00:06:03.280> a<00:06:03.310> hydrometer

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
hydrometer but you can use a hydrometer

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.480 
hydrometer but you can use a hydrometer
to<00:06:05.340> keep<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.610> what's<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.389> called<00:06:07.570> the

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
to keep the what's it called the

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.860 
to keep the what's it called the
humidity<00:06:09.490> level<00:06:09.820> and<00:06:10.090> it<00:06:10.510> should<00:06:10.630> be<00:06:10.750> I<00:06:10.780> think

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
humidity level and it should be I think

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.620 
humidity level and it should be I think
seventy<00:06:11.440> to<00:06:11.560> eighty<00:06:11.710> percent<00:06:12.270> humidity<00:06:13.270> in

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
seventy to eighty percent humidity in

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.770 
seventy to eighty percent humidity in
the<00:06:13.660> cage<00:06:13.930> so<00:06:14.260> this<00:06:15.039> substrate<00:06:15.970> also<00:06:16.120> helps

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
the cage so this substrate also helps

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.279 
the cage so this substrate also helps
keep<00:06:16.990> humidity<00:06:17.380> so<00:06:17.800> that's<00:06:18.729> what<00:06:18.940> I<00:06:18.970> use<00:06:19.300> and<00:06:19.599> I

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
keep humidity so that's what I use and I

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.450 
keep humidity so that's what I use and I
turn<00:06:21.010> the<00:06:21.160> basking<00:06:21.550> spot<00:06:21.580> lamp<00:06:22.510> off<00:06:22.900> at<00:06:23.770> night

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
turn the basking spot lamp off at night

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.450 
turn the basking spot lamp off at night
I<00:06:24.849> keep<00:06:25.780> it<00:06:25.900> on<00:06:25.990> during<00:06:26.199> daylight<00:06:26.830> hours<00:06:26.889> only

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
I keep it on during daylight hours only

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.170 
I keep it on during daylight hours only
and<00:06:27.910> you<00:06:28.510> should<00:06:28.720> get<00:06:28.930> 10<00:06:29.410> to<00:06:29.530> 12<00:06:29.770> hours<00:06:30.310> of<00:06:30.340> UVB

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
and you should get 10 to 12 hours of UVB

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.540 
and you should get 10 to 12 hours of UVB
lighting<00:06:31.449> for<00:06:31.780> your<00:06:31.840> green<00:06:32.139> anole<00:06:32.470> in<00:06:32.740> order

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
lighting for your green anole in order

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.339 
lighting for your green anole in order
to<00:06:33.760> process<00:06:34.590> healthy<00:06:35.590> bone<00:06:36.190> structure<00:06:36.820> this

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
to process healthy bone structure this

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.779 
to process healthy bone structure this
gives<00:06:38.349> the<00:06:38.560> anole<00:06:38.860> all<00:06:39.070> the<00:06:39.250> calcium<00:06:39.490> they

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
gives the anole all the calcium they

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:40.050 
gives the anole all the calcium they
need

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
need

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.490 
need
their<00:06:40.240> bone<00:06:40.389> so<00:06:40.630> it's<00:06:40.780> very<00:06:40.960> important<00:06:41.440> to

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
their bone so it's very important to

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.820 
their bone so it's very important to
have<00:06:41.650> the<00:06:41.770> UVB<00:06:42.130> light<00:06:42.490> so<00:06:43.450> this<00:06:44.169> is<00:06:44.350> just<00:06:44.560> one

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
have the UVB light so this is just one

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.629 
have the UVB light so this is just one
