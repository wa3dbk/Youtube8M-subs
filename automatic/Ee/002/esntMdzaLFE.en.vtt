 the new addresses like here for 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.350

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.350
 wrong notes 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.180
 the concept of haute couture pastry has 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.650
 been launched eight years ago by stone 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.510
 hermÃ© 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.210
 since this art of upsetting the forms 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.779
 and the codes of tradition exploded 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.179
 in the capital of pastries a little 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.099
 somewhat crafty concept a little to the 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.980
 fashion ten years ago there are 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.769
 was not in Paris today he in 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.379
 opens a trend every six months 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.110
 background that often surf with the 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.519
 Parisian snobbery the past that are 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.350
 pretty smart because they understand that 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.480
 people need this and need 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.239
 to value themselves in the idea that they have 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.699
 discovered places and it's really 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.070
 the sentence of the Parisian I found 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.469
 a small pastry next to my home 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.239
 do things so well you 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.260
 really that you tasted you give me 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.399
 address to no I can not give you 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.070
 the address because it's so 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.070
 confidential they do not give themselves the 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.200
 addresses pass came this secret but 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.270
 beyond the modes the development of 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.250
 high-end pastries has an origin 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.119
 very precise 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.180
 the ambition of young talents 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.020
 working in the hospitality we go 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.630
 that a phenomenon 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.270
 there are pastry chefs who have pretty much 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.830
 the thirties or even the quarantine are 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.600
 stayed long enough in big 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.670
 palaces the plaza the georges sac 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.470
 formerly pencil and who are 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.049
 consultants for example they want 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.400
 finally to open their own pastry 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.140
 to be the owner 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.140
 they will associate with 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.700
 investors and are going to want to 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.770
 show other solutions capable of 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.150
 do without having a hierarchy without 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.800
 to have not too much 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.530
 but with the multiplication of these 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.540
 shops a danger threat 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.220
 everyone is trying to find the idea of 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.979
 century I'm going to open a shop 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.659
 specialized in cream puff 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.200
 extraordinary I proposed a single 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.330
 product 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.400
 declined in 25 different forms 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.880
 is that what customers 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.330
 expect in terms of mud in terms of 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.030
 flavor 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.030
 in terms of proposal I am patient 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.989
 in the face of these fashionable pastries 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.450
 some have made the choice to return to 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.209
 the essential quality and freshness 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.040
 some products 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.630
 the project is a pastry chef who has 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.209
 worked at the bigger ones as said 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.550
 know white sylvain is an engineer 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.920
 brilliant from the world of luxury 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.709
 three years ago and two childhood friends 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.800
 have decided to create this pastry to 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.830
 jewelry look with logo in shape 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.560
 of fish and which offers cakes to 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.640
 the way of a cabinet of curiosities the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.500
 individual cakes it's so 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.930
 surprising unusual talent of them 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.959
 find here all alone in their small 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.519
 box presented in columns that 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.209
 are really good furniture 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.760
 specific 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.290
 well, people do not expect a real 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.390
 surprise 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.269
 here prices have been thought not to 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.049
 influence the choice of dessert every 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.690
 traditional cakes are at 5:40 or 6 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.000
 20 euros for creations and what 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.030
 whether the sophistication of the cake or 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.680
 the ingredients used to price more 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.810
 expensive than traditional rice pastry 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.269
 but who take into account the extreme 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.030
 freshness of products that are mounted 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:27.010
 backstage all day long 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.530
 90% of pastry chefs but it's not it 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.510
 not bad happens very early in the morning do 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.860
 the cakes of the day and after the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.840
 guests come during the day 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.590
 we broke it because I 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.720
 wanted to work as in a 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.210
 restaurant have that freshness side to the 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.160
 minute so that when we put fruit 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.380
 on a pie he is the most brilliant 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.490
 possible not at all dry so that the 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.030
 thousand leaves are extremely 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.920
 landed 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.870
 yes it is possible and make a ghost 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.200
 with four people the praline and well 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.530

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.550
 maximum quality 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.100
 this house has opted for another big 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.740
 bias only work the fruits 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.500

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.580
 very late as strawberries and but he 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.470
 there is an economic interest camp for not 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.230
 quote that the strawberry the strawberry in all 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.860

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.900
 gariguette around the 10th of April they go 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.600

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.000
 we an interest for our customers because 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.270
 that if we buy phrases 1 euro the 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.740

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.660

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.480
 citrus fruits of lemon mandarin in 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.850
 going through the fashionable fruit 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.770
 the kumbh awa of the flavors that 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.900
 found on pies in the design 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.390
 pretty original is we who have 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.220
 drawn the mold the cookie cutter can 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.380
 have plenty of perfume and everyone is 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.900
 choice and it avoids the fateful moment 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.940
 who cuts the cake 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.759

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.850
 to have copied their ideas as per 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.380
 example this single piece pie background that 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.370
 we find in some catalogs 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.260
 industrial 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.580
 at first regretted a little bit annoying 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.590
 say no it's not possible can not 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.760
 unravel all alone and then after we 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.600

 their shops to taste and 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.620
 to formally take inspiration from their 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.860
 creation 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.150
 and then contact us for 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.250
 regularly privatize the shop that 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.350
 come with a little bit their manager

 r &amp; d of the whole world is it founded 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.270
 brainstorm with us and often that makes 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.530
 the object of a sling and turn to paris 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.030
 so they will spend two hours at 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.979
 we two hours right on the left 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.120
 encounters that are not necessarily 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.280
 one-way 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.169
 during these exchanges it is also 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.760
 the opportunity to benefit from their very 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.060
 good knowledge of clients and 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.520
 market 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.979
 for example we knew not long ago 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.690
 through our exchanges that she is ice 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.270
 the most sold was vanilla and the 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.680
 pistachio and pistachio it's not 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.620
 necessarily an ice cream that we would have 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.650
 necessarily made or pure vanilla the 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.900
 boundaries between industry and crafts 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.910
 are more than ever scrambled and in 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.160
 the current legal void the clients 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.900
 have no way of knowing the origin 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.780
 of what they buy in 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.930
 pastry or whether the cakes 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:48.110
 that they consume conservative cash more 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.150
 ten dyes or excess sugar 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.400
 potential dangers that deserve 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.650
 to be reported so that gourmands 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.060
 can continue to feast without 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.060
 risk to sulk their pleasure
