00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
seven chemistry because he will only get

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.779 
seven chemistry because he will only get
one<00:00:19.020> link<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.650> from<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> look<00:00:20.220> at<00:00:20.369> when

lucas and that in she wasn't getting the
nine<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.580> chemistry<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.779> i<00:00:27.840> might<00:00:28.439> change<00:00:28.740> it

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
nine in chemistry but i might change it

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.679 
nine in chemistry but i might change it
in<00:00:29.099> game<00:00:29.460> i<00:00:29.490> tried<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.060> out<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.179> little<00:00:30.390> bit<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
in game i tried it out a little bit and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.690 
in game i tried it out a little bit and
i'm<00:00:30.810> not<00:00:31.019> too<00:00:31.199> sure<00:00:31.230> which<00:00:31.740> works<00:00:32.099> best<00:00:32.430> i

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
i'm not too sure which works best i

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.670 
i'm not too sure which works best i
probably<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.930> play<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> few<00:00:34.320> more<00:00:34.380> games

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
probably have to play a few more games

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.100 
probably have to play a few more games
before<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.370> decide<00:00:35.489> upon<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.750> I'm

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
before I can decide upon that but I'm

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.200 
before I can decide upon that but I'm
training<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.829> nil<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:38.579> before<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
training one nil and it's not before the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.360 
training one nil and it's not before the
86<00:00:39.809> million<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.260> managed<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.739> get<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.100> goal

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
86 million that I managed to get a goal

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.549 
86 million that I managed to get a goal
here<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.670> woloson<00:00:42.059> cutting<00:00:42.390> inside<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.290> make

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
here with woloson cutting inside to make

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.709 
here with woloson cutting inside to make
it<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> 11<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.730> thought<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.090> were<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.420> into

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
it a 11 and I thought we were going into

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.720 
it a 11 and I thought we were going into
extra<00:00:45.899> time<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> don't<00:00:47.039> manage<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.340> hit<00:00:47.550> him

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
extra time but I don't manage to hit him

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.700 
extra time but I don't manage to hit him
on<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> counter<00:00:48.420> attack<00:00:48.510> from<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> corner<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
on a counter attack from a corner and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
on a counter attack from a corner and
we'll<00:00:50.250> find<00:00:50.579> Ibrahimovic<00:00:51.360> day<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> knew<00:00:51.870> I

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
we'll find Ibrahimovic day I knew I

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.720 
we'll find Ibrahimovic day I knew I
couldn't<00:00:52.140> get<00:00:52.320> past<00:00:52.469> about<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.100> when<00:00:53.489> he<00:00:53.520> was

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
couldn't get past about it when he was

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.180 
couldn't get past about it when he was
jugging<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.870> find<00:00:55.140> him<00:00:55.260> anybody

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
jugging like that so we find him anybody

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.029 
jugging like that so we find him anybody

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
late goes to win me the game and that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.349 
late goes to win me the game and that
means<00:01:01.410> I'm<00:01:01.620> foo<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.520> corner<00:01:02.879> fans<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
means I'm foo to the corner fans and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
means I'm foo to the corner fans and
keep<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> same<00:01:04.439> side<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
keep going with the same side and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.219 
keep going with the same side and
another<00:01:05.670> thing<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> said<00:01:06.360> about<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
another thing you said about it was that

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
another thing you said about it was that
I<00:01:07.500> should<00:01:07.710> change<00:01:07.979> Kiba<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> team<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
I should change Kiba that the team of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.300 
I should change Kiba that the team of
the<00:01:09.330> year<00:01:09.360> Casilla<00:01:10.170> wasn't<00:01:10.590> worth<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.010> coin

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the year Casilla wasn't worth the coin

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.130 
the year Casilla wasn't worth the coin
so<00:01:11.670> I'll<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.360> play<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> few<00:01:12.810> more<00:01:12.869> games

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
so I'll have to play a few more games

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.679 
so I'll have to play a few more games
before<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.619> judge<00:01:14.220> about<00:01:14.490> judge<00:01:14.700> upon<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.479> but

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
before I judge about judge upon that but

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.109 
before I judge about judge upon that but
I<00:01:15.869> mind<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.710> element<00:01:17.159> because<00:01:17.460> he's<00:01:17.700> went<00:01:18.000> up

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
I mind this element because he's went up

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.359 
I mind this element because he's went up
about<00:01:18.299> 100k<00:01:19.110> since<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.530> bought<00:01:19.710> him<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> nice

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
about 100k since I bought him so a nice

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.460 
about 100k since I bought him so a nice
profit<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.119> made<00:01:21.150> there<00:01:21.330> actually<00:01:21.930> but

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
profit to be made there actually but

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
profit to be made there actually but
moving<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.979> gameplay<00:01:23.369> nice<00:01:23.759> Tavia<00:01:24.150> by<00:01:24.299> a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
moving on to gameplay nice Tavia by a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.120 
moving on to gameplay nice Tavia by a
movie<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.900> past<00:01:25.140> two<00:01:25.350> defenders<00:01:25.500> find

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
movie going past two defenders find

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.030 
movie going past two defenders find
woloson<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.450> will<00:01:27.780> make<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.619> also<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
woloson and that will make it one also a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.920 
woloson and that will make it one also a
