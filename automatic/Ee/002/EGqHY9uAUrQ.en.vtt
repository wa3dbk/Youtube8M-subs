00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.960
 butter and water so 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:46.350
 I open innovative and I install the

 slow speed 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.159
 the right idea of ​​melting water and the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.859
 butter once the water and melted butter 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:05.819
 I can stop chef cooking and 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.619
 stop the temperature I open everything and 

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:10.110
 I will pour all the ingredients to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.440
 know the icing sugar the flour and the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.440
 powdered almonds 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.920
 I close and I mix until I get 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.920
 a homogeneous paste 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.899
 I have a homogeneous paste do not worry 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.619
 not it is slightly liquid it is 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.210
 complitly normal 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.070
 you can either work it all from 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.810
 following or so there sisters opposed to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.920
 fridge so that it solidifies and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.130
 so work it a lot more 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:37.439
 easily I realize then but 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.030
 tiles using a small spoon 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.140
 we make a little pile like that here I do 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.369
 that on a silicone canvas 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.289
 you can very well do this on a 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.240
 parchment paper or on a plate 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.799
 nonstick and was going well 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.899
 tiles at cooking they will have 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.729
 tendency to spread out so it's not 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.409
 sufficiently spaced they will stick 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.000
 between one ends up with a leak 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.319
 giant but you they are now 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.569
 realized I'll be able to put them at 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.340
 oven at 200 ° for about six to eight 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:08.399
 minutes the time it spreads and 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.479
 especially some aramendi well for the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.630
 making the meringue 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.269
 I need three sugar whites 2 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.980
 and icing sugar 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.670
 so I do not know at first 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.959
 the yellows of the whites the whites in the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.569
 king chef bowl 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.190
 the yellows I keep them well he me 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.590
 will be used for making sabayon 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.859
 in the meantime I put my egg yolks 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.410
 in the fridge I install the whip blow 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:37.230
 king chef 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.120
 I close and I start slowly 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.370
 the idea is going to be at first of 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.870
 untie the blu which will allow in 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.250
 makes them go up a lot more 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.750
 easily with a lot more 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.410
 regularity which will allow me to have 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.410
 a beautiful meringue 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.020
 and then I accelerate as I go 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.910
 as soon as the whites start to be 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.240
 well sparkling I'll be able to add the 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.240
 Granulated sugar 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.070
 I now get something from 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.120
 well firm of good shining i'm going 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.950
 add the icing sugar 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.660
 I mix everything gently for good 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.050
 add the icing sugar to the rest of 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.050
 Meringue 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.030
 my meringue is now ready she 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.350

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.900
 put it in your pocket we will apply it 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.640
 then on our small roasted figs 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.770

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.270
 shape the one you want and the 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.680
 bake in its oven 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.690
 about an hour on will allow 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.340
 to get a crispy meringue 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.890
 there we will be closer to the meringue 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.990
