00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
stating as the fighting type the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.789 
stating as the fighting type the
interference<00:01:39.180> type<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.930> support<00:01:40.350> type<00:01:40.590> and

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
interference type the support type and

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.109 
interference type the support type and
the<00:01:40.890> key<00:01:41.070> left<00:01:41.340> side<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:43.640> we<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:44.909> know

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
the key left side now we do not know

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.679 
the key left side now we do not know
what<00:01:45.299> these<00:01:45.540> mean<00:01:46.020> right<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:46.979> i<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:48.540> i'm

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
what these mean right now i get i'm

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.600 
what these mean right now i get i'm
guessing<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.079> fighting<00:01:49.530> type<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:50.009> probably

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
guessing the fighting type is probably

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.780 
guessing the fighting type is probably
the<00:01:50.820> aggressive<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.979> interference<00:01:53.579> type

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the aggressive one the interference type

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.460 
the aggressive one the interference type
is<00:01:53.970> probably<00:01:54.360> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
is probably going to be like the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.620 
is probably going to be like the
ultimate<00:01:55.530> opportunist<00:01:56.399> waiting<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
ultimate opportunist waiting for the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.510 
ultimate opportunist waiting for the
right<00:01:57.810> time<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.409> strike<00:01:58.619> probably<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.280> that

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
right time to strike probably like that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.719 
right time to strike probably like that
stuff<00:01:59.880> support<00:02:00.659> type<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.079> probably<00:02:01.320> just

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
stuff support type it's probably just

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.270 
stuff support type it's probably just
supporting<00:02:02.729> probably<00:02:03.329> um<00:02:03.950> probably<00:02:04.950> just

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
supporting probably um probably just

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.530 
supporting probably um probably just
like

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
like

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.609 
like
I<00:02:06.630> don't<00:02:07.110> know<00:02:07.170> how<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> explain<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.180> I<00:02:09.619> really

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
I don't know how to explain it I really

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.800 
I don't know how to explain it I really
haven't<00:02:10.890> really<00:02:11.160> thought<00:02:11.400> about<00:02:11.460> it<00:02:11.810> about

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
haven't really thought about it about

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.550 
haven't really thought about it about
the<00:02:12.990> support<00:02:13.440> type<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.900> thought

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
the support type but I have thought

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.260 
the support type but I have thought
about<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.980> other<00:02:17.160> ones<00:02:17.400> there's<00:02:17.970> another<00:02:18.180> one

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
about the other ones there's another one

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.230 
about the other ones there's another one
of<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.570> key<00:02:18.750> blast<00:02:19.020> tight<00:02:19.350> will<00:02:19.670> will<00:02:20.670> tell<00:02:21.060> it

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
of the key blast tight will will tell it

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.700 
of the key blast tight will will tell it
says<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.780> its<00:02:21.930> name<00:02:22.110> how<00:02:22.410> are<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.500> going<00:02:22.620> to

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
says it in its name how are we going to

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.680 
says it in its name how are we going to
be<00:02:22.770> shooting<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.100> bunch<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.340> key<00:02:23.580> black<00:02:23.850> because

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
be shooting a bunch of key black because

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.520 
be shooting a bunch of key black because
remember<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.350> team<00:02:26.870> team<00:02:27.870> based<00:02:28.140> game

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
remember this is a team team based game

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.130 
remember this is a team team based game
and<00:02:28.830> you're<00:02:29.730> gonna<00:02:29.820> have<00:02:30.030> about<00:02:30.150> like<00:02:30.510> four

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
and you're gonna have about like four

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.650 
and you're gonna have about like four
five<00:02:31.650> characters<00:02:32.250> attacking<00:02:32.790> one<00:02:32.940> person<00:02:33.390> at

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
five characters attacking one person at

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.960 
five characters attacking one person at
once<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.850> it's<00:02:35.850> probably<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:37.230> only<00:02:37.320> logical

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
once so it's probably the only logical

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.890 
once so it's probably the only logical
substance<00:02:38.970> which<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.240> have<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:39.690> these

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
different types of all the characters

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.350 
different types of all the characters
and<00:02:42.030> stuff<00:02:42.590> types<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.830> stuff<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.940> let's<00:02:45.120> get

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and stuff types of stuff so let's get

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.780 
and stuff types of stuff so let's get
it's<00:02:45.930> really<00:02:46.260> basically<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.250> only<00:02:47.400> good

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
it's really basically the only good

thing yeah so let's get to the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.550 
thing yeah so let's get to the
disappointing<00:02:52.920> things<00:02:53.130> up<00:02:54.110> one<00:02:55.110> there<00:02:55.410> would

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
disappointing things up one there would

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.360 
disappointing things up one there would

of Z I repeat there will be no dt
characters<00:03:01.860> only<00:03:02.340> because<00:03:03.030> they<00:03:03.150> said<00:03:03.360> not

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
characters only because they said not

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.430 
characters only because they said not
enough<00:03:03.900> people<00:03:04.560> really<00:03:04.890> cared<00:03:05.190> about<00:03:05.420> GT<00:03:06.440> they

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
enough people really cared about GT they

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.590 
enough people really cared about GT they
thought<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:07.709> no<00:03:08.160> one<00:03:08.310> really<00:03:08.340> care<00:03:08.910> if<00:03:09.180> they

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
thought that no one really care if they

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.030 
thought that no one really care if they
didn't<00:03:09.840> put<00:03:10.050> them<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.260> there<00:03:10.410> or<00:03:10.530> not<00:03:10.709> which<00:03:11.010> is

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
didn't put them in there or not which is

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.080 
didn't put them in there or not which is
really<00:03:11.730> wrong<00:03:12.030> um<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:13.640> lot<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.760> people<00:03:14.970> really

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
really wrong um a lot of people really

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.470 
really wrong um a lot of people really
like<00:03:15.330> GT<00:03:15.690> even<00:03:16.620> though<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:16.769> really<00:03:17.610> don't

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
like GT even though I really don't

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.170 
like GT even though I really don't
really<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.800> that<00:03:19.830> much<00:03:20.040> because<00:03:20.580> of

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
really like it that much because of

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.310 
really like it that much because of
Akira<00:03:21.720> Toriyama<00:03:22.019> not<00:03:22.380> creating<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.010> himself

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
Akira Toriyama not creating it himself

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.310 
Akira Toriyama not creating it himself
it<00:03:25.549> picks<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.700> as<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> big<00:03:27.180> what-if<00:03:27.480> because<00:03:28.140> it

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
it picks it as a big what-if because it

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.100 
it picks it as a big what-if because it
wasn't<00:03:28.620> really<00:03:28.769> created<00:03:29.160> by<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.310> original

back<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.270> TLC<00:04:31.750> um<00:04:32.669> so<00:04:33.669> what<00:04:33.850> does<00:04:33.970> this<00:04:34.090> mean<00:04:34.360> i

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
back to TLC um so what does this mean i

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.629 
back to TLC um so what does this mean i
think<00:04:34.810> that<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:35.620> will<00:04:35.710> be<00:04:35.860> more<00:04:36.160> what<00:04:36.460> its

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
think that it will be more what its

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.089 
think that it will be more what its
characters<00:04:37.210> like<00:04:37.449> super<00:04:37.900> saiyan<00:04:38.139> 3<00:04:38.260> vegeta

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
characters like super saiyan 3 vegeta

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.850 
characters like super saiyan 3 vegeta
super<00:04:39.550> saying<00:04:39.789> um<00:04:40.030> three<00:04:40.810> goat<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:41.530> stuff

super saying um three goat and stuff
like<00:04:41.979> that<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:44.370> think<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:45.520> they<00:04:45.610> should

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
like that I think that they should

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.810 
like that I think that they should
already<00:04:46.030> have<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.599> couple<00:04:47.229> of<00:04:47.410> what<00:04:48.220> it's<00:04:48.400> to

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
already have a couple of what it's to

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.850 
already have a couple of what it's to
start<00:04:49.180> with<00:04:49.360> what<00:04:49.599> the<00:04:49.690> VLC<00:04:49.960> opens<00:04:50.560> up<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:50.830> lot

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
start with what the VLC opens up a lot

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.969 
start with what the VLC opens up a lot
of<00:04:51.240> possibilities<00:04:52.240> like<00:04:52.750> probably<00:04:53.620> a<00:04:53.800> new

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
of possibilities like probably a new

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.250 
of possibilities like probably a new
fusion<00:04:54.669> probably<00:04:55.449> uh<00:04:56.310> trunks<00:04:57.720> soups<00:04:58.720> and<00:04:58.960> for

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
fusion probably uh trunks soups and for

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.469 
fusion probably uh trunks soups and for
stuff<00:05:00.099> like<00:05:00.160> that<00:05:00.280> and<00:05:00.639> um<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:02.590> know<00:05:03.479> they

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
stuff like that and um you know they

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.240

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:22.790 
take that she was very limited away so I

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.450 
take that she was very limited away so I
don't<00:07:22.910> know<00:07:23.000> how<00:07:23.030> far<00:07:23.419> they<00:07:23.630> could<00:07:23.840> go<00:07:24.050> uh<00:07:24.460> but
