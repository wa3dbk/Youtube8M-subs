underneath<00:00:56.489> because<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.440> it's<00:00:58.440> composting

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
underneath because it's it's composting

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.910 
underneath because it's it's composting
kind<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.609> itself<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.600> those<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:01.500> hard<00:01:01.739> time

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
kind of itself but those have hard time

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.719 
kind of itself but those have hard time
composting<00:01:02.609> themselves<00:01:04.039> what<00:01:05.039> I<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.519> do

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
composting themselves what I like to do

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.690 
composting themselves what I like to do
is<00:01:08.060> ground<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.740> put<00:01:11.399> it<00:01:11.520> into

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
is ground all this and then put it into

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.370 
is ground all this and then put it into
my<00:01:12.060> pot<00:01:12.860> in<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.340> soil<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.600> tried<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
my pot in on the soil I have tried to

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.320 
my pot in on the soil I have tried to
put<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:17.520> dig<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> hole<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.360> then<00:01:18.660> put<00:01:19.259> all<00:01:19.440> this

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
put to dig a hole and then put all this

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
put to dig a hole and then put all this
inside<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.840> hole<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.410> those<00:01:22.950> little

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
inside of that hole so those little

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.430 
inside of that hole so those little
animals<00:01:23.369> worms<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.509> eat<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.140> make<00:01:25.410> a

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
animals worms would eat it and make a

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.880 
animals worms would eat it and make a
compost<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.940> some<00:01:27.390> other<00:01:27.630> animals<00:01:28.259> came<00:01:28.619> at

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
compost but some other animals came at

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.210 
compost but some other animals came at
night<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.490> dug<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.789> out<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.020> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.560> use

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
night and dug it out so I'm going to use

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.990 
night and dug it out so I'm going to use
another<00:01:32.549> approach<00:01:34.070> here<00:01:35.070> I'm<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> open

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
another approach here I'm going to open

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.789 
another approach here I'm going to open
my<00:01:37.670> compost<00:01:38.670> jar<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.240> doesn't<00:01:40.140> smell<00:01:40.380> because

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
my compost jar it doesn't smell because

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.749 
my compost jar it doesn't smell because
I<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.280> filled<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:41.820> yesterday<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:43.759> but

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
I just filled this up yesterday and but

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.999 
I just filled this up yesterday and but
the<00:01:45.390> filter<00:01:45.720> also<00:01:45.899> helps<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.680> not<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the filter also helps for it not to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219 
the filter also helps for it not to
smell<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.880> you're<00:01:48.329> going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.689> keep<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:49.170> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
smell if you're going to keep this for a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.550 
smell if you're going to keep this for a
couple<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.530> days<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.869> usually<00:01:52.079> smells

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
couple of days and it usually smells

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.410 
couple of days and it usually smells

when you have liquid inside I don't have
any<00:01:54.600> liquid<00:01:54.840> inside<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.649> only<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.509> dry<00:01:57.920> Kiwi

fast so this is my blender the Magic
Bullet<00:02:10.739> I'm<00:02:11.579> going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.030> put<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.360> inside<00:02:12.780> I

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
Bullet I'm going to put this inside I

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.759 
Bullet I'm going to put this inside I
know<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.239> takes<00:02:15.450> time<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:15.750> I'm<00:02:15.989> here<00:02:16.200> helping

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
my environment I'm helping my plants and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.979 
my environment I'm helping my plants and
then<00:02:20.310> I'm<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.760> add<00:02:21.030> water<00:02:23.900> very<00:02:24.900> little

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
then I'm going to add water very little

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.650 
then I'm going to add water very little
halfway<00:02:26.359> so<00:02:27.359> my<00:02:28.100> blender<00:02:29.100> would<00:02:29.250> work<00:02:29.660> covered

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
halfway so my blender would work covered

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.780 
halfway so my blender would work covered
up

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
up

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.400 
up
and<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:34.810> I'm<00:02:34.930> going<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.319> blend<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:37.380> okay<00:02:38.380> I

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
and then I'm going to blend it okay I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.620 
and then I'm going to blend it okay I
blended<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.890> organic<00:02:39.459> material<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.240> fruits

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
blended the organic material the fruits
