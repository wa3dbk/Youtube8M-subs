 Hello from the g7 actress and sportive staff 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.909
 dot com 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:49.440
 the matter now that protein isolated from 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.769
 whey 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.619
 this protein is the best protein 15 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:59.309
 simply because they were 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:02.519
 Lactose Lactose is a carbohydrate milk 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.580
 this fact prevents the absorption of our 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.580
 body to make the choice in case of total 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.069
 of the protein by our body then 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.310
 Are you thinking about the best protein? 

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:16.799
 looking for an isolated protein 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.649
 usually they come with a good 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.030
 up to vitamins and minerals 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.190
 study the nutritional chart of the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.530
 product you are choosing if you have 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.799
 vitamins but what is important is 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.459
 know that here you have total absorption 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:37.459
 usually in 30 grams of the powder present 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:40.049
 27 28 29 grams of protein goes from level 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.960
 of your protein from the product you 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.969
 chose but do not forget when I say 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.270
 of lactose carbohydrate 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:52.679
 this is the carbohydrate milk is fundamental 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.990
 but that is after the workout has to have 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.259
 an addition of simple carbohydrates in the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.009
 case to destroy a good ordered games 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.679
 together is destroyed 11 and iso protein 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.869
 whey protein isolate 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.799
 trained will always have his life before 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.750
 and the protein will have the function of 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.590
 reconstruction and maintenance of fiber 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.630
 muscular 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.799
 I'm sure you'll choose one 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.799
 great protein
