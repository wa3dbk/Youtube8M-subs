00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
because the cars that were added except

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.869 
because the cars that were added except
for<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> dub<00:02:06.630> stuff<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.500> are<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.890> pretty

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
for the dub stuff they are all pretty

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.089 
for the dub stuff they are all pretty
generic<00:02:09.300> cars<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.379> they're<00:02:10.500> not<00:02:10.619> super

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
generic cars you know they're not super

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.110 
generic cars you know they're not super
high-end<00:02:11.580> cars<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.270> you

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
high-end cars so you

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.670 
high-end cars so you
think<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.599> some<00:02:13.930> civilians<00:02:14.379> would<00:02:14.530> be

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
think that some civilians would be

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.990 
think that some civilians would be
driving<00:02:14.860> them<00:02:15.069> around<00:02:15.159> every<00:02:15.640> now<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:15.940> then

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
driving them around every now and then

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.229 
driving them around every now and then
they<00:02:16.180> may<00:02:16.269> be<00:02:16.330> some<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:16.989> rarer<00:02:17.319> cars<00:02:17.739> but

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
they may be some of the rarer cars but

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.570 
they may be some of the rarer cars but
still<00:02:19.239> if<00:02:19.599> that's<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.349> possibility<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.250> you

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
still if that's a possibility and you

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.460 
still if that's a possibility and you
don't<00:02:21.730> have<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:21.879> lot<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.030> money<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.480> may<00:02:22.720> want

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
don't have a lot of money you may want

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.830 
don't have a lot of money you may want
to<00:02:23.560> just<00:02:23.860> see<00:02:24.159> if<00:02:24.370> if<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.700> will<00:02:25.180> work<00:02:25.390> but
