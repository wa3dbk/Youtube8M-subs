00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.510
 hello everyone welcome to neil inÃ©s yes 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.230
 you want to know how to do this manicure 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:19.279
 with chains keep looking you will need 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.700
 a base enamel some chains 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.860
 cut cables or scissors enamel 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.790
 Thick transparent or glue for 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.200
 top coat nails and preferably some 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.000
 tweezers 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.090
 we begin by applying our color of 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.980
 base I have chosen pink but we can 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.700
 choose others that combine with 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.800
 chains like for example black for 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.650
 do this tutorial you will need some 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.590
 chains mine are from bourne ricky 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.040
 store seemed cheap to me and they are very 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.040
 long 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.989
 you can really use others that you have 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.420
 for home like for example a necklace 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.740
 old but it's a shame to spoil the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.170
 having other options 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.780
 what is very important is that the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.880
 chains have the flat links for 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.820
 that can adjust well to the nail and not 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.790
 snagging at least if you are looking for something 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.970
 durability in the manicure these are 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.400
 adjust very well and also do not destine 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.190
 apply top coat or lose color with 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.870
 the days when they are well dry 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.510
 nails so there are no traces of 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.400
 manipulation is convenient that we measure 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.730
 the amount of chain we need 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.890
 cut I have done this filigree and for 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.470
 measure it I will calculate the piece that 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.640
 I need between one nail and another but in 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.920
 you make another design 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.650
 you should calculate it equally 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.020
 to cut the necessary piece though 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.030
 they are cut very easily it is better 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.140
 use a wire cutter to not 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.540
 ruin the edge of our scissors 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.640
 then we apply the thick enamel 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.320
 Transparent or nail glue 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.080
 where we want it to be placed 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.530
 chain making sure to impregnate well 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.080
 the edges so that later it does not take off 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.009
 do not worry if there are gobs 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.009
 here if it is better 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.500
 before it dries we put the 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.980
 chain over is much easier 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.810
 help yourself with a pair of tweezers to do it 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.480
 to ensure that the chain is 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.450
 well flat and adjusted to the nail and that the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.329
 edges are either well glued or the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.129
 chain will snag and fall if 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.370
 you want to make turns like in the girl's 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:38.060
 ring finger do it in two non-mountainous steps 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.060
 the chains 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.860
 finally we take top coat to seal 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.860
 the design and uniform the gobs 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.150
 and our manicure with chains is 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.050
