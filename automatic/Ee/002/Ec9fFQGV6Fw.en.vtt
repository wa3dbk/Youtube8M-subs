00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:10.250
 hello i have a small reception for 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.840
 where is the menu here again 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.760
 you can find the ingredients here 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.470
 preparation and here the tasting and 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:21.050
 Although I had a keeper one day 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.090
 on marzipan potatoes and almost 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.890
 crazy because I have none here 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.170
 marzipanrohmasse found and therefore 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.520
 I thought Carry all but himself 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.260
 and I show you today like the whole 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.090
 So does it really 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.500
 Just when I thought it was 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.710
 tastes or not he had again 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.540
 end of my education yes poor i have too 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.700
 200 grams exactly 34 pieces 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.550
 rausgekriegt and the whole has apiece 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.470
 around the 33 calories and it's a very 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.210
 cheap gift and that is what I have 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.370
 The then packed in such a way in the end 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.630
 small mini casserole I do not know 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.000
 where you can get them maybe you can 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.620
 load in a euro or so then I have 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.010
 the marzipan potatoes purely just here 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.260
 filled a small sign made it 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.090
 what then looks like this is me 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.519
 would say go directly to the to 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.740
 retribution 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.930
 you even need cacau further 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.360
 break with powdered sugar rose water to 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.180
 guesses all words have half a pack 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.670
 vanilla sugar once mandl flavors once 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.500
 act so it's easy then 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.890
 Let's get the almonds before five 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.820
 soaking in warm water for several minutes 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.970
 So we peel it off a bit 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.010
 Who can solve it more easily? 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.290
 now or jokes lazy is to do that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.909
 because I had none of that too 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.310
 just those californian ones 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.100
 blanched deficiency take so and then 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.170
 i just have all the almonds and 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.720
 today that has me around the 20 minutes 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.130
 time cost but now what you do not 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.500
 everything does but I have one here 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.329
 electric coffee mill because my part 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.740
 I did not believe it broke 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.509
 i have not had it that long and 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.390
 he is hurting again 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.520
 Well, then I give the almonds 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.750
 and the whole of pure and will then 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.479
 then you finely grind a bit 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.460
 It will not contain fat like mine 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.050
 but it will be a pampe anyway 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.460
 and therefore 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.780
 kamp is good so it will be a bit 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.250
 tschuldigung fixed and therefore is the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.880
 unfortunately, the whole was enough afterwards 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.010
 knead together 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.910
 then we take our icing sugar once 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.590
 add a little vanilla sugar 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.300
 So half the pack ever over 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.870
 the almonds and then knelt the same 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.060
 a little bit so i have one here 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.220
 few drops from the lack of that 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.100
 change of flavor so not so much 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.210
 and then a bit bit by bit 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.340
 rose water with added 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.860
 you just have to feel the whole thing 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.600
 so i have about five to 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.460
 ten milliliters of rosewater with 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.560
 entered and it gives it all 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.180
 so that something certain and then work 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.280
 the whole thing until one of them 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.090
 powdered sugar is fully incorporated 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.980
 you have such a bullet there so the whole 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.600
 then tear off a few pieces and 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.880
 Form this into a ball and roll that 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.380
 Whole corner buy if you still the whole 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.910
 would like to do with cinnamon or something like that then 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.620
 you can just cinnamon there a bit 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.540
 grow with pure and then you have 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.670
 after this ball and that's it 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.680
 so it is not fast so I was 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.300
 really excited how fast 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.070
 that then actually went in the end 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.660
 and or you can all do bullets 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.860
 make equality and then just in 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.989
 put the cocoa so a bit 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.780
 that's what it all looked like in the end 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.500
 So not perfect but I find it 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.550
 are already very handsome and me 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.200
 I would be happy again 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.750
 of course after power and once with 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.000
 hashtag cost here we have 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.890
 yet again, tasting so I liked it 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.239
 is a little bit weird because we are 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.610
 that you are used to and that you have 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.380
 tasted so good and I know 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.880

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.350
 cupcake video and once the 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.640
 cinnamon rolls and if you like 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.090
