00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.910 
first off let's talk a little bit about
team<00:00:17.760> liquid<00:00:17.970> where<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.350> think<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.800> you

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
team liquid where do you think that you

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.670 
team liquid where do you think that you
guys<00:00:19.949> are<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.660> rankings<00:00:22.050> right<00:00:22.230> now<00:00:22.350> like

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
guys are in the rankings right now like

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.859 
guys are in the rankings right now like
not<00:00:23.460> looking<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.880> actual<00:00:24.180> win-loss<00:00:24.660> thing

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
not looking at the actual win-loss thing

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.000 
not looking at the actual win-loss thing
but<00:00:25.050> where<00:00:25.199> do<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.380> think<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.590> stand<00:00:25.769> against

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
but where do you think you stand against

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.099 
but where do you think you stand against
the<00:00:26.130> other<00:00:26.250> teams<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.730> think<00:00:27.449> instant<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.869> terms

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the other teams I think instant in terms

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.109 
the other teams I think instant in terms
of<00:00:28.260> strength<00:00:28.619> right<00:00:28.769> now<00:00:28.830> I'd<00:00:29.250> say<00:00:29.279> we're<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
of strength right now I'd say we're a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.229 
of strength right now I'd say we're a
top<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:31.080> top<00:00:31.560> three<00:00:31.800> team<00:00:31.949> I'm<00:00:32.850> not<00:00:33.000> sure<00:00:33.120> how<00:00:33.210> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
top to top three team I'm not sure how a

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.729 
top to top three team I'm not sure how a
strong<00:00:33.600> grab<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.050> because<00:00:34.380> they're<00:00:34.530> doing

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
strong grab it is because they're doing

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.990 
strong grab it is because they're doing
well<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.100> during<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.340> season<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:35.700> i'm<00:00:35.880> not

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
well in during the season but i'm not

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.430 
well in during the season but i'm not
sure<00:00:36.059> if<00:00:36.239> they're<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:37.140> battling

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
sure if they're going to do battling

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.130 
sure if they're going to do battling
playoffs<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.489> places<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.480> behind<00:00:39.719> TSM

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
playoffs so out places just behind TSM

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.520 
playoffs so out places just behind TSM
so<00:00:40.410> top<00:00:41.010> two<00:00:41.329> one<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> things<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.899> i<00:00:43.350> was

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
so top two one of the things that i was

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.779 
so top two one of the things that i was
talking<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.890> some<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> players<00:00:44.550> about

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
talking to some of the players about

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.160 
talking to some of the players about
last<00:00:45.000> week<00:00:45.149> especially<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.660> guess<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.020> was

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
last week especially I guess that was

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.010 
last week especially I guess that was
that<00:00:47.000> you<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> hinted<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> little

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
that you kind of hinted this a little

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.299 
that you kind of hinted this a little
bit<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.530> playoffs<00:00:49.829> thing<00:00:50.010> where<00:00:50.190> it's

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
bit with the playoffs thing where it's

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.350 
bit with the playoffs thing where it's
like<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.700> very<00:00:50.910> different<00:00:51.090> thing<00:00:51.329> when

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
like it's very different thing when

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
like it's very different thing when
you're<00:00:51.539> doing<00:00:51.780> best<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.110> fives<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.649> you're

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
you're doing best of fives and you're

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.459 
you're doing best of fives and you're
doing<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:53.910> than<00:00:53.969> one<00:00:54.210> game<00:00:54.420> what<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:55.379> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
doing more than one game what do you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.119 
doing more than one game what do you
think<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:57.390> idea<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.140> maybe<00:00:58.500> changing<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
think of the idea of maybe changing the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.160 
think of the idea of maybe changing the
format<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.489> LCS<00:00:59.940> from<00:01:00.149> bestel<00:01:00.660> ones<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.020> either

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
format of LCS from bestel ones to either

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.770 
format of LCS from bestel ones to either
like<00:01:01.440> best<00:01:01.649> tues<00:01:01.859> or<00:01:02.010> best<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> threes<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.780> shirt

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
like best tues or best of threes a shirt

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
like best tues or best of threes a shirt
like<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.170> lot<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:04.860> best<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> sbisa

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
like that a lot I think best of to sbisa

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240 
like that a lot I think best of to sbisa
threes<00:01:06.060> would<00:01:06.299> add<00:01:06.450> more<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> match<00:01:07.590> because

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
threes would add more to a match because

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.190 
threes would add more to a match because
fans<00:01:08.790> would<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.360> more<00:01:09.510> exciting<00:01:09.900> working

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
fans would have more exciting working

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
fans would have more exciting working
towards<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.619> would<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.700> battle

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
towards and it would be more of a battle

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.300 
towards and it would be more of a battle
and<00:01:12.119> Sarah<00:01:12.299> feels<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.689> Oh<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> 25-minute

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and Sarah feels like Oh is a 25-minute

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.270 
and Sarah feels like Oh is a 25-minute
game<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.280> for

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
game and that's it like so I think for

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.609 
game and that's it like so I think for
me<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> would<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> bastard<00:01:19.110> 2

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
me I would really like a bastard 2

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.080 
me I would really like a bastard 2
bachelor<00:01:19.799> format<00:01:20.400> probably<00:01:20.700> best<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.850> three

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
bachelor format probably best to three

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.870 
bachelor format probably best to three
so<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> clear<00:01:22.080> winner<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.880> I'm

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
so you can have a clear winner and I'm

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.710 
so you can have a clear winner and I'm
not<00:01:23.939> sure<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.240> we're<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
not sure if we're going to see that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.569 
not sure if we're going to see that
though<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.110> Isis<00:01:26.119> what<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.270> think<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:28.579> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
though and Isis what do you think of the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.740 
though and Isis what do you think of the
fact<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.000> would<00:01:30.150> add<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.479> lot<00:01:30.630> more

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
fact that that would add like a lot more

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.330

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
keep a healthy lifestyle because I would

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.270 
keep a healthy lifestyle because I would
imagine<00:03:06.720> you're<00:03:07.050> one<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.230> them<00:03:07.290> are<00:03:07.440> healthy

personally<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:12.090> can't<00:03:12.690> really<00:03:12.930> play<00:03:13.320> for<00:03:13.709> long

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
personally I can't really play for long

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.350 
personally I can't really play for long
periods<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.550> times<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.030> just<00:03:15.060> get<00:03:15.330> really

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
periods of times I just get really

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.390 
periods of times I just get really
fatigued<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.050> my<00:03:16.260> play<00:03:16.500> decreases<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> lot<00:03:17.220> so

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
fatigued and my play decreases a lot so

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.210 
fatigued and my play decreases a lot so
I<00:03:17.640> naturally<00:03:17.760> use<00:03:18.300> take<00:03:18.450> breaks<00:03:18.720> during<00:03:19.220> 3-4

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
I naturally use take breaks during 3-4

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.310 
I naturally use take breaks during 3-4
hours<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.670> for<00:03:21.239> example<00:03:21.600> in<00:03:21.780> scrims<00:03:22.050> and

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
hours and for example in scrims and

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.350 
hours and for example in scrims and
scrim<00:03:22.650> stays<00:03:22.860> after<00:03:23.489> screams<00:03:23.940> let's<00:03:24.120> go<00:03:24.239> back

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
scrim stays after screams let's go back

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.540 
scrim stays after screams let's go back
home<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.810> take<00:03:25.019> like<00:03:25.200> two<00:03:25.350> hours<00:03:25.380> off<00:03:25.739> when<00:03:26.220> I

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
home and take like two hours off when I

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.070 
home and take like two hours off when I
go<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.940> gym<00:03:27.060> during<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.630> do<00:03:27.989> other

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
go to the gym during that and do other

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.810 
go to the gym during that and do other
things<00:03:28.200> used<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.739> relax<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.220> then<00:03:29.400> go<00:03:29.640> at<00:03:29.790> it

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
things used to relax and then go at it

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.970 
things used to relax and then go at it
again<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.900> try<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.110> find<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.709> balance

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
again so you try to find a balance

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.009 
again so you try to find a balance
because<00:03:32.550> I<00:03:32.580> don't<00:03:32.820> think<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.269> feel<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:33.870> me

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
because I don't think I feel is for me

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.320 
because I don't think I feel is for me
if<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.290> spam<00:03:34.560> too<00:03:34.739> many<00:03:34.920> games<00:03:35.070> then<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.790> won't

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
if I spam too many games then I won't

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.360 
if I spam too many games then I won't
really<00:03:36.480> get<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.780> most<00:03:37.290> out<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.920> also<00:03:38.190> I

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
really get the most out of it and also I

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.750 
really get the most out of it and also I
would<00:03:38.700> just<00:03:38.970> get<00:03:39.570> too<00:03:39.750> fatigued<00:03:40.080> out<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.760> do

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
would just get too fatigued out of it do

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.690 
would just get too fatigued out of it do
you<00:03:41.820> ever<00:03:41.970> think<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:43.190> do<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.310> ever<00:03:44.430> worry
