00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.740
 and that for kids here is good this 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.139
 night a new video and good this compis 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.270
 in vis of the two sins against two 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.189
 goals with a vis a vis quite 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.840
 fun especially because they will go the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.610
 goals together and the freckles together is going to be 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.380
 a combination of one side will go a lot 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.869
 power much spit and on the other and very 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.300
 little damage and on the other hand see - shield and 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.800
 much more damage way accompanied by 9 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.210
 Senators in total 2 of the castle 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.160
 great level 4 that will accompany the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.610
 freckles since they are softer and then the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.370
 that against as if they were a 10 in 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.520
 instead of 9 and I'm going to drop 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 everything I have more or less calculator not 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.940
 I want to stay more then we break them 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.489
 those who are to help and the goblins 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.890
 which are to finish filling in later 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.239
 it took all rays and 22 rage if two 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.980
 cures that are going to be to help them 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.420
 to them and it's simply this so 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 well let's find a village to attack 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.300
 what is not going to be a very difficult one 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.789
 since good these troops are not going to do 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.410
 nothing the only thing I want is for you to play 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.110
 I think that attacked this is almost still what 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.240
 I mean or that dark comes to me from pearls 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.810
 if you keep out today it seems to me that 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.460
 I do what I do, then, say the kings 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.500
 they're going to be a bit decorative so 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.500
 well above all I like this one because 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.350
 have the journals out and I can 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.760
 inflation is almost impossible to perform 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.760
 ok let's go let's see 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.200
 and I do not know why he's going to release everything 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.880
 I've heard it more painful 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.170
 it's faster this 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.030
 ok let's see what happens 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.930
 especially since it is not worth 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.930
 check here the goals 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.799
 ok 2 goals 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.670
 123 load the antiaircraft before 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.700
 that you can be worth and now they 're going 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.340
 and this accompanied by this plus the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.020
 Clan castle and a wall breaks 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.310
 I'm going to let them go there to help like this 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.020
 good ok let's see what happens I'll 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.369
 lower the volume a little ok perfect the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.610
 healing my god method of the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.610
 senators 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.130
 that I take only then I'm going 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.940
 the rage and perfect is everything instead 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.560
 they are perfect and nothing has happened to 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.240
 the freckles but also the notebooks and 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.280
 what the fuck has happened and when you're fucking 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.630
 it has happened that we have been killed is worth the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.070
 cure result is released all 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.170
 the successes to the goals are for what 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.760
 yesterday I can not throw anything else and I do not know 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.980
 what noses has happened to them that I have 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.550
 stayed as they are going or if pe 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.410
 there is only one for you see it 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.260
 what the fuck has happened that I did not know 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.580
 if we can to know we're going to let go 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.010
 this side the queen to go 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.600
 helping them and here the golem that 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.710
 suddenly I'm very afraid of the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.030
 anti- aircraft issue because I got the 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.390
 they are going to fry as they have believed 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.070
 second then I do not know I think I do not know no 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.450
 I know what to do very well I have to go this 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.830
 it will be clear that the pk have won 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.510
 the pk because they have died has died his with 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.370
 your partner from the beginning should 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.030
 have kept the 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.950
 the healing of having saved 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.390
 in the queen to load my antiaircraft 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.140
 but good as I train they should help 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.430
 much 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.480
 I would like the pk to be more 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.459
 intelligent and out what is to them 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.860
 saving instead of what for the 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.140
 sculptor who is nothing bad 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.480
 It's good, well, that's why you do not want to 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.950
 he has passed the pk is still alive but nothing 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.450
 it will be very little because if nothing 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.940
 happens happens to go to save their 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.130
 partners who help saving and a little 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.170
 I miss you do not want but good the pk 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.760
 you're still going to die in nothing since 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.290
 the senators have already died that there 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.209
 is this goal in which it is not going to 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.010
 divide into nothing and now that the same 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.760
 the goal had survived longer 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.760
 I 'm telling you 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.170
 good mg of what we have, that is, in 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.260
 Survival theme has endured more 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.790
 in the golem 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.650
 neither should we give much merit that I 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.030
 It would be loaded freckles or the pk that is 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.980
 the only one that has gone simply because 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.239
 it has carefully worked more in my opinion I 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.730
 got almost everything dark two 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.980
 very nice stars we're going to let go 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.989
 around here this and well the pixies 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.970
 to do what they want where 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.540
 you want me to notice that it's pretty cool 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.700
 I liked especially the area here 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.229
 the first thing I lost a pk that 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.639
 now let's see in the repetition what 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.840
 noses off because we're going I'd like 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.760
 know what happened to my dear pk 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.490
 skills that time runs out we go 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.780
 to see ok I will not be able to do either 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.790
 more I do not know why I'm leaving it 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.440
 I die in kings but I think that 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.150
 good that we have done a damage graze 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.180
 I know there has been a very small area that 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.010
 we can have broken pretty good for 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.240
 nothing reward me what to spend in the 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.620
 troops but well this is an attack for 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.150
 help you thank you for certain 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.130
 a kid isa more pilot that is the 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.289
 golden theme the two winners and here 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.820
 We have 7 healers that the truth is that 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.440
 they have all died with the colors and that 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.880
 is what may have influenced a lot in 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.949
 the result and then a golem go 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.270
 to see what happened to her is how I think 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.919
 that attack powerful state has been fine 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.930
 we have gained quite dark that milk is 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.760
 very very well in my opinion and now we're going 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.280
 to see what has actually happened so 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.720
 how good are we going to go here I think 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.539
 I have to leave the game to load it 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.010
 to this with second and we do not see each other today 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.660
 what are you doing then we're here and good 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.180
 let's see what happened record of 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.580
 attack does not come to me in time 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.320
 and we have come back and we will see what has 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.910
 I am very interested in two points and 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.620
 let's stop the video for a moment 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.270
 interesting what happened to the healers 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.020
 how he died so fast because I do not think 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.520
 that is so fast the stec ic the bomb and 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.620
 what's up with my first pk because we're going 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.240
 it's very interesting between me I think that 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.919
 repeat a couple of times we see this 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.729
 there it is worth we break those that are going to do 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:38.129
 very good work and healing ok 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.680
 is that I must have turned out to be very poor 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.210
 is that I'm a fool I've divided them badly 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.189
 has ended up releasing many more to the 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.229
 freckles and now also another that I see is 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.639
 that avale goes from semi to divert a sin 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.889
 of healing because the poor have 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.539
 as we speak so easily and ceded by 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.770
 your bitch counts and has finished as finished 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.839
 in what you have there you see the 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.210
 intelligence belén esteban and obviously 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:59.099
 the steve hoskins someone we're going 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.509
 check it off, steve hoskins and pk 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.099
 Bethlehem were the apec to Bethlehem Esteban 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.169
 here we can all double gender and the 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.240
 heals the fury that I had level 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.889
 to let go and that's how we see the glue 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.080
 that there could be could be a 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.029
 bestiality what would be how would 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.969
 the thing ends if the two frets had 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:17.219
 he had kept together charged the 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.139
 earlier and much faster 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:20.580
 a lot of reagents, especially how 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.229
 finished the thing here because here highlights 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.089
 the rage I think that either very well 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.680
 but come on I think it's been an attack 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:27.120
 very beast let's put it on camera 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.029
 quick so we can see more or less how 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.349
 has been the destruction area already in 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:32.639
 full screen without focusing on 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.110
 none and I think it's been pretty 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.610
 well in attack the truth could have me 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.069
 centered a little bit more I believe in the 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.629
 theme of protecting freckles and wings 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.480
 young people especially who trust me 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:44.130
 also in his life 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.960
 well I think it's pretty good 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.449
 let's see how it ends there is nothing left 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.430
 30 seconds 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.870
 and well I would like to know if the 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.629
 comments what kind of videos that 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:57.949
 Any being whatever happens on 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:07:00.770
 everything for a mushroom epileptic in a 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.999
 barbarian king epileptic for robbery that 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.229
 they deserve the comments that appeared 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:05.089
 the video if you want some vis-à-vis 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:06.320
 gotzon style I want it was the one that 

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:08.540
 I went up 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:14.360
 also uploads viruses for example but 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:17.800
 well this is a lot and see you in 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.800
 the next video to another
