00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
any specific shape so it's just kind of

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.880 
any specific shape so it's just kind of

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.550 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:28.090> head<00:01:28.240> over<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.540> photoshop<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:29.229> create<00:01:29.470> an

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
to head over to photoshop and create an

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.499 
to head over to photoshop and create an
image<00:01:29.770> mask<00:01:30.159> to<00:01:30.399> apply<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.790> this<00:01:31.030> layer<00:01:31.299> of

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
image mask to apply to this layer of

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.330 
image mask to apply to this layer of
video<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.409> takes<00:01:32.590> on<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.799> specific

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340
