00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
diagonal all the way to the ground like

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.140 
diagonal all the way to the ground like
that<00:01:15.020> then<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.470> left<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.340> bottom<00:01:17.880> lock

that then go left of this bottom lock

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.050 
that then go left of this bottom lock
this<00:01:18.540> block<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.869> hit<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> floor<00:01:19.680> by<00:01:20.220> free<00:01:20.700> so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
this block that hit the floor by free so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.520 
this block that hit the floor by free so
that's<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.689> two<00:01:22.200> three<00:01:22.970> then<00:01:23.970> go<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.360> by<00:01:24.869> seven

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that's one two three then go up by seven

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.789 
that's one two three then go up by seven
so<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.070> one<00:01:26.460> two<00:01:26.909> three<00:01:27.450> four<00:01:27.900> five<00:01:28.350> six

exactly like this once you've reached
this<00:01:56.189> point<00:01:56.430> right<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.930> you

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
this point right here this is what you

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.440 
this point right here this is what you
want<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.770> next<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.219> take<00:01:59.700> out<00:01:59.880> your<00:01:59.909> cyan

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
want to do next so take out your cyan

want to do next so take out your cyan
and<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.250> your<00:02:02.460> cyan<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.180> is

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and do this with your cyan this is

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.179 
and do this with your cyan this is
actually<00:02:03.780> kind<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.140> difficult<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> explain

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
actually kind of difficult to explain

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.580 
actually kind of difficult to explain
but<00:02:05.490> it'll<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.880> really<00:02:06.210> easy<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.659> see<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:07.439> you

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
but it'll be really easy to see what you

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.699 
but it'll be really easy to see what you
have<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.979> do<00:02:08.129> with<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> cyan<00:02:08.879> once<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.259> actually

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
have to do with the cyan once I actually

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.730 
have to do with the cyan once I actually
do<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.090> whether<00:02:12.569> your<00:02:12.780> cyan<00:02:13.170> you

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
do it for you so whether your cyan you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.800 
do it for you so whether your cyan you
want<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.160> do<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.150> should<00:02:15.180> be<00:02:15.420> really<00:02:15.780> easy

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
want to do this it should be really easy

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.600 
want to do this it should be really easy
to<00:02:16.170> see<00:02:16.350> what<00:02:16.500> I've<00:02:16.590> done<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.950> as<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.400> all

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
to see what I've done that as it's all

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.570 
to see what I've done that as it's all
the<00:02:18.150> way<00:02:18.330> next<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.320> blank<00:02:19.620> wall<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.430> we

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
the way next to the blank wall that we

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.570 
the way next to the blank wall that we
placed<00:02:20.910> previously<00:02:22.190> once<00:02:23.190> you've<00:02:23.370> done<00:02:23.520> that

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
placed previously once you've done that

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.210 
placed previously once you've done that
with<00:02:24.000> your<00:02:24.210> cyan<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:25.170> then<00:02:25.380> want<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.680> take<00:02:25.980> out

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
with your cyan you then want to take out

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.400 
with your cyan you then want to take out
your<00:02:26.400> white<00:02:26.670> wall<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.180> do<00:02:27.390> three<00:02:27.870> blocks<00:02:28.200> of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
your white wall and do three blocks of

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.980 
your white wall and do three blocks of
white<00:02:28.740> wall<00:02:29.070> in<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.790> position<00:02:30.360> right<00:02:30.930> there

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
white wall in that position right there

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.530 
white wall in that position right there
in<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.590> little<00:02:31.890> alcove<00:02:32.490> where<00:02:32.730> we<00:02:32.910> had<00:02:33.120> cyan

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
in that little alcove where we had cyan

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.800 
in that little alcove where we had cyan
previously<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.380> then<00:02:34.770> two<00:02:35.130> on<00:02:35.340> top<00:02:35.670> then<00:02:36.480> once

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
previously and then two on top then once

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.420 
previously and then two on top then once
you've<00:02:36.990> added<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.470> white<00:02:37.710> wall<00:02:37.980> all<00:02:38.220> you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
you've added that white wall all you

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.370 
you've added that white wall all you
have<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.790> do<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.330> completely<00:02:39.810> fill<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380
