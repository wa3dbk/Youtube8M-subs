00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.960
 do it because it 's so easy the only thing 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.509
 you have to do is at the beginning 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.830
 undo the principle well so that 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.800
 then the end comes out then 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.240
 perfectly in agreement and well then 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.590
 basically what is explained what 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.920
 you have to do is come just 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.009
 here to the roller coaster once you have 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.250
 suicide of the Ferris wheel according 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.540
 previously committed suicide 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.420
 what needs to be done now is 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.610
 just ride here on the mountain 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.330
 Russian to know if it has gone well 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.880
 we ride as if nothing is worth it and what 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.050
 what will happen now will be a kind of 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.000
 ship or in agreement we will get the 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.710
 camera is like this and now what we will do 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.720
 will be to give the select to put it in 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.310
 first person agree now what 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.170
 will have to do is wait for more or 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.790
 minus a few minutes two or three 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.950
 minutes at most according to what we 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.690
 turn around in full agreement and once 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.090
 he has turned us around 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.009
 will lower the character then from the mountain 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.009
 Russian not from the wheel but from the mountain 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.259
 Russian you will see and what we will see 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.459
 we will be the player like that in 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.070
 first person as you are seeing 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.140
 right now will happen to us this kind of 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.660
 strange ship because supposedly this 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.850
 camera is for first person but for 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.530
 first person of the wheel and what 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.380
 It is a kind of egg that is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.230
 we are left forever and well, we already have 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.520
 our first person character to 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.780
 it does not always mean that you have it 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.610
 always this is when you turn off the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.709
 you leave the game you are 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.120
 goes or just starts is a 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.520
 activity as it has happened to me in the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.680
 unintentionally video agree 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.260
 and well nothing now I will run this 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.930
 so you can see the first person and 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.310
 nothing to like if you liked 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.730
