00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 the first loves of the series are not 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.220
 scordano never returns home war 86 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.200
 sonic speed 3 compact from white to green 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.330
 really colorless very interesting 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.340
 clearly not the z3 videorecensione 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.440
 compact that you have learned by now 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.210
 absolutely to know but let's go to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:27.090
 see what's new on android 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:30.330
 lollipop 5.1.1 yes yes dear boys 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.030
 welcome back in the company 76 rusair sony 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.300
 ring to z3 compact for android 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:42.000
 lollipop 5.1.1 if you also have a 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.070
 sony xperia z3 or z3 compact clearly 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.020
 the guide can be found on those and telephone 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.329
 puntoit made by andrea nicosia called 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.520
 also the air for the friends he has 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.649
 made the guide how to install it without 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.920
 wait lot update is clearly a 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.539
 flash of a very original rom then 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.370
 no problem whatsoever the only problem 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.320
 save yourself photos and anything else because 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.170
 obviously clean like installation 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.380
 if we had just bought ours 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.970
 sony xperia z3 compact I don't think it is 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.890
 still exit for z3 if I'm wrong 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.100
 however find the link in description 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.210
 so you can go too ad 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.530
 install it quietly then 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.920
 let's go immediately to unlock ours 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.830
 device then we open the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.350
 our loose companion looks a lot 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.770
 slippery on the bench however clearly 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 is a is not a problem of android but 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.650
 in short, it is the back cover then first 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.799
 renewal on the graphic aspect 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.090
 of the setting meanwhile we go to 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.799
 cancel this notification not that 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.439
 let's go up slightly 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.729
 brightness so you see quite better 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.250
 in automatic video brightness 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.049
 clearly in my phone then 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.140
 in short, some with china has changed 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.030
 excellent especially the detachment between a menu 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.979
 and the other is not lost inside 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.869
 this menu and this is not a plus or not 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.729
 recently inside a phone 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.060
 because it's true I feel good with this 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.049
 sony home settings menu 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.509
 camera optimization in 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.069
 automatic mode now photos 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.289
 according to me still 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.329
 united first and clearly 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.370
 integration of google news 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.099
 stock then if we go to pull down 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.769
 the year the notification curtain look if 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.930
 we enter the wifi menu or better if 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.700
 we go to crush under where there are 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.920
 the various wifi networks you see there 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.359
 the preview or better the effect a 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.519
 circle 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.099
 you have seen bluetooth and ditto if 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.590
 we crush below we have this 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.359
 circle effect in my opinion very beautiful 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.819
 graphically here are some gems a 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:41.219
 graphic level we return to the menu 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.169
 settings because in the keyboard 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.000
 something has changed and we go to the language 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:47.010
 and on a mission 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.049
 if we are going to personalize ours 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.980
 keyboard then we go to the keyboard 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:55.709
 current or a small keyboard xperia 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.930
 here we are then we can even 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.219
 now finally for those who had it 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.199
 requested to integrate the function of 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.810
 so we basically have the numbers 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.980
 numbers in first function how to do it 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.989
 then we enter the menu of 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.949
 settings let's go to interface 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.190
 selection keyboard ah no sorry 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:17.540
 select here 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.590
 symbols we see a little inward 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.140
 symbols numeric keys if we go to 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.870
 activate see how inside for 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.390
 example of a browser 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.090
 see now we have the numbers in first 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.040
 very convenient but uncomfortable function on a 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.750
 compact because you see how the keyboard 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.200
 it stands up considerably and therefore 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.660
 we have missing screen portion e 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.239
 so I preferred to disable it 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.709
 however you see slightly then you 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.660
 if we make a pinch we enter into 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.670
 home setting what has changed 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.530
 we have the automatic rotation of the whole 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.780
 the homescreen as well as the size 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.660
 icon that when grown can pass to those who have 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.670
 as small as there was on the jelly bean now 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.860
 see how the icons have become more 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.450
 small while kat lollipop kit is 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.519
 clearly bigger icons and this one goes 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.400
 to your taste the home 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.799
 here it is, you can also use it in 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.920
 landscape mode and look also 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:16.130
 the effect that takes a while 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.650
 here here is here here is here turns 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.989
 really optimally 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.780
 congratulations for this thing to sony if 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.220
 we click on our notifications on 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.419
 the audio you see that there is a menu of 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.320
 settings menu settings 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.030
 is opened and we can choose which one 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.280
 sound increase if for example of the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.380
 alarm clock for example of the general volume 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.039
 or medium volume have been separated 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:44.090
 the 3 different toggle things first instead not 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:46.460
 it was therefore in small novelties we said to 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.530
 level of software but new second 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.850
 me important graphics very pretty 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.539
 also the possibility to choose if 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.310
 big icons some small since that 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:57.289
 many nostalgic lovers of the brand 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.940
 sony loved smaller icons like 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.590
 in jelly beans I prefer these 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.660
 slightly larger are tastes 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.539
 clearly we would miss something else 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.669
 for some info for all questions 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.220
 of the case it sends you to the comment box 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.780
 because maybe I'll ask Andrea 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.150
 that 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.300
 it is not that a sony fan f in my opinion 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.880
 sony grip for excellence in Italy 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.430
 he will try to explain the whole thing to you 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.380
 for today all and all dear boys there 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.240
 we feel as always at the next video 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.240
 a salute from wars 86
