00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.990
 hello with you and the mountains are relative 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.459
 I recently told the main 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.559
 disadvantages if I may say so 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.289
 iphone 5s video link you see 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.390
 right now you can see on the screen 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.240
 if interesting and today i would like 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.939
 talk about its benefits and know 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.800
 it will be something like that advantage plus 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.810
 experience of using I think those who 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.820
 Watch my channel regularly in the course of what 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.620
 I use my iphone 5s practically 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.530
 from the first weeks of sales that is 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.940
 in fact, it’s already half a year now 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.820
 I have something to say on this 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.830
 I immediately say that everything is already 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.600
 difficult is solely mine 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.010
 an opinion that you can both 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.920
 listen from which you can 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.050
 agree so may or may not agree 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.150
 and criticize always resent it all 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.340
 welcomed in the comments so 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.010
 the main advantage of iphone 5s to my 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.920
 look is a7 chip and advantage 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.920
 there are no 64 betah that sound very 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.439
 Ponto and the fact that in reality this 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.810
 the processor is able as I said before 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.640
 the difference in such yourself everyday 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.100
 work between iphone 5 where not 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.530
 new - fashioned processor and 5s actually 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.320
 no matter how I work everyday 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.899
 I mean launching applications surfing 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.329
 internet and so on but important 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.159
 understand that a7 processor is responsible for 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.929
 many other things such as 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.999
 serial shooting work lean and 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.189
 improved video stabilization of the 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:33.289
 hdr which appeared sim 1 and so on and 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.060
 so on the most revealing 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.679
 examples but here so that at once 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.719
 check will probably soon 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.759
 save the photo your ardent actually 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.679
 iphone 5s camera firing rate 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.319
 I have already shown how it works in 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.119
 full comparison iphone 5s 5 5 you can 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.520
 See a reference right now at 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.920
 screen or in the description below this video 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.630
 plus everything asem not very weak 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.310
 such a groundwork for the future regarding 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.530
 performance and speed 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.490
 really powerful applications which 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.740
 to date 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.869
 Alas, not so much in second place 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.939
 placed the camera and will not touch 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.830
 the number of megapixels about it I already 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.460
 spoke no however 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.360
 1 confirmation of the fact that the camera is in 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.670
 iphone 5s 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.580
 very very cool are the photos 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.110
 Made on the new 2014 flagship 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.730
 htc one m8 well, if seriously, the father 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.970
 really great camera which 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.890
 very decent shoots and photos and videos in 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.140
 there are no competitors 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.090
 some extra piggy white balances 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.680
 don't know the millions of camera modes do 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.540
 what should the mobile device 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.610
 got the phone winged application 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.430
 photographed and got quite 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.500
 decent photo while in ios 7 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.900
 you can actually enable all settings 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.570
 which and so not much in auto mode and not 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.140
 bother absolutely well personally i'm so 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.209
 and doing 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.130
 + very pleased with the rate of this 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.140
 the camera itself it really happens 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.750
 It helps to get the right photo in 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.700
 movement as for the video here 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.560
 still at a very high level and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.200
 Personally, I sometimes shoot a video camera 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.959
 panasonic there start 903 which 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.209
 is in the region of 600 dollars and sometimes 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.950
 on iPhones and what's really cool 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.040
 I personally do not see the difference in practice 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.250
 never plus have the ability to record 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.959
 with 120 fps with the word effect can not 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.120
 say i use new 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.280
 opportunities it's great in third place 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.310
 Tachadi will be many still consider 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.209
 fingerprint scanner somehow 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.430
 pampering and when apple only 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.980
 announced tachaydi and actually 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.230
 thought so too but after six 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.030
 months, I think it's almost 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.519
 the best iphone has now 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.200
 I will explain why well it happened that on 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.019
 my device has a lot of information on 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.280
 job contacts document records do not 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.310
 I know everything in general 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.510
 and personally, in case of loss of the device 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.940
 would worry no more for herself 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.430
 device and for information that can 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.260
 access from my iphone well not that 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.630
 so that their dofiga important person but it 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.580
 indeed so and that is why 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.950
 for a long time used the password and 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.380
 stitch dima brought the device protection on 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.230
 what a new and very cool level 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.000
 comfort unlocking father takes 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.350
 some fractions of a second in fact 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.970
 happens faster than even 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.250
 unlocking device where sometimes 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.160
 no plus installed at all 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.750
 to stare 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.090
 in the device screen when entering the password 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.880
 let's say behind the wheel that allows once again 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.250
 no medicine in fourth place with 7 a 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.800
 more precisely, even 71 here I will be quite 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.810
 briefly honestly I don’t remember which one 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.360
 I had a reaction right after the announcement in 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.910
 June 13, but today I 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.070
 so used to ios 7 that already with 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.100
 horror I look at the sixth version of mobile 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.320
 Wasp from apple must be admitted that 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.800
 first builds 7 firmware is not very weak 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.170
 so lame but 71 personally I have questions 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.510
 Probably not the speed of the work 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.330
 the application crash actually took off 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.760
 gone well personally I don't remember whether 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.920
 they generally after installing sim1 time 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.900
 battery life has increased and in general 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.550
 then in general a fairy tale and I know that 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.830
 some users still 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.560
 catch something which bugs well in general i 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.660
 I think that with a sim a cool comfortable 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.230
 practical with which is great 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.730
 works with iphone 5s and in this place 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.940
 corps here go wrong everything is clear 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.760
 I personally wear my last iphone 3 without 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.920
 any covers and films and in my 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.110
 The last case that was worn was still 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.120
 bumper on iphone 4 with which I went 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.760
 probably a month or maybe even two 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.710
 and whoever said no to metal and 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.169
 glass is much nicer to hold 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.750
 than plastic collabs quality was not 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.760
 plus everything i was replacing black 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.800
 on the color of gray space than finally 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.240
 I have solved the problem of visibility of chips and 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.230
 scratching rims on which many 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.510
 complained 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.060
 why exactly the visibility problem because 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.310
 that they of course appear on 5 seconds 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.560
 gray but much less visible 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.900
 and not so striking can not 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.360
 say that scratches on black iphone 5 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.400
 I was greatly disturbed to lie down 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.169
 problem here you can look at 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.419
 my black five after six months 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.570
 use she looked quite nothing 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:05.290
 even though it looks like itself again 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.150
 Something better 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.310
 advantage or experience of use 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.440
 iphone 5s i got write to 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.200
 comments what do you think about 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.150
