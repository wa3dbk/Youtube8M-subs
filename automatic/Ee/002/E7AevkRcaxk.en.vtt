I<00:02:56.769> do<00:02:56.950> mean<00:02:57.280> heavy<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:58.090> car<00:02:58.390> weighs<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.690> little

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
I do mean heavy this car weighs a little

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.170 
I do mean heavy this car weighs a little
bit<00:02:59.200> more<00:02:59.440> than<00:02:59.739> two<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.130> half<00:03:00.310> tons<00:03:00.670> which

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
bit more than two and a half tons which

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.820 
bit more than two and a half tons which
puts<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.510> in<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> same<00:03:01.930> sort<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.290> bracket<00:03:02.650> as<00:03:02.799> a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
puts it in the same sort of bracket as a

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.620 
puts it in the same sort of bracket as a
top-of-the-line<00:03:03.310> Land<00:03:03.730> Rover<00:03:03.940> Discovery<00:03:04.060> or

interesting<00:03:08.950> thing<00:03:09.160> about<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:09.610> car<00:03:09.819> this<00:03:09.970> is

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
interesting thing about this car this is

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.150 
interesting thing about this car this is
what<00:03:10.209> is<00:03:10.299> so<00:03:10.450> cool<00:03:10.630> about<00:03:10.690> all<00:03:11.140> electric<00:03:11.950> cars

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
what is so cool about all electric cars

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.039 
what is so cool about all electric cars
is<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.459> develops<00:03:12.880> maximum<00:03:13.450> torque<00:03:13.720> from

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
is it develops maximum torque from

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.960 
is it develops maximum torque from
literally<00:03:14.530> zero<00:03:15.040> from<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.310> standstill<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.819> in

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
literally zero from a standstill and in

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.020 
literally zero from a standstill and in
this<00:03:16.090> case<00:03:16.360> that<00:03:16.599> equates<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.370> 981<00:03:18.370> pound-feet

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
this case that equates to 981 pound-feet

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.470 
this case that equates to 981 pound-feet
of<00:03:19.060> torque

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
of torque

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.990 
of torque
which<00:03:20.140> is<00:03:20.290> more<00:03:20.440> than<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.620> Bugatti<00:03:20.920> Veyron<00:03:21.160> so

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
which is more than a Bugatti Veyron so

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.339 
which is more than a Bugatti Veyron so
when<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:22.269> put<00:03:22.480> my<00:03:22.510> foot<00:03:22.720> down<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.989> know<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.230> weighs

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
when I put my foot down I know it weighs

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.930 
when I put my foot down I know it weighs
two<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.650> half<00:03:23.739> tons<00:03:23.980> but<00:03:24.220> I'm<00:03:24.310> expecting<00:03:24.850> it

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
two and a half tons but I'm expecting it

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.699 
two and a half tons but I'm expecting it
to<00:03:25.209> go<00:03:25.359> so<00:03:25.870> we're<00:03:25.989> going<00:03:26.109> to<00:03:26.170> try<00:03:26.320> this<00:03:26.380> but

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
to go so we're going to try this but

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.349 
to go so we're going to try this but
just<00:03:26.890> in<00:03:27.070> stealth<00:03:27.340> mode<00:03:27.400> purely<00:03:27.940> electric

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
just in stealth mode purely electric

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.240 
just in stealth mode purely electric
let's<00:03:29.049> see<00:03:29.170> how<00:03:29.290> much<00:03:29.410> it<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.620> okay

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
let's see how much it is okay

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.130 
let's see how much it is okay
okay<00:03:32.940> it's<00:03:33.060> not<00:03:33.210> exactly<00:03:33.510> smoking<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.960> stuff

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
okay it's not exactly smoking it stuff

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.410 
okay it's not exactly smoking it stuff
it's<00:03:34.500> quite<00:03:34.770> impressive<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.460> mean<00:03:35.640> given<00:03:36.300> that

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
it's quite impressive I mean given that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.150 
it's quite impressive I mean given that
there<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.630> no<00:03:36.900> engine<00:03:37.110> working<00:03:37.470> here<00:03:37.740> at<00:03:37.890> all

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
there is no engine working here at all

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.440 
there is no engine working here at all
it's<00:03:38.400> really<00:03:38.490> very<00:03:38.970> quick<00:03:40.910> as<00:03:41.910> for<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.300> way

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
it's really very quick as for the way

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.720 
it's really very quick as for the way
the<00:03:42.780> car<00:03:42.960> handles<00:03:42.990> well<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.980> raw<00:03:44.130> material<00:03:44.640> is

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
the car handles well the raw material is

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.520 
the car handles well the raw material is
perhaps<00:03:44.880> not<00:03:45.270> that<00:03:45.510> pre<00:03:45.780> possessing<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.350> got

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
perhaps not that pre possessing you got

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.140 
perhaps not that pre possessing you got
as<00:03:46.650> we've<00:03:46.830> already<00:03:47.070> discovered<00:03:47.520> extremely

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
as we've already discovered extremely

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.270 
as we've already discovered extremely
heavy<00:03:48.360> car<00:03:48.660> with<00:03:49.260> an<00:03:49.410> extremely<00:03:49.860> long

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
heavy car with an extremely long

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.970 
heavy car with an extremely long
wheelbase<00:03:50.790> but<00:03:51.630> we<00:03:51.750> know<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.110> is<00:03:52.230> also<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.590> GT

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
wheelbase but we know this is also a GT

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.250 
wheelbase but we know this is also a GT
car<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.400> perhaps<00:03:53.790> our<00:03:54.120> expectation<00:03:54.930> levels

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
car so perhaps our expectation levels

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260 
car so perhaps our expectation levels
should<00:03:55.380> not<00:03:55.590> be<00:03:55.740> too<00:03:56.430> high<00:03:56.700> now<00:03:57.000> we're<00:03:57.120> going

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
should not be too high now we're going

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.360 
should not be too high now we're going
through<00:03:57.390> some<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.320> know<00:03:58.410> quite<00:03:58.650> fast<00:03:58.980> curves

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
through some you know quite fast curves

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.790 
through some you know quite fast curves
here<00:03:59.670> I'll<00:04:00.150> have<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.420> say<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.870> feels<00:04:01.170> extremely

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
here I'll have to say it feels extremely

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.220 
here I'll have to say it feels extremely
planted<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.940> manages<00:04:03.360> its<00:04:03.510> mess<00:04:03.720> very<00:04:03.990> well

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
planted it manages its mess very well

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.930 
planted it manages its mess very well
and<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:05.010> doesn't<00:04:05.310> feel<00:04:05.430> like<00:04:05.490> a<00:04:05.640> particularly

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
and it doesn't feel like a particularly

and it doesn't feel like a particularly
agile<00:04:06.390> car<00:04:06.690> but<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.260> also<00:04:07.410> doesn't<00:04:07.770> feel<00:04:07.890> like

around for me one of the most

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.380 
around for me one of the most
interesting<00:04:13.830> facets<00:04:14.550> of<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.850> car<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.240> its

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
interesting facets of this car is its

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.110 
interesting facets of this car is its
interior<00:04:15.750> there<00:04:16.320> are<00:04:16.350> so<00:04:16.980> few<00:04:17.280> switches<00:04:17.970> in

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120
