00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
bit ridiculous because there's a song

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.670 
bit ridiculous because there's a song
called<00:01:52.890> my<00:01:53.009> hair<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.880> same<00:01:54.540> suit<00:01:54.869> different<00:01:55.200> tie

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
but they managed to pull it off I feel

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.230 
but they managed to pull it off I feel
like<00:01:58.500> there<00:01:58.649> are<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> lot<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.070> metaphors<00:01:59.759> hidden

forever The Sickest Kids

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.820 
forever The Sickest Kids
it's<00:04:24.550> album<00:04:25.000> that<00:04:25.419> kind<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:25.990> tried<00:04:26.350> to<00:04:26.380> do<00:04:26.650> that

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
it's album that kind of tried to do that

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.950 
it's album that kind of tried to do that
that<00:04:27.100> kind<00:04:27.310> of<00:04:27.400> failed<00:04:27.819> at<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.180> same<00:04:28.419> time<00:04:28.720> I

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
that kind of failed at the same time I

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.230 
that kind of failed at the same time I
think<00:04:29.289> this<00:04:29.500> is<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.830> correct<00:04:30.400> version<00:04:30.850> of

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
think this is the correct version of

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.080 
think this is the correct version of
that<00:04:31.389> one<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:31.930> just<00:04:32.110> really<00:04:32.949> really<00:04:33.520> sold<00:04:33.910> it

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
that one that just really really sold it

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.540 
that one that just really really sold it
for<00:04:34.389> me<00:04:34.569> I<00:04:34.840> think<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.349> carries<00:04:35.620> out<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.130> album

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
for me I think it carries out the album

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.850 
for me I think it carries out the album
on<00:04:36.729> one<00:04:37.210> of<00:04:37.240> those<00:04:37.449> really<00:04:38.199> positive<00:04:38.710> and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
on one of those really positive and

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.499 
on one of those really positive and
strong<00:04:39.039> notes<00:04:39.460> it<00:04:39.669> just<00:04:39.880> almost<00:04:40.240> feels<00:04:40.449> like

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
strong notes it just almost feels like

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.240 
strong notes it just almost feels like
you're<00:04:40.720> kind<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:40.960> walking<00:04:41.169> home<00:04:41.410> on<00:04:41.889> a<00:04:41.919> summer

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250

night with your friends around you and
you're<00:04:44.800> basically<00:04:45.099> kind<00:04:45.490> of<00:04:45.550> trading<00:04:46.030> stories

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
you're basically kind of trading stories

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.270 
you're basically kind of trading stories
talking<00:04:47.020> about<00:04:47.199> all<00:04:47.500> of<00:04:47.560> these<00:04:47.740> nights<00:04:48.099> you've

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
talking about all of these nights you've

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.210 
talking about all of these nights you've
had<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:49.120> shitty<00:04:49.389> bars<00:04:49.720> etc<00:04:50.139> I<00:04:50.770> just<00:04:51.039> don't

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
had the shitty bars etc I just don't

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.469 
had the shitty bars etc I just don't
think<00:04:51.400> they<00:04:51.520> could<00:04:51.580> have<00:04:51.699> closed<00:04:52.060> out<00:04:52.300> this

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
think they could have closed out this

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.589 
think they could have closed out this
album<00:04:52.720> in<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.139> better<00:04:53.319> fashion<00:04:53.880> unlost<00:04:54.880> is<00:04:55.330> one

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
album in a better fashion unlost is one

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:56.999 
album in a better fashion unlost is one
of<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.780> only<00:04:55.930> tracks<00:04:56.289> on<00:04:56.500> this<00:04:56.620> album<00:04:56.830> that

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
of the only tracks on this album that

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.860 
of the only tracks on this album that
I'm<00:04:57.220> not<00:04:57.370> really<00:04:57.580> connecting<00:04:58.120> with<00:04:58.300> on<00:04:58.660> many

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
I'm not really connecting with on many

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.870 
I'm not really connecting with on many
levels<00:04:59.199> I<00:04:59.530> won't<00:04:59.740> say<00:04:59.919> that<00:04:59.949> it's<00:05:00.220> a<00:05:00.310> bad<00:05:00.550> song

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
levels I won't say that it's a bad song

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.670 
levels I won't say that it's a bad song
by<00:05:01.090> any<00:05:01.270> means<00:05:01.539> because<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:02.050> don't<00:05:02.199> think<00:05:02.530> that

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
by any means because I don't think that

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.620 
by any means because I don't think that
there<00:05:02.800> is<00:05:02.830> a<00:05:03.070> pet<00:05:03.280> song<00:05:03.580> on<00:05:03.789> this<00:05:03.970> LP<00:05:04.120> like<00:05:04.509> I

there is a pet song on this LP like I

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.629 
there is a pet song on this LP like I
mentioned<00:05:05.020> several<00:05:05.289> times<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:06.130> know<00:05:06.220> I<00:05:06.430> got

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
mentioned several times I know I got

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.339

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
really worked up and kind of excited

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.930 
really worked up and kind of excited
when<00:05:08.500> talking<00:05:08.740> about<00:05:08.919> this<00:05:09.220> album<00:05:09.460> it's<00:05:09.729> just

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
when talking about this album it's just

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.029 
when talking about this album it's just
because<00:05:10.210> I<00:05:10.419> did<00:05:10.870> not<00:05:11.020> really<00:05:11.259> expect<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.800> I

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
because I did not really expect it I

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.490 
because I did not really expect it I
will<00:05:12.400> say<00:05:12.580> that<00:05:12.789> unlost<00:05:13.150> like<00:05:13.479> I<00:05:13.599> said<00:05:13.870> I<00:05:14.080> just

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
will say that unlost like I said I just

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.649 
will say that unlost like I said I just
felt<00:05:14.680> a<00:05:14.800> little<00:05:15.310> bit<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.759> little<00:05:16.090> bit<00:05:16.330> like<00:05:16.509> it

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
felt a little bit a little bit like it

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.029 
felt a little bit a little bit like it
missed<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.169> mark<00:05:17.409> to<00:05:17.680> me

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
missed the mark to me

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.040 
missed the mark to me
but<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.759> final<00:05:18.970> track<00:05:19.300> that<00:05:19.479> I<00:05:19.509> will<00:05:19.780> mention

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
but the final track that I will mention

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.559 
but the final track that I will mention
is<00:05:20.470> miles<00:05:20.979> away<00:05:21.340> definitely<00:05:22.270> think<00:05:22.419> this

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
is miles away definitely think this

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.749 
is miles away definitely think this
thing<00:05:22.750> has<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:23.110> really<00:05:23.620> really<00:05:23.740> solid<00:05:24.099> start<00:05:24.610> to

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
thing has a really really solid start to

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.460 
thing has a really really solid start to
the<00:05:24.880> album<00:05:25.240> it<00:05:25.419> gives<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:25.990> that<00:05:26.020> breath<00:05:26.440> of

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
the album it gives it that breath of

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.930 
the album it gives it that breath of
life<00:05:26.860> that<00:05:26.889> we<00:05:27.159> just<00:05:27.340> kind<00:05:27.520> of<00:05:27.550> needed<00:05:27.909> to

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
life that we just kind of needed to

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.810 
life that we just kind of needed to
real-ass<00:05:28.780> in<00:05:29.139> as<00:05:29.409> the<00:05:29.560> listener<00:05:30.009> and<00:05:30.159> then<00:05:30.610> it

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
real-ass in as the listener and then it

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.249 
real-ass in as the listener and then it
just<00:05:30.970> kind<00:05:31.180> of<00:05:31.240> keeps<00:05:31.389> your<00:05:31.599> attention<00:05:32.050> all

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
just kind of keeps your attention all

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.020 
just kind of keeps your attention all
throughout<00:05:32.650> I<00:05:32.919> like<00:05:33.099> the<00:05:33.250> guitar<00:05:33.310> solo<00:05:33.880> on

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
throughout I like the guitar solo on

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.279 
throughout I like the guitar solo on
this<00:05:34.150> one<00:05:34.210> in<00:05:34.419> particular<00:05:34.509> and<00:05:34.930> I<00:05:34.990> thought<00:05:35.139> the

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
this one in particular and I thought the

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.870 
this one in particular and I thought the
hook<00:05:35.470> was<00:05:35.650> really<00:05:35.889> strong<00:05:36.130> and<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.430> goes<00:05:36.639> into

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
hook was really strong and it goes into

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.420 
hook was really strong and it goes into
same<00:05:37.300> suit<00:05:37.690> different<00:05:38.229> time<00:05:38.470> really<00:05:39.039> well<00:05:39.190> and

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
same suit different time really well and

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.370 
same suit different time really well and
then<00:05:39.639> the<00:05:39.759> album<00:05:40.180> just<00:05:40.389> kind<00:05:40.570> of<00:05:40.630> steam<00:05:40.960> rolls

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
then the album just kind of steam rolls

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.490 
then the album just kind of steam rolls
in<00:05:41.500> a<00:05:41.800> very<00:05:42.130> good<00:05:42.639> direction<00:05:43.240> from<00:05:43.719> there<00:05:43.960> I

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
in a very good direction from there I

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.800 
in a very good direction from there I
kind<00:05:45.009> of<00:05:45.099> went<00:05:45.250> off<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.520> cuff<00:05:45.729> on<00:05:45.969> this<00:05:46.419> review

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
kind of went off the cuff on this review

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.089 
kind of went off the cuff on this review
didn't<00:05:47.080> really<00:05:47.289> write<00:05:47.409> down<00:05:47.620> much<00:05:47.800> just

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
didn't really write down much just

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:49.800 
didn't really write down much just
because<00:05:48.219> I<00:05:48.490> felt<00:05:48.729> like<00:05:48.759> I<00:05:48.880> had<00:05:49.120> a<00:05:49.150> lot<00:05:49.419> to<00:05:49.449> say

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
because I felt like I had a lot to say

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.510 
because I felt like I had a lot to say
but<00:05:49.840> I<00:05:50.050> didn't<00:05:50.289> exactly<00:05:50.530> know<00:05:50.740> how<00:05:50.979> to<00:05:51.009> say<00:05:51.340> it

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
but I didn't exactly know how to say it

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.850 
but I didn't exactly know how to say it
so<00:05:51.669> I<00:05:51.880> just<00:05:52.090> kind<00:05:52.360> of<00:05:52.479> let<00:05:52.690> my<00:05:52.840> brain<00:05:53.110> spill<00:05:53.680> out

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
so I just kind of let my brain spill out

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.860 
so I just kind of let my brain spill out
to<00:05:54.009> the<00:05:54.099> camera<00:05:54.460> I<00:05:54.580> hope<00:05:54.729> you<00:05:54.849> enjoyed<00:05:55.240> this
