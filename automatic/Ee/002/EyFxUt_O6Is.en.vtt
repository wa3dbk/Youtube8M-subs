00:00:00.593 --> 00:00:02.811
- Hi, Jason Ganahl, GQue BBQ.

00:00:02.811 --> 00:00:04.657
It's snowing outside,

00:00:04.657 --> 00:00:06.140
but that's O.K. because I've got something

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.855
that's going to warm you up.

00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:10.676
Margaret Nadeau's Red Sahara Chili recipe.

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:14.113
She won the national championship in 2005,

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:17.573
and then she went ahead
and won it again in 2009.

00:00:17.573 --> 00:00:19.918
Both times beating entries from over

00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:22.190
500 qualifying contests.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.549
If you're into red chili,

00:00:23.549 --> 00:00:25.329
this is not something that
you're not going to want to miss.

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.135
(cheering)

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:31.135
(dance music)

00:01:53.103 --> 00:01:55.250
- I've been watching this
chili cook all afternoon,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.628
and now I can finally taste it.

00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:02.361
Excellent red chili.

00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:05.983
It's got great depth,
lots of flavors going on,

00:02:05.983 --> 00:02:07.947
which is really surprising
because we didn't put

00:02:07.947 --> 00:02:09.854
a whole lot of ingredients inside of it,

00:02:09.854 --> 00:02:11.470
but that's what happens when you allow

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.829
something to cook for several hours.

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.306
Everything comes together really nicely

00:02:15.306 --> 00:02:17.396
and balances itself out.

00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:18.837
I do think it's a little bit too salty

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:20.462
for my personal preference;

00:02:20.462 --> 00:02:22.273
however, it's still better than 90 percent

00:02:22.273 --> 00:02:23.922
of the red chilies I've ever had,

00:02:23.922 --> 00:02:25.245
and I use to be a chili judge

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:28.202
when I lived in Saint
Louis a long time ago.

00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:30.339
Excellent, excellent chili.

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.208
This chili, along with all the other

00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:34.205
national championship chilies...

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:38.327
The recipes are posted
on the C-A-S-I website.

00:02:38.327 --> 00:02:40.742
I'm going to put that link down below.

00:02:40.742 --> 00:02:42.123

and you won't miss any
of our awesome stuff.

00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:54.244
We're going to be outside on
the smoker or on the grill

00:02:54.244 --> 00:02:55.170
if the weather is good.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.992
If the weather is bad,
we're going to be inside

00:02:56.992 --> 00:02:58.409
here banging out good stuff.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.951
Take a look at some of my
other videos over here,

00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:02.844
and I'll see you next time.

00:03:02.844 --> 00:03:05.189

- Nadea's Red Sarah Chili recipe.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.863
She won the national...
