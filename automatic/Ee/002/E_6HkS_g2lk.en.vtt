 more options in the world 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.789
 we have that the bureaucracy can 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.699
 not appear on the larger screen right 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.070
 you can see there write it down there as well 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.559
 simple and very interesting general 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.550

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.770

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.290
 avoid leaving default month gives a completed 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:51.570
 create new world hopes to build 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:53.989
 career now this is a village well 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.760
 great 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:04.949
 80 of the no-brainer deals and I ended up 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:08.360
 discovering stay in this environment here 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.360
 always around here 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:33.720
 so here the iron field here plus one 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.689
 Tip for you in this world here in this 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.909
 town very close to the village with 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.369
 iron in the village then shows that 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.040
 there is a hole as soon as you do 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:49.020
 an iron mine 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.119
 I have very well big 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.299
 I have to think for this type of channel 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.930
 this one is very small that these 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.890
 light here has a yard also has 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:08.590
 these little lines of this kind 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:12.010
 here is a staircase right here 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.340
 is not everyone who has this house that is 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.890
 the largest area that is the most used 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:22.019
 low here is that most use I 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.019
 I like her because she's so big. 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:30.580
 have also had their well and of course not 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.340
 could forget the well also has a 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:39.970
 means that a library is not 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:42.660
 white it gets the library also has 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.660
 the little church 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.170
 I'm not going to leave not on top and last 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.030
 today last here at the blacksmith's house 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.079
 time because this life that is home to the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:00.150
 blacksmith is interesting even though you 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.150
 they will be very tall 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.910
 Now I had to cut a hole here, eh? 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.470
 shows that the blacksmith's house right I 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.540
 I had to cut the video but it looks 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:20.230
 here you have the iron pen and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:25.989
 iron sword six homicides and 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:28.810
 very interesting digging armor right 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:33.329
 the hole had fired near the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:37.290
 here is the one from here but if you 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:42.150
 dig here I do not remember well where 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:49.349
 So here I was digging the 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:56.109
 iron here in a world that I use a 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:04:05.319
 creative in seeing the size of the village being 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:07.799
 a notion is again I have created here that a 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.799
 another world 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.959
 Certainly some people will 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.510
 Warn me now, I'll go 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.300
 think there cut 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:29.300
 look here and ended up growing a lot and 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:34.200
 he two things is true was there 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:39.240
 look here the size of life helps well 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.820
 big even look it was pretty big 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.310
 same 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:50.160
 look at the houses here and that everybody who 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.250
 He's already walking here just once to 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.930
 show that the village team and these I 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.310
 I found three victories 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:01.530
 they are not in order that as soon as I 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.200
 I was going to say that they just want to sell and not 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:10.110
 buy nothing but this attack goes only 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:13.370
 five minor has no new base 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:22.320
 emerald gold the face is beast 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:30.510
 Wow, there is a book and 12 emeralds. 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:32.460
 I think this is going to stay here. 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.980
 If you liked it if you liked it 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.570
 very happy of pain ladies and gentlemen 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.860
 possible because if it is true more 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.560
 release of the video 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.540
 and do not forget to write the channel if 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.540
 You are not writing and I went
