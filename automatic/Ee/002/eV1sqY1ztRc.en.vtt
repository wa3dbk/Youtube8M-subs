 our format we are this three times 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.370
 hang up format this hang up has us 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.239
 actually tend to be that way 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.640
 I kinda fun at the joy 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.830
 I do not know I had sometime 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.970

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.629
 started with so I urgently need money 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:07.360
 needed and and then I had 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.770
 these beautiful turntables from tomb raider 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.350
 At that time I was still on tour 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.780
 I never got home like that 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.299
 I thought oh well get maximum boss times 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.280
 you watch something happen and 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.439
 then I stood there I believe a week 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.459
 long and has so much fun with myself 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:28.810
 in my apartment and davos others 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:30.819
 things and then exactly and then it has become 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.719
 that someday so surrendered that me 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.340
 then with a dj league she is called 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.319
 I have always gone with me 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.630
 sung for them somehow so live and 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.310
 then after Israel comes , do it now 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.590
 Once yourself offers easy to do 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.459
 and to simply looks something happened 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.659
 standing on the gas pedal with 28 and mobile 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.819
 make and you do not quite 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.689
 unsuccessful bridge and you also have people 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.670
 the not believe 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:59.669
 and they are still leaving with their new ones 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.849
 also something that is not typical for her 

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:06.310
 that is already compliment and that already 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.110
 also about the horny fuck you make 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.570
 you do not 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.430
 the shit is cool you say yourself 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.580
 the people, the atmosphere and something 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.770
 role models of you are cologne mood 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.360
 that's what it was 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.350
 Compact it would be possible 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.810
 never forget it 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.060
 So how did that happen? 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.600
 so this remix of skimming is 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.040
 I have been one of my role models 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.720
 I agree with you , I agree 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.750
 not quite sure i did not see any 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:44.610
 man stands in front of him cancer and the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:45.720
 remix in cologne no matter if ok 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.459
 something out so if i'm in front of him 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.060
 I just put him around martin 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.000
 not to be embarrassed 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.890
 the thing was so I'm I'm so 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.570
 Before that was so with electronic music 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.130
 I always thought so I can still 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.959
 from every hard rock scene and so on 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.940
 Well that's what electronic music is 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:10.170
 is here so dream dance plan on pants 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:15.630
 and students build and build little houses 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:20.100
 so my dancing and sorry I'm not 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.900
 There is something sexy about it, too 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.209
 I heard them and for once really 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.640
 such an epiphany for me 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.320
 the very drink itself very quickly 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.269
 wanted to do that and that's why it was so 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.590
 the so for me I'm off 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.180
 At some point too, I think it was that 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.450
 Rummels Bay also in Berlin when it comes to 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.440
 Of course he has an open erding 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.180
 I'm there and I thought so well 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.410
 so drink now drinks 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.209
 Give her a bit of courage 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.459
 and if he's right off the stage right now 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.820
 come down that you just guess 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.769
 and ask him then I stood 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.480
 really after he hung up 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.250
 he there so i have him backstage 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.390
 Seen and I am a stand I have 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.230
 just staring at him quite simply 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.790
 just stared because I thought 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.110
 someday you have to think 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.000
 either at what is that for you 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.070
 Psychopath I dare now immediately 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.860
 so I will not show myself anymore 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.889
 or he wants comfort and wants to know what 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.439
 actually my problem is he came 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:23.460
 thank god, he came forward and I stood 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:25.710
 what will again be my goal break 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.039
 and he thought like me, I have to 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.919
 gut anmut that was that that was that 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.779
 was it or is it there for me like this ? 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.819
 One constantly looking forward to having one together 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:37.800
 I know that sounds totally stupid or something 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.930
 but could you imagine 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.479
 maybe maybe remix for me too 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.529
 do 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.779
 actually I do not make remix oil 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:47.279
 or yes Jacob send me 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:50.639
 Just something to do on soundcloud then 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:53.909
 I thought so well to all six 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.610
 teams to eh never something like 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:05:00.330
 Sometime something comes but hey 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.900
 is okay comes did you try 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.479
 cool so at least you have the courage 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.240
 and then I always have 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.139
 sent and then he has me 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.759
 called 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.009
 I also have my mobile number right now 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.729
 packed and then he has me 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:19.020
 called 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:22.680

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:38.550

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:42.599
