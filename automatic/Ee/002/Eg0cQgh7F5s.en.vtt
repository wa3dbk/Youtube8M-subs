00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.279
 Hello dear friends with you I am 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.500
 cranes and today we'll see i discuss 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.910
 First of all, what am I thinking about mode? 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.220
 like football and look at the match blue 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.720
 team against the opposite side 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.600
 red team which includes 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.410
 stellar such composition amway zemlekku and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.180
 lion show match wanted to say pain will be 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.610
 quite interesting so let's see 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.960
 speculate 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.750
 observe so that's what i wanted 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.280
 say yes plus recently not so long ago was 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.059
 football mode introduced to us all gave out 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.970
 t-62a sport and it turns out that the teams 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.449
 3 on 3 you can platoon to go either in 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.960
 solo will throw you a random team of 3 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.510
 person 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.630
 all you need to do is shoot 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.580
 land mines on the ball and try to score it 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.400
 but the gates may be well 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.369
 score of course in your own but there is 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.270
 few nuances dunk date all 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.039
 thousands to odessa ninety nine 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.110
 millimeters of armor damage done here 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.210
 almost impossible yes there are such 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.759
 moments when tanks jump on a sword 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.820
 fall and blow themselves 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.009
 on foot but you cannot deal damage 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.960
 you shoot only landmines can shoot down 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.689
 u slim and this is probably one of the most 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.240
 the main problems that all the buzz from 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.850
 the game breaks down why because football 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.619
 he must be so dynamic yes that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.159
 have all the football the whole point is what 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.740
 you run play without stopping there 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.799
 and here it turns out I knocked down my opponent 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.659
 and you see each other and admire 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:00.659
 meanwhile the red team provtykat a 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.090
 the ball and the blue ones scored their first goal 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.060
 so that 's what I'm talking about here because of the dynamics 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.940
 of this suffering you stand throwing time 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.700
 it goes a little boring 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.620
 plus the ball is the ball it somehow you can 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.330
 hold it and give some points like 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.160
 right now he jumped out 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.860
 but at some point it can for 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.500
 huddle the final you just have it 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.310
 mts work 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.380
 he will throw out yes and here I am 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.680
 I think that physics needs a little bit physics 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.840
 correct and probably worth it at all 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.000
 get rid of such a thing as knock off and 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.860
 harp either to be repaired at least 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.620
 second well there really is two 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.220
 three seconds it's a little annoying 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.260
 plus the choice of the tank is such as t-62a I 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.260
 would personally like to see the hearth saying that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.320
 before they tested the tree at night 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.250
 something happened ball Nathan 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.410
 could kick and as far as tactics are visible 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.380
 well at least as Sasha bank if anyone 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.390
 saw our stream we are there such tactics already 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.910
 invented but two people should 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.989
 one man must fight for the ball 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.820
 to be protected he should if that 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.489
 to score a ball 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.910
 out on the goal line and defender 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.070
 should 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.739
 Well, here the defender of the game turns out he 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.560
 must score for it until the ball flies by and 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.150
 that's what I was talking about the situation is 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.860
 that the ball just squeezed on both sides 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.660
 try trying to shoot and here 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.140
 now friends begin interesting 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.120
 moment to boil the ball overshoot 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.070
 the ball is left handed by the ball 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.070
 gets into the gate and see how it is now 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.670
 Our hero will weigh Davy play so 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.160
 goalkeeper 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.880
 watch the ball trying to score but 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.430
 nothing works and we look we look 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.530
 were well just beautiful friends here 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.750
 this bout is really bout matches by 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.420
 country confuse fight match us not much 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.680
 beautiful how competently competently defended 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.829
 gate and 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.269
 knocked out so let's say the ball and understandably forgot 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.010
 say to knock the ball can of course 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.230
 shoot him again but again 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.140
 physics is not always somehow right 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.220
 it works you shoot it somewhere well 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.950
 in the wrong direction and I wish he was flying 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.049
 see what happens next play again 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.049
 on the side of the red team see 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.519
 what happens is gusl you gusl from the match 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.190
 Lasts if my memory serves me 7 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.500
 minutes later you know quite a lot 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.810
 for some reason, because every second match 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.940
 these are friends draw and in these 7 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.820
 in mention and generally play up to three 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.740
 heads here cut straight like this 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.300
 far so let's let the ball still gave 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.370
 give 2 friends a goal 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.750
 fine the team failed to protect but 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.419
 what I am talking about here is that they don't 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.550
 in my opinion very cial plays 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.740
 one person should see here 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.780
 stand on defense if the ball is somewhere 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.820
 breaks through so you can him and 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.090
 It turns out that half of the fights 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.669
 it's just no matter how hard you try 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.340
 even if you defeat the boys will return 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.100
 match will last almost 7 minutes 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.330
 because inside the ball here to score 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.520
 in less than 7 minutes just 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.710
 it's physically impossible either to do 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.130
 to play before the first goal and all 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.880
 inside the goal for winning too much 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:22.090
 places 10 fights God forbid that at least one 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.479
 the match will end 300 and there 32 that someone 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.180
 miraculously score three goals and see 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:31.210
 what is already left is the last minute score 2 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.160
 0 and here it is clear that she win 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.860
 red team well, just physically 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.200
 will not succeed in time let's a little bit 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.960
 rewind and of course this is a topic 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.539
 This is a rather jaded mode. 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.970
 very well, you all have long been 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.669
 discuss but I just liked this 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.960
 match like our hero exactly 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:54.490
 defile gates ie played goalkeeper 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.050
 it was very cool we all wanted 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.720
 I don't share much of my opinion 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.240
 played but enough to understand everything in 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.060
 This mode and I hope that the developers 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.919
 want to leave him kind of like and I hope 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.710
 they will be exactly the direction more 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.000
 dynamics go to matches were 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.150
 much more interesting 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.490
 sunset more exciting yes but so 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.380
 red team loses all thanks 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.789
 what were watching with you I was not the screen 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.760
 forget to subscribe to the channel set 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.320
 likes everyone good luck with randomness 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:28.080
 You will run for free if you play 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.080
 football and see you soon
