00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 this year in our region turned out 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
 especially rainy and cold autumn about 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.030
 what will be the weather for tomorrow we will know 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.830
 from the weather forecast but the staff 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.750
 Regional Botanical Garden has 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.059
 its green barometer is rare 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
 tropical plant alokaziya watching 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.210
 behind him you can predict precipitation 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.410
 laziness 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 short-term weather forecast for 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.609
 alokazii together with the staff of the greenhouse 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.060
 compiled and our correspondent 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.640
 Irina Gorshenin and Alokaziya in the botanical 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.740
 garden plant special for almost 20 years 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.600
 how it grows here almost never 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.610
 no mistakes nozzles 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.980
 this natural phenomenon has quite 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.230
 scientific basis for the structure of the sheet 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.510
 allows the plant to secrete excess water 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.140
 which accumulate with increased 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.000
 humidity 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.550
 such unusual properties of this 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.860
 a tropical species also gave him a second 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.899
 name for year nickname grow them such 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.050
 a feature that about a day when 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.160
 air humidity starts to rise 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.360
 goes down opens and starts 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.309
 moisture release 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.570
 surplus it can happen the same way 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.090
 with abundant watering 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.860
 but all 10 autumn we have a very rainy 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.610
 it turned out our plant is crying 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.560
 constantly 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.470
 we hope to be warm soon 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.930
 sunny our plant no longer plow 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.240
 will be by the way on the day of shooting the leaves 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.520
 Alokazii were dry I would like of course 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.040
 believe the plant to assume that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.380
 in our region , nevertheless, clouds will shatter and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.060
 the sun will look out but on the predictions of this 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.439
 tropical species can count 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.390
 only during the day 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.479
 by the way experts warn 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.100
 alokaziya plants are poisonous and such a house 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.079
 better not to start the barometer 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.820
 by the way botanical garden now 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.310
 prepare for planting other plants 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.710
 who are also unfamiliar to residents 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.600
 the region is planned that this fall in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.399
 within the regional project beautiful 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.829
 the efforts of everyone in the region only 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.470
 Volga will be planted about four 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.970
 thousands of seedlings we just tried 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.649
 pick up an assortment which is not 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.229
 used before in the city 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.540
 landscaping but other than that he is not 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.820
 used these varieties have already passed 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.990
 approbation that is they are resistant to our 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.430
 climatic conditions and we offer 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.140
 use forms of form with an unusual 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.970
 leaf coloring here we see 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.830
 variegated forms we have red 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.080
 forest golden forms 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.390
 that is, it will certainly significantly change 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.060
 its appearance will decorate the general appearance of the city 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.099
 Volga first seedlings heading to 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.720
 kindergartens and schools of the Volga by the way 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.970
 at registration of the territory of children 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.069
 institutions have their own nuances say 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.870
 botanists on sanitary norms and rules 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.569
 prickly plants should not be planted 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.420
 poisonous and for example juniper Cossack 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.850
 castor also unwanted plants with 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.290
 fruits even if they are edible because they 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.390
 can accumulate harmful substances 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.890
 so the staff of Volgograd 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.260
 botanical garden at the moment 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.600
 makes a list of plants which 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.580
 decorate the yards of schools and kindergartens and will 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.410
 while safe and new alleys 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.780
 which will land this year will become 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.810
 contestants whose results 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.970
 fail next year irina gorshenin 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.739
 Angelica Antipina Alexei Lunev in strength 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.739
