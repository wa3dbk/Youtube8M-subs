00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
just from the sense that you have an

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.640 
just from the sense that you have an

athlete in a prominent position and you

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469 
athlete in a prominent position and you
could<00:01:19.830> argue<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.939> college<00:01:21.270> basketball

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
could argue that in college basketball

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.170 
could argue that in college basketball
she<00:01:22.049> was<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> biggest<00:01:22.560> star<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.670> year<00:01:23.970> and

she was the biggest star of the year and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.090 
she was the biggest star of the year and
I<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> ease<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.110> which<00:01:25.500> she<00:01:25.680> said<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.070> she

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I like the ease in which she said it she

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.940 
I like the ease in which she said it she
was<00:01:26.369> very<00:01:26.460> comfortable<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:28.170> wasn't<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> lot<00:01:28.770> of

such<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> strong<00:01:36.509> message<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.990> young<00:01:37.350> people

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
such a strong message to young people

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.710 
such a strong message to young people
we've<00:01:38.159> read<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> accounts<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.240> young<00:01:39.450> people

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
we've read the accounts of young people

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.420 
we've read the accounts of young people
being<00:01:39.869> bullied<00:01:40.110> about<00:01:40.380> their<00:01:40.650> sexuality<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
being bullied about their sexuality and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.920 
being bullied about their sexuality and
this<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.000> something<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.420> think<00:01:42.509> will<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this is something that I think will go a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
this is something that I think will go a
long<00:01:43.170> way<00:01:43.409> now<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:45.060> how<00:01:45.270> she's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
long way now as you see how she's

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.120 
long way now as you see how she's
handled<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.079> how<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.350> been<00:01:46.470> accepted<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
handled it and how it's been accepted it

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.100 
handled it and how it's been accepted it
makes<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.850> question<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.720> an<00:01:48.930> issue

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
makes you question is this an issue

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.440 
makes you question is this an issue
about<00:01:49.740> athletes<00:01:50.460> coming<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.970> or<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
about athletes coming out or is this

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.539 
about athletes coming out or is this
just<00:01:51.509> an<00:01:51.810> issue<00:01:51.990> about<00:01:52.320> athletes<00:01:53.130> coming<00:01:53.340> out

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
just an issue about athletes coming out

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.670 
just an issue about athletes coming out
in<00:01:53.729> men's<00:01:54.030> sports<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.689> particularly<00:01:55.079> football

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
in men's sports in particularly football

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.889 
in men's sports in particularly football
or<00:01:55.920> basketball<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.450> think<00:01:57.689> she's

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
or basketball and I think she's

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.560 
or basketball and I think she's
providing<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.649> great<00:01:58.950> model<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.820> maybe<00:02:00.240> it's

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
providing a great model and maybe it's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.929 
providing a great model and maybe it's
because<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:01.409> think<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.250> parameters<00:02:02.759> around

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
because I think the parameters around

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.670 
because I think the parameters around
women's<00:02:03.479> sports<00:02:03.689> are<00:02:03.840> different<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.500> much

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
women's sports are different not as much

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.649 
women's sports are different not as much
attention<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.670> lot<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> sports<00:02:06.210> maybe<00:02:06.420> not

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
attention and a lot of sports maybe not

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.749 
attention and a lot of sports maybe not
as<00:02:06.750> much<00:02:06.899> money<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.500> could<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> part<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.459> it

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
as much money that could be a part of it

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
as much money that could be a part of it
but<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> think<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> bigger<00:02:09.660> issue<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.229> for

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
but I think the bigger issue is that for

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.589 
but I think the bigger issue is that for
men's<00:02:10.890> sports<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.760> feels<00:02:12.090> like<00:02:12.270> it's<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
men's sports it feels like it's a

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.370 
men's sports it feels like it's a
challenge

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
challenge

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.230 
challenge
or<00:02:13.440> some<00:02:13.920> consider<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.520> challenge<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:15.120> their

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
or some consider it a challenge of their

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.450 
or some consider it a challenge of their
masculinity<00:02:15.720> if<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.350> have<00:02:16.560> gay<00:02:16.830> athletes<00:02:17.310> who

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
masculinity if you have gay athletes who

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.340 
masculinity if you have gay athletes who
are<00:02:17.490> or<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.790> should<00:02:18.240> say<00:02:18.360> openly<00:02:18.690> gay<00:02:18.900> athletes

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
are or I should say openly gay athletes

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.750 
are or I should say openly gay athletes

particular ready for that I think ready

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.040 
particular ready for that I think ready
is<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.550> relative<00:02:39.060> term<00:02:39.300> if<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.780> think<00:02:39.960> about

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
is a relative term if you think about

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.230 
is a relative term if you think about
any<00:02:40.290> significant<00:02:40.920> progress<00:02:41.100> we've<00:02:41.730> ever<00:02:42.000> had

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
any significant progress we've ever had

any significant progress we've ever had
in<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.600> country<00:02:43.050> where<00:02:43.410> we<00:02:43.530> ready<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:45.060> be

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
in this country where we ready a to be

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.880 
in this country where we ready a to be
honest<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.660> look<00:02:45.900> at<00:02:46.050> especially<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
honest if you look at especially the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.460 
honest if you look at especially the
civil<00:02:47.190> rights<00:02:47.400> struggle<00:02:47.880> if<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.110> ask<00:02:49.290> some

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
civil rights struggle if you ask some

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.020 
civil rights struggle if you ask some
people<00:02:49.560> then<00:02:49.860> were<00:02:50.040> they<00:02:50.190> ready<00:02:50.460> if<00:02:50.700> you

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
people then were they ready if you

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.550 
people then were they ready if you
waited<00:02:51.240> for<00:02:51.450> them<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.660> be<00:02:51.780> ready<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.080> think<00:02:52.260> we'd

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
waited for them to be ready I think we'd

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.840 
waited for them to be ready I think we'd
all<00:02:52.650> still<00:02:52.920> be<00:02:52.980> drinking<00:02:53.370> out<00:02:53.460> a<00:02:53.490> separate

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
all still be drinking out a separate

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.640 
all still be drinking out a separate
drinking<00:02:53.970> fountain<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.840> think<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.530> it

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
drinking fountain so I think that it

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.200 
drinking fountain so I think that it
doesn't<00:02:55.950> matter<00:02:56.040> if<00:02:56.190> we're<00:02:56.490> ready<00:02:56.700> at<00:02:56.940> the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
doesn't matter if we're ready at the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.390 
doesn't matter if we're ready at the
moment<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.690> here<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.770> Brendan<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.280> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
moment is here and I have Brendan on the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.790 
moment is here and I have Brendan on the
podcast<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.120> he<00:03:00.450> he<00:03:00.900> walked<00:03:01.110> back<00:03:01.260> some<00:03:01.770> of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
podcast and he he walked back some of

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.260 
podcast and he he walked back some of
those<00:03:01.950> comments<00:03:02.370> because<00:03:02.460> he<00:03:02.700> realized<00:03:03.090> by

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
those comments because he realized by

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.120 
those comments because he realized by
saying<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:03.810> he<00:03:04.230> was<00:03:04.380> putting<00:03:04.620> pressure<00:03:04.950> on

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130
