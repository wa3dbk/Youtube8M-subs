00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
is really useful in the jungle because

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.239 
is really useful in the jungle because
you<00:02:15.689> already<00:02:15.810> get<00:02:16.079> sustained<00:02:16.620> from<00:02:17.069> the

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:17.249 
you already get sustained from the

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.149 
you already get sustained from the
jungle<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.989> you're<00:02:19.049> not<00:02:19.469> really<00:02:19.620> killing

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
jungle and you're not really killing

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.089 
jungle and you're not really killing
minions<00:02:20.579> as<00:02:20.879> well<00:02:21.239> as<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.780> solo<00:02:22.079> Lane<00:02:22.379> I<00:02:22.620> think

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
minions as well as a solo Lane I think

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.039 
minions as well as a solo Lane I think
that<00:02:23.430> points<00:02:23.999> better<00:02:24.150> use<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.629> exposed

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
that points better use in exposed

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.929 
that points better use in exposed
weakness<00:02:25.530> as<00:02:26.359> when<00:02:27.359> you're<00:02:27.510> ganking<00:02:28.189> dear<00:02:29.189> any

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
weakness as when you're ganking dear any

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.729 
weakness as when you're ganking dear any
with<00:02:30.299> a<00:02:30.329> new<00:02:30.719> hit<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:30.959> spell<00:02:31.230> then<00:02:31.590> your

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
with a new hit of spell then your

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.729 
with a new hit of spell then your

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
opponents can deal more I mean your

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.170

teammates can deal more damage to your

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.899 
teammates can deal more damage to your
opponents<00:02:36.829> that<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:37.980> want<00:02:38.189> to<00:02:38.280> focus<00:02:38.639> on

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
sustained support jungler and you don't

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.830 
sustained support jungler and you don't
want<00:02:49.919> that<00:02:49.980> all<00:02:50.189> offense<00:02:50.669> know<00:02:51.329> we'll<00:02:51.569> just<00:02:51.719> go

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
want that all offense know we'll just go

kind of champion can't think of one
right<00:03:14.939> now<00:03:15.120> but<00:03:15.719> yeah<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.439> v.v<00:03:17.189> will<00:03:17.370> work

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
right now but yeah like v.v will work

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.409 
right now but yeah like v.v will work
here<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.030> like<00:03:18.209> v<00:03:19.849> so<00:03:20.849> you<00:03:20.939> still<00:03:21.150> want<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.329> get

here so like v so you still want to get

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.390 
here so like v so you still want to get
the<00:03:21.540> same<00:03:21.720> points<00:03:22.049> in<00:03:22.139> offense<00:03:22.259> what<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.220> only

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
the same points in offense what the only

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.099 
the same points in offense what the only
difference<00:03:23.729> here<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.909> you<00:03:24.299> won't<00:03:24.479> get<00:03:24.720> second

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
difference here is you won't get second

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.520 
difference here is you won't get second
wind<00:03:25.349> you'll<00:03:25.709> focus<00:03:25.949> on<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:28.019> can<00:03:28.139> focus<00:03:28.290> on

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
wind you'll focus on you can focus on

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.249 
wind you'll focus on you can focus on
resistance<00:03:29.009> you<00:03:29.129> can<00:03:29.189> focus<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.669> health<00:03:30.259> you

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:31.259 
resistance you can focus on health you

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.009 
resistance you can focus on health you
can<00:03:31.290> focus<00:03:31.620> on<00:03:31.949> any<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.430> these<00:03:32.810> anything<00:03:33.810> else

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
can focus on any of these anything else

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.899 
can focus on any of these anything else
in<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.409> tree<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:35.129> just<00:03:35.310> don't<00:03:35.489> need<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:35.790> focus

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
in the tree you just don't need to focus

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.759 
in the tree you just don't need to focus
wind<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.509> perseverance<00:03:37.079> isn't<00:03:37.439> really<00:03:37.620> that

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
wind and perseverance isn't really that

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.839 
wind and perseverance isn't really that
great<00:03:38.629> um<00:03:39.629> so<00:03:40.530> yeah<00:03:40.769> that's<00:03:41.250> more<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.699> if

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
great um so yeah that's more of if

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.349 
great um so yeah that's more of if
you're<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:42.509> a<00:03:42.540> Vye<00:03:43.199> or<00:03:43.819> or<00:03:44.819> something<00:03:45.209> that's

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
you're like a Vye or or something that's

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.309 
you're like a Vye or or something that's
at<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:45.689> ad<00:03:46.729> tankier<00:03:47.729> jungle<00:03:48.180> then<00:03:48.689> if<00:03:49.049> you're

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
at the ad tankier jungle then if you're

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.140 
at the ad tankier jungle then if you're
just<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.620> tank<00:03:49.859> jungler<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.549> general<00:03:50.939> and<00:03:51.090> you

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
just a tank jungler in general and you

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.240 
just a tank jungler in general and you
want<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.389> sustain<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:52.709> won't<00:03:52.859> change<00:03:53.040> the

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
want the sustain you won't change the

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.619 
want the sustain you won't change the
defense<00:03:53.639> tree<00:03:53.879> you<00:03:54.030> make<00:03:54.180> sure<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:54.419> get<00:03:54.509> the

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
defense tree you make sure you get the

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.740 
defense tree you make sure you get the
second<00:03:54.959> wind<00:03:55.169> and<00:03:55.849> you<00:03:56.849> just<00:03:57.180> go<00:03:57.329> into<00:03:57.509> utility

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
second wind and you just go into utility

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.869 
second wind and you just go into utility
instead<00:03:58.349> it<00:03:58.680> helps<00:03:58.949> you<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.069> have<00:03:59.310> longer<00:03:59.549> buff

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
instead it helps you to have longer buff

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.929 
instead it helps you to have longer buff
durations<00:04:00.620> gives<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.799> more<00:04:02.250> movement<00:04:02.790> speed

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
durations gives you more movement speed

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.869 
durations gives you more movement speed
which<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.180> always<00:04:03.389> good<00:04:03.599> for<00:04:03.870> ganking<00:04:04.259> and

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
which is always good for ganking and

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.249 
which is always good for ganking and
Alchemist<00:04:05.879> is<00:04:06.030> just<00:04:06.299> there<00:04:06.509> because<00:04:06.659> as<00:04:07.199> a

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:07.259 
Alchemist is just there because as a

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.360 
Alchemist is just there because as a
jungler<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.859> might<00:04:08.009> be<00:04:08.129> using<00:04:08.280> potions<00:04:08.579> a<00:04:08.849> bit

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
jungler you might be using potions a bit

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.020 
jungler you might be using potions a bit
as<00:04:11.689> for<00:04:12.689> if<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.199> and<00:04:14.039> then<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.519> same<00:04:14.699> idea

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
as for if you and then the same idea

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.789 
as for if you and then the same idea
here<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.449> like<00:04:15.840> if<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.259> don't<00:04:16.469> if<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.650> don't

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
here is like if you don't if you don't

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.370 
here is like if you don't if you don't
have<00:04:17.009> sustained<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.849> zero<00:04:18.389> rammus<00:04:18.900> then

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
have sustained is zero rammus then
