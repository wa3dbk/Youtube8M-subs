think<00:01:51.229> about<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.979> demolition<00:01:52.579> of<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
think about it the demolition of the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.270 
think about it the demolition of the
wedlocke<00:01:53.240> stand<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:54.319> the<00:01:54.500> build<00:01:54.829> of<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.100> new

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
wedlocke stand that the build of the new

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.940 
wedlocke stand that the build of the new
one<00:01:55.520> or<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.630> infrastructure<00:01:57.319> that<00:01:57.530> goes<00:01:57.740> with

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
one or the infrastructure that goes with

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.649 
one or the infrastructure that goes with
that<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.220> function<00:01:58.610> rooms<00:01:58.819> and<00:01:59.090> so<00:01:59.240> on<00:01:59.420> will

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
that the function rooms and so on will

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.749 
that the function rooms and so on will
take<00:01:59.840> time<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.469> then<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.979> final<00:02:01.009> part<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
take time and then the final part of the

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.700 
take time and then the final part of the
jigsaw<00:02:02.149> is<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.600> final<00:02:02.929> dressing<00:02:03.319> if<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:03.530> like

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
jigsaw is the final dressing if you like

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.529 
jigsaw is the final dressing if you like
with<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.100> seeds<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:04.700> we've<00:02:05.210> probably<00:02:05.390> got

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
with the seeds so we've probably got

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.259 
with the seeds so we've probably got
another<00:02:05.869> year<00:02:06.110> or<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:06.530> before<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:07.700> decision

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
another year or so before that decision

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.240 
another year or so before that decision
has<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.420> be<00:02:08.539> taken<00:02:09.019> it's<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.619> brave<00:02:09.799> step<00:02:09.950> from

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
has to be taken it's a brave step from
