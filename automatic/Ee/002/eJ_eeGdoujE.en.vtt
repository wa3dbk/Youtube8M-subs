00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.859
 all 24 with a modern hit 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.119
 I remember that it began its trajectory in 2003 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.710
 in the midst of so many first-person shooters 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.380
 World War II, the title of infinity ward became 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.119
 by conducting the script presenting very intense and dramatic situations 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.239
 now in the face of developments in international politics after the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.089
 September 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.729
 the modern wars began to enter the target of the producers 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.120
 coming back from four land models 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.540
 Followed this path 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.170
 but did much more than just change was pictured 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.940
 cinematographic is the buzzword is not soft until 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.360
 not only because of the always spectacular staff 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.730
 for many times photorealistic but bring a script driving 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.130
 brilliantly surpassing even the predecessors with a great power of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.129
 immersion 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.329
 the plot unfolds on two fronts 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.689
 at one end is a sms novice soldier special forces uk 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.810
 while in another article said marine 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.490
 and the United States 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.700
 The two armies act in two situations that may 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.860
 the west 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.890
 in one of them 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.810
 a Middle Eastern country suffered a coup in the new military government 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.040
 declares a holy war against the great satan 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.010
 in another 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.700
 other Russian nationalists also plan a major attack 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.289
 Well-groomed production made up for not very creative backgrounds. 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.829
 the control consolidates us and even simple for a film of the genre 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.280
 but it is practical and functional in addition to having quick and accurate answers 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.910
 better than this by suffering a keyboard and mouse and how to preserve 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.459
 like the predecessors the progression is basically threshold 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.660
 but an exquisite stages snub makes the player have so many alternatives 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.119
 which reminds you of 10 yen per share with an explosive thing 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:52.069
 this broad way allows the creation of several strategies to defeat the 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.089
 opponents 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:57.429
 and are very numerous and especially smarter 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.570
 if we proceed at the rate we were 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.060
 right with your group 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.010
 Grenades have been set out to force you and your comrades out of hiding. 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.089
 the possibilities of using the scenario work paranÃ¡ 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:13.149
 the sides and dominate the resource is as important as its ability to 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.509
 turn and shoot 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.509
 as intense science shootings were not enough 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.310
 the producer adds in revenue 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.320
 like the predecessors 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.790
 countless situations to give more variety to the 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.070
 of a ship shape 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.020
 in the middle of a storm passing by the command of the artillery in the helicopter 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.110
 and neither hercules equipped with armaments beyond heavy to a 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.160
 murder mission in which the player and his superior 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.019
 infiltrate then with the enemies 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.069
 the team of precision invitations 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.969
 the way the player's participation in the team is also different is not 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.969
 of a squad game in which you give the orders 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.480
 in theory 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.709
 You're just one more in the platoon and each soldier's network with your 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.539
 own artificial intelligence 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:09.749
 but acts of heroism are always left in the player's house 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.219
 good games and make time pass faster 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.189
 but here 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.529
 The fact is that the campaign really counts 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.889
 if it does not find difficulties the modality can be finished in 5 or 6 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:22.780
 hours 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.190
 and nobody sees what happens to the squadron 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.680
 not have a co-operative mode stop-go missed opportunity 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.139
 reported that appearing for those who finished the campaign 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.449
 are life forms counted in punctuation 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.199
 but those who have a signature or in the light 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.650
 can enjoy one of the most important multiplier of the last 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.570
 times 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.330
 the mode is robust 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.250
 supports up to 18 players and ejections 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.289
 and 32 in the computer that has 16 forests and 13 modalities 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:04.430
 in general 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.699
 breathtaking visual production environments seem to have a life of their own 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.039
 not all scenarios are spectacular but when all 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:14.509
 elements falling into place 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.300
 effect particle smoke great beast 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.780
 and especially the superb elimination 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.790
 has one of the most exquisite and photorealistic graphics of the current generation 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.410
 the Norton partition - out of series 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.630
 keeping the tradition the dubbing is perfect is with a super 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.630
 film production with those dramatic soundtracks typical of 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.909
 war works 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.110
 which stands out from the soundproofing 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.479
 each type of weapon is different 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.389
 with clarity and infarct the explosions are noisy and in a powerful sound system 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.389
 everything trembled 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.810
 lacked 4 9 thousand hectares 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.060
 is strong candidate of the year 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.430
 brilliant in every way 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.310
 the campaign has an impeccable story line 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.560
 as one of the richest shocking scenes seen in the video game 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.210
 with the feeling of being part of a war movie 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.160
 the only one in its short duration, but while on the front it is 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.960
 likely to be some of the most exciting hours in front of a 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.759
 biennium 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.780
 on the other hand none of the most important multiplexes of recent times 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:25.870
 combining how these 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.330
 and a system of experience that makes it sticky exist 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.389
 This is a war that is definitely worth fighting for. 

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:40.919
