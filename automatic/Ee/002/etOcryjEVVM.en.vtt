 a cup of oatmeal which is called 'la 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.600
 passion or school and we're going to need 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.239
 two tablespoons of vanilla extract 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.940
 this is optional but definitely you 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.519
 It gives a super super rich flavor to 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.160
 booties good now what we're going to do 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.290
 it's wetting the oats we're just going to 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.959
 put little water that gets wet all over and 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.269
 let's shake it we put in the 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.120
 blender and again we integrate all 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.120
 the other ingredients like the egg the 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.950
 apple the banana and here I am going to 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.500
 be showing the vanilla extract 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.540
 that I used only two 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.209
 teaspoons put you 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.739
 and that's all grind the whole mixture if 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.459
 you do not have a type of blender 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.109
 like the one that I have and it's bigger 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.019
 mola just say that good is 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.540
 It is very necessary that they only use the 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.950
 amounts that I am giving you these 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.890
 amounts 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.010
 they reach about 7 hot cakes or 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.590
 pancakes then this if they want to do 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.659
 more simply double the amount that 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.239
 they will not put more on it because if not 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.459
 mix goes wrong and they will not go out and 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.470
 well now in a pan or what you 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.030
 you want to put this butter and the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.159
 mixture should be left as is. 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.049
 seeing puts it and simply with a 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.840
 teaspoon is watered to make a 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.970

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.819
 that are going to be girls definitely that 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.609
 it's all they flip, they do not take long 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.659
 in baking they still put it to a 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:16.299
 temperature more or less as medium 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.820
 fire a little bit shorter as a 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.190
 medium-low fire something like this reminds us 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.870
 how it's called but good and look like that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.630
