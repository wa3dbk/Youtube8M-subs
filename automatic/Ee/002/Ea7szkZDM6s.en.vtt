I guess actually right now you just

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.770 
I guess actually right now you just
probably<00:02:11.540> yank<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:12.110> right<00:02:12.500> up<00:02:12.650> through<00:02:12.890> and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
probably yank this right up through and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.240 
probably yank this right up through and
yank<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.960> ball<00:02:15.230> right<00:02:15.530> out<00:02:15.710> of<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:16.010> thing
