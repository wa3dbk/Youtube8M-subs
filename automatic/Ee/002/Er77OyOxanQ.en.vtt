races which have artifacts around the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.270 
races which have artifacts around the
world<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.590> Azeroth<00:00:35.540> it's<00:00:36.540> there<00:00:36.809> or<00:00:37.140> 14<00:00:37.620> Brona

world of Azeroth it's there or 14 Brona

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.180 
world of Azeroth it's there or 14 Brona
if<00:00:38.489> there<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.910> that's<00:00:39.239> like<00:00:39.510> low<00:00:40.050> mistake<00:00:40.649> they

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
if there is that's like low mistake they

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.979 
if there is that's like low mistake they
haven't<00:00:41.340> even<00:00:41.460> been<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.540> long<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
haven't even been there that long and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.750 
haven't even been there that long and
suddenly<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.710> start<00:00:44.100> finding<00:00:44.520> their

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
suddenly you can start finding their

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.830 
suddenly you can start finding their
artifacts<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.410> let's<00:00:46.620> hope<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.100> isn't<00:00:47.550> there

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
artifacts so let's hope that isn't there

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.279 
artifacts so let's hope that isn't there
but<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:49.140> there's<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.559> another<00:00:50.600> well<00:00:51.600> page

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
but then there's this another well page

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.470 
but then there's this another well page
which<00:00:52.980> has<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.760> artifacts<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.329> have

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
which has all the artifacts you have

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
which has all the artifacts you have
completed<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.039> I've<00:00:56.280> been

seriously have no idea but I think it's

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.920 
seriously have no idea but I think it's
like<00:02:54.170> three<00:02:54.680> times<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.190> can<00:02:55.340> use<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.720> an

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
like three times you can use this in an

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.309 
like three times you can use this in an
area<00:02:57.350> which<00:02:57.830> has<00:02:58.030> which<00:02:59.030> has<00:02:59.330> been<00:02:59.600> marked<00:02:59.930> as

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
area which has which has been marked as

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.900 
area which has which has been marked as
