really<00:01:34.740> changed<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.400> much<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.180> he<00:01:36.240> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
really changed that much but he is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.940 
really changed that much but he is
getting<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:37.020> bit<00:01:37.229> older<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.710> don't

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
getting a little bit older and I don't

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.920 
getting a little bit older and I don't
think<00:01:38.220> EA<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.790> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.240> upgrade<00:01:39.360> him<00:01:39.750> or

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
think EA are going to upgrade him or

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.800 
think EA are going to upgrade him or
keeping<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> same<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.740> think<00:01:41.220> 82<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.820> pretty

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
keeping the same I think 82 is pretty

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.350 
keeping the same I think 82 is pretty
fair<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.500> my<00:01:43.770> honest<00:01:44.220> opinion<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.030> he's<00:01:45.180> still

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
fair in my honest opinion so he's still

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.609 
fair in my honest opinion so he's still
be<00:01:45.509> really<00:01:45.840> good<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.200> think<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.530> going
