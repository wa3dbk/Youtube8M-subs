more<00:01:36.689> clearer<00:01:36.990> over<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> amber<00:01:38.369> unit

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
more clearer over here on the amber unit

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.969 
more clearer over here on the amber unit
you<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> bulb<00:01:39.720> mounted<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> center

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
you have the bulb mounted in the center

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.520 
you have the bulb mounted in the center
and<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> reflector<00:01:42.600> set<00:01:43.229> up<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and then with the reflector set up in a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.410 
and then with the reflector set up in a
cone<00:01:43.829> shape<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.610> gives<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.240> impression

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
cone shape it gives you that impression

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.649 
cone shape it gives you that impression
of<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.290> dual<00:01:46.619> seal<00:01:47.040> being<00:01:47.399> life<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.030> again<00:01:48.360> this

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
of a dual seal being life and again this

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.240 
of a dual seal being life and again this
is<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> configuration<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.649> set<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.009> here

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
is the configuration they set up here

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.800 
is the configuration they set up here
they<00:01:50.579> also<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:51.000> some<00:01:51.149> federal<00:01:51.329> signal

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
they also have some federal signal

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.940 
they also have some federal signal

units these are using mr11 light heads

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.319 
units these are using mr11 light heads
but<00:01:55.950> essentially<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.729> scene<00:01:57.000> light<00:01:57.180> at

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
but essentially this is a scene light at

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.569 
but essentially this is a scene light at
allergen<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.009> lower<00:01:59.189> level

the back of this particular vehicle now

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.190 
the back of this particular vehicle now
this<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.050> a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
this is a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.710 
this is a
demo<00:02:13.440> unit<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.489> again<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.090> lighting<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.510> see

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
demo unit so again the lighting you see

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.790 
demo unit so again the lighting you see
here<00:02:15.989> has<00:02:16.110> been<00:02:16.140> selected<00:02:16.650> by<00:02:16.739> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
here has been selected by the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.110 
here has been selected by the
manufacturer<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:17.760> you're<00:02:17.910> building

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
manufacturer so if you're building

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.610 
manufacturer so if you're building
something<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.599> this<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.290> might<00:02:19.500> be

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
something like this it might be

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.660 
something like this it might be
something<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.069> could<00:02:20.190> take<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> look<00:02:20.550> at

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
something that you could take a look at

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.580 
something that you could take a look at
on<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.030> signage<00:02:21.510> website<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.349> have<00:02:22.560> a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
on the signage website and have a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.979 
on the signage website and have a
different<00:02:22.920> configuration<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:24.330> again<00:02:24.540> many

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
different configuration but again many

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.910 
different configuration but again many
thanks<00:02:25.080> for<00:02:25.470> watching<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.040> I'm<00:02:26.489> Stuart
