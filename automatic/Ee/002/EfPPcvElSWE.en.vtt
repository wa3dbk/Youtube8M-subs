00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
for each platform that we skipped last

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.490 
for each platform that we skipped last
time<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.309> i<00:00:56.789> mean<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.719> don't<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.320> want

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
you can actually do a virtual device

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.990 
you can actually do a virtual device
you'll<00:01:42.479> also<00:01:42.689> need<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.310> download<00:01:44.310> those<00:01:44.700> tools

you'll also need to download those tools
if<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> will<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.659> doing<00:01:45.810> any<00:01:46.140> app<00:01:46.409> development

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
if you will be doing any app development

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.749 
if you will be doing any app development
those<00:01:48.270> tools<00:01:48.600> really<00:01:48.990> come<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.770> help<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.520> in

those tools really come and help out in

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.319 
those tools really come and help out in
especially<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:52.380> when<00:01:53.009> you're<00:01:53.250> testing<00:01:54.180> out

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
especially like when you're testing out

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.709 
especially like when you're testing out
the<00:01:54.509> app<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.689> i<00:01:55.020> would<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.470> arm

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
the app and i would like that arm

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.120 
the app and i would like that arm
another<00:01:57.719> program<00:01:58.170> you'll<00:01:58.380> use<00:01:58.590> for<00:01:58.860> app

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
another program you'll use for app

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.880 
another program you'll use for app
development<00:01:59.729> would<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.090> eclipse<00:02:00.899> reply<00:02:01.829> would

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
development would be eclipse reply would

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.560 
development would be eclipse reply would
be<00:02:02.070> your<00:02:02.310> best<00:02:02.490> bet<00:02:02.729> because<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.420> can

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
be your best bet because you can

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.929 
be your best bet because you can
actually<00:02:03.719> install<00:02:04.140> more<00:02:05.100> development<00:02:05.729> tools

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
actually install more development tools

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.260 
actually install more development tools
and<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.670> pretty<00:02:08.670> much<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.000> will<00:02:09.060> guide

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and that and pretty much it will guide

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.270 
and that and pretty much it will guide
you<00:02:09.479> through<00:02:09.509> what's<00:02:10.440> possible<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.009> what's

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
you through what's possible and what's

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.760 
you through what's possible and what's
not<00:02:11.489> like<00:02:12.180> when<00:02:12.360> you're<00:02:12.540> actually<00:02:12.840> putting

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
not like when you're actually putting

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.220 
not like when you're actually putting
in<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> Java<00:02:14.190> code<00:02:14.490> if<00:02:14.910> something<00:02:15.840> isn't

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
in the Java code if something isn't

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.220 
in the Java code if something isn't
right<00:02:16.560> it'll<00:02:16.890> actually<00:02:17.270> air<00:02:18.270> out<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.900> show

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
right it'll actually air out and show

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.720 
right it'll actually air out and show
you<00:02:19.290> where<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.830> errors<00:02:20.190> are<00:02:20.370> which<00:02:20.610> are

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
you where the errors are which are

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.960 
you where the errors are which are
really<00:02:20.970> nice<00:02:21.120> um<00:02:22.250> we'll<00:02:23.250> probably<00:02:23.520> get<00:02:23.790> into

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
really nice um we'll probably get into

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.740 
really nice um we'll probably get into
that<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.450> little<00:02:24.540> bit<00:02:24.720> later<00:02:26.360> for<00:02:27.360> now<00:02:27.480> we're

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
that a little bit later for now we're

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.660 
that a little bit later for now we're
going<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.200> do<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.770> virtual<00:02:29.190> machine<00:02:29.640> and

going to just do a virtual machine and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.640 
going to just do a virtual machine and
this<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.150> going<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.360> be<00:02:30.450> where<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.050> decide

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
this is going to be where you decide

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.680 
this is going to be where you decide
what<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.100> want<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.370> do<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.740> name<00:02:35.700> my

what you want to do I like to name my

what you want to do I like to name my
virtual<00:02:37.170> devices<00:02:37.470> what<00:02:38.040> I'm<00:02:38.250> actually<00:02:38.460> going

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
virtual devices what I'm actually going

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.410 
virtual devices what I'm actually going
to<00:02:38.790> be<00:02:38.850> using<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.570> as<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.710> honeycomb<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.300> do<00:02:42.390> a

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
to be using so as a honeycomb I can do a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:52.250 
to be using so as a honeycomb I can do a
target<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.880> 3.2<00:02:49.910> will<00:02:50.910> just<00:02:51.270> create<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:52.020> a

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
target of 3.2 will just create this a

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.070 
target of 3.2 will just create this a
will<00:02:52.980> use<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.280> default<00:02:53.430> settings<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.240> now

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
will use the default settings and now

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:04.300 
will use the default settings and now
when<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.380> run<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:56.120> actually<00:02:57.120> start<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.510> like

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.000 

using<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.550> 10<00:03:05.880> inches<00:03:06.180> 10<00:03:07.110> inch<00:03:07.410> screen<00:03:07.530> size

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
using a 10 inches 10 inch screen size

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.250 
using a 10 inches 10 inch screen size
that's<00:03:08.310> diagonally<00:03:08.880> that'll<00:03:09.750> that's<00:03:10.080> what

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
that's diagonally that'll that's what

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.400 
that's diagonally that'll that's what
most<00:03:10.520> tablets<00:03:11.520> use<00:03:11.760> anyway<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:13.170> this<00:03:13.260> is

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
most tablets use anyway so this is

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.610 
most tablets use anyway so this is
actually<00:03:13.530> going<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.890> be<00:03:14.810> pretty<00:03:15.810> much<00:03:16.050> more<00:03:16.530> or

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
actually going to be pretty much more or

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.060 
actually going to be pretty much more or
less<00:03:16.740> with<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.300> Android<00:03:18.300> tablets<00:03:18.750> today<00:03:19.070> are

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
less with the Android tablets today are

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:28.699 
less with the Android tablets today are
going<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> look<00:03:21.150> like<00:03:26.990> it<00:03:27.990> does<00:03:28.260> take<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.530> little

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
going to look like it does take a little

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.330 
going to look like it does take a little
bit<00:03:28.860> um<00:03:30.170> quite<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.230> bit<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.530> while<00:03:31.740> to<00:03:31.980> load<00:03:32.130> up

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
bit um quite a bit of a while to load up

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.800 
bit um quite a bit of a while to load up
on<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.360> computer<00:03:35.270> this<00:03:36.270> is<00:03:36.420> probably<00:03:36.660> because

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
on the computer this is probably because

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.530 
on the computer this is probably because
it's<00:03:37.200> not<00:03:37.320> really<00:03:37.560> optimized<00:03:38.100> for<00:03:38.130> Intel<00:03:38.970> CPUs

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
it's not really optimized for Intel CPUs

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.699 
it's not really optimized for Intel CPUs
or<00:03:39.930> anything<00:03:40.200> like<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:42.260> even<00:03:43.260> using<00:03:43.680> my

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
or anything like that I even using my

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
quad core computer at home it it really

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.420 
quad core computer at home it it really
does<00:03:47.459> still<00:03:48.050> take<00:03:49.050> a<00:03:49.260> long<00:03:49.470> time<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.740> boot<00:03:50.310> up

this generic Android boot up screen will
be<00:04:17.519> on<00:04:17.640> like<00:04:17.910> every<00:04:19.850> emulator<00:04:20.850> doesn't<00:04:21.720> matter

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
you're still going to get this same boot

you're still going to get this same boot
up<00:04:33.120> screen

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.219 

I'm<00:05:02.970> going<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.120> meantime<00:05:03.600> I'm<00:05:03.780> actually<00:05:03.960> going

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
I'm going to meantime I'm actually going

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:12.010 
I'm going to meantime I'm actually going
to<00:05:04.319> load<00:05:04.470> up<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.800> SDK<00:05:05.370> or<00:05:06.020> okay<00:05:07.190> sorry<00:05:08.270> general

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.210 

I'll<00:05:13.020> show<00:05:13.259> you<00:05:13.319> that<00:05:13.440> you<00:05:13.620> can<00:05:13.740> actually

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
I'll show you that you can actually

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:30.529 
I'll show you that you can actually
communicate<00:05:14.580> to<00:05:15.270> this<00:05:15.599> to<00:05:16.289> the<00:05:16.440> emulator<00:05:29.539> so

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
communicate to this to the emulator so

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.029 
communicate to this to the emulator so
what<00:05:30.690> I<00:05:30.720> do<00:05:30.840> is<00:05:30.990> you're<00:05:31.530> going<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.710> change

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
what I do is you're going to change

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.140 
what I do is you're going to change
directory<00:05:32.580> CD<00:05:32.849> again<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.840> Android<00:05:34.319> SDK<00:05:34.830> and

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
directory CD again to Android SDK and

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.760 
directory CD again to Android SDK and
inside<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.360> folder<00:05:36.509> platform<00:05:37.169> tools<00:05:37.410> because

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
inside the folder platform tools because

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.540 
inside the folder platform tools because
that's<00:05:37.979> where<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.340> adb<00:05:40.160> but<00:05:41.160> like<00:05:41.430> the

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
that's where the adb but like the

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.029 
that's where the adb but like the
android<00:05:41.699> debugging<00:05:42.180> bridge<00:05:42.389> is<00:05:42.599> so<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:43.889> can

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
android debugging bridge is so you can

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.129 
android debugging bridge is so you can
actually<00:05:44.210> make<00:05:45.210> sure<00:05:45.389> that<00:05:45.630> your<00:05:45.810> device<00:05:46.080> is

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
actually make sure that your device is

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.070 
actually make sure that your device is
on<00:05:46.650> which<00:05:47.400> here<00:05:48.120> you<00:05:48.300> can<00:05:48.449> actually<00:05:48.570> visually

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
on which here you can actually visually

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.230 
on which here you can actually visually
see<00:05:49.320> it<00:05:49.440> because<00:05:50.340> it's<00:05:50.490> on<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.699> computer<00:05:51.060> but

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
see it because it's on the computer but

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.300 
see it because it's on the computer but
like<00:05:51.449> let's<00:05:51.660> say<00:05:51.750> you<00:05:51.870> had<00:05:52.229> a<00:05:52.259> phone<00:05:52.530> or<00:05:52.860> tablet

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
like let's say you had a phone or tablet

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.469 
like let's say you had a phone or tablet
and<00:05:53.430> you<00:05:53.490> wanted<00:05:53.669> to<00:05:53.729> make<00:05:53.909> sure<00:05:53.940> that<00:05:54.270> it<00:05:54.389> was

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
and you wanted to make sure that it was

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.210 
and you wanted to make sure that it was
communicating<00:05:55.139> to<00:05:55.289> the<00:05:55.380> computer<00:05:55.770> properly

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
communicating to the computer properly

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.909 
communicating to the computer properly
you<00:05:56.430> can<00:05:56.580> actually<00:05:56.699> type<00:05:57.060> in<00:05:57.240> adb<00:05:58.169> devices<00:05:58.289> if

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
you can actually type in adb devices if

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.950 
you can actually type in adb devices if
you<00:05:59.190> do<00:05:59.430> not<00:05:59.460> have<00:05:59.849> the<00:06:00.180> bugging<00:06:00.509> mode<00:06:00.690> turned

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
you do not have the bugging mode turned

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.010 
you do not have the bugging mode turned
arm<00:06:01.319> the<00:06:01.440> phone<00:06:01.680> you<00:06:02.340> should<00:06:02.610> get<00:06:02.759> nothing<00:06:03.150> but

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
arm the phone you should get nothing but

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.469 
arm the phone you should get nothing but
since<00:06:04.440> we<00:06:04.770> have<00:06:05.130> the<00:06:05.580> emulator<00:06:06.000> running<00:06:06.270> you

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
since we have the emulator running you

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.760 
since we have the emulator running you
could<00:06:06.630> actually<00:06:06.750> see<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.229> emulator<00:06:09.770> actually

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
could actually see the emulator actually

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.240 
could actually see the emulator actually
can<00:06:11.099> see<00:06:11.280> multiple<00:06:11.729> devices<00:06:12.030> if<00:06:12.330> you<00:06:12.449> want<00:06:12.659> to

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
can see multiple devices if you want to

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.379 
can see multiple devices if you want to
like<00:06:14.250> right<00:06:14.400> now<00:06:14.550> i'm<00:06:14.639> going<00:06:14.789> to<00:06:14.849> hook<00:06:15.030> up<00:06:15.240> my

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.649 

iphone<00:06:18.620> and<00:06:19.620> you'll<00:06:20.370> see<00:06:20.580> two<00:06:20.969> devices<00:06:21.240> if<00:06:21.539> i

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:21.659 
iphone and you'll see two devices if i

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:32.960 
iphone and you'll see two devices if i
run<00:06:21.780> that<00:06:21.990> again

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.350 

so<00:06:33.970> here's<00:06:34.420> your<00:06:34.600> emulator<00:06:34.900> um<00:06:36.360> it's

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
so here's your emulator um it's

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.350 
so here's your emulator um it's
basically<00:06:37.750> just<00:06:37.900> honeycomb<00:06:38.680> and<00:06:38.970> it<00:06:39.970> runs

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
basically just honeycomb and it runs

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.740 
basically just honeycomb and it runs
really<00:06:40.870> slow<00:06:41.410> on<00:06:41.740> a<00:06:41.770> computer<00:06:45.750> incredibly

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
really slow on a computer incredibly

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.400 
really slow on a computer incredibly
slow<00:06:47.190> now<00:06:48.190> my<00:06:48.790> macbook<00:06:49.270> has<00:06:49.540> been<00:06:49.810> pretty<00:06:50.290> much

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
slow now my macbook has been pretty much

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.130 
slow now my macbook has been pretty much
stretched<00:06:50.800> to<00:06:51.010> its<00:06:51.370> limits<00:06:51.850> period<00:06:52.510> so<00:06:52.810> I

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
stretched to its limits period so I

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.830 
stretched to its limits period so I
don't<00:06:53.410> expect<00:06:53.800> it<00:06:53.950> to<00:06:53.980> actually<00:06:54.250> be<00:06:54.840> any

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
don't expect it to actually be any

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.320 
don't expect it to actually be any
better<00:06:56.020> anytime<00:06:56.380> suit<00:06:56.860> especially<00:06:57.730> since<00:06:58.210> i'm

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
better anytime suit especially since i'm

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.370 
better anytime suit especially since i'm
actually<00:06:58.510> using<00:06:58.720> a<00:06:59.080> screen<00:06:59.320> capture<00:06:59.620> tool<00:06:59.800> so

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
actually using a screen capture tool so

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.470 
actually using a screen capture tool so
that's<00:07:02.380> obviously<00:07:02.560> taking<00:07:03.310> some<00:07:03.550> ram<00:07:04.120> away

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:04.480 
that's obviously taking some ram away

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.560 
that's obviously taking some ram away
from<00:07:04.950> running<00:07:05.950> this<00:07:06.010> properly<00:07:06.550> but<00:07:07.390> if<00:07:07.480> you

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
from running this properly but if you

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.650 
from running this properly but if you
wanted<00:07:07.870> to<00:07:07.960> actually<00:07:08.110> test<00:07:08.650> the<00:07:08.770> map<00:07:09.030> but<00:07:10.030> you

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660 
wanted to actually test the map but you

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.170 
wanted to actually test the map but you
have<00:07:10.810> an<00:07:10.930> emulator<00:07:11.410> or<00:07:11.530> any<00:07:11.890> kind<00:07:12.190> of<00:07:12.400> any

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
have an emulator or any kind of any

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.150 
have an emulator or any kind of any
emulator<00:07:13.990> going<00:07:14.290> you<00:07:14.380> can<00:07:14.500> actually<00:07:14.770> test<00:07:14.950> out

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 
emulator going you can actually test out

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.700 
emulator going you can actually test out
your<00:07:15.190> apps<00:07:15.520> in<00:07:15.730> the<00:07:15.820> emulator<00:07:16.270> before<00:07:16.720> you<00:07:16.900> go

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710 
your apps in the emulator before you go

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.940 
your apps in the emulator before you go
and<00:07:19.440> publish<00:07:20.440> it<00:07:20.620> to<00:07:20.650> the<00:07:21.190> android<00:07:21.550> market<00:07:22.950> ok

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:23.950 
and publish it to the android market ok

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.240 
and publish it to the android market ok
so<00:07:24.610> that's<00:07:25.390> the<00:07:25.570> end<00:07:25.690> of<00:07:25.810> this<00:07:25.930> tutorial<00:07:26.250> just

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
so that's the end of this tutorial just

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.740 
so that's the end of this tutorial just
pretty<00:07:27.700> much<00:07:27.790> how<00:07:28.030> to<00:07:28.090> get<00:07:28.270> an<00:07:28.390> emulator

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
pretty much how to get an emulator

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.350 
pretty much how to get an emulator
running<00:07:28.990> and<00:07:29.730> probably<00:07:30.730> next<00:07:30.970> time<00:07:31.180> we're

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 
running and probably next time we're

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.510 
running and probably next time we're
gonna<00:07:32.670> build<00:07:33.670> a<00:07:33.880> signage<00:07:34.390> in<00:07:34.570> mandra<00:07:35.100> and<00:07:36.100> then

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 
gonna build a signage in mandra and then

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.880 
gonna build a signage in mandra and then
have<00:07:36.760> it<00:07:36.790> running<00:07:37.060> in<00:07:37.240> the<00:07:37.360> emulator<00:07:37.800> so<00:07:38.800> you

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:38.890 
have it running in the emulator so you

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.980 
have it running in the emulator so you
can<00:07:39.010> actually<00:07:39.160> see<00:07:39.580> what<00:07:40.150> it's<00:07:40.300> like<00:07:40.420> to<00:07:40.690> build

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
can actually see what it's like to build

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.960 
can actually see what it's like to build
and<00:07:41.320> test<00:07:41.860> it<00:07:42.040> out<00:07:42.070> make<00:07:42.130> sure<00:07:42.370> that<00:07:42.700> it<00:07:42.850> runs

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:42.970 
and test it out make sure that it runs

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.790 
and test it out make sure that it runs
ok<00:07:44.970> now<00:07:45.970> we'll<00:07:46.120> be<00:07:46.270> using<00:07:46.480> Ubuntu<00:07:47.470> for<00:07:47.680> that

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800 
ok now we'll be using Ubuntu for that

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.130 
ok now we'll be using Ubuntu for that
because<00:07:47.980> i<00:07:48.420> personally<00:07:49.420> like<00:07:49.600> building<00:07:50.050> in

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:50.140 
because i personally like building in

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.090 
because i personally like building in
the<00:07:50.230> butt<00:07:50.380> too<00:07:50.530> all<00:07:51.520> right<00:07:51.670> check
