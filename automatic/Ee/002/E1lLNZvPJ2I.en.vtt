00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.980
 digital SLR camera and we 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.619

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.260
 see the camera itself 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.520
 which consists of two main parts 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:45.870
 besides that we have a strap 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.500
 battery cords connect to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.780

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.070
 the charger that is what 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.390
 camera operation 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.059
 First of all, the lens is standard 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.460
 triple lens optical system 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.860
 stabilization for what we need in short 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.560
 I will say you need it when you shoot in 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 indoors evening time 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.170
 night time or if you're on

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.420

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.350
 by means of such a ring 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.750
 you see two markers position a friend 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.110
 against a friend and fix accordingly 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.250
 camera lens on camera 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.820
 we see buttons controls 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.220
 which allow you to more accurately adjust 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:51.510
