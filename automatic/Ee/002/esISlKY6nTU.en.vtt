mister<00:01:53.369> I'm<00:01:54.330> adding<00:01:54.959> them<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.500> four<00:01:55.890> times<00:01:56.160> of

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
mister I'm adding them in four times of

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.880 
mister I'm adding them in four times of
additions<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.170> beginning<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.679> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
additions and in the beginning of the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.309 
additions and in the beginning of the
addition<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.819> dough<00:02:00.000> may<00:02:00.300> not<00:02:00.569> combine<00:02:01.020> well

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
addition the dough may not combine well

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.710 
addition the dough may not combine well
and<00:02:01.619> looks<00:02:02.039> like<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.880> will<00:02:03.030> not<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.599> be

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
and looks like there will not really be

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.740 
and looks like there will not really be
joining<00:02:04.679> together<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.429> just<00:02:05.789> keep<00:02:06.030> mixing<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
joining together but just keep mixing it

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.120 
joining together but just keep mixing it
until<00:02:07.039> they<00:02:08.039> come<00:02:08.520> together<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:10.130> thick

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130

until they come together as a one thick
batter<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> quiet<00:02:13.170> heavy<00:02:13.620> work<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.370> do

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
batter it is a quiet heavy work to do

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.000 
batter it is a quiet heavy work to do
this<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.300> may<00:02:15.480> need<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.780> strong<00:02:16.200> arm<00:02:16.380> for

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
this and you may need a strong arm for

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.070 
this and you may need a strong arm for
this<00:02:17.160> but<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.360> quite<00:02:18.720> fun<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.680> make<00:02:19.860> this

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
this but it is quite fun to make this

this<00:02:27.930> one<00:02:28.230> pipe<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.550> way<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.180> will<00:02:30.300> make

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
this one pipe in this way we will make

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.250 
this one pipe in this way we will make
this<00:02:30.810> one<00:02:31.170> looks<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:32.400> more<00:02:32.790> natural<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.660> it
