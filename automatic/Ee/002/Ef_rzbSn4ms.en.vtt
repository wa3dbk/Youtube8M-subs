done that because very occasionally when

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.020 
done that because very occasionally when
you<00:00:12.080> put<00:00:12.290> a<00:00:12.320> full<00:00:12.559> top<00:00:12.860> on<00:00:13.160> an<00:00:13.490> empty<00:00:13.669> bottom

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.759 
you put a full top on an empty bottom
and<00:00:14.179> this<00:00:14.240> is<00:00:14.299> the<00:00:14.419> empty<00:00:14.660> bottom<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.589> whole

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
and this is the empty bottom the whole

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.130 
and this is the empty bottom the whole
the<00:00:16.280> whole<00:00:16.490> hive<00:00:16.760> just<00:00:16.789> slumps<00:00:17.539> and<00:00:17.690> falls<00:00:17.960> in

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
the whole hive just slumps and falls in

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.080 
the whole hive just slumps and falls in
the<00:00:18.200> bottom<00:00:18.500> and<00:00:18.650> that's<00:00:18.770> disastrous<00:00:19.190> this

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
the bottom and that's disastrous this

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.640 
the bottom and that's disastrous this
actually<00:00:20.510> gives<00:00:20.720> it<00:00:20.780> a<00:00:20.870> bit<00:00:20.960> of<00:00:21.020> support<00:00:21.260> and

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
actually gives it a bit of support and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.560 
actually gives it a bit of support and
stops<00:00:21.890> that<00:00:22.040> from<00:00:22.070> happening<00:00:22.340> now<00:00:23.270> you<00:00:23.330> will

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
it one thing about this top is this is a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.100 
it one thing about this top is this is a
hive<00:00:38.930> that<00:00:38.960> died<00:00:39.380> so<00:00:40.250> there<00:00:40.810> we<00:00:41.810> like<00:00:41.960> to

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
hive that died so there we like to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.720 
hive that died so there we like to
recycle<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.620> boxes<00:00:42.950> because<00:00:43.130> the<00:00:43.220> boxes<00:00:43.520> cost

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
recycle the boxes because the boxes cost

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.170 
recycle the boxes because the boxes cost
me<00:00:43.850> about<00:00:43.940> $60<00:00:44.600> each<00:00:44.810> so<00:00:45.590> with<00:00:46.250> this<00:00:46.430> hive<00:00:46.970> the

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
me about $60 each so with this hive the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.880 
me about $60 each so with this hive the
bees<00:00:47.360> have<00:00:47.540> already<00:00:47.870> really<00:00:48.290> rezoned<00:00:48.650> it<00:00:48.739> up

it it's embarrassingly easy so I've seen
people<00:01:55.459> have<00:01:55.639> a<00:01:55.700> hive<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:56.119> never<00:01:56.299> split<00:01:56.539> it

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
people have a hive and never split it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.199 
people have a hive and never split it

straightforward it is this is something

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.550 
straightforward it is this is something
that<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.539> really<00:02:08.810> should<00:02:08.959> have<00:02:08.990> a<00:02:09.110> go<00:02:09.259> at<00:02:09.410> if

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
that you really should have a go at if

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
you have your own native bee hive what

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.809 
you have your own native bee hive what
we're<00:02:11.720> going<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.930> do<00:02:12.049> now<00:02:12.230> is<00:02:12.620> separate<00:02:13.340> this

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
we're going to do now is separate this

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:22.750 
we're going to do now is separate this
hive<00:02:17.379> is<00:02:18.379> this<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.129> a<00:02:19.189> 30<00:02:19.430> second<00:02:19.819> job<00:02:21.760> if

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
hive is this is a 30 second job if

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.660 
hive is this is a 30 second job if
normally<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.269> egg<00:02:23.390> mass<00:02:23.599> pulls<00:02:23.900> away

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
normally the egg mass pulls away

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:36.850 
normally the egg mass pulls away
knife<00:02:25.670> please<00:02:34.060> okay<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.629> if<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.170> look<00:02:36.319> at<00:02:36.409> if

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
knife please okay so if you look at if

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.770 
knife please okay so if you look at if
you<00:02:37.010> look<00:02:37.129> at<00:02:37.219> this<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:38.209> see<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.659> egg

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
you look at this you can see the egg

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.380 
you look at this you can see the egg
mass<00:02:39.019> egg<00:02:39.709> mass<00:02:40.069> is<00:02:40.280> absolutely<00:02:40.969> critical<00:02:41.329> and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
mass egg mass is absolutely critical and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.850 
mass egg mass is absolutely critical and
you<00:02:41.480> can<00:02:41.599> see<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.870> Queen<00:02:42.110> cells<00:02:42.469> look<00:02:42.769> at

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
you can see the Queen cells look at

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.979 
you can see the Queen cells look at
those<00:02:42.980> bigger<00:02:43.250> eggs<00:02:43.459> they're<00:02:43.760> their<00:02:44.689> Queen

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
those bigger eggs they're their Queen

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.199 
those bigger eggs they're their Queen
cells<00:02:45.349> so<00:02:45.769> lots<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.430> lots<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.670> Queen<00:02:46.909> cells

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
cells so lots and lots of Queen cells

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.600 
cells so lots and lots of Queen cells
this<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.049> one<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.010> think<00:02:49.129> we're<00:02:49.430> going<00:02:49.549> to

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
this is one that I think we're going to

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.339 
this is one that I think we're going to
put<00:02:49.730> another<00:02:49.939> strip<00:02:50.360> across<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.140> middle

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
put another strip across the middle

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.750 
put another strip across the middle
because<00:02:51.469> this<00:02:51.769> is<00:02:51.920> going<00:02:52.069> to<00:02:52.159> fall<00:02:52.340> otherwise

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
because this is going to fall otherwise

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.149 
because this is going to fall otherwise
so<00:02:53.569> I<00:02:53.599> don't<00:02:53.930> want<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:54.200> egg<00:02:54.439> mass<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.799> fall<00:02:55.010> on

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
so I don't want this egg mass to fall on

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.770 
so I don't want this egg mass to fall on
the<00:02:55.250> bottom<00:02:55.549> so<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.239> bees<00:02:56.420> are<00:02:56.569> just<00:02:56.629> gonna

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
the bottom so the bees are just gonna

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.319 
the bottom so the bees are just gonna
have<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:56.989> work<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.200> out<00:02:57.500> okay<00:02:57.920> now<00:02:58.489> we're

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
have to work this out okay now we're

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:00.970 
have to work this out okay now we're
going<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.510> see<00:02:59.719> all<00:02:59.750> these<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.439> this<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:00.859> to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
going to see all these and this is to

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.839 
going to see all these and this is to
stop<00:03:01.269> any<00:03:02.269> insect<00:03:02.750> tests<00:03:03.170> having<00:03:04.159> a<00:03:04.250> go<00:03:04.400> and

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
stop any insect tests having a go and

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.429 
stop any insect tests having a go and
now<00:03:05.000> we're<00:03:05.150> going<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.390> go<00:03:05.510> around<00:03:05.629> it<00:03:06.049> because

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
now we're going to go around it because

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.610 
now we're going to go around it because
very<00:03:07.310> occasionally<00:03:08.120> this<00:03:08.420> gets<00:03:08.689> dropped<00:03:08.959> so

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
very occasionally this gets dropped so

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.319 
very occasionally this gets dropped so
now<00:03:09.799> I<00:03:09.829> can<00:03:10.099> actually<00:03:10.219> remove<00:03:10.730> this<00:03:10.939> this<00:03:11.180> is

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
now I can actually remove this this is

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.000 
now I can actually remove this this is
going<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.599> be<00:03:11.689> the<00:03:11.780> hide<00:03:11.959> who<00:03:12.439> goes<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.799> another

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
going to be the hide who goes to another

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:25.430 
going to be the hide who goes to another
