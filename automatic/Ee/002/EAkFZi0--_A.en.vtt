felt like I had to do something but

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.030 
felt like I had to do something but
since<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.360> war<00:02:10.539> was<00:02:10.750> going<00:02:11.050> on<00:02:11.170> back<00:02:11.440> home<00:02:11.680> but

since the war was going on back home but
there<00:02:12.459> was<00:02:12.580> no<00:02:12.730> way<00:02:12.880> for<00:02:12.940> me<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.270> do<00:02:13.540> anything

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.479 
just feel like there's nothing you can
do<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.720> decided<00:02:20.379> that<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.950> really<00:02:21.040> wanted<00:02:21.370> to
