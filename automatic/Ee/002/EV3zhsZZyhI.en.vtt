00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
it apart to what the actual how it's

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.280 
it apart to what the actual how it's
made<00:01:00.660> how<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.860> better<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:03.290> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
made how to make it better and the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.890 
made how to make it better and the
biggest<00:01:04.650> difficulty<00:01:05.160> for<00:01:05.550> me<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:06.630> from

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
biggest difficulty for me is going from

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.520 
biggest difficulty for me is going from
a<00:01:07.230> design<00:01:07.620> world<00:01:08.240> conceptual<00:01:09.240> world<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.900> how

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
a design world conceptual world to how

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:45.800 
a design world conceptual world to how
will<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.770> actually<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:11.310> made

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.750 

so<00:01:46.380> after<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.799> tool<00:01:46.979> takes<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.400> world<00:01:47.580> by

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
so after the tool takes the world by

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.640 
so after the tool takes the world by
storm<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.450> some<00:01:48.900> other<00:01:49.049> ideas<00:01:49.440> how

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
storm you have some other ideas how

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.980 
storm you have some other ideas how
