00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
there you go the calculator itself is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.119 
there you go the calculator itself is
lighter<00:00:58.050> than<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:58.980> stock

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
lighter than what we have in stock

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.770 
lighter than what we have in stock
Android<00:00:59.520> but<00:00:59.670> it's<00:00:59.789> basically<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.270> calculator

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
Android but it's basically a calculator

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.270 
Android but it's basically a calculator
no<00:01:00.960> no<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:01.469> cares<00:01:01.710> about<00:01:01.770> regular

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
no no and it really cares about regular

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.219 
no no and it really cares about regular
it<00:01:02.609> functions<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> other<00:01:04.080> one

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
it functions just like the other one

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.109 
it functions just like the other one
does<00:01:04.409> move<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> gallery<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.000> this

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
does move on to the gallery and this

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.310 
does move on to the gallery and this
looks<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.450> little<00:01:06.570> bit<00:01:06.750> different<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.200> well

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
looks a little bit different as well

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
did actually take this picture using the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.780

camera<00:01:12.659> with<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.920> ROM<00:01:14.159> installed<00:01:14.580> so

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
camera with with this ROM installed so

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.609 
camera with with this ROM installed so
it<00:01:14.909> does<00:01:15.090> work<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.600> port<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.320> Nexus

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619

background is moving very minimalistic
and<00:02:42.359> a<00:02:42.629> nice<00:02:42.840> feel<00:02:43.109> I<00:02:43.200> don't<00:02:43.409> know<00:02:43.470> if<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.620> can

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
and a nice feel I don't know if you can

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.319 
and a nice feel I don't know if you can
see<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.069> but<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> kind<00:02:44.579> of<00:02:44.670> edges<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.209> the

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
see this but the kind of edges of the

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.330 
see this but the kind of edges of the
app<00:02:45.510> are<00:02:45.840> kind<00:02:46.109> of<00:02:46.200> curved<00:02:46.530> instead<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.190> just

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
app are kind of curved instead of just

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.580 
app are kind of curved instead of just
rectangular<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.269> that's<00:02:49.200> kind<00:02:49.530> of

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
rectangular so that's kind of

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.460 
rectangular so that's kind of
interesting<00:02:49.829> as<00:02:50.190> well<00:02:50.540> if<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:51.720> move<00:02:51.930> into<00:02:52.139> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
interesting as well if we move into the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.589 
interesting as well if we move into the
phone<00:02:52.769> app<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.579> see<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.239> again

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
phone app you can see this is again

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.479

other stuff we'll just cancel that

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.009 
other stuff we'll just cancel that
before<00:03:26.970> somebody<00:03:27.209> picks<00:03:27.389> up<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.690> note<00:03:27.840> that

before somebody picks up and note that

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.199

transition<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.590> was<00:03:28.889> very<00:03:29.159> I<00:03:29.310> oh<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.699> see<00:03:30.030> I

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
transition that was very I oh I see I

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.000 
transition that was very I oh I see I
think<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.870> transition<00:03:31.440> was<00:03:31.590> basically

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
think that transition was basically

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.159 
think that transition was basically
taken<00:03:32.430> directly<00:03:32.879> out<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.239> iOS<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:33.959> see
