00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 a little orientation video 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.649
 different because I did not find the basis of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.920
 my tripod then I'm grabbing the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.110
 camera of my cell phone with another base chair 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.860
 I'm going to make a video to guide 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.110
 all those kids who want 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.529
 start skating either on longboard 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.810
 in skateboarding and they have the doubt of good 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.970
 that the longboard suits me because there are 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.910
 too many brands too many models 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.000
 too many styles sizes prices 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.030
 then this video I hope you help them 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.840
 and give them a clear idea that they can 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.350
 this buy to do what you 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.260
 want to do ok 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.539
 I want to learn to skate I want my 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.930
 first longboard and the only thing I want 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.870
 is to transport me the longboard me 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.430
 you recommend is what they always tell me 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.769
 friend friend then the only thing that I can you 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.190
 recommend is that you buy what you 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.409
 like it because your margin is very broad 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.509
 then if you just want to transport yourself 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.130
 from a point to a point b comfortably or 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.720
 or maybe that uncomfortably or whatever 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.380
 good you must take into account two 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.509
 aspects the first one is going to be the size 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.580
 transport you in a long table like this 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.190
 like this one that has a little more than 40 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 inches long on a table like this 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.760
 very long is a little more comfortable 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.520
 transport you 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.290
 and the cons of such a long table 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.600
 is that it's too lumpy to too much 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.040
 surface and where you keep them by 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.750
 example if you're going to work you should 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.550
 leave the stop at a specific place 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.540
 because you can not save it under your 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.820
 desk or if you go to college that 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.570
 It is not much table 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.960
 and also a very long table its curves 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 his turns are going to be not so closed but 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.910
 it's going to take a little longer to do the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.880
 turn then if you want to transport 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.440
 in the city with a long table and by 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.070
 example there are people that when the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.959
 traffic of 23 rows of cars there are people 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.640
 that is put to six aguiar between the 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.370
 cars if you can safely 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.900
 while in red and the entire row of 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.390
 cars is there not if it can be done 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.030
 but in a very very long table like 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.739
 This is going to be a bit more difficult because 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.270
 the turns are very very open or 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.920
 you have to do so to turn 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.770
 no matter how tight or what 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.110
 so weak are your tricks instead 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.560
 you want to transport 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.830
 and be a little more agile you can choose 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.950
 a shorter table like this one that I have 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.260
 here it does not matter which brand does not matter what 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.240
 that is you want to transport 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.940
 you can use this one that is a little more this 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:00.410
 short this is a the hellraiser swing 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.300
 great racing which this time if 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.150
 they realize it is very very small then 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.580
 it's a little easier to keep a 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.940
 little bit easier to maneuver because 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:15.500
 the curves that a small table makes 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:18.020
 then they are more this more closed can 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.290
 keep surfing between the cars that 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.930
 they stand on the street without problem 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.420
 because it is short you can get 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.490
 easily instead a very long table 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.220
 Well, not the only detail is also 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.420
 that very very short tables like the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.330
 crosses so penny type or similar this 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.670
 Well, you do not have a lot of surface and 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.240
 me in my case is very uncomfortable because the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.090
 foot for example I get it hangs me like this and 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.730
 I do not like it then, I always 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.980
 to make this transport cross 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.900
 I always look for something neither too small nor too 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.500
 long something medium then you can use 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.989
 this can be if only if you only go to 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.780
 transport does not need to have theo 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.459
 you do not have to have with game that 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.670
 have flyers does not matter the brand does not 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.069
 matter the material simply 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.440
 you can transport you have the options 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.810
 buy a rigid one that is a little bit more 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.299
 stable to go fast or you can 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.209
 buy yourself a flexible that are bamboo 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.500
 or fiberglass and then those are going to 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.860
 absorb a little bit more 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.800
 road irregularities have another 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.990
 feeling and it's also from me I do not 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.580
 I like both the flexible ones but it's called 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.040
 get used to the rigid ones but there you can 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.230
 goes to taste then for all 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.610
 friends who want to start 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.520
 skate and do not know what 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.469
 if its only purpose is transport only 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.259
 buy what they want what they want 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:47.639
 reach what you like that is small 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.310
 make it big no matter what it is 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:53.909
 medium does not matter in this much that 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.750
 three are going to have the wheels yes 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:59.790
 it can vary and it is important to know that 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.370
 small wheels 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.430
 have higher acceleration or can you 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.760
 start moving faster without so much 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.800
 effort but in distances are not going to 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.650
 keep up speed so you're going to 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.370
 tire if you're going to accelerate fast from 0 to 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.190
 10 kilometers for example but this one 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.220
 will cost instead in a wheeled 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.330
 a little taller than 70 millimeters 75 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.250
 millimeters high 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.349
 many people say to and you do not have less 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.610
 acceleration but if it's almost 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:34.030
 imperceptible that you will not have 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.789
 acceleration at the beginning but what's important 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.280
 is that bigger wheels are going to keep 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.639
 for more time the speed that you already 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.009
 you have generated then this are for 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:48.449
 say it faster but it also has 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.449
 a lot to see your bearings 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.000
 and your ability also strength with the 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.730
 that drives you if nothing else but that's the 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.610
 point that I want to highlight please 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.580
 for all those who ask me this advice 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.220
 and hey they recommend a friend table if 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.740
 you are only going to transport get what 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.810
 that you want in another video I'm going to 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.570
 explain then if you want to do 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.849
 slides downhill rap tricks is what 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.039
 what table should you look for 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:20.409
 and chords that also tastes 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.689
 they break genres but for transport 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:26.139
 choose the one you want, just guide you in 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:29.020
 that I already mentioned the size this and 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.809
 wheels and ready with that you're going to have 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.729
 to be able to start learning already 

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:35.349
 you want to do slides let's talk about 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.830
 another topic but this will be in another video 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.830
 comes out
