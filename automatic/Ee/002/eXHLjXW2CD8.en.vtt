looking at the ocz agility for now if
you<00:00:13.200> remember<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.500> couple<00:00:13.679> months<00:00:13.950> ago<00:00:14.130> I

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
you remember a couple months ago I

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.529 
you remember a couple months ago I
reviewed<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.570> vertex<00:00:16.470> 4<00:00:16.920> from<00:00:17.250> ocz<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.150> a

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
reviewed the vertex 4 from ocz it's a

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.560 
reviewed the vertex 4 from ocz it's a
great<00:00:18.900> high<00:00:19.640> performance<00:00:20.640> solid-state<00:00:21.270> drive

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.150 
great high performance solid-state drive
especially<00:00:21.810> if<00:00:22.320> you're<00:00:22.710> doing<00:00:23.010> something

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
especially if you're doing something

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.929 
especially if you're doing something
like<00:00:23.460> video<00:00:23.820> editing<00:00:24.330> graphics<00:00:24.869> processing

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
like video editing graphics processing

intensive gaming solid-state drive like
that<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.279> perfect<00:00:29.849> for<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.119> because<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.510> can

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that is perfect for you because it can

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
that is perfect for you because it can
sustain<00:00:30.869> those<00:00:31.560> very<00:00:31.949> high<00:00:32.279> read/write

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.690 
sustain those very high read/write
speeds<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.750> those<00:00:34.260> programs<00:00:34.829> may<00:00:35.160> require

now<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.719> course<00:00:36.960> if<00:00:37.110> you're<00:00:37.200> not<00:00:37.290> doing<00:00:37.500> that

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
now of course if you're not doing that

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.350 
now of course if you're not doing that
but<00:00:38.040> you're<00:00:38.129> doing<00:00:38.370> something<00:00:38.610> relatively

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
casual gaming you really don't need to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.630 
casual gaming you really don't need to
have<00:00:48.329> very<00:00:48.870> intensive<00:00:49.710> power<00:00:50.010> coming<00:00:50.370> from<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
state drive is going to give you a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.869 
state drive is going to give you a
performance<00:00:54.719> boost<00:00:55.199> over<00:00:55.800> spinning<00:00:56.370> media

performance boost over spinning media

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.880 
performance boost over spinning media
drives<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.710> those

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
drives now if you want one of those

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.410 
drives now if you want one of those
middle<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.520> road<00:00:59.699> drives<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
middle of the road drives and the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.660 
middle of the road drives and the
agility<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.410> perfect<00:01:02.160> one<00:01:02.370> for<00:01:02.399> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
agility for is the perfect one for you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.810 
agility for is the perfect one for you
it's<00:01:03.270> relatively<00:01:03.960> inexpensive<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.580> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it's relatively inexpensive and you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.420 
it's relatively inexpensive and you
don't<00:01:06.030> need<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.299> pay<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
don't need to pay out the but for a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.550 
don't need to pay out the but for a
solid<00:01:08.909> state<00:01:09.299> drive<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.720> mean<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.049> about<00:01:10.140> 200

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
solid state drive I mean it's about 200

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.530 
solid state drive I mean it's about 200
bucks<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.430> expensive<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.420> if

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
bucks so it's not that expensive but if

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.179 
bucks so it's not that expensive but if
you're<00:01:12.659> looking<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.170> compared<00:01:13.619> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you're looking at it compared to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.280 
you're looking at it compared to
spinning<00:01:15.000> immediate<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.930> pretty

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
spinning immediate as it is pretty

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.490 
spinning immediate as it is pretty
expensive<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.880> performance<00:01:18.750> gain<00:01:19.080> from

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
expensive but that performance gain from

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.440 
expensive but that performance gain from
it<00:01:19.979> being<00:01:20.369> relatively<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.030> little<00:01:21.210> bit<00:01:21.299> more

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
it being relatively a little bit more

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.800 
it being relatively a little bit more
expensive<00:01:21.840> kind<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.650> balances<00:01:23.250> itself<00:01:23.430> out

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
expensive kind of balances itself out

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
expensive kind of balances itself out
now<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> agility<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.220> great<00:01:26.580> for<00:01:26.880> those

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
now the agility for is great for those

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.420 
now the agility for is great for those

performance boost like this is going to
be<00:01:44.670> great<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.329> your<00:01:45.450> computer<00:01:46.049> now<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.799> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
be great for your computer now if you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.490 
be great for your computer now if you
want<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> look<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.149> results<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.140> have

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
want to look at the results that I have

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.950 
want to look at the results that I have
done<00:01:49.770> between<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.579> vertex<00:01:51.180> 4<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.869> the

done between the vertex 4 and the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.950 
done between the vertex 4 and the
agility<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.680> you'll<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.299> they're

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
agility for you'll see that they're

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.560 
agility for you'll see that they're
relatively<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.040> same<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:56.939> you're<00:01:57.060> looking<00:01:57.329> at

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
relatively the same if you're looking at

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.920 
relatively the same if you're looking at
data<00:01:58.200> speeds<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:59.490> example<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.119> agility<00:02:00.479> for

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
data speeds for example the agility for

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.209 
data speeds for example the agility for
has<00:02:01.340> 327<00:02:02.340> megabits<00:02:03.409> sequential<00:02:04.409> read<00:02:05.009> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
has 327 megabits sequential read and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.100 
has 327 megabits sequential read and
write<00:02:05.369> speeds<00:02:05.549> compared<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> vertex<00:02:06.719> 4<00:02:06.990> is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
write speeds compared to the vertex 4 is

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.309 
write speeds compared to the vertex 4 is
381<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.310> they're<00:02:08.429> pretty<00:02:08.849> comparable<00:02:09.390> there's

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
381 so they're pretty comparable there's

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.750 
381 so they're pretty comparable there's
only<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.560> little<00:02:10.770> bit<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.099> fall<00:02:11.370> off<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
only a little bit of fall off it

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.950 
only a little bit of fall off it
actually<00:02:11.849> gets

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
actually gets

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.190 
actually gets
a little<00:02:13.470> bit<00:02:13.620> under<00:02:14.550> those<00:02:14.970> writing<00:02:15.810> speeds

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
a little bit under those writing speeds

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.360 
a little bit under those writing speeds
as<00:02:16.410> well<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:16.980> see<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.250> they're

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
as well and you can see that they're

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.490 
as well and you can see that they're
pretty<00:02:17.700> much<00:02:18.050> comparable<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.290> really

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
pretty much comparable so you really

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.830 
pretty much comparable so you really
don't<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:20.000> worry<00:02:21.000> too<00:02:21.390> much<00:02:21.420> on

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
don't have to worry too much on

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.020 
don't have to worry too much on
downgrading<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.070> agility<00:02:23.340> for<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.880> not

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
downgrading to the agility for and not

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.820 
downgrading to the agility for and not
having<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.930> same<00:02:26.270> performance<00:02:27.530> values<00:02:28.530> that

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
having the same performance values that

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.060 
having the same performance values that
the<00:02:29.160> agility<00:02:30.090> series<00:02:30.630> gives<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.500> versus<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
the agility series gives you versus the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.060 
the agility series gives you versus the
vertex<00:02:32.580> series<00:02:33.210> now<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.650> vertex

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
vertex series now just like the vertex

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.550 
vertex series now just like the vertex
series<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.580> run<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> indie<00:02:36.900> licks<00:02:37.290> can

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.290 
series it is run on the indie licks can
indie<00:02:37.890> links<00:02:38.280> controller<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.820> guess<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.150> could

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
indie links controller I guess you could

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.570 
indie links controller I guess you could
say<00:02:39.480> always<00:02:40.290> been<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> tough<00:02:40.890> word<00:02:41.190> for<00:02:41.370> me<00:02:41.460> to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
say always been a tough word for me to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.750 
say always been a tough word for me to
say<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.720> runs<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.470> same<00:02:43.650> controller<00:02:44.040> they

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
say it runs on the same controller they

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.430 
say it runs on the same controller they
moved<00:02:45.090> off<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.330> sound<00:02:45.660> force<00:02:45.990> controllers

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
moved off the sound force controllers

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.080 
moved off the sound force controllers
because<00:02:46.680> they're<00:02:46.830> having<00:02:47.190> some<00:02:47.430> issues<00:02:47.880> but

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
because they're having some issues but

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.930 
because they're having some issues but
be<00:02:48.390> assured<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.720> agility<00:02:49.410> has<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.640> right

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
be assured that agility has the right

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.340 
be assured that agility has the right
controllers<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.600> won't<00:02:51.870> give<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.140> those

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
controllers that won't give you those

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.860 
controllers that won't give you those
errors<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.340> have<00:02:53.520> been<00:02:53.700> popping<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.240> in<00:02:54.420> most

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
errors that have been popping up in most

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.620 
errors that have been popping up in most
consumer<00:02:55.650> solid-state<00:02:56.370> drives<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.360> can

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
consumer solid-state drives now you can

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.050 
consumer solid-state drives now you can
use<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:57.990> with<00:02:58.200> both<00:02:58.410> windows<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.070> macs<00:02:59.760> and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
use this with both windows and macs and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.720 
use this with both windows and macs and
also<00:03:00.630> Linux<00:03:01.050> computers<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.710> you're<00:03:02.190> not<00:03:02.340> tied

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
also Linux computers so you're not tied

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.630 
also Linux computers so you're not tied
down<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.870> single<00:03:04.350> platform<00:03:04.800> with<00:03:05.340> solid

down to a single platform with solid
state<00:03:05.850> drives<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.630> are<00:03:06.750> with<00:03:06.870> any

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
state drives just like you are with any

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.180 
state drives just like you are with any
spinning<00:03:07.980> media<00:03:08.520> drive<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.210> a<00:03:09.740> 6g<00:03:10.740> drive<00:03:11.040> so

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
spinning media drive it is a 6g drive so

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.160 
spinning media drive it is a 6g drive so
you<00:03:11.310> put<00:03:11.460> it<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.790> set<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.180> three<00:03:12.480> porn<00:03:13.050> and

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
you put it in a set of three porn and

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.640 
you put it in a set of three porn and
get<00:03:13.290> those<00:03:13.650> sata3<00:03:14.430> sorry<00:03:15.420> sata3<00:03:15.960> connections

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
get those sata3 sorry sata3 connections

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.930 
get those sata3 sorry sata3 connections
with<00:03:17.690> around<00:03:19.190> what<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.340> should<00:03:20.400> be<00:03:20.760> getting

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
with around what you should be getting

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.570 
with around what you should be getting
on<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.300> SATA<00:03:21.840> 3<00:03:22.110> connection<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.560> that's<00:03:22.710> pretty

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
on a SATA 3 connection so that's pretty

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.970 
on a SATA 3 connection so that's pretty
good<00:03:23.730> there<00:03:24.030> as<00:03:24.270> well<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.630> that's<00:03:24.980> really

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
good there as well and that's really

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.660 
good there as well and that's really
kind<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.520> rounded<00:03:26.940> out<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.890> review<00:03:28.890> really

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
kind of rounded out this review really

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.640 
kind of rounded out this review really
of<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.150> agility<00:03:30.480> series<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.110> mean<00:03:31.260> it's<00:03:31.410> great

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
of the agility series I mean it's great

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.100 
of the agility series I mean it's great
for<00:03:31.860> anybody<00:03:32.100> who<00:03:32.760> wants<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.750> speed<00:03:34.020> up<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
gigabyte version but you could prove me

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.840 
gigabyte version but you could prove me
wrong<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.300> think<00:04:00.330> that<00:04:00.720> one<00:04:00.960> has<00:04:01.740> been<00:04:02.070> opted

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
wrong I think that one has been opted

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.900 
wrong I think that one has been opted
out<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.120> think<00:04:03.180> it's<00:04:03.360> only<00:04:03.450> 128<00:04:04.200> 256<00:04:04.650> 512<00:04:05.190> if

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
out so I think it's only 128 256 512 if

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.850 
out so I think it's only 128 256 512 if
I<00:04:06.450> remember<00:04:06.720> correctly<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.260> all<00:04:07.350> those<00:04:07.500> links
