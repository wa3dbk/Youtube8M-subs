think<00:04:28.890> one<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.430> reasons<00:04:29.610> is<00:04:30.060> I've<00:04:30.330> been

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
think one of the reasons is I've been

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.450 
think one of the reasons is I've been
out<00:04:30.570> here<00:04:30.600> for<00:04:30.960> six<00:04:31.260> seven<00:04:31.500> years<00:04:31.620> now<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.310> it

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
out here for six seven years now and it

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.580 
out here for six seven years now and it
takes<00:04:32.820> time<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.150> build<00:04:33.630> yourself<00:04:34.080> up<00:04:34.260> to<00:04:34.440> bull

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
takes time to build yourself up to bull

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.680 
takes time to build yourself up to bull
get<00:04:34.800> out<00:04:34.920> here<00:04:35.190> another<00:04:35.850> thing<00:04:36.150> is<00:04:36.300> equipment

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
get out here another thing is equipment

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.120 
get out here another thing is equipment
the<00:04:36.900> equipment's<00:04:37.320> changed<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.740> lot<00:04:37.920> in<00:04:37.950> the

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130

the equipment's changed a lot in the
last<00:04:38.190> couple<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.670> years<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:39.300> think<00:04:39.540> the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
last couple of years and I think the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.840 
last couple of years and I think the
equipment<00:04:40.140> right<00:04:40.740> now<00:04:40.920> is<00:04:41.160> helping<00:04:41.490> my<00:04:41.610> game
