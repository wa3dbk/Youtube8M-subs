opened<00:03:23.790> up<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.209> doors<00:03:24.420> for<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.840> lot<00:03:25.019> of

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
opened up the doors for a lot of

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.199 
opened up the doors for a lot of
different<00:03:25.230> tricks<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.920> personally<00:03:26.610> have<00:03:26.850> a

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
different tricks I personally have a

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.020 
different tricks I personally have a
size<00:03:27.420> 11<00:03:27.840> foot<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.620> maybe<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.700> could<00:03:29.880> be<00:03:30.000> a

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
size 11 foot so maybe it could be a

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.750 
size 11 foot so maybe it could be a
little<00:03:30.239> bit<00:03:30.420> wider<00:03:30.660> for<00:03:31.019> more<00:03:31.530> stability<00:03:31.860> also

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
little bit wider for more stability also

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.259 
little bit wider for more stability also
we're<00:03:33.600> on<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.780> flex<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.739> wait<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.670> weigh<00:03:35.850> 200

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
we're on a flex to I wait I weigh 200

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.210 
we're on a flex to I wait I weigh 200
pounds<00:03:36.300> so<00:03:37.170> it<00:03:37.260> probably<00:03:37.620> better<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.920> have

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
pounds so it probably better to have

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.490 
pounds so it probably better to have
eight<00:03:38.550> flex<00:03:38.850> one<00:03:39.180> but<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:39.720> does<00:03:39.900> come<00:03:40.140> in<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.290> one

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
eight flex one but it does come in a one

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.190 
eight flex one but it does come in a one
and<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:41.250> also<00:03:41.280> comes<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.880> flexing<00:03:42.360> three<00:03:42.600> you

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
