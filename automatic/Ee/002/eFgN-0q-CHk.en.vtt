firewire<00:00:47.319> interfaces<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.459> saffire<00:00:48.819> pro<00:00:48.850> 40

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
firewire interfaces the saffire pro 40

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.949 
firewire interfaces the saffire pro 40
so<00:00:50.079> it's<00:00:50.199> got<00:00:50.319> all<00:00:50.350> of<00:00:50.469> the<00:00:50.620> same<00:00:51.659> front<00:00:52.659> panel

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:52.959 
so it's got all of the same front panel

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:56.369 
so it's got all of the same front panel
design<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.940> also<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.329> same<00:00:55.569> back<00:00:55.839> panel<00:00:56.260> as

we've got extra room so we stuck the

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.289 
we've got extra room so we stuck the
word<00:01:07.299> clock<00:01:07.509> up<00:01:07.719> on<00:01:07.869> there<00:01:08.109> as<00:01:08.229> well

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
word clock up on there as well

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.779 
word clock up on there as well
so<00:01:10.899> you've<00:01:11.049> got<00:01:11.229> eight<00:01:11.549> Focusrite<00:01:12.549> Mouse

priests that we featuring in our entire

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.539 
priests that we featuring in our entire
interface<00:01:16.990> range<00:01:17.409> so<00:01:17.590> they're<00:01:17.799> really<00:01:18.340> well

can<00:01:29.649> actually<00:01:29.729> expand<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.850> interface<00:01:31.270> with

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
can actually expand the interface with

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:32.999 
can actually expand the interface with
