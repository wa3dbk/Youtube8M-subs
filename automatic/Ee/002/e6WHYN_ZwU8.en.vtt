from<00:04:32.800> 40<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.220> 50<00:04:33.670> was<00:04:33.820> because<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.800> noticed<00:04:35.800> that

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
from 40 to 50 was because I noticed that

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.870 
from 40 to 50 was because I noticed that
i<00:04:36.720> can<00:04:37.720> easily<00:04:37.960> do<00:04:38.320> 10<00:04:38.560> with<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.770> 40s<00:04:39.220> so<00:04:39.820> I

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
i can easily do 10 with the 40s so I

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.220 
i can easily do 10 with the 40s so I
said<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.180> know<00:04:40.210> what<00:04:40.300> let<00:04:40.570> me<00:04:40.600> go<00:04:40.780> up<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.020> wait

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
said you know what let me go up and wait

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.770 
said you know what let me go up and wait
but<00:04:42.100> as<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.310> was<00:04:42.340> doing<00:04:42.730> it<00:04:42.850> with<00:04:42.910> the<00:04:43.060> 50s<00:04:43.540> I

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
but as I was doing it with the 50s I

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.400 
but as I was doing it with the 50s I
also<00:04:44.230> realized<00:04:44.830> that<00:04:45.010> I<00:04:45.160> can<00:04:45.810> do<00:04:46.810> these<00:04:47.020> pretty

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
also realized that I can do these pretty

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.910 
also realized that I can do these pretty
easily<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:48.810> now<00:04:49.810> I<00:04:49.840> know<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.140> next<00:04:50.530> time<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.770> go

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
easily so now I know that next time I go

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.550 
easily so now I know that next time I go
I'm<00:04:51.460> gonna<00:04:51.820> have<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.090> increase<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.420> weight<00:04:52.720> so

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
I'm gonna have to increase the weight so

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.680 
I'm gonna have to increase the weight so

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
for smaller muscle groups like that but

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.530 
for smaller muscle groups like that but
because<00:05:46.360> i<00:05:46.660> was<00:05:46.900> doing<00:05:47.290> a<00:05:48.030> hard<00:05:49.030> chest<00:05:49.330> day

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540

today my triceps were ready extremely

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.740 
today my triceps were ready extremely
tight<00:05:52.290> so<00:05:53.290> I<00:05:53.740> felt<00:05:54.490> like<00:05:54.669> this<00:05:54.730> would<00:05:55.540> be<00:05:55.720> a

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
tight so I felt like this would be a

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.350 
tight so I felt like this would be a
perfect<00:05:56.050> number<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:57.070> also<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.880> way<00:05:58.060> it<00:05:58.120> was

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
perfect number and also the way it was

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.630 
perfect number and also the way it was
was<00:05:58.690> kind<00:05:58.750> of<00:05:58.990> heavy<00:05:59.169> so<00:05:59.860> now<00:06:00.040> we're<00:06:00.220> moving<00:06:00.370> on

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
was kind of heavy so now we're moving on

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.040 
was kind of heavy so now we're moving on

the<00:06:16.510> difference<00:06:17.050> with<00:06:18.010> dumbbells<00:06:18.580> in<00:06:18.990> my

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
the difference with dumbbells in my

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.590 
the difference with dumbbells in my
opinion<00:06:20.700> they're<00:06:21.700> a<00:06:21.730> little<00:06:21.970> bit<00:06:22.180> harder

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
opinion they're a little bit harder

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.570 
opinion they're a little bit harder
because<00:06:23.200> you<00:06:23.560> have<00:06:23.710> to<00:06:23.860> balance<00:06:24.130> the

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
because you have to balance the

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.150 
because you have to balance the
dumbbells<00:06:25.030> we're<00:06:25.330> on<00:06:25.570> a<00:06:25.630> cable<00:06:26.169> you<00:06:27.039> don't

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
dumbbells we're on a cable you don't

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.219 
dumbbells we're on a cable you don't
have<00:06:27.250> to<00:06:27.370> worry<00:06:27.580> about<00:06:27.729> that<00:06:27.910> and<00:06:28.330> you<00:06:29.050> can

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
have to worry about that and you can

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:30.750 
have to worry about that and you can
focus<00:06:29.500> a<00:06:29.770> little<00:06:29.860> bit<00:06:30.010> more<00:06:30.160> on<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.400> stretch

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
focus a little bit more on the stretch

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.410 
focus a little bit more on the stretch
