00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
research on it and I looked at quite a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.510

few different recipes and I've modified

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.970 
few different recipes and I've modified
it<00:00:16.730> to<00:00:17.240> suit<00:00:17.480> my<00:00:17.689> own<00:00:17.720> tastes<00:00:18.320> like<00:00:18.770> for

juice

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
juice

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.290 
juice
not<00:00:21.829> everybody<00:00:22.250> has<00:00:22.340> fresh<00:00:22.730> lemons<00:00:23.119> in<00:00:23.239> the

fridge but I figure most people have a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.310 
fridge but I figure most people have a
jar<00:00:25.099> of<00:00:25.189> pickles<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:25.700> that<00:00:26.360> substitute<00:00:26.989> works

would not cover it completely it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.249 
would not cover it completely it
probably<00:02:02.350> will<00:02:02.500> boil<00:02:02.710> over<00:02:03.069> if<00:02:03.190> you<00:02:03.340> do<00:02:04.259> you

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
probably will boil over if you do you

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.600 
probably will boil over if you do you
can<00:02:05.380> turn<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.679> heat<00:02:05.830> down<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:06.069> bit<00:02:06.310> for<00:02:06.520> this

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
can turn the heat down a bit for this

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.820 
can turn the heat down a bit for this
Jim<00:02:08.819> next<00:02:09.819> you<00:02:09.940> want<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:11.100> wash<00:02:12.100> trim<00:02:13.710> trim<00:02:14.710> the

Jim next you want to wash trim trim the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.120 
Jim next you want to wash trim trim the
ends<00:02:14.950> off<00:02:15.190> your<00:02:15.880> celery<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.750> then<00:02:17.620> chop<00:02:17.920> that

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
ends off your celery and then chop that

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.220 
ends off your celery and then chop that
up<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.640> how<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.819> do<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.270> with<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> celery<00:02:19.930> stalk

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
up and how I do that with a celery stalk

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.780 
up and how I do that with a celery stalk
is<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:21.310> cut<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:22.380> half<00:02:24.120> lengthwise<00:02:26.370> cut<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.490> again

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
is I cut it half lengthwise cut it again

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.890 
is I cut it half lengthwise cut it again
so<00:02:28.120> it's<00:02:28.300> basically<00:02:28.780> four<00:02:30.000> even<00:02:31.000> sized<00:02:31.300> or

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
so it's basically four even sized or

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.900 
so it's basically four even sized or
nearly<00:02:32.110> even<00:02:32.350> strips

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:49.949 

then<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.590> chop<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.620> fine<00:02:48.330> let's<00:02:49.330> pop<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:49.630> in

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
board just cut in half just to be

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.910 
board just cut in half just to be
absolutely<00:04:41.410> sure<00:04:44.310> okay<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:46.770> cut<00:04:47.770> it

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
absolutely sure okay so I cut it

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:56.580 
absolutely sure okay so I cut it
lengthwise<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:55.570> let's<00:04:55.750> take<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.020> look<00:04:56.290> at<00:04:56.410> that

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
lengthwise so let's take a look at that

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.460 
lengthwise so let's take a look at that
good<00:04:56.860> as<00:04:57.010> soon<00:04:57.450> as<00:04:58.450> you<00:04:58.630> can<00:04:58.780> see<00:04:59.050> it<00:04:59.320> is

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
good as soon as you can see it is

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.150 
good as soon as you can see it is
slightly<00:05:00.370> slightly<00:05:00.850> pink<00:05:01.390> in<00:05:01.630> one<00:05:02.470> spot<00:05:02.830> so

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
slightly slightly pink in one spot so

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.980 
slightly slightly pink in one spot so
I'm<00:05:03.280> gonna<00:05:03.580> let<00:05:03.760> that<00:05:03.790> go<00:05:04.240> for<00:05:04.480> another<00:05:04.630> three

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
I'm gonna let that go for another three

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.390 
I'm gonna let that go for another three
four<00:05:05.230> minutes<00:05:05.410> and<00:05:05.680> put<00:05:05.830> this<00:05:05.919> back<00:05:06.130> in<00:05:06.340> the

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
four minutes and put this back in the

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.530 
four minutes and put this back in the
boiling<00:05:06.700> water<00:05:08.610> so<00:05:09.610> it's<00:05:09.730> been<00:05:09.910> another<00:05:10.150> five

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
boiling water so it's been another five

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.120 
boiling water so it's been another five
minutes<00:05:10.960> I'm<00:05:11.110> guessing<00:05:11.500> it's<00:05:11.620> completely

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
minutes I'm guessing it's completely

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.250 
minutes I'm guessing it's completely
cooked<00:05:12.460> but<00:05:12.669> I<00:05:12.700> still<00:05:13.000> want<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.270> check<00:05:13.540> so<00:05:14.140> I'm

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
cooked but I still want to check so I'm

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.020 
cooked but I still want to check so I'm
going<00:05:14.410> to<00:05:14.500> take<00:05:14.650> the<00:05:14.860> part<00:05:15.160> that<00:05:15.430> has<00:05:15.550> not<00:05:15.790> been

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
going to take the part that has not been

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.240 
going to take the part that has not been
cut<00:05:16.330> up<00:05:16.360> because<00:05:17.200> if<00:05:17.350> I<00:05:17.470> look<00:05:17.710> at<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:17.950> one<00:05:18.100> that

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
cut up because if I look at the one that

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:28.320 
cut up because if I look at the one that
has<00:05:18.430> been<00:05:18.460> it's<00:05:19.030> absolutely<00:05:19.780> cooked<00:05:25.110> yes<00:05:27.330> so

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
has been it's absolutely cooked yes so

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.070 
has been it's absolutely cooked yes so
that's<00:05:28.419> fine<00:05:29.550> just<00:05:30.550> leave<00:05:30.730> it<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:30.910> cool<00:05:31.240> off

one thing I should say you know the

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.520 
one thing I should say you know the
advantage<00:06:15.640> of<00:06:15.790> boiling<00:06:16.540> chicken<00:06:16.810> for<00:06:17.140> this<00:06:17.290> is

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
advantage of boiling chicken for this is

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.660 
advantage of boiling chicken for this is
if<00:06:18.250> there<00:06:18.730> are<00:06:18.760> any<00:06:19.000> bacteria<00:06:19.930> on<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:21.220> chicken

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
if there are any bacteria on the chicken

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.140 
if there are any bacteria on the chicken
boiling<00:06:22.210> does<00:06:23.220> work<00:06:24.220> really<00:06:24.460> well<00:06:24.670> to<00:06:24.940> kill

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
boiling does work really well to kill

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.250 
boiling does work really well to kill
off<00:06:25.330> as<00:06:25.570> many<00:06:26.350> bacteria<00:06:26.980> as<00:06:27.100> possible<00:06:28.110> so<00:06:29.110> once

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
off as many bacteria as possible so once

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.430 
off as many bacteria as possible so once
I've<00:06:29.410> got<00:06:29.440> that<00:06:29.620> trimmed<00:06:30.960> just<00:06:31.960> take<00:06:32.230> your

sandwiches some of the thicker pieces

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
sandwiches some of the thicker pieces
may<00:06:53.470> need<00:06:53.800> to<00:06:53.950> be<00:06:54.070> cut<00:06:54.340> again<00:06:55.740> once<00:06:56.740> all<00:06:56.950> the

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
may need to be cut again once all the
