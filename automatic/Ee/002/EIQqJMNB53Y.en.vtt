00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.599 
know you for against animal circuses
animals<00:04:15.240> in<00:04:15.330> captivity<00:04:15.890> it's<00:04:16.890> complicated<00:04:17.489> in

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
animals in captivity it's complicated in

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.509 
animals in captivity it's complicated in
a<00:04:17.670> really<00:04:17.880> complicated<00:04:18.180> issue<00:04:18.480> I<00:04:18.720> think

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
a really complicated issue I think

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.650 
a really complicated issue I think
animals<00:04:20.519> belong<00:04:20.700> in<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.850> wild<00:04:21.000> that's<00:04:21.480> where

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
animals belong in the wild that's where

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.350 
animals belong in the wild that's where
they<00:04:21.750> should<00:04:21.810> be<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:23.550> big<00:04:23.940> problem<00:04:24.330> that

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
they should be and the big problem that

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.440 
they should be and the big problem that
we<00:04:24.510> have<00:04:24.840> isn't<00:04:25.410> actually<00:04:25.860> circuses<00:04:26.450> or

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
we have isn't actually circuses or

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.000 
we have isn't actually circuses or
animals<00:04:27.780> in<00:04:27.870> captivity<00:04:28.020> is<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.620> loss<00:04:28.830> of

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
animals in captivity is the loss of

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.600 
animals in captivity is the loss of
habitat<00:04:29.400> all<00:04:29.970> over<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.450> world<00:04:31.490> habitat<00:04:32.490> is

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
habitat all over the world habitat is

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.940 
habitat all over the world habitat is
vanishing<00:04:33.120> as<00:04:33.320> animals<00:04:34.320> come<00:04:34.590> into<00:04:34.770> conflict

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
vanishing as animals come into conflict

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.530 
vanishing as animals come into conflict
whether<00:04:35.400> they<00:04:35.550> have<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.670> burgeoning<00:04:35.910> human

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
whether they have a burgeoning human

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.780 
whether they have a burgeoning human
population<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:38.010> think<00:04:38.220> what<00:04:38.340> we<00:04:38.460> have<00:04:38.610> to

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
population and I think what we have to

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.730 
population and I think what we have to
do<00:04:38.910> is<00:04:39.060> learn<00:04:39.240> to<00:04:39.300> live<00:04:39.660> alongside<00:04:39.900> wildlife

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
do is learn to live alongside wildlife

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.460 
do is learn to live alongside wildlife
and<00:04:41.010> that's<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.250> very<00:04:41.430> difficult<00:04:41.669> thing<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.470> I

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
and that's a very difficult thing and I

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.560 
and that's a very difficult thing and I
believe<00:04:44.400> that's<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.640> ultimate<00:04:44.790> test<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.480> a

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
believe that's the ultimate test of a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.810 
believe that's the ultimate test of a
civilization<00:04:46.260> is<00:04:46.470> whether<00:04:47.070> or<00:04:47.250> not<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.669> can

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
civilization is whether or not you can

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.270 
civilization is whether or not you can
live<00:04:48.060> alongside<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.960> wild<00:04:49.230> animals<00:04:49.620> that

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
live alongside the wild animals that

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.430 
live alongside the wild animals that
occupy<00:04:50.760> that<00:04:50.940> space<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.540> that<00:04:51.900> that's<00:04:52.260> not

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
occupy that space and that that's not

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.290 
occupy that space and that that's not
just<00:04:52.550> having<00:04:53.550> them<00:04:53.669> there<00:04:53.700> so<00:04:54.030> what's<00:04:54.180> our

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
just having them there so what's our

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.610 
just having them there so what's our
having<00:04:54.480> them<00:04:54.600> there<00:04:54.750> in<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:54.990> way<00:04:55.169> that<00:04:55.440> you

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
having them there in a way that you

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.220 
having them there in a way that you
couldn't<00:04:55.830> coexist<00:04:56.070> without<00:04:56.960> conflict<00:04:57.960> and

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
couldn't coexist without conflict and

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.930 
couldn't coexist without conflict and
that's<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.530> very<00:04:58.800> difficult<00:04:59.040> thing<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.460> think

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
that's a very difficult thing to think

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.460 
that's a very difficult thing to think
but<00:05:00.090> do<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.210> think<00:05:00.360> sex<00:05:00.570> is<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:00.990> know<00:05:01.110> with

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
but do you think sex is you know with

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.680 
but do you think sex is you know with
animals<00:05:02.430> either<00:05:02.730> dying<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.330> is<00:05:03.419> that's<00:05:03.600> a

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
animals either dying it is that's a

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.909 
animals either dying it is that's a
natural<00:05:03.900> death<00:05:04.260> it's<00:05:04.470> just<00:05:04.650> inevitable

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
natural death it's just inevitable

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.380 
natural death it's just inevitable
that's<00:05:05.340> got<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.580> happen<00:05:05.820> in<00:05:05.940> this<00:05:06.000> day<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.300> age

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
that's got to happen in this day and age

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.390 
that's got to happen in this day and age
I<00:05:06.750> mean<00:05:07.380> my<00:05:07.500> heart<00:05:07.680> goes<00:05:07.830> nothing<00:05:08.100> because<00:05:08.310> he

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
I mean my heart goes nothing because he

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.980 
I mean my heart goes nothing because he
clearly<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.880> woman<00:05:08.970> absolutely<00:05:09.720> loves<00:05:09.870> her

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
clearly the woman absolutely loves her

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.500 
clearly the woman absolutely loves her
arms<00:05:10.230> well<00:05:10.410> exactly<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.160> as<00:05:12.030> she<00:05:12.210> said<00:05:12.390> you

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
arms well exactly and as she said you

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.850 
arms well exactly and as she said you
know<00:05:12.630> they'd<00:05:12.780> hired<00:05:13.080> somebody<00:05:13.470> who<00:05:13.710> was

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
know they'd hired somebody who was

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.500 
know they'd hired somebody who was
unscrupulous<00:05:14.460> but<00:05:14.640> I<00:05:14.880> think<00:05:15.150> at<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.330> end<00:05:15.360> of

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
unscrupulous but I think at the end of

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.610 
unscrupulous but I think at the end of
the<00:05:15.570> day<00:05:15.690> you<00:05:15.750> have<00:05:15.960> to<00:05:16.080> ask<00:05:16.290> what<00:05:16.440> do<00:05:16.560> you

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
the day you have to ask what do you

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.110 
the day you have to ask what do you
think<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.830> elephant<00:05:17.160> would<00:05:17.280> say<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:18.030> of

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
think the elephant would say and of

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.640 
think the elephant would say and of
course<00:05:18.270> elephants<00:05:18.660> as<00:05:18.810> we<00:05:18.930> know<00:05:19.110> are<00:05:19.260> social

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
course elephants as we know are social

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.680 
course elephants as we know are social
animals<00:05:19.800> with<00:05:20.310> tremendous<00:05:20.940> depth<00:05:21.450> of

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
animals with tremendous depth of

personality and feeling and it's just a

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.090 
personality and feeling and it's just a
