00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.339
 so resisted comments to the player review 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.589
 to the incredible to the human 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.760
 the manual former informer can do that 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.820
 think that is a beast but that is 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.180
 you have to look pointing to his map 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:19.920
 89 tempo 78 83 shoot and 85 for 61 82 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.320
 small working space right- hand borovikov 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.090
 three put it went with 170 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.590
 but I should still cost in the week 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.090
 go down and in actually 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.560
 four and a half games let's say nine 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.820
 She certainly did not score like that 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.590
 Bad example goes to his in 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.200
 games is pretty good too 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.870
 off high speed and up 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.770
 of course, higher up with 290 of course 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.270
 not to be considered 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.309
 also the ability from a bad one 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 graduation the best with the shooting power 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.570
 but with the attribute attributes was 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.800
 we say what makes for immanuel lie 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.780
 in the form of space 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 you have to say he is still 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.890
 strong as a bear the guy is just right 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.140
 is here that is forward in the square 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.789
 You will not get that from the way of the skin 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.510
 the references and thinking ahead 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.730
 and then I just blared away 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.989
 and tricks and you do not think so 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.320
 pretty much at 918 paces 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.380
 fast 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.670
 so if he is with a similarly strong 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.590
 player what to do one runs the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.210
 if necessary just leave so there is rarely 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.770
 player who is as fast as in the mini 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.720
 comes or as strong as emily goes 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.970
 that's why it is relatively difficult 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.530
 somehow so defend but the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.070
 100 managed but still very much 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.630
 heavy 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.400
 were to be statements and sixteen 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.890
 he does not have to say he's pretty bomb 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 everyone goes in has 84 graduation yes that 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.810
 get there 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.130
 you do not wait for everyone to go in there 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.049
 Many went in and gates were 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.950
 is all in the sixteen because of that is 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.140
 very good in any case 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.450
 This also had good trails and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.490
 good positional play low working data 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.750
 always said that and noticed 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.820
 you also that you always right on 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.570
 display and does not have any problems 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.430
 to be found at the back 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.140
 the gate was still really high 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.490
 degree of protection that is not because this time 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.840
 with the precision is then just times 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.329
 with strength and blasted the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.310
 Ballermann corners and nets and everything 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.479
 plus an advantage rico that is 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.860
 It basically does not matter which foot 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.450
 Of course you prefer this with the right one 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.950
 a little better but otherwise left 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.240
 that works fine too and his 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.680
 Ball control is actually whole 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.170
 cool so ballance vote on everyone 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.210
 fall still third and to insert however 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.129
 what does not an emanuel michael do ? 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.959
 well you have to say first that's it 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.610
 as always not so gailer and his 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.140
 best has 950 euro stand up that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.470
 you also notice short passes but go 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.330
 clear 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.770
 if he does something himself then 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.000
 he should be very critical 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.080
 therefore you should not take in 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.130
 but just customize it and then 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.610
 just make a shit somehow 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.040
 to let 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.280
 that works better and it shows 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.730
 me is extremely abnormal to me to negative 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.550
 So go the balance and scored in 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.100
 the games of 68 and so on and that notices 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.000
 So you can accept the ball and 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.220
 then quickly a game like that 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.090
 make and then but is difficult 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.870
 there again the direction 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
 that's a bit 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.550
 more complicated few because of the skill 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.470
 Of the year he probably will not 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.570
 more and so rough is from winter 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.280
 So dangerous situations surrounded 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.930
 is if I'm from two or three players m 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.310
 It's not his favorite situation 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.990
 but that's why it's at a tempo with his 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.580
 Strengthen your body quickly 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.010
 go and usually push the opponent away 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.340
 that the best variant so dribbling and 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.910
 but not so short tiki taka tiki taka 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.060
 So going back and forth with it is easy 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.510
 not if and what is really negative 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.090
 noticed is in principle design 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.950
 Designed that is a big problem 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.390
 Although I have already played in form he 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.550
 was good he was beasty also in be 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.570
 something of 90 or so potent or so 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.570
 provide that merkel that's 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.739
 clinician but i found that in shape now 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.080
 not really amazing 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.150
 at least not 150 or so would be better 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.590
 that's not why i would 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.060
 wait at your place him now 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.739
 buy so if he goes down to the end 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.230
 the week to wednesday then look 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.239
 how much does it cost if 80 km 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.260
 like to strike but more too 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.510
 not because that's not really 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.530
 worth because so much difference together 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.330
 unfortunately he does not have any form 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.440
 and that does in my eyes too 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.880
 actually pretty bad because if 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.190
 he is not no better than one in shape 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.140
 and in shape and then stop anyway 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.739
 That's pretty much 180 km 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.570
 crap 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.480
 Therefore, there are only for me 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.400
 emmanuel emenike at the end of an 80 of 10 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.799
 score thumbs to the side because of that 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.420
 is a bit critical, I got mine 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.420
 better hope so it is sometimes 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.269
 good actually in my eyes that has 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.280
 so its not really much better shape 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.900
 but what in the player review I 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.829
 Hope you liked it and then 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.670
 comes my comments one can do now 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.019
 should 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.220
 I would have a nice day and 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.220
 say temporarily, at least
