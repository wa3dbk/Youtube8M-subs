00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
is going to turn green and I was like

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.770 
is going to turn green and I was like
well<00:04:44.699> that's<00:04:44.820> not<00:04:45.090> gonna<00:04:45.210> work<00:04:45.449> because<00:04:45.599> my

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
well that's not gonna work because my

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.710 
well that's not gonna work because my
hair's<00:04:46.110> already<00:04:46.259> green<00:04:46.680> so<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:48.000> took<00:04:48.300> the

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
hair's already green so I took the

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.649 
hair's already green so I took the
chance<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:49.289> it<00:04:49.470> went<00:04:49.650> black<00:04:49.849> so<00:04:50.849> if<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:51.180> have

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
chance and it went black so if you have

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.080 
chance and it went black so if you have
green<00:04:51.990> hair<00:04:52.020> or<00:04:52.409> bleached<00:04:52.770> hair<00:04:53.099> I<00:04:53.370> guess<00:04:53.759> I

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
green hair or bleached hair I guess I

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.649 
green hair or bleached hair I guess I
would<00:04:54.240> recommend<00:04:54.690> using<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.169> clear-all

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
would recommend using the clear-all

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.149 
would recommend using the clear-all
