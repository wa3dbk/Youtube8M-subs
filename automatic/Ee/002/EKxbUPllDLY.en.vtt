have to put it to this these were

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.580 
have to put it to this these were
important<00:01:11.430> games<00:01:11.729> yes<00:01:12.150> because<00:01:12.479> they<00:01:13.320> really

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
important games yes because they really

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
important games yes because they really
gave<00:01:13.740> birth<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.369> idea<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.820> cutscenes<00:01:15.420> in

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
gave birth to the idea of cutscenes in

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.929 
gave birth to the idea of cutscenes in
games<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.100> gave<00:01:17.250> birth<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
games and then really gave birth to the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.120 
games and then really gave birth to the
idea<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.330> more<00:01:18.479> narrative<00:01:18.840> based<00:01:19.439> games<00:01:19.830> I

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
idea of more narrative based games I

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.280 
idea of more narrative based games I
guess<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.460> new<00:01:20.640> generation<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.509> designers<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
guess a new generation of designers and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.560 
guess a new generation of designers and
video<00:01:22.710> game<00:01:22.860> historians<00:01:23.520> comes<00:01:23.820> up<00:01:24.000> every<00:01:24.180> new

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
video game historians comes up every new

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.660 
video game historians comes up every new
console<00:01:25.110> cycle<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.799> maybe<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.340> got<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
console cycle so maybe you got to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
console cycle so maybe you got to
refresh<00:01:27.570> their<00:01:27.840> memories<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.380> stuff<00:01:28.590> like

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
refresh their memories with stuff like

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.590 
refresh their memories with stuff like
this<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.880> an<00:01:30.030> insufferable

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
this but this is an insufferable

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.990 
this but this is an insufferable
experience<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.500> series<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> QuickTime<00:01:32.369> events

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
experience a series of QuickTime events

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.910 
experience a series of QuickTime events
yeah<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.930> too<00:01:34.049> quick<00:01:34.409> even

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
yeah that are a little too quick even

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.880

for<00:01:35.250> me<00:01:35.549> I'm<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> skilled<00:01:36.509> game

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.980 

honestly<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:39.920> believe<00:01:39.950> that<00:01:40.550> it<00:01:40.670> was<00:01:40.940> Asian<00:01:41.600> to

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990
