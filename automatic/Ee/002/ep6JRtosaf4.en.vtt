was anticipating this for a while
because<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:27.000> been<00:00:27.210> quite<00:00:27.630> some<00:00:27.930> time<00:00:27.960> since

the<00:00:33.090> last<00:00:33.270> time<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.540> think<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.960> might<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.320> been

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the last time I think it might have been

the last time I think it might have been
Toriko<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.370> last<00:00:35.579> battle<00:00:35.969> series<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.480> an

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
pretty disappointing in many different

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.569 
pretty disappointing in many different
aspects<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.469> was<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.340> think

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
aspects because I was just like I think

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
enjoyable and exciting but what I got in

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.150 
enjoyable and exciting but what I got in
this<00:00:57.000> episode<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.780> content<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> was

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
this episode the content as for I was

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.220 
this episode the content as for I was
like<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> story<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.420> alright<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.020> was

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
like the story it was alright it was

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.130 
like the story it was alright it was
decent<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.760> production<00:01:03.149> qualities<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
decent but the production qualities and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.560 
decent but the production qualities and
all<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.040> aesthetics<00:01:05.610> around<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.270> just

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
all the aesthetics around it was just

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.730 
all the aesthetics around it was just
like<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.930> seems<00:01:07.049> as<00:01:07.260> though<00:01:07.380> Toei<00:01:07.560> animation

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
like it seems as though Toei animation

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.950 
like it seems as though Toei animation
just<00:01:08.369> did<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.670> care<00:01:09.000> about<00:01:09.030> putting<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.600> proper

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
just did not care about putting a proper

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.450 
just did not care about putting a proper
budget<00:01:10.110> into<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.650> because<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.159> first

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
budget into this because for first

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
budget into this because for first
episode<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.450> dropped<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> ball<00:01:13.080> for

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
episode they dropped the ball for

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.170 
episode they dropped the ball for
starters<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> art<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.430> animation<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:15.000> seems

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
starters the art and animation it seems

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.850 
starters the art and animation it seems
as<00:01:15.330> though<00:01:15.450> every<00:01:15.689> time<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:16.259> had<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> chance

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
as though every time they had a chance

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
as though every time they had a chance
they<00:01:17.100> went<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> still<00:01:17.850> frame<00:01:18.150> shot<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.750> was

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
they went for a still frame shot I was

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.450 
they went for a still frame shot I was
just<00:01:19.080> looking<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.530> something<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.280> some

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
just looking at something with some

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
just looking at something with some
dialogue<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.509> when<00:01:21.659> they<00:01:21.780> did<00:01:21.990> animated

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
dialogue and then when they did animated

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.950 
dialogue and then when they did animated
and<00:01:22.890> did<00:01:23.009> not<00:01:23.159> look<00:01:23.400> fluid<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.970> any<00:01:24.180> aspect<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and did not look fluid in any aspect it

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.749 
and did not look fluid in any aspect it
looked<00:01:25.110> very<00:01:25.140> choppy<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.460> honest<00:01:26.670> with

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
looked very choppy and to be honest with

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.039 
looked very choppy and to be honest with
you<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.000> certain<00:01:27.270> aspects<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> looked<00:01:27.930> as

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you in certain aspects it looked as

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.140 
you in certain aspects it looked as
though<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.680> almost<00:01:28.829> flash<00:01:29.220> animation<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
though it was almost flash animation it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
though it was almost flash animation it
seems<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:30.689> were<00:01:30.780> probably<00:01:31.140> trying<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
seems like they were probably trying to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
seems like they were probably trying to
go<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> more<00:01:32.610> kid<00:01:32.909> demographic<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.780> just

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
go for a more kid demographic that just

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.719 
go for a more kid demographic that just
really<00:01:34.470> wouldn't<00:01:34.710> care<00:01:35.009> about<00:01:35.040> any<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.610> those

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
really wouldn't care about any of those

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.819 
really wouldn't care about any of those
things<00:01:35.790> because<00:01:36.329> they<00:01:36.600> put<00:01:36.840> barely<00:01:37.350> any<00:01:37.530> money

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
things because they put barely any money

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.830 
things because they put barely any money
into<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> art<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> animation<00:01:39.060> was<00:01:39.600> just

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
into this the art and animation was just

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.960 
into this the art and animation was just
not<00:01:40.049> good<00:01:40.409> at<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.490> thinking<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
not good at all I was just thinking to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.700 
not good at all I was just thinking to
myself<00:01:42.000> half<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.630> time<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710

the<00:01:45.360> animate<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.780> something<00:01:46.049> I'll<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.259> like

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the animate is something I'll be like

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
why does it look this bad the beginning

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.060 
why does it look this bad the beginning
with<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> world<00:01:48.810> building<00:01:49.259> an<00:01:49.350> exposition<00:01:49.890> as

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
with the world building an exposition as

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.740 
with the world building an exposition as
to<00:01:50.220> what's<00:01:50.460> going<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> story<00:01:51.450> was

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.270 
to what's going on and the story was
pretty<00:01:52.049> interesting<00:01:52.590> finding<00:01:52.979> out<00:01:53.070> about

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
pretty interesting finding out about

that's come from I guess in another
world<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.270> something<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.049> they

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
