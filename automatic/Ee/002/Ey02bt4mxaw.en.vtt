00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
a Blissey it my I think it takes like

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.910 
a Blissey it my I think it takes like
half<00:03:02.680> in<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.370> rain<00:03:03.609> from<00:03:04.420> from<00:03:05.260> Blastoise

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.409 
confuse you're gonna always hit and
confuse<00:04:17.440> with<00:04:17.620> water<00:04:17.859> pulse<00:04:18.159> so<00:04:18.849> I<00:04:19.000> say<00:04:19.239> go

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
confuse with water pulse so I say go

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.240 
confuse with water pulse so I say go
with<00:04:19.539> water<00:04:19.780> pulse<00:04:20.079> you<00:04:20.590> might<00:04:20.799> get<00:04:20.949> a<00:04:20.979> lucky

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
with water pulse you might get a lucky

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.390 
with water pulse you might get a lucky
confusion<00:04:21.849> and<00:04:22.029> get<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:23.050> it<00:04:23.169> KO<00:04:23.349> on<00:04:23.560> something

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
confusion and get to it KO on something

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.330 
confusion and get to it KO on something
but<00:04:25.330> yeah<00:04:25.540> even<00:04:25.960> Ferrothorn<00:04:26.680> switching<00:04:27.130> into

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
but yeah even Ferrothorn switching into

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.040 
but yeah even Ferrothorn switching into
waterspout<00:04:27.910> even<00:04:28.330> if<00:04:28.419> it's<00:04:28.509> not<00:04:28.630> in<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.870> rain

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
waterspout even if it's not in the rain

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.320 
waterspout even if it's not in the rain
I'm<00:04:29.259> pretty<00:04:29.530> sure<00:04:29.830> with<00:04:30.340> this<00:04:30.550> Eevee<00:04:30.940> spread

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
I'm pretty sure with this Eevee spread

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.290 
I'm pretty sure with this Eevee spread
or<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.080> sphere<00:04:32.530> takes<00:04:32.889> Ferrothorn<00:04:33.520> out<00:04:33.759> like

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
or a sphere takes Ferrothorn out like

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.189 
or a sphere takes Ferrothorn out like
it's<00:04:34.449> nothing

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
it's nothing

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.370 
it's nothing
so<00:04:35.590> just<00:04:36.190> 252<00:04:36.810> actually<00:04:37.810> need<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:37.990> fix<00:04:38.169> these

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
so just 252 actually need to fix these

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.080 
so just 252 actually need to fix these
IVs<00:04:38.830> because<00:04:39.070> I<00:04:39.130> had<00:04:39.310> like<00:04:39.550> hidden<00:04:39.820> power

IVs because I had like hidden power

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.439 
IVs because I had like hidden power
something<00:04:40.600> on<00:04:40.780> there<00:04:41.190> but<00:04:42.190> yeah<00:04:42.340> 252<00:04:43.090> speed

doesn't matter I just put it in HP if

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.520 
doesn't matter I just put it in HP if
the<00:04:51.340> defense<00:04:51.639> is<00:04:51.759> pretty<00:04:52.120> much<00:04:52.240> equal<00:04:52.570> and

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
the defense is pretty much equal and

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.100 
the defense is pretty much equal and
it's<00:04:53.650> not<00:04:53.830> weak<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.280> rocks<00:04:54.520> or<00:04:54.789> whatever<00:04:55.110> and

it's not weak to rocks or whatever and
that's<00:04:56.740> pretty<00:04:57.010> much<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.250> set<00:04:57.699> it's<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:58.060> bulky

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
that's pretty much the set it's a bulky

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.159 
that's pretty much the set it's a bulky
a<00:04:58.840> very<00:04:59.770> dangerous<00:05:00.389> wall<00:05:01.389> breaker<00:05:01.750> pretty

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
a very dangerous wall breaker pretty

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.100 
a very dangerous wall breaker pretty
much<00:05:02.410> make<00:05:03.160> up<00:05:03.190> Blastoise<00:05:03.850> i<00:05:04.240> approve<00:05:04.600> its

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
much make up Blastoise i approve its

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.620 
much make up Blastoise i approve its
speed<00:05:05.530> is<00:05:05.710> a<00:05:05.740> little<00:05:06.190> disheartening<00:05:06.729> but<00:05:07.360> if

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
speed is a little disheartening but if

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.650 
speed is a little disheartening but if
you<00:05:07.810> run<00:05:08.370> Jolley<00:05:09.370> or<00:05:09.639> Tim<00:05:10.000> and<00:05:10.180> I<00:05:10.240> should<00:05:10.449> say

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
you run Jolley or Tim and I should say

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.110 
you run Jolley or Tim and I should say
timid<00:05:11.410> max<00:05:11.770> special<00:05:11.979> attack<00:05:12.370> max<00:05:12.639> speed<00:05:12.940> you

timid max special attack max speed you

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.110 
timid max special attack max speed you
can<00:05:13.270> out<00:05:13.419> speed<00:05:13.780> you<00:05:14.470> know<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.830> base<00:05:15.460> I<00:05:15.849> think

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
can out speed you know the base I think

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.620 
can out speed you know the base I think
it's<00:05:16.270> base<00:05:16.530> 90<00:05:17.910> uninvested<00:05:19.530> speed<00:05:20.530> tier<00:05:20.770> like

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
it's base 90 uninvested speed tier like

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.529 
it's base 90 uninvested speed tier like
adamant<00:05:22.630> Lucario<00:05:23.199> for<00:05:23.560> instance<00:05:23.889> so<00:05:24.639> yeah

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
adamant Lucario for instance so yeah

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.210 
adamant Lucario for instance so yeah
timid<00:05:26.080> and<00:05:26.229> plus<00:05:26.410> you're<00:05:26.710> gonna<00:05:26.800> out<00:05:26.979> speed

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
stuff before you take a hit and you can

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.790 
stuff before you take a hit and you can
waterspout<00:05:30.490> and<00:05:30.760> do<00:05:30.940> maximum<00:05:31.270> damage<00:05:31.449> so<00:05:32.289> that
