okay<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.469> stage<00:00:01.829> two<00:00:02.220> on<00:00:02.399> how<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.669> solve

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
okay this is stage two on how to solve

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.019 
okay this is stage two on how to solve
the<00:00:03.210> Rubik's<00:00:03.659> Cube<00:00:04.319> but<00:00:04.950> stage<00:00:05.400> two<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.850> all

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
the Rubik's Cube but stage two is all

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.650 
the Rubik's Cube but stage two is all
about<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.600> second<00:00:07.319> layer<00:00:07.529> here<00:00:08.330> all<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
about the second layer here all the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.140 
about the second layer here all the
colors<00:00:09.960> are<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.290> right<00:00:10.559> spot<00:00:10.590> on<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
colors are in the right spot on the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.870 
colors are in the right spot on the
second<00:00:12.690> layer<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.500> first<00:00:13.799> layer<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.370> I'm

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
second layer and the first layer so I'm

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.939 
second layer and the first layer so I'm
going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.179> show<00:00:15.420> how<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> do<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:17.180> so<00:00:18.949> I'm

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
going to show how to do that so I'm

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.870 
going to show how to do that so I'm
going<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> mix<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.670> up<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.140> solve<00:00:22.140> my<00:00:22.880> first

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
going to mix it up and solve my first

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.830 
going to mix it up and solve my first
layer<00:00:24.500> so<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.590> show<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.630> second<00:00:27.630> layer

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
layer so I can show you the second layer

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.530 
layer so I can show you the second layer
so<00:00:28.789> I'll<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:30.060> back<00:00:31.460> okay<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.239> my<00:00:33.510> first

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
so I'll be back okay now I have my first

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.910 
so I'll be back okay now I have my first
layer<00:00:34.850> solved<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.230> I'm<00:00:37.230> ready<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.770> begin

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
layer solved and I'm ready to begin

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.400 
layer solved and I'm ready to begin
showing<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.790> how<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.059> solve<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.870> second

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
showing you how to solve the second

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.850 
showing you how to solve the second
layer<00:00:40.649> edge<00:00:40.980> pieces<00:00:41.690> so<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.940> should<00:00:44.940> have

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
layer edge pieces so you should have

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.369 
layer edge pieces so you should have
solved<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.399> white<00:00:47.760> side<00:00:48.210> here<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.170> stage<00:00:50.160> one

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
solved the white side here on stage one

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.860 
solved the white side here on stage one
or<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:53.340> probably<00:00:53.760> won't<00:00:54.090> understand<00:00:54.690> this

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
or you probably won't understand this

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.590 
or you probably won't understand this
video<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.739> hadn't<00:00:56.280> done<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.120> white<00:00:57.329> side

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
video if you hadn't done the white side

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.160 
video if you hadn't done the white side
here<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:59.100> didn't<00:00:59.460> go<00:00:59.969> back<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.600> stage

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
here so if you didn't go back to stage

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.670 
here so if you didn't go back to stage
one<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.969> do<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.329> same<00:01:03.809> thing<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.470> know

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
one and do the same thing that you know

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.500 
one and do the same thing that you know
first<00:01:05.250> layer<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.030> with<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> white

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
first layer but do it with the white

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.429 
first layer but do it with the white
side<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> bottom<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.930> once<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.229> that

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
side on the bottom so once you have that

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.090 
side on the bottom so once you have that
done<00:01:10.799> look<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.080> top<00:01:13.080> layer<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:14.070> should

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
done look at the top layer you should

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.350 
done look at the top layer you should
have<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.670> yellow<00:01:15.330> edge<00:01:15.600> piece<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.680> there<00:01:17.360> look

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
have a yellow edge piece on there look

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.380 
have a yellow edge piece on there look
around<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:19.380> these<00:01:19.799> four<00:01:20.549> colors<00:01:20.820> two<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
around for these four colors two of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.600 
around for these four colors two of
these<00:01:21.509> four<00:01:21.869> colors<00:01:22.490> blue<00:01:23.780> red<00:01:25.159> green<00:01:26.159> or

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
these four colors blue red green or

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.819 
these four colors blue red green or
orange<00:01:28.009> you<00:01:29.009> should<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:30.200> hopefully<00:01:31.200> you

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
orange you should see hopefully you

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.600 
orange you should see hopefully you
should<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:33.470> one<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.619> those<00:01:34.770> four<00:01:35.040> colors<00:01:35.250> on

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
should see a one of those four colors on

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.340 
should see a one of those four colors on
the<00:01:35.759> top<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:37.290> red<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.790> them<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
the top I see red that's one of them and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.980 
the top I see red that's one of them and
there's<00:01:40.350> blue<00:01:40.740> right<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.790> those<00:01:42.780> are

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
there's blue right there and those are

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.929 
there's blue right there and those are
both<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.189> four<00:01:45.030> colors<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:47.610> edge

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
both one of the four colors so this edge

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.990 
both one of the four colors so this edge
piece<00:01:48.140> needs<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.439> show<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.829> blue<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.640> here

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
piece needs to show the blue right here

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.649 
piece needs to show the blue right here
and<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:52.170> red<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.299> piece

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
and the red right here so this piece

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.310 
and the red right here so this piece
needs<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> go<00:01:55.409> near<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:57.060> normally<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.170> would

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
needs to go near so normally you would

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.160 
needs to go near so normally you would
just<00:01:58.530> think<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.430> should<00:01:59.759> just<00:02:00.170> push

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
just think that you should just push

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.990 
just think that you should just push
that<00:02:01.409> down<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:02.149> over<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.390> up<00:02:04.579> but<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
that down and over and up but that is

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.600 
that down and over and up but that is
not<00:02:06.180> right<00:02:06.450> because<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.200> mixes<00:02:07.799> up<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
not right because that mixes up the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.430 
not right because that mixes up the
white<00:02:08.789> side<00:02:09.319> there's<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.730> algorithm<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
white side there's a algorithm to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.980 
white side there's a algorithm to
this<00:02:12.620> piece<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.250> here<00:02:13.730> without<00:02:14.210> mixing<00:02:14.660> up<00:02:14.780> any

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
this piece in here without mixing up any

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.490 
this piece in here without mixing up any
of<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.290> first<00:02:15.500> layer<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:17.390> if<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.080> need<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.290> go

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
of the first layer so if you need to go

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.410 
of the first layer so if you need to go
this<00:02:18.710> piece<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.880> right<00:02:21.250> right<00:02:22.250> here<00:02:22.420> which

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
this piece to the right right here which

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.240 
this piece to the right right here which
this<00:02:23.690> piece<00:02:23.990> needs<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.440> go<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.740> right<00:02:24.950> then

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
this piece needs to go to the right then

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.020 
this piece needs to go to the right then
you<00:02:25.850> need<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.360> do<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:26.870> algorithm<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:28.960> are

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
you need to do this algorithm you are

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:40.390 
you need to do this algorithm you are
you<00:02:32.030> i<00:02:32.060> are<00:02:32.720> i<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:34.790> i<00:02:35.470> fi<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.940> f<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.560> then

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
you i are i you i fi you f and then

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.870 
you i are i you i fi you f and then
there's<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.570> piece<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:43.130> used<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.580> be<00:02:43.700> up

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
there's a piece and it used to be up

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.000 
there's a piece and it used to be up
there<00:02:44.090> but<00:02:44.510> now<00:02:44.630> it's<00:02:44.810> in<00:02:44.960> there<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.350> still

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
there but now it's in there and still

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.970 
there but now it's in there and still
none<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.700> first<00:02:47.090> layer<00:02:47.390> has<00:02:47.870> been

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
none of the first layer has been

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.760 
none of the first layer has been
bothered<00:02:48.980> or<00:02:49.220> moved<00:02:49.760> at<00:02:50.030> all<00:02:50.330> then<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.560> move

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
bothered or moved at all then you move

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.120 
bothered or moved at all then you move
to<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.130> right<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.150> next<00:02:53.510> part<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:54.130> the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
to the right and the next part of the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.220 
to the right and the next part of the
cube<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.350> not<00:02:57.350> there<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:59.360> search<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.990> top

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
cube is not there you search the top

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.990 
cube is not there you search the top
layer<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.780> then<00:03:02.780> red<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.890> green<00:03:04.760> is

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
layer for it and then red and green is

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.270 
layer for it and then red and green is
supposed<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.480> show<00:03:05.720> there<00:03:05.990> there's<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:07.010> red

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
supposed to show there there's the red

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.670 
supposed to show there there's the red
and<00:03:07.720> green<00:03:08.720> piece<00:03:09.020> but<00:03:09.740> it's<00:03:09.950> flipped<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.930> this

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
and green piece but it's flipped so this

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.550 
and green piece but it's flipped so this
means<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.460> have<00:03:13.490> to<00:03:13.640> do<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.480> sequence<00:03:14.990> three

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
means you have to do the sequence three

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.720 
means you have to do the sequence three
times<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.400> here's<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.330> sequence<00:03:17.750> again<00:03:18.730> you

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
times and here's the sequence again you

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:32.140 
times and here's the sequence again you
are<00:03:21.489> you<00:03:22.489> i<00:03:22.520> RI<00:03:24.160> UI<00:03:25.160> f<00:03:25.870> i<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:28.720> f<00:03:30.160> then<00:03:31.160> it's<00:03:31.610> in

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
are you i RI UI f i you f then it's in

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.290 
are you i RI UI f i you f then it's in
here<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:33.980> need<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.520> do<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.790> two<00:03:35.030> more<00:03:35.060> times

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
here so you need to do it two more times

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.150 
here so you need to do it two more times
if<00:03:35.959> it's<00:03:36.680> already<00:03:37.070> in<00:03:37.250> here<00:03:37.730> but<00:03:38.239> flipped<00:03:39.160> then

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
if it's already in here but flipped then

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.009 
if it's already in here but flipped then
you<00:03:40.459> just<00:03:40.700> need<00:03:40.910> to<00:03:41.030> do<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.269> two<00:03:41.450> times

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
you just need to do it two times

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.430 
you just need to do it two times
so<00:03:42.200> if<00:03:42.440> it's<00:03:42.890> flipped<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.550> in<00:03:44.180> here<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:45.290> need

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
so if it's flipped and in here you need

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.440 
so if it's flipped and in here you need
to<00:03:45.500> do<00:03:45.769> it<00:03:45.890> two<00:03:46.100> times<00:03:46.840> so<00:03:47.840> here<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.590> is<00:03:48.709> again

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
to do it two times so here it is again

00:03:49.450 --> 00:04:03.040 
to do it two times so here it is again
you<00:03:50.450> are<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:53.150> i<00:03:53.180> are<00:03:53.840> i<00:03:55.030> UI<00:03:56.030> f<00:03:56.959> i<00:03:58.780> you<00:04:00.220> f<00:04:02.050> then

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
you are you i are i UI f i you f then

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.770 
you are you i are i UI f i you f then
flip<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.860> top<00:04:04.070> layer<00:04:04.400> about<00:04:04.970> two<00:04:05.180> times<00:04:05.480> and

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
flip the top layer about two times and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.190 
flip the top layer about two times and
it's<00:04:06.650> right<00:04:06.950> there<00:04:07.190> red<00:04:07.670> and<00:04:08.000> green<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:08.989> this

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
it's right there red and green and this

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.350 
it's right there red and green and this
time<00:04:09.500> it's<00:04:09.680> not<00:04:09.890> flipped<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.459> wrong<00:04:10.580> way<00:04:10.820> so

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
time it's not flipped the wrong way so

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.199 
time it's not flipped the wrong way so
the<00:04:11.570> red<00:04:11.750> can<00:04:12.080> show<00:04:12.410> there<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:13.220> green<00:04:13.580> can

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
the red can show there and the green can

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.050 
the red can show there and the green can
show<00:04:14.540> there<00:04:14.840> do<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.830> sequence<00:04:16.280> one<00:04:16.549> more<00:04:16.790> time

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
show there do the sequence one more time

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.090 
show there do the sequence one more time
and<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.660> piece<00:04:17.870> should<00:04:18.140> be<00:04:18.200> in<00:04:18.530> there<00:04:18.799> if<00:04:18.919> you

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
and the piece should be in there if you

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.880 
and the piece should be in there if you
did<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.400> correctly<00:04:19.430> now<00:04:20.140> remember<00:04:21.140> not<00:04:21.590> to

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
did it correctly now remember not to

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.460 
did it correctly now remember not to
flip<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.400> cube<00:04:22.669> this<00:04:23.330> way<00:04:23.630> or<00:04:23.930> any<00:04:24.140> other

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
flip the cube this way or any other

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.220 
flip the cube this way or any other
direction

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
direction

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.770 
direction
you<00:04:25.350> need<00:04:25.530> to<00:04:25.680> keep<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:26.220> side<00:04:26.580> facing<00:04:27.330> you

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
you need to keep this side facing you

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.410 
you need to keep this side facing you
with<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.590> piece<00:04:28.860> on<00:04:29.130> top<00:04:29.670> that<00:04:29.970> you<00:04:30.090> need<00:04:30.300> to

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
with the piece on top that you need to

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.250 
with the piece on top that you need to
get<00:04:30.570> in<00:04:30.720> there<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:32.610> here's<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.240> sequence<00:04:33.660> one

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
get in there so here's the sequence one

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:46.730 
get in there so here's the sequence one
more<00:04:34.500> time<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:36.060> are<00:04:37.850> UI<00:04:38.850> RI<00:04:40.490> UI<00:04:42.680> fi<00:04:44.060> u<00:04:45.080> F<00:04:46.080> and

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
more time you are UI RI UI fi u F and

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.270 
more time you are UI RI UI fi u F and
then<00:04:47.460> there<00:04:47.880> it<00:04:48.030> is<00:04:48.210> red<00:04:48.900> green<00:04:49.440> used<00:04:49.890> to<00:04:50.040> be<00:04:50.160> up

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
then there it is red green used to be up

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.760 
then there it is red green used to be up
there<00:04:50.580> then<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.480> came<00:04:51.630> down<00:04:51.810> here<00:04:52.170> then<00:04:52.650> it

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
there then it came down here then it

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.890 
there then it came down here then it
went<00:04:52.920> back<00:04:53.190> up<00:04:53.460> there<00:04:53.730> and<00:04:53.970> now<00:04:54.450> it's<00:04:54.660> in<00:04:54.780> the

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
went back up there and now it's in the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.460 
went back up there and now it's in the
correct<00:04:55.200> spot<00:04:56.510> so<00:04:57.510> now<00:04:57.720> turn<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:58.140> over<00:04:58.260> and

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
correct spot so now turn it over and

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.160 
correct spot so now turn it over and
look<00:04:58.650> for<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:58.980> next<00:04:59.160> empty<00:04:59.790> piece<00:05:00.180> or<00:05:00.540> piece

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
look for the next empty piece or piece

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.490 
look for the next empty piece or piece
that's<00:05:01.440> flipped<00:05:01.910> there<00:05:02.910> it<00:05:03.090> is<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.780> search

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
that's flipped there it is so search

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.210 
that's flipped there it is so search
your<00:05:04.740> cube<00:05:05.070> for<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.610> correct<00:05:06.180> piece<00:05:06.570> and<00:05:07.220> here

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
your cube for the correct piece and here

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.650 
your cube for the correct piece and here
is<00:05:08.340> mine<00:05:08.810> green<00:05:10.040> orange<00:05:11.040> green<00:05:12.170> orange<00:05:13.250> so

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
is mine green orange green orange so

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.090 
is mine green orange green orange so
that's<00:05:15.660> where<00:05:16.080> it's<00:05:16.290> supposed<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.650> be<00:05:16.710> right

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
that's where it's supposed to be right

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.730 
that's where it's supposed to be right
there<00:05:17.400> but<00:05:18.270> it's<00:05:18.420> flipped<00:05:18.780> so<00:05:19.050> you<00:05:19.110> need<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.530> do

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
there but it's flipped so you need to do

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.460 
there but it's flipped so you need to do
the<00:05:19.980> sequence<00:05:20.430> three<00:05:20.910> times<00:05:21.270> again<00:05:21.660> and<00:05:21.840> you

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
the sequence three times again and you

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.790 
the sequence three times again and you
cannot<00:05:22.770> do<00:05:23.040> it<00:05:23.220> at<00:05:23.370> any<00:05:23.730> up<00:05:23.970> at<00:05:24.540> any<00:05:25.050> face<00:05:25.530> of

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
cannot do it at any up at any face of

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.430 
cannot do it at any up at any face of
the<00:05:25.980> cube<00:05:26.190> you<00:05:26.940> have<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.300> have<00:05:27.480> it<00:05:27.660> at<00:05:27.840> this

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
the cube you have to have it at this

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.420 
the cube you have to have it at this
face<00:05:29.270> so<00:05:30.290> let's<00:05:31.290> do<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.740> sequence<00:05:32.100> three

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
face so let's do the sequence three

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:42.680 
face so let's do the sequence three
times<00:05:33.020> you<00:05:34.020> are<00:05:35.000> you<00:05:36.000> I<00:05:36.030> are<00:05:36.570> I<00:05:37.260> UI<00:05:38.250> f<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:39.680> u<00:05:40.680> F<00:05:41.690> and

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
times you are you I are I UI f I u F and

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.390 
times you are you I are I UI f I u F and
it's<00:05:42.840> right<00:05:43.050> here<00:05:43.080> we<00:05:43.620> need<00:05:43.830> to<00:05:43.980> do<00:05:44.130> it<00:05:44.220> two

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
it's right here we need to do it two

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.140 
it's right here we need to do it two
more<00:05:44.430> times

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
more times

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:54.050 
more times
you<00:05:45.840> are<00:05:46.640> you<00:05:47.640> I<00:05:47.910> are<00:05:48.270> I<00:05:48.840> you<00:05:49.350> I<00:05:49.980> F<00:05:50.520> I<00:05:51.170> you<00:05:52.170> F<00:05:53.060> now

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
you are you I are I you I F I you F now

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.000 
you are you I are I you I F I you F now
here<00:05:54.300> we<00:05:54.420> go<00:05:54.450> for<00:05:54.870> the<00:05:54.930> last<00:05:55.170> time<00:05:55.500> you<00:05:55.710> need<00:05:55.890> to

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
here we go for the last time you need to

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.310 
here we go for the last time you need to
turn<00:05:56.190> your<00:05:56.340> top<00:05:56.550> layer<00:05:56.880> and<00:05:57.180> tell<00:05:57.810> it's<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.140> the

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
turn your top layer and tell it's in the

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.520 
turn your top layer and tell it's in the
correct<00:05:58.560> position<00:05:58.910> right<00:05:59.910> there<00:06:00.660> so<00:06:01.260> it<00:06:01.350> needs

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
correct position right there so it needs

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.520 
correct position right there so it needs
to<00:06:01.650> go<00:06:01.800> in<00:06:01.920> there<00:06:02.270> so<00:06:03.270> one<00:06:03.720> more<00:06:03.930> time<00:06:04.170> here<00:06:04.440> we

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
to go in there so one more time here we

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:14.750 
to go in there so one more time here we
go<00:06:04.740> you<00:06:05.640> are<00:06:06.770> you<00:06:07.770> i<00:06:07.800> RI<00:06:08.870> UI<00:06:09.870> f<00:06:10.500> i<00:06:11.480> nu<00:06:12.710> f<00:06:13.710> and<00:06:14.400> then

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
go you are you i RI UI f i nu f and then

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.990 
go you are you i RI UI f i nu f and then
there<00:06:15.030> it<00:06:15.180> is<00:06:15.300> it's<00:06:15.600> in<00:06:15.720> the<00:06:15.840> right<00:06:15.960> spot<00:06:17.000> then

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
there it is it's in the right spot then

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
there it is it's in the right spot then
look<00:06:18.300> at<00:06:18.450> your<00:06:18.690> next<00:06:19.410> piece<00:06:20.150> this<00:06:21.150> is<00:06:21.450> my<00:06:21.720> last

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
look at your next piece this is my last

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.060 
look at your next piece this is my last
one<00:06:22.560> for<00:06:23.550> here<00:06:23.850> because<00:06:24.530> every<00:06:25.530> other<00:06:25.710> edge

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
one for here because every other edge

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.630 
one for here because every other edge
piece<00:06:26.820> on<00:06:27.060> the<00:06:27.210> middle<00:06:27.450> layer<00:06:27.630> is<00:06:27.900> solved<00:06:28.860> so

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
piece on the middle layer is solved so

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.090 
piece on the middle layer is solved so
here<00:06:30.420> it<00:06:30.570> is<00:06:30.980> orange<00:06:31.980> blue<00:06:33.050> so<00:06:34.050> for<00:06:34.560> this<00:06:34.740> we

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
here it is orange blue so for this we

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.180 
here it is orange blue so for this we
only<00:06:35.130> need<00:06:35.580> to<00:06:35.700> do<00:06:35.850> it<00:06:35.970> one<00:06:36.240> time<00:06:36.800> because<00:06:37.800> it's

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
only need to do it one time because it's

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.930 
only need to do it one time because it's
already<00:06:38.460> in<00:06:38.640> the

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
already in the

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.600 
already in the
correct<00:06:39.320> position<00:06:40.320> and<00:06:40.560> it<00:06:40.950> just<00:06:41.160> needs<00:06:41.370> to<00:06:41.490> go

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
correct position and it just needs to go

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.250 
correct position and it just needs to go
in<00:06:41.670> there<00:06:41.940> so<00:06:42.540> here<00:06:42.690> we<00:06:42.810> go

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
in there so here we go

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:54.170 
in there so here we go
you<00:06:43.770> are<00:06:44.990> UI<00:06:45.990> RI<00:06:47.150> UI<00:06:48.560> fi<00:06:49.640> new<00:06:51.320> F<00:06:52.730> then<00:06:53.730> it's

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
you are UI RI UI fi new F then it's

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
you are UI RI UI fi new F then it's
right<00:06:54.780> there<00:06:55.050> and<00:06:55.580> your<00:06:56.580> middle<00:06:56.790> layer<00:06:57.200> should

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.200 
right there and your middle layer should

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.000 
right there and your middle layer should
be<00:06:59.000> solved
