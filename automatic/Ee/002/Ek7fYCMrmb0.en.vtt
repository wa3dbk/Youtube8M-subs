00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
playing so much better out there on the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.890 
playing so much better out there on the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
court we are moving a lot faster we are

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.379 
court we are moving a lot faster we are
much<00:02:31.319> more<00:02:31.350> agile<00:02:31.829> out<00:02:32.310> there<00:02:32.609> and<00:02:32.880> we<00:02:33.239> are

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
much more agile out there and we are

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.110 
much more agile out there and we are
definitely<00:02:33.900> more<00:02:34.470> effective<00:02:35.130> on<00:02:35.370> fast<00:02:35.760> breaks

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
definitely more effective on fast breaks

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.789 
definitely more effective on fast breaks
but<00:02:36.600> as<00:02:36.720> we're<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:36.959> through<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.500> timeout

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
but as we're going through a timeout

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.440 
but as we're going through a timeout
right<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.519> at<00:02:38.639> the<00:02:38.790> end<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.239> third

by<00:02:41.790> four<00:02:42.090> points<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.989> we<00:02:43.139> are<00:02:43.260> not<00:02:43.530> really

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
by four points but we are not really

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.420 
by four points but we are not really
performing<00:02:44.819> up<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.510> our<00:02:45.720> standards<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.829> far<00:02:47.160> we

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
performing up to our standards so far we

only have six points two rebounds and
one<00:02:50.069> assist<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.090> already<00:02:51.180> know<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.870> has

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
one assist and you already know that has

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.309 
one assist and you already know that has
to<00:02:52.500> change<00:02:52.639> sooner<00:02:53.639> rather<00:02:54.090> than<00:02:54.329> later<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
to change sooner rather than later and

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.199
