three<00:00:56.670> modes<00:00:56.879> which<00:00:57.269> we'll<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.570> into<00:00:57.629> detail

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
three modes which we'll get into detail

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.030 
three modes which we'll get into detail
with<00:00:58.199> individually<00:00:59.070> now

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.950 

this<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> most<00:01:05.970> balanced<00:01:06.450> mode<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this is the most balanced mode of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380 
this is the most balanced mode of
vitamin<00:01:07.530> E<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:08.040> seems<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> work<00:01:08.700> best<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.240> the

vitamin E it seems to work best with the
engine<00:01:09.720> used<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.140> making<00:01:10.320> game<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.980> this<00:01:11.520> mode

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
engine used to making game in this mode

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.430 
engine used to making game in this mode
you<00:01:11.970> connect<00:01:12.330> three<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.690> more<00:01:12.840> blocks<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
you connect three or more blocks of the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.830 
you connect three or more blocks of the
same<00:01:13.650> color<00:01:13.950> together<00:01:14.430> together<00:01:14.760> points<00:01:15.510> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
same color together together points and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.960 
same color together together points and
energy<00:01:16.290> when<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.160> connect<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:17.610> blocks

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
energy when you connect these blocks

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.460 
energy when you connect these blocks
they<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.270> chained<00:01:18.570> together<00:01:18.690> and<00:01:19.140> after<00:01:19.440> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
they are chained together and after a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.680 
they are chained together and after a
few<00:01:19.740> seconds<00:01:20.160> they<00:01:20.340> disappear<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:21.510> you're

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
few seconds they disappear if you're

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.480 
few seconds they disappear if you're
fast<00:01:22.020> enough<00:01:22.230> you<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.830> string<00:01:23.100> together<00:01:23.220> some

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
fast enough you can string together some

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
fast enough you can string together some
massive<00:01:24.090> combos<00:01:24.510> which<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.900> pretty

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
massive combos which is pretty

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.800 
massive combos which is pretty
satisfying<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.850> complaint<00:01:27.240> i<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
satisfying the complaint i have with the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.990 
satisfying the complaint i have with the
gameplay<00:01:28.380> overalls<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.250> some<00:01:29.520> blocks<00:01:29.820> are

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
gameplay overalls that some blocks are

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
gameplay overalls that some blocks are
very<00:01:30.210> similarly<00:01:30.720> colored<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.410> other<00:01:31.530> blocks

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
very similarly colored to other blocks

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.510 
very similarly colored to other blocks
for<00:01:32.670> instance<00:01:32.940> there<00:01:33.240> are<00:01:33.330> two<00:01:33.479> kinds<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.870> blue

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
for instance there are two kinds of blue

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.710 
for instance there are two kinds of blue
but<00:01:34.729> people<00:01:34.880> look<00:01:35.570> about<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.990> same<00:01:36.020> cipher

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
but people look about the same cipher

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:46.490 
but people look about the same cipher
a<00:01:37.780> little<00:01:38.590> bit<00:01:38.710> darker<00:01:38.830> than<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.280> other

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.870 

I<00:01:46.770> must<00:01:47.400> say<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.970> mode<00:01:48.480> is<00:01:48.530> walled<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:50.370> way

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
I must say this mode is walled it's way

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.270 
I must say this mode is walled it's way
too<00:01:50.940> easy<00:01:51.240> I'm<00:01:51.870> not<00:01:52.200> kidding<00:01:52.620> you<00:01:52.740> when<00:01:52.890> i<00:01:52.920> say

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.380 
that i SAT there mashing the space
button<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.040> i<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.310> instantly<00:01:56.700> racking<00:01:57.270> up

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
button and i was instantly racking up

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.750 
button and i was instantly racking up
massive<00:01:57.900> amounts<00:01:58.050> of<00:01:58.290> points<00:01:58.800> all<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.640> have

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.670 
got much more about this one I actually
had<00:02:15.180> trouble<00:02:15.570> finishing<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.170> mode<00:02:16.440> because

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
had trouble finishing this mode because

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.980 
had trouble finishing this mode because
you<00:02:16.980> can't<00:02:17.220> end<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.550> by<00:02:17.730> family<00:02:18.240> even<00:02:18.780> if<00:02:18.870> you

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
you can't end it by family even if you

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.560 
you can't end it by family even if you
tried<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.760> think<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.880> time<00:02:21.120> ran<00:02:21.390> out<00:02:21.420> of

tried to I think the time ran out of

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.630
