me the idea of wrapping wrapping down is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.619 
me the idea of wrapping wrapping down is
if<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:01.920> example<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.629> if

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
if you if you it for example you you if

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.170 
if you if you it for example you you if
you<00:01:03.809> want<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.170> hit<00:01:04.290> someone<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:05.010> bare<00:01:05.909> hand

you want to hit someone with bare hand

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.880 
you want to hit someone with bare hand
you<00:01:06.689> want<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.930> maintain<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> position<00:01:07.560> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you want to maintain the position you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.230 
you want to maintain the position you
don't<00:01:07.979> want<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> bend<00:01:08.369> your<00:01:08.640> wrist<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.030> course
