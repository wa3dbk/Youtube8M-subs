because<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.049> level-cap<00:00:07.470> got<00:00:07.680> announced<00:00:07.890> and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
because the level-cap got announced and

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.709 
because the level-cap got announced and
I<00:00:08.280> didn't<00:00:08.550> feel<00:00:08.730> like<00:00:08.760> doing<00:00:08.910> more<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.599> them

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719
