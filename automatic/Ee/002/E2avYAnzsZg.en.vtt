00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
different position so it's like

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:40.080 
different position so it's like
checkpoint<00:04:32.650> here<00:04:33.630> restart<00:04:35.760> here<00:04:36.790> oh<00:04:38.940> that's<00:04:39.940> a

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
checkpoint here restart here oh that's a

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.850 
checkpoint here restart here oh that's a
good<00:04:40.210> checkpoint<00:04:40.660> spot<00:04:41.020> actually<00:04:41.500> for<00:04:41.710> you

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
only we notice weird checkpoint systems

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.409 
only we notice weird checkpoint systems
yeah<00:04:49.210> we<00:04:49.479> edit<00:04:49.720> video<00:04:50.160> like<00:04:51.160> most<00:04:51.400> games<00:04:51.639> it

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
checkpoint ready you just know that oh I

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.760 
checkpoint ready you just know that oh I
died<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.389> don't<00:04:58.449> have<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.870> go<00:04:58.960> back<00:04:59.169> five
