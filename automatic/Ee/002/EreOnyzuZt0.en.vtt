xcalibur

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
xcalibur

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.700 
xcalibur
food<00:01:54.810> dehydrator<00:01:55.380> which<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:57.179> the<00:01:57.960> safest<00:01:58.530> one

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
food dehydrator which is the safest one

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
food dehydrator which is the safest one
to<00:01:58.859> use<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.399> it<00:02:00.299> has<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.539> temperature

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
to use because it has a temperature

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.950 
to use because it has a temperature
control<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.920> that's<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.090> really<00:02:03.509> important

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
control and that's a really important

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.509 
control and that's a really important
thing<00:02:05.090> because<00:02:06.090> we<00:02:06.329> can't<00:02:06.570> fluctuate

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
thing because we can't fluctuate

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.759 
thing because we can't fluctuate
it<00:02:09.450> has<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.929> keep<00:02:10.140> between<00:02:11.450> 140<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.769> 150

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
it has to keep between 140 and 150

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:14.630 
it has to keep between 140 and 150
degrees

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640
