00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:08.294
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.820
 Today, Xiaotang wants to introduce to you how to grow pineapple at home. 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.540
 Plant a cute pineapple (haha) 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.900
 First of all, I have to come up with a pineapple head. 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:30.320
 This is the head cut from the pineapple, so you can leave him. 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.920
 Then you can pull him out, like this pineapple cut down, I grabbed the place 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.380
 Then, if you feel that you will stab, you will not be stabbed if you wear gloves. 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.560
 Then twist the head like this 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.400
 Rotate 

00:00:51.853 --> 00:00:52.853
 Good thorn 

00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:54.693
 Careful hand 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.580
 OK! 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.360
 After twisting it, let’s take a look at this pineapple head. 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.240
 The part that is twisted down is long 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:13.520
 At this time, we have to strip some leaves along the broken place. 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.380
 First peel off a few pieces to see what happens. 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.000
 Is peeling off, peeling off the leaves like a circle 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:40.900
 About 4-5 layers are peeled off in total 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.680
 At this time, the growth point of pineapple has begun to emerge. 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.440
 Let's see what is the growth point. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.900
 After the pineapple peels off the leaves, you can see some white spots here. 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.240
 The part of this white point is the growth point of pineapple 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.040
 At this time, I have to clean the pineapple a little. 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.820
 Then bring a pot of water 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:26.260
 Don't have too much water, probably half the depth of the pineapple growth point, don't exceed 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.760
 Probably such a deep water, put him inside. 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.040
 Remember, it’s best to change the water once a day. 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.620
 After a week of continuous soaking, she will grow up. 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.020
 Let's turn around now! (one week) 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.700
 This is the pineapple that I cut last week. Now I have grown roots. 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.640
 I have grown roots below this growth point. 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.820
 At this time, we can transplant him into the soil. 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.340
 Next, let's see how to grow into the soil. 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.120
 OK! Now let me talk about what I have to prepare. 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.460
 There is a washbasin underneath 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.620
 He can store water so that your water won't flow away (is it moisturizing? XD) 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.780
 Will not stain your home 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.280
 Come again with a soft basin 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.880
 This is for ordinary people to raise seedlings~ 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.800
 Meaning that after planting now 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.120
 It’s better to grow up when you grow up. 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.400
 At this time, I have prepared some cultivated soil here. 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.920
 Take some culture soil first. 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.680
 Probably.... put it to a height of about half 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.500
 Probably like this half or so the height is enough. 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.320
 At this time, I took the pineapple. 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.520
 This one I just saw is a pineapple with roots. 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.700
 Put him probably in this place 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.460
 Then I will add some cultivation soil. 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.540
 The best soil for cultivation is humus and deciduous inside. 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.400
 Then it’s better to be wet. 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.840
 Put him inside 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.100
 Put him evenly around from around 4 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.520
 After I put it almost, I pressed him a little. 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.880
 Why do you want to press it? 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.000
 Because there will be gaps inside 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.620
 The roots of pineapples cannot reach the soil 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.940
 Can't pick up water and nutrients 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.940
 After a little pressing, add it to about 8 points of soil. 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.840
 After the soil is also pressed, 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.180
 It's finished! 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.180
 I will take him to the balcony and pour some water. 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.760
 I have now moved the pineapple to the balcony. 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.900
 Because at this time his roots are not yet long. 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.660
 So he still can't get a big sun 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.460
 It is recommended to put him indoors first. 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.560
 Probably the same scene (environment) of orchid root agave 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.820
 I have to add some water now. 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.920
 Add it from above and let him damp 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.220
 Wait for him to take some water out 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.380
 In fact, his soil was originally wet, and he had just said that it was a wet culture soil. 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.780
 Add a little more 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.520
 Add a bit of water in the end, let’s take a look 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.220
 Is it under the water? En 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.780
 It’s almost like taking water out. 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.320
 Remember to pour water once a day. 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.840
 How do you know if he has succeeded? 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.640
 You look at him every day, if you grow new leaves here or grow taller 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.260
 Then you know that he has succeeded. 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.940
 I can transplant him into the soil in about a month. 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.500
 Or larger flower pot 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.980
 If you put it at home, you can use it as an ornament or watch. 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.960
 This is the method of introducing pineapple head pineapple today. 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.820
 Next day, let’s try again with pineapple
