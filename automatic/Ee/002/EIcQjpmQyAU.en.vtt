s4 this sounds to be split up into parts
right<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.349> in-game<00:00:13.620> audio<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.160> buds

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.279 
right the in-game audio and the buds
communication<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.509> if<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:15.870> use<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.260> for

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
communication so if you just use it for

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.290 
communication so if you just use it for
in-game<00:00:16.650> audio<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:17.130> entirely<00:00:17.430> wireless<00:00:17.910> if

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
in-game audio it's entirely wireless if

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.359 
in-game audio it's entirely wireless if
you<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.260> however<00:00:19.470> want<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.949> talk<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.279> your

so<00:00:23.519> then<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.180> hook<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.480> cable

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
so then you have to hook up the cable

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.450 
so then you have to hook up the cable
from<00:00:24.990> your<00:00:25.199> headset<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> controller

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
from your headset to the controller

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.609 
from your headset to the controller
launching<00:00:27.390> there's<00:00:27.599> no<00:00:27.840> way<00:00:27.990> around<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.439> for

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
launching there's no way around it for

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.679 
launching there's no way around it for
us<00:00:28.769> because<00:00:29.070> that's<00:00:29.519> just<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.939> way<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.269> xbox

us because that's just the way the xbox
worse<00:00:31.610> so<00:00:33.140> yeah<00:00:34.140> but<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.070> use<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:35.550> an

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
worse so yeah but you can use it as an

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.040 
worse so yeah but you can use it as an
Italian<00:00:36.090> wireless<00:00:36.390> associate<00:00:36.930> not

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
Italian wireless associate not

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.900 
Italian wireless associate not
marketable<00:00:37.590> what<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.250> actually<00:00:38.430> tried<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
marketable what we actually tried to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.910 
marketable what we actually tried to
decide<00:00:39.420> said<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.110> more<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> approach<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.890> from

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
decide said is more to approach it from

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
decide said is more to approach it from
a<00:00:41.100> usability<00:00:41.280> point<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.030> view<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.050> did

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
a usability point of view so what we did

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.950 
a usability point of view so what we did
on<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.680> other<00:00:44.460> than<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> basic<00:00:45.270> evaluation

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
on that other than the basic evaluation

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.590 
on that other than the basic evaluation
strands<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.940> hook<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> four

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
strands on you can hook up to four

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.080 
strands on you can hook up to four
headsets<00:00:48.989> up<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> space<00:00:49.620> station<00:00:50.090> and

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
headsets up to the space station and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.790 
headsets up to the space station and
then<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.390> also<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.020> get<00:00:52.260> daisy<00:00:52.469> chain

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
then they also have to get daisy chain

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.529 
then they also have to get daisy chain
so<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.239> use<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
so you can you don't have to use the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.850 
so you can you don't have to use the
expertise<00:00:54.930> communication<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.680> just

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
expertise communication you can just

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.979 
expertise communication you can just
talk<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.090> there's<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> mode<00:00:57.960> button

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
talk to do that there's the mode button

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.750 
talk to do that there's the mode button
on<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> side<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.920> headset<00:00:59.280> which<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.579> can

on the side of the headset which you can

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.580 
on the side of the headset which you can
switch<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.600> back<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> extras<00:01:01.260> left<00:01:01.469> in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
switch to get back to the extras left in

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.620 
switch to get back to the extras left in
addition<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.100> want<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:03.049> yes<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.339> two

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you dial down the in-game audio or if

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.590 
you dial down the in-game audio or if
some<00:01:16.470> guys<00:01:16.680> cursing<00:01:17.340> little<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.420> might

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
some guys cursing little then you might

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.920 
some guys cursing little then you might
just<00:01:18.750> want<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.229> later<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.750> can

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
just want to that later on so that can

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.420 
just want to that later on so that can
all<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.140> done<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.560> headset<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.250> don't

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
all be done on the headset so you don't

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.429 
all be done on the headset so you don't
have<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.060> go<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.509> races<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
have to get up and go to the races the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.380 
have to get up and go to the races the
base<00:01:25.619> station<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.220> obviously<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.880> core

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
base station is obviously the core

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.469 
base station is obviously the core
principle<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.680> entire<00:01:28.950> thing<00:01:29.360> that's<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
principle of the entire thing that's the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.600 
principle of the entire thing that's the
DSP<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:30.930> virtualized<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.040> process<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.549> a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
DSP that virtualized that process is a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.120 
DSP that virtualized that process is a
virtualization<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> surround<00:01:33.869> sound

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
virtualization of the surround sound

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.960 
virtualization of the surround sound
there's<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> audio<00:01:35.640> pass<00:01:35.909> through<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
there's a audio pass through on the

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.240 
there's a audio pass through on the
patient<00:01:37.870> so<00:01:37.930> you<00:01:38.050> can<00:01:38.230> basically<00:01:38.650> walk<00:01:39.070> up

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
patient so you can basically walk up

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.370 
patient so you can basically walk up
your<00:01:39.430> TV<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:40.030> base<00:01:40.180> station<00:01:40.420> first<00:01:40.900> so<00:01:41.290> as

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
your TV to the base station first so as

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.590 
your TV to the base station first so as
soon<00:01:41.500> as<00:01:41.650> you<00:01:41.740> switch<00:01:41.980> on<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:42.490> headset<00:01:43.360> the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
soon as you switch on the headset the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.710
