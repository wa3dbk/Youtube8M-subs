00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.470
 hello hello welcome to all and 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.939
 all on cocotte tv for this new 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.010
 video presentation that focuses on a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.010
 case to know the bitfenix to and slides 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.269
 a micro-atx type housing that wants to 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.830
 a little bit dedicated anyway to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.240
 watercooling we will discover all that 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.899
 immediately together 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.030
 it is sure that the code tv we start all 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.730
 first with her some expect of this 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.649
 case is a measure 205 by 470 by 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.620
 480 mm weighs 6.7 kg and format 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.070
 micro-atx his steel gesture his 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 fairings are plastic a few 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.090
 other technical characteristics 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.329
 significant 170 mm max height for 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.809
 the cooler cpu 380 mm max for the card 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.030
 graphic 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.610
 220 mm maximum for limitation 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.710
 go we start to go around this 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.430
 haggis in shon comedy that means 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.990
 we have the right 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.990
 behind this little front 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.710
 glossy black lacquered one has the right to a 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.670
 LCD screen of 320 by 240 mm that are not going 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.920
 in 320 by 240 pixels that will allow you 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.820
 so display the logo you want 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.189
 lose face 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.560
 oh well seen on the side we have 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.909
 ventilation grills that will allow 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.030
 fans that will be placed at 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.159
 the back to suck in fresh air we're going 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.470
 power incidentally passed behind this 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.439
 invoice mans we draw like this here we 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.960
 sees in the access to the usb screen the screen 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.240
 and hull lcd screen that plugs into usb 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.930
 we then have here a big filter is 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.460
 mounted and tormented profile hide 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.810
 slots in 3 x 120 mm or 2 x 140 mm 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.500
 if we disassemble everything inside we 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.030
 can also put a radiator 2 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.030
 368 m on the front 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.269
 it's pretty easy to get back into place 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.790
 we go on the side now on the 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.060
 side we find a beautiful window that is 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.920
 very large which will give wide access to 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.970
 your components so we can go pretty 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.120
 easily what's going on inside 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.769
 the pc continues without further delay to 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.330
 the back where we have a rather 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.860
 traditional and classic with two 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.959
 pass-through the location of the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.329
 plate and shield the map towards a 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.670
 location for a fan of 120 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.560
 mm we also find five slots 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.150
 Extension with a cachets jory 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.400
 small ventilation grid and finally 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.410
 the location of the power supply in the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.690
 down we notice that all the panels 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.390
 can be dismantled either the one above or 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.790
 those sides through hand screws on 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:58.489
 find two of them no water 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.829
 also finds a big filter so 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.560
 there too he is magnetized as the model 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.709
 from above we see that we at the location 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.049
 here for the diet which is so 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.569
 behind a small grid is here we have 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.760
 another grid that will leave that 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:20.269
 wanted would be installed to a fan 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:22.310
 in 120 or bag or in 140 mm we have 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.109
 also four feet so feet 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.109
 who are hard plastic would have short 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:31.639
 covered with foam in cap 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:34.430
 we are on the south now so 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.920
 we will find the pot aaron the rize is 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.900
 the device to regulate the speed 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.540
 fans according to three modes on 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.950
 also finds two usb 3.0 and the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.620
 audio output jacks and diodes 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.470
 of activity finally here on youtube 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.250
 there is a whitewater grid that 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.260
 will leave you access is certainly limited 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.540
 to three fans of 120 mm or two 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.459
 fans of 140 mm the whole thing is 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.959
 filtered but be aware that this part of 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.980
 worlds if we remove both his hand this 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.989
 which will allow you to install 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.530
 easily fans to 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.530
 interior 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.439
 to lose inside the case one 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.630
 said it's removing two thumbscrews on 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.720
 each of the panels and we open it all 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.570
 nothing very complicated inside 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.080
 of the case itself we discover 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.479
 an interesting chassis that offer a 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.430
 wide access backplate and passages a 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.139
 little bit everywhere for cables know 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.820
 we are on micro-atx format 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.889
 we have a nice high ceiling at 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.250
 minus 170 mm which will allow to put 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.070
 big radiator so here we find at 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.680
 two bays 2.5 inches for ssd 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.259
 know that we can remove this cache 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.080
 just like to the cage underneath left 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.240
 a 3.5 inch for two hard drives of 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.650
 everything and removable enough easily 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.889
 bottom cage is also retiring is 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.669
 also the cash to 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.310
 supply 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.110
 in fact this is one of the strengths of 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.449
 this case is that it is entirely 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.789
 modular and it even offers for example 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.900
 options that are delivered so this does not 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.039
 will not be options like this 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.930
 platinum for media 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.280
 watercooling with a platinum that is 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.300
 soft this is what will limit 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.260
 vibrations 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.620
 so we said it at 2 2.5 inches 6 6 2 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.800
 3.5 inches here 3.5 inches 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.620
 here we have different locations here the 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.060
 cash to the food the 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.639
 studs at the motherboard are 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.870
 already installed basic and we will pass 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.570
 on the other side to show you the 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.760
 chassis at the back is this 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.580
 also relatively interesting we have 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.860
 example a platinum here with davis in 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.250
 rubber that can be used either for 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.430
 install a ssd either to be able to 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.750
 put for example a reservoir to this 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.050
 place there is also another 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.479
 Latin ssd here so who's in the back 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.860
 from the tray to the back of the feed 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.750
 we really have technical solutions 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.159
 which are different from what we 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.180
 usually finds it rather 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.159
 a good thing 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.979
 we can therefore for example if we decide 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:07.810
 to have only one ssd place it here at 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.490
 the back and removed all the others 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.680
 components and all other turntables 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.930
 to be able to enjoy only 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.330
 watercooling radiator for example 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.099
 to be able to cool 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.479
 a CPU and a graphics card as well 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.759
 have good performance and a 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.830
 excellent cooling a trucker who 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.020
 so is quite interesting in our opinion 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.409
 we will give you more details about this 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.780
 latest 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.250
 when we go to the full test of 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.020
 this one sure your long point 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.669
 as on this we give you appointment 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.620
 very soon on our website and on 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.009
 our youtube channel for new 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.009
