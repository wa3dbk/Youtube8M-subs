up there now we try to do this on rounds
10<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.640> 16<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:36.780> were<00:00:36.870> doing<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
10 to 16 and we were doing it in the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.600 
10 to 16 and we were doing it in the
wrong<00:00:37.500> times<00:00:37.860> we<00:00:38.100> were<00:00:38.160> doing<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.520> there

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
wrong times we were doing it when there

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.889 
wrong times we were doing it when there
was<00:00:38.700> thunder<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.030> one<00:00:39.180> corner<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.540> map<00:00:39.750> in

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
was thunder in one corner a map in

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.270 
was thunder in one corner a map in
another<00:00:40.140> corner<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> map<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:41.010> need<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
another corner of the map you need to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.459 
another corner of the map you need to
start<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> round<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.420> thunder<00:00:42.840> absolutely

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
start the round with thunder absolutely

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.680 
start the round with thunder absolutely
everywhere<00:00:43.829> only<00:00:44.280> then<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> avogadro

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
everywhere only then with the avogadro

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.750 
everywhere only then with the avogadro
actually<00:00:46.110> spawn<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.829> crop<00:00:47.070> field<00:00:47.309> itself

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
actually spawn in the crop field itself

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.270 
actually spawn in the crop field itself
when<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> does<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.680> you'll<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
when it does do that as you'll see in a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.840 
when it does do that as you'll see in a
moment<00:00:50.789> you'll<00:00:51.600> probably<00:00:52.110> shit<00:00:52.320> bricks<00:00:52.850> but

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
moment you'll probably shit bricks but

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.549 
moment you'll probably shit bricks but
then<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.360> need<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> go<00:00:54.750> straight<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> action

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
then you need to go straight to action

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
then you need to go straight to action
stations<00:00:55.800> mode<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.489> follow<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.180> steps<00:00:57.449> that

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
stations mode and follow the steps that

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.080 
stations mode and follow the steps that
I<00:00:57.960> give<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.559> accordingly<00:00:59.219> okay<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.699> probably

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
I give you accordingly okay so probably

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.939 
I give you accordingly okay so probably
about<00:01:00.390> 30<00:01:00.840> seconds<00:01:01.320> before<00:01:01.469> he<00:01:01.770> actually

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
about 30 seconds before he actually

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.619 
about 30 seconds before he actually
spawns<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.090> him<00:01:03.300> here's<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
spawns in and you see him here's the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.700 
spawns in and you see him here's the
footage<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.899> us<00:01:04.019> seeing<00:01:04.260> him<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> first
