00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
can just see they're so over

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.350 
can just see they're so over
straighten<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.170> ice<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.819> we're<00:02:13.970> just<00:02:14.120> going

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
straighten the ice and we're just going

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.630 
straighten the ice and we're just going
to<00:02:14.420> keep<00:02:14.629> whisking<00:02:15.440> around<00:02:15.950> now<00:02:16.159> if<00:02:16.400> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
to keep whisking around now if the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.070 
to keep whisking around now if the
mixture<00:02:17.180> gets<00:02:18.080> grainy<00:02:19.030> okay<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.810> can<00:02:20.930> always

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
mixture gets grainy okay you can always

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.740 
mixture gets grainy okay you can always
take<00:02:21.409> it<00:02:21.560> back<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:21.980> double<00:02:22.280> boiler<00:02:22.750> and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
take it back to the double boiler and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.660 
take it back to the double boiler and
melt<00:02:24.110> down<00:02:24.170> those<00:02:24.560> grainy<00:02:24.890> pipes<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.430> start

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
melt down those grainy pipes and start

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.600 
melt down those grainy pipes and start
again<00:02:25.819> so<00:02:26.659> this<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:27.080> pretty<00:02:27.290> much<00:02:27.590> what<00:02:28.459> we're

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
again so this is pretty much what we're

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.280 
again so this is pretty much what we're
after<00:02:28.760> when<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.209> get<00:02:29.329> to<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.480> stage<00:02:29.840> where<00:02:30.170> it's

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
after when you get to a stage where it's

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.800 
after when you get to a stage where it's
hanging<00:02:30.799> off<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.760> top<00:02:32.000> there<00:02:32.209> just<00:02:32.569> like<00:02:32.750> that

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
hanging off the top there just like that

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.160 
hanging off the top there just like that
and<00:02:33.170> it's<00:02:33.799> cooled<00:02:34.190> right<00:02:35.060> down<00:02:35.360> that's

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
and it's cooled right down that's

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:56.070 
and it's cooled right down that's
exactly<00:02:36.860> what<00:02:37.489> we're<00:02:37.640> after
