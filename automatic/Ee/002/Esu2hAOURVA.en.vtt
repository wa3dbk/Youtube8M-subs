00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
than da custom definitely louder but not

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.319 
than da custom definitely louder but not
as<00:00:35.850> hard<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:37.680> play<00:00:37.920> as<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.430> Z<00:00:38.640> custom<00:00:39.120> which

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
as hard to play as the Z custom which

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.510 
as hard to play as the Z custom which
are<00:00:39.600> more<00:00:39.930> designed<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.770> heavy<00:00:41.129> players

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
are more designed for heavy players

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.150 
are more designed for heavy players
these<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> lot<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.379> volume<00:00:43.710> without

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
these can get a lot of volume without

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.240 
these can get a lot of volume without
too<00:00:44.700> much<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> heavy-hitting<00:00:46.250> definitely

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
too much of a heavy-hitting definitely

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.850 
too much of a heavy-hitting definitely
good<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.579> live<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.570> also<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> studio<00:00:49.590> if

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
good for live but also in the studio if

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.709 
good for live but also in the studio if
you<00:00:50.309> want<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.969> really<00:00:51.809> really<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:53.010> know

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
you want that really really you know

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.279 
you want that really really you know
aggressive<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:56.039> too<00:00:56.399> loud<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.449> guess

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
aggressive but not too loud and I guess

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
aggressive but not too loud and I guess
you<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.620> these<00:00:58.829> are<00:00:58.890> easier<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> play<00:01:00.270> than

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
you know these are easier to play than

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689 
you know these are easier to play than
the<00:01:00.780> Z<00:01:00.960> custom<00:01:01.440> definitely<00:01:02.010> I've<00:01:02.160> used<00:01:02.520> them

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the Z custom definitely I've used them

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.090 
the Z custom definitely I've used them
on<00:01:02.820> gigs<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:04.320> touch<00:01:04.589> them<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:04.890> explode

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
on gigs and you touch them they explode

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.020 
on gigs and you touch them they explode
and<00:01:06.170> they<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> full<00:01:07.979> tone<00:01:08.280> from<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and they just have a full tone from the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270 
and they just have a full tone from the
second<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.570> hit<00:01:09.780> them<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.770> don't<00:01:10.979> need<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
second you hit them so you don't need to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520 
second you hit them so you don't need to
get<00:01:11.640> into<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.090> heavy<00:01:12.330> heavy<00:01:12.570> pounding<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.350> get
