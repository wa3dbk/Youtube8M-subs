covering the gray water and mulch does

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.190 
covering the gray water and mulch does
several<00:03:06.890> other<00:03:07.190> good<00:03:07.490> things

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
several other good things

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.100 
several other good things
it<00:03:09.200> keeps<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.160> surface<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.910> soil<00:03:11.209> friable

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
it keeps the surface of the soil friable

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.260 
it keeps the surface of the soil friable
and<00:03:12.320> open<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.070> gray<00:03:13.310> water<00:03:13.550> infiltrates

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
and open so the gray water infiltrates

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.320 
and open so the gray water infiltrates
rapidly<00:03:14.870> even<00:03:15.170> after<00:03:15.830> decades<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.880> also<00:03:17.180> it's

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
rapidly even after decades and also it's

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.790 
rapidly even after decades and also it's
way<00:03:17.450> better<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.840> have<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.050> mulch<00:03:18.260> turn<00:03:18.590> into

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
way better to have the mulch turn into

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.040 
way better to have the mulch turn into
fruit<00:03:19.100> in<00:03:19.340> your<00:03:19.490> garden<00:03:19.910> than<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.720> turn<00:03:20.900> into

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
fruit in your garden than to turn into

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.780 
fruit in your garden than to turn into

methane in the landfill which is a
greenhouse<00:03:23.150> gas<00:03:23.360> it's<00:03:23.959> 30<00:03:24.230> times<00:03:24.500> more<00:03:24.800> potent

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190
