 virgilio and you have been weighed together with federico buffa 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.189
 today in our journey within the 50 stars of 50 states of the

 american flag we make a stage that has me particularly k 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.659
 those who know and are the story of the TV series cannot do without 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.120
 lady named angela lansbury in jessica fletcher art 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.710
 chear kept company someone say stolen for years and years and years 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.630
 television letters and the lady of course

 compile all his yellowish discoveries that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.360
 Too many killers to be such a quiet land cabot cove place 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.450
 imaginary I think I understand that it does not exist but that it is placed in the main today 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.450
 federico bufalino in the left chin today we see gray set of - remaining 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.840
 always in the literary theme written in kind ambiente most of his 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.610
 men video stories come 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.210
 that one of the cities in the meantime 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.200
 he also creates imaginary swimming as a name but they are clearly 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.000
 set in the - hayden also active - iphone land - 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.500
 and the problem is conducted we call the American state and try to find out 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.490
 the etymology sayf in the rain virginia okey west very simple law is a mansion 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.829
 queen elizabeth before she was virgin on May 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.399
 the state is a virgin, but if you go about what it means - it's not a name 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.039
 Indian is not an English name what will this be - indeed it is one among a 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.510
 just rather complex 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.040
 I might be honoring live French discoverers or more likely 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.450
 if you go to the menu, you get a fabulous dinner * of the 5,000 islands that are so many 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.360
 in an American context 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.280
 it is thought that the inhabitants of the 5000 islands whenever they wanted to go 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.590
 on the mainland they called it - renders 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.409
 and at this point even if we have to add an it 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.700
 in the context of the word it is probable that men derived from these that is 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.770
 were the mainland seen by the islanders 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.450
 with I call it - even on weekends 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.890
 yes and it's really new wind 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.599
 we are therefore in the part 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.859
 north above this boston 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.580
 in the naturally most beautiful part of the north coast 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.560
 and I must say that the mena has something special not by chance all the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.750
 American presidents including shells go there regularly 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.670
 why many 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.780
 of the noble American families of the coast this and enriched by others 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.980
 parts of america a cotte gali lali if I can have to char 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:42.859
 the capital of the state is augusta have an exactly the most well-known place of the 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.600
 pepepepepe world 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.560
 it gives itself of the united states while instead a protagonist no tav of the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.720
 life of the meringues not the lobster but the lobster to the new sister - the e mail 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.679
 I want you here 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:03:00.069
 and here I want you because the American mouse flies exactly that 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.919
 that thing that marco zuki described to you has been delivered for centuries in 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.870
 particular from the inhabitants of the blacks 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.679
 the poorest of ct 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:12.879
 exact granta to me it is not so many that they don't know where to put evening 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.040
 unfortunately there is art lobster tables that is not the perception that 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.099
 we have the lobster among us the one of the least and if you have ever had the 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.200
 I wish I could eat healthy 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.310
 It is much more dulce and has a much better meat than can be found 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.710
 in the Mediterranean 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.330
 the lobster of the minds frankly they treat badly it is of an absolute goodness 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.870
 that I receive a lobster for kharja those that are big and not from the coast 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.330
 like us. we are used to seeing it among other things 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.630
 which then returns from the main usually takes the plane boston airport 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.650
 boston and matto - detached the live lobster peru brought home if you want it right 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.509
 hehe 16 million of those yesterday 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:51.500
 deported annually 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.380
 in the film letters the third was a period for which we were tired on 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.880
 plaques delman play-off to remove because 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.420
 became west air sent oo pluma Russian American iso mu market that 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.120
 works I think I remember maybe I'm wrong that it's off the coast of the 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.059
 also pay some importance to fishing 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:14.399
 to the whale. in the centuries, not letting yourself die in the whale of the - is a sentence 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:15.249
 typical 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.319
 of north east america so we think the open mind and leter ceter 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:24.069
 etcetera and to that by now by now passed we are in the 800 in which they took the oil 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:25.180
 for the lamps 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.099
 from the year spermaceti from the head of the sperm whales etcetera 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.399
 let's go to something else luciano simbolo ciao ciao firenze is as if i'm shivering 

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:37.509
 he calls cyclades and I don't know for sure what it is while the flower in white paint 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.430
 with also being that it should be like the Ipp of the Pinot Blanc 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.780
 instead it is a flower in order to say however the symbol of the state this 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.500
 you can compare to check on the internet so much so that the nickname 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.940
 del - is just the paint free x fighters 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.780
 there are pilus for all exactooo wonderful wooded areas all along the east coast 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.999
 it is particularly via the north-east and very green part 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:06.949
 elman you may not even meet anyone for weeks inside 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:12.029
 these bosch is of an infinite beauty that alternates this sea coast 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:13.469
 type du ferra 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:16.469
 Connard large forested these islands in front 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.240
 objectively makes it one of the most beautiful states to see that everything is you 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.680
 find in the American east 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.309
 not by chance, as mentioned before, there are Africans only 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:29.709
 we also have a music to choose from as always this time 

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:31.749
 we don't really know a company 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:36.849
 which way to go to ward off maybe a soundtrack from some movie taken from 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.680
 stiven king was a possibility but we were too much about the thriller so what 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.400
 and I was inspired by another reason of the men if possible even more famous 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.669
 and important with respect to stephen king that such john ford that is one of the maxima e 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.960
 directors the history of American and world food by Pietro Elisabetta born in 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.070
 menu for the. john ford the one of red shadows to say one of fury that 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.440
 remains my favorite movie among his 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.590
 and so we choose the soundtrack we will have instrumental not a song of me 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.470
 this case 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.760
 I would say that with pon bros we go bassanza soulseek now makes miracles marco mirra
