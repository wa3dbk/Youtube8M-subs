suppose that was testament to the school
that<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.780> can't<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.289> don't<00:01:37.320> define<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.310> by

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that you can't you don't define it by

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429 
that you can't you don't define it by
what<00:01:38.850> year<00:01:39.060> you're<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.929> grow<00:01:40.170> naturally

713<00:01:54.270> anyone<00:01:55.049> can<00:01:55.229> get<00:01:55.380> involved

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
713 anyone can get involved

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.249 
713 anyone can get involved
I<00:01:56.009> suppose<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.459> another<00:01:56.729> opportunity<00:01:57.599> for

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
I suppose it's another opportunity for

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.199 
I suppose it's another opportunity for
people<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:59.009> something<00:01:59.700> outside<00:01:59.849> the

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
people to do something outside the

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.779 
people to do something outside the
classroom<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:01.140> sport<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.830> music<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.490> guess

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
classroom like sport like music I guess

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.130 
classroom like sport like music I guess
I<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.030> probably<00:02:03.149> quite<00:02:03.420> worried<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.959> first

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
I was probably quite worried the first

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.929 
I was probably quite worried the first
day<00:02:04.319> as<00:02:04.470> everyone<00:02:04.799> probably<00:02:05.039> wasn't<00:02:05.310> nervous

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
day as everyone probably wasn't nervous

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.270 
day as everyone probably wasn't nervous
but<00:02:06.720> there's<00:02:07.409> nothing<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.009> worried<00:02:08.220> about

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
but there's nothing to be worried about

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.039 
but there's nothing to be worried about
because<00:02:08.610> you're<00:02:08.700> looked<00:02:08.880> after<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.420> well<00:02:09.690> you

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
because you're looked after so well you

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.110 
because you're looked after so well you
very<00:02:10.289> quickly<00:02:10.560> become<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> part<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.819> school

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
very quickly become a part of the school

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.420 
very quickly become a part of the school
and<00:02:12.269> that's<00:02:13.049> very<00:02:13.440> well<00:02:13.650> done<00:02:13.860> right<00:02:14.160> from<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and that's very well done right from the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.199 
and that's very well done right from the
word<00:02:14.790> go<00:02:14.849> first<00:02:15.299> day<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:16.230> come<00:02:17.069> here<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.519> you

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
word go first day you come here and you

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.130 
word go first day you come here and you
become<00:02:18.540> part<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.840> something<00:02:20.599> I'm<00:02:21.599> Jordan

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
become part of something I'm Jordan

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.979 
become part of something I'm Jordan
Dylan<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.709> I'm<00:02:22.829> in<00:02:22.980> year<00:02:23.400> 13<00:02:23.579> been<00:02:24.569> here<00:02:24.780> since

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
Dylan and I'm in year 13 been here since

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.020 
Dylan and I'm in year 13 been here since
year<00:02:25.140> seven<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.769> this<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.069> my<00:02:26.190> seventh<00:02:26.549> year<00:02:26.730> I

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
year seven so this is my seventh year I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.690 
year seven so this is my seventh year I
think<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.690> schools<00:02:27.989> had<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> massive<00:02:29.250> hand<00:02:29.459> in

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
think the schools had a massive hand in

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.599 
think the schools had a massive hand in

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
how I've changed just the kind of ethos

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.440 
how I've changed just the kind of ethos
of<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.970> school<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:35.430> expectations<00:02:36.269> the
