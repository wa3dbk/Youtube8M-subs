some<00:00:37.829> inconsistencies<00:00:38.210> but<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.239> think<00:00:39.570> that's

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
some inconsistencies but I think that's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.270 
some inconsistencies but I think that's
just<00:00:39.780> me<00:00:40.110> being<00:00:40.140> picky<00:00:41.270> I<00:00:42.860> really<00:00:43.860> liked<00:00:44.129> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
just me being picky I really liked it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.360 
just me being picky I really liked it
even<00:00:44.520> though<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:45.000> slow<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> beginning

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
even though it was slow in the beginning

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.830 
even though it was slow in the beginning
it<00:00:47.370> has<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:48.149> lot<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:50.059> Sparta<00:00:51.199> soldiers<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
it has a lot of the Sparta soldiers and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.689 
it has a lot of the Sparta soldiers and
main<00:00:54.840> character<00:00:55.410> who<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:58.699> she

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
main character who is kind of not she

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
main character who is kind of not she
doesn't<00:00:59.969> start<00:01:00.300> off<00:01:00.480> strong<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.260> she<00:01:01.320> goes

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
doesn't start off strong so she goes

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.650 
doesn't start off strong so she goes
through<00:01:01.980> his<00:01:02.070> character<00:01:02.489> arc<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.879> yeah<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
through his character arc and yeah it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.929 
through his character arc and yeah it
just<00:01:03.719> was<00:01:04.320> through<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.860> whole<00:01:05.220> journey<00:01:05.489> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
just was through this whole journey and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.649 
just was through this whole journey and
I<00:01:06.750> know<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.200> lot<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.409> hype<00:01:07.740> around<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
I know there was a lot of hype around it

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.039 
I know there was a lot of hype around it
even<00:01:09.950> having<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> compared<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.520> Harry<00:01:11.700> Potter

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
even having it compared to Harry Potter

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.590 
even having it compared to Harry Potter
there<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.200> no<00:01:13.760> comparison<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.000> harry<00:01:15.299> potter

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
there is no comparison to harry potter

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
there is no comparison to harry potter
and<00:01:15.960> i<00:01:16.439> think<00:01:16.619> people<00:01:16.740> are<00:01:16.920> getting<00:01:17.040> confused

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and i think people are getting confused

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.730 
and i think people are getting confused
with<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.180> fact<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.810> set<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.409> boring
