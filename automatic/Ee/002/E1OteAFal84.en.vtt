00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.210 

one<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> important<00:01:28.800> things<00:01:29.190> that<00:01:31.220> anglers

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
one of the important things that anglers

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.260 
one of the important things that anglers
often<00:01:32.880> miss<00:01:33.120> is<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.170> how<00:01:34.950> complicated<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
often miss is just how complicated and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.850 
often miss is just how complicated and
how<00:01:36.600> abundant<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.920> community<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.860> that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
how abundant the community is of that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.160 
how abundant the community is of that
makes<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> food<00:01:41.580> chain<00:01:41.910> for<00:01:42.300> for<00:01:42.900> a<00:01:42.930> bass

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
makes up the food chain for for a bass

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.560 
makes up the food chain for for a bass
for<00:01:43.470> example<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.550> have<00:01:44.850> fish<00:01:45.150> that<00:01:45.180> feed

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
for example so you have fish that feed

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.040 
for example so you have fish that feed
on<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.900> bottom<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.650> suckers<00:01:48.050> minnows

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
on the bottom like the suckers minnows

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.830 
on the bottom like the suckers minnows
and<00:01:49.550> alewives<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.880> things<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.240> feed<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and alewives and things that feed in

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.130 
and alewives and things that feed in
mid-water<00:01:52.290> all<00:01:53.190> of<00:01:53.729> these<00:01:53.909> things<00:01:54.240> provide

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
mid-water all of these things provide

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.730 
mid-water all of these things provide
babies<00:01:56.899> that<00:01:57.899> some<00:01:58.770> size<00:01:59.160> bass<00:01:59.610> somewhere<00:02:00.330> are

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
babies that some size bass somewhere are

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.830 
babies that some size bass somewhere are
just<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:02.070> size<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.610> eat<00:02:02.789> and<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.690> it's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
just the right size to eat and so it's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.389 
just the right size to eat and so it's
really<00:02:04.050> important<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.770> all<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.160> all

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
really important to have all the all

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.199 
really important to have all the all
those<00:02:06.740> native<00:02:07.740> species<00:02:08.100> that<00:02:08.310> make<00:02:08.820> up<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
those native species that make up the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.449 
those native species that make up the
food<00:02:09.360> chain<00:02:09.420> around<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.500> order<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.070> grow<00:02:11.310> up

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
food chain around in order to grow up

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.470 
food chain around in order to grow up
large<00:02:11.910> bass<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:14.070> course<00:02:14.340> something<00:02:15.209> gets

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
large bass of course something gets

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.420 
large bass of course something gets
introduced<00:02:15.959> like<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.350> round<00:02:16.590> goby<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.070> for

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
introduced like the round goby and for

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.880 
introduced like the round goby and for
years<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:17.910> thought<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.360> was<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.630> past<00:02:18.930> we've

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
years we thought that was the past we've

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.890 
years we thought that was the past we've
seen<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.370> somehow<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.880> bass<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.480> caught<00:02:21.750> on

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
seen that somehow the bass of caught on

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.320 
seen that somehow the bass of caught on
and<00:02:22.200> they're<00:02:22.470> eating<00:02:23.280> them<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.580> abundance<00:02:24.060> and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
and they're eating them in abundance and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.420 
and they're eating them in abundance and
growing<00:02:24.750> bigger<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.500> more<00:02:25.890> abundant<00:02:26.130> than

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
growing bigger and more abundant than

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.030 
growing bigger and more abundant than
ever<00:02:26.700> before<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.470> thing<00:02:28.739> that<00:02:28.890> we

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
ever before so this thing that we

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.699 
ever before so this thing that we
regarded<00:02:29.910> as<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> pest<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.840> it's<00:02:31.049> still<00:02:31.320> kind

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
regarded as a pest and it's still kind

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.100 
regarded as a pest and it's still kind
of<00:02:31.769> still<00:02:32.610> an<00:02:32.790> introduced<00:02:33.269> pest<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.930> we'd

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
of still an introduced pest that we'd

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.740 
of still an introduced pest that we'd
rather<00:02:34.320> not<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:34.980> but<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.120> interesting<00:02:36.420> to

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
rather not have but it's interesting to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.050 
rather not have but it's interesting to
see<00:02:37.110> how<00:02:37.140> it's<00:02:37.500> been<00:02:37.980> integrated<00:02:38.670> into<00:02:38.850> the
