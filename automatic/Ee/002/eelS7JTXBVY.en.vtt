00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.479 
felt like it was from you know I
remember<00:03:44.390> when<00:03:44.720> playing<00:03:45.380> black<00:03:45.590> ops<00:03:45.709> 1<00:03:45.859> that

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
remember when playing black ops 1 that

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.060 
remember when playing black ops 1 that
this<00:03:46.670> is<00:03:46.850> somebody's<00:03:47.570> imagination<00:03:47.859> that<00:03:48.859> this

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
this is somebody's imagination that this

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.590 
this is somebody's imagination that this
whole<00:03:49.340> thing<00:03:49.670> is<00:03:50.530> happening<00:03:51.530> in<00:03:51.950> someone's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
whole thing is happening in someone's

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.550 
whole thing is happening in someone's
you<00:03:53.600> know<00:03:53.690> sort<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.930> like<00:03:53.989> Twilight<00:03:54.380> Zone

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
you know sort of like Twilight Zone

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.830 
you know sort of like Twilight Zone
someone's<00:03:54.890> imagination<00:03:55.579> that<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:56.569> it<00:03:56.659> wasn't

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
someone's imagination that and it wasn't

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.199 
someone's imagination that and it wasn't
real<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.409> think<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:57.830> cutscenes<00:03:58.400> sort<00:03:59.150> of

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
real and I think this cutscenes sort of

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.670 
real and I think this cutscenes sort of
goes<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.690> that<00:03:59.840> point<00:04:00.170> where

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
goes to that point where

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.280 
goes to that point where
you<00:04:01.430> know<00:04:01.519> what<00:04:01.700> this<00:04:01.879> was<00:04:02.090> all<00:04:02.290> Samantha's

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
you know what this was all Samantha's

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.800 
you know what this was all Samantha's
and<00:04:03.700> Eddie's<00:04:04.700> so<00:04:05.150> that<00:04:05.269> we<00:04:05.480> would<00:04:05.629> toughen

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
and Eddie's so that we would toughen

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.030 
and Eddie's so that we would toughen
sort<00:04:06.230> of<00:04:06.319> play<00:04:07.780> imagination<00:04:08.780> right<00:04:08.930> but<00:04:09.859> then

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
sort of play imagination right but then

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.300 
sort of play imagination right but then
here's<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.370> thing<00:04:10.579> you'll<00:04:11.569> notice<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:12.310> at

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
here's the thing you'll notice that at

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.550 
here's the thing you'll notice that at
the<00:04:13.519> ends<00:04:13.879> Mathis<00:04:14.239> says<00:04:14.450> oh<00:04:14.629> my<00:04:14.989> daddy<00:04:15.200> has<00:04:15.530> a
