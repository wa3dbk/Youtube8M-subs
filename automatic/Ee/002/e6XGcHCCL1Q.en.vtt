a day that is really afraid that that is

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.229 
a day that is really afraid that that is
honestly<00:02:18.390> really<00:02:18.629> really<00:02:18.930> great<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.340> May

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239

honestly really really great that on May
fourteenth<00:02:21.870> he's<00:02:22.109> reached<00:02:22.379> three<00:02:22.799> million

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
fourteenth he's reached three million

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.330 
fourteenth he's reached three million
subscribers<00:02:23.579> and<00:02:23.760> now<00:02:24.060> as<00:02:24.299> of<00:02:24.780> jun<00:02:25.469> 26<00:02:26.069> was<00:02:26.310> a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
subscribers and now as of jun 26 was a

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.589 
subscribers and now as of jun 26 was a
day<00:02:26.549> that<00:02:26.579> he<00:02:26.879> reached<00:02:27.090> 4<00:02:27.390> million

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
day that he reached 4 million

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.390 
day that he reached 4 million
subscribers<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.680> was<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.920> course<00:02:29.159> of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
subscribers so that was the course of

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.849 
subscribers so that was the course of
six<00:02:29.730> weeks<00:02:30.030> though<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> really<00:02:31.500> great

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
six weeks though that is a really great

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.759 
six weeks though that is a really great
pace<00:02:32.280> right<00:02:32.579> there<00:02:32.909> so<00:02:33.450> every<00:02:33.780> six<00:02:34.019> weeks<00:02:34.109> he's

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
pace right there so every six weeks he's

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.240 
pace right there so every six weeks he's
reaching<00:02:35.430> another<00:02:35.909> million<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:37.379> by<00:02:37.829> next<00:02:37.889> year

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
reaching another million so by next year

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.649 
reaching another million so by next year
he's<00:02:38.549> going<00:02:38.639> to<00:02:38.760> reach<00:02:38.969> 10<00:02:39.359> million

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
he's going to reach 10 million

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.729 
he's going to reach 10 million
subscribers<00:02:41.090> unless<00:02:42.090> there's<00:02:42.209> another<00:02:42.739> jump

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
subscribers unless there's another jump

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.149 
subscribers unless there's another jump
from<00:02:43.980> 25,000<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:45.000> like<00:02:45.299> 40,000<00:02:46.079> a<00:02:46.260> day<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:46.680> I

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
from 25,000 to like 40,000 a day but I

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.530 
from 25,000 to like 40,000 a day but I
don't<00:02:47.669> know<00:02:47.760> what's<00:02:47.939> going<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.120> go<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.209> there

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
don't know what's going to go on there

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
don't know what's going to go on there
but<00:02:48.840> still<00:02:49.109> pretty<00:02:49.620> much<00:02:49.889> at<00:02:50.189> least<00:02:50.489> by<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
but still pretty much at least by the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.099 
but still pretty much at least by the
2014<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> year<00:02:53.280> he<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.519> gonna<00:02:53.730> reach<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:55.280> wait<00:02:56.280> I

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
2014 a year he is gonna reach to wait I

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.170 
2014 a year he is gonna reach to wait I
don't<00:02:58.109> know<00:02:58.169> if<00:02:58.290> I'm<00:02:58.379> thinking<00:02:58.980> right<00:02:59.219> why

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
don't know if I'm thinking right why

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.270 
don't know if I'm thinking right why
then<00:03:00.329> if<00:03:00.959> anything<00:03:01.169> else<00:03:01.500> by<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.799> end<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.099> this

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
then if anything else by the end of this

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.699 
then if anything else by the end of this
year<00:03:02.760> he's<00:03:03.209> gonna<00:03:03.389> reach<00:03:03.629> 10<00:03:03.959> million<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:04.530> I

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
year he's gonna reach 10 million and I

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.170 
year he's gonna reach 10 million and I
will<00:03:04.919> not<00:03:05.040> doubt<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.310> he'll<00:03:05.609> reach<00:03:05.879> there

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
will not doubt that he'll reach there

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.119 
will not doubt that he'll reach there
that<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:07.200> course<00:03:07.230> he's<00:03:07.560> gonna<00:03:07.680> reach<00:03:07.889> 5

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
that of course he's gonna reach 5

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.339 
that of course he's gonna reach 5
million<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.579> then<00:03:08.849> just<00:03:09.689> he's<00:03:10.079> going<00:03:10.230> to

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
million and then just he's going to

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.599 
million and then just he's going to
continue<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.739> do<00:03:10.859> what<00:03:11.040> he<00:03:11.129> does<00:03:11.280> and

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
continue to do what he does and

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.429 
continue to do what he does and
eventually<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.569> going<00:03:12.659> to<00:03:12.750> reach<00:03:12.870> 10<00:03:13.169> million

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
eventually is going to reach 10 million

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.629 
eventually is going to reach 10 million
because<00:03:13.620> that's<00:03:13.769> going<00:03:13.889> to<00:03:13.980> be<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.069> threshold

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
because that's going to be a threshold

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.610 
because that's going to be a threshold
that<00:03:14.819> a<00:03:15.180> lot<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.569> big<00:03:15.689> youtubers<00:03:16.260> going<00:03:16.560> to

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
that a lot of big youtubers going to

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.589 
that a lot of big youtubers going to
reach<00:03:16.829> now<00:03:17.159> we<00:03:17.669> already<00:03:17.849> had<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.090> 1,000,000

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
reach now we already had that 1,000,000

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.750 
reach now we already had that 1,000,000
then<00:03:19.199> we<00:03:19.290> had<00:03:19.379> that<00:03:19.500> 5<00:03:19.739> million<00:03:20.159> and<00:03:20.250> now<00:03:20.699> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
then we had that 5 million and now the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.680 
then we had that 5 million and now the
threshold<00:03:21.659> is<00:03:21.840> up<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.169> 10<00:03:22.530> million<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.209> will

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
threshold is up to 10 million so I will

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.990 
threshold is up to 10 million so I will
not<00:03:24.810> doubt<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:25.049> he's<00:03:25.319> gonna<00:03:25.440> reach<00:03:25.650> there

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
not doubt that he's gonna reach there

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000 
not doubt that he's gonna reach there
and<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.269> course<00:03:27.510> there's<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.010> infinite

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
and of course there's the infinite

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.469 
and of course there's the infinite
source<00:03:29.189> of<00:03:29.310> diamond<00:03:29.699> I<00:03:29.879> just<00:03:30.150> kind<00:03:30.359> of<00:03:30.389> leave

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
source of diamond I just kind of leave

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.020 
source of diamond I just kind of leave
that<00:03:30.720> there<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.349> always<00:03:31.799> spawned<00:03:32.129> every<00:03:32.819> time

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
that there it always spawned every time

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.530 
that there it always spawned every time
I<00:03:33.299> patch<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.930> up<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.349> save<00:03:35.069> I<00:03:35.310> exit<00:03:35.849> come<00:03:36.329> back

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
I patch it up I save I exit come back

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.979 
I patch it up I save I exit come back
hours<00:03:36.930> later<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.769> spawns<00:03:38.159> again<00:03:38.750> what<00:03:39.750> can<00:03:39.900> I

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
hours later it spawns again what can I

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.589 
hours later it spawns again what can I
