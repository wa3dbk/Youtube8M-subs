00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
surprised to see this today I was like

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.410 
surprised to see this today I was like
what<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.479> world<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:23.460> look<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
what in the world so look at all of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.030 
what in the world so look at all of
those<00:01:24.720> eggs<00:01:26.570> those<00:01:27.570> are<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:27.869> Finch<00:01:28.350> eggs<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
those eggs those are all Finch eggs and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:39.380 
those eggs those are all Finch eggs and
little<00:01:29.400> java<00:01:29.670> rice<00:01:29.909> Finch<00:01:30.270> eggs<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:39.210> then

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
little java rice Finch eggs and then

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.770 
little java rice Finch eggs and then
inside<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.259> nest<00:01:40.619> box<00:01:41.060> there's<00:01:42.060> also<00:01:42.329> some

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.819 
inside that nest box there's also some
eggs<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:44.329> I<00:01:45.329> think<00:01:45.659> there's<00:01:45.840> actually<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829

few eggs in there I'm not sure I'm gonna
bring<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:50.880> here

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.670 

just<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.890> Graham<00:02:05.160> Finch<00:02:05.490> over<00:02:05.790> there

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
just like Graham Finch over there

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.790 
just like Graham Finch over there
so<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.149> amazed<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:09.929> see<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.170> many

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
so is this amazed to see that many

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.890 
so is this amazed to see that many
inches<00:02:12.080> nesting<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.200> one<00:02:13.440> nest<00:02:13.740> box<00:02:14.570> so<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.600> used

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
inches nesting on one nest box so I used

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.530 
inches nesting on one nest box so I used
to<00:02:16.020> see<00:02:16.200> them<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.440> lot<00:02:16.590> Finch<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:18.150> know<00:02:18.240> staying

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
to see them a lot Finch you know staying

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.580 
to see them a lot Finch you know staying
together<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.670> laying<00:02:20.670> their<00:02:20.850> eggs<00:02:21.560> but<00:02:22.560> I

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
together and laying their eggs but I

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.280 
together and laying their eggs but I
think<00:02:22.830> that's<00:02:23.010> just<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.370> game<00:02:23.520> too<00:02:23.730> much<00:02:24.290> so

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
think that's just a game too much so

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.220 
think that's just a game too much so
these<00:02:25.440> double<00:02:25.860> rights<00:02:26.040> are<00:02:26.220> about<00:02:26.930> well<00:02:27.930> this

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
these double rights are about well this

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.500 
these double rights are about well this
little<00:02:28.530> pie<00:02:28.739> here<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.130> about<00:02:29.430> less<00:02:30.239> than<00:02:30.420> a

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
little pie here is about less than a

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.110 
little pie here is about less than a
year<00:02:30.660> old<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.400> white<00:02:32.610> one<00:02:32.790> there<00:02:32.970> is

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
year old and the white one there is

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.920

about<00:02:33.360> three<00:02:33.660> years<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:35.030> my<00:02:36.030> normal<00:02:36.570> pear<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
about three years and my normal pear I

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.729 
about three years and my normal pear I
would<00:02:39.930> say<00:02:40.200> about<00:02:40.410> four<00:02:41.130> years<00:02:41.310> range<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:43.680> I

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
would say about four years range so I

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.680

the<00:03:49.739> java<00:03:49.980> rice<00:03:50.130> finches<00:03:50.579> I<00:03:50.730> just<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.690> these

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
the java rice finches I just have these

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.949 
the java rice finches I just have these
four<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.739> needed<00:03:53.190> an<00:03:53.280> extra<00:03:53.720> Finch<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:54.930> I

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
four and I needed an extra Finch so I

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.479 
four and I needed an extra Finch so I
decided<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.380> get<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.500> PI<00:03:55.739> which<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.190> normally

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
decided to get a PI which I normally

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.560 
decided to get a PI which I normally
don't<00:03:56.579> like<00:03:56.730> tides<00:03:57.030> but<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.360> one's<00:03:57.510> very

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
don't like tides but this one's very

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.710 
don't like tides but this one's very
pretty<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.820> thought<00:04:00.030> they<00:04:00.180> need<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.510> be<00:04:00.630> in

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
pretty and I thought they need to be in

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.990 
pretty and I thought they need to be in
pairs

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
pairs

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.690 
pairs
and<00:04:03.560> as<00:04:04.560> always<00:04:04.769> finches<00:04:05.310> aren't<00:04:05.519> really

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
and as always finches aren't really

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.690 
and as always finches aren't really
valuable<00:04:06.560> but<00:04:07.560> if<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.800> have<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:07.980> large<00:04:08.310> flight

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
valuable but if you have a large flight

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.400 
valuable but if you have a large flight
cage<00:04:08.970> that's<00:04:09.180> very<00:04:09.420> tall<00:04:09.690> they<00:04:10.080> were<00:04:10.110> you're

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
cage that's very tall they were you're

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.729 
cage that's very tall they were you're
better<00:04:10.650> in<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.040> large<00:04:11.580> flight<00:04:11.940> cage<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.739> of

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
better in a large flight cage and of

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.470 
better in a large flight cage and of

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
course give them a lot of nest boxes to

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.240
