the<00:00:21.869> fossil<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.100> let's<00:00:23.490> go<00:00:24.500> what<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.650> will

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the fossil one so let's go what you will

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.830 
the fossil one so let's go what you will
need<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.220> some<00:00:26.460> view<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.000> white<00:00:27.210> clay<00:00:27.539> and

need is some view and white clay and
still<00:00:28.380> sort<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.769> pointed<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.390> shape

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
still sort of pointed to just to shape

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.560 
still sort of pointed to just to shape
the<00:00:31.080> little<00:00:31.380> pieces<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.920> go<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.160> top<00:00:32.570> just

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the little pieces that go on top just

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.600 
the little pieces that go on top just
take<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> ball<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.200> blue<00:00:34.440> clay<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.070> flatten<00:00:35.520> it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.310 
take a ball of blue clay and flatten it
down<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.969> slightly<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.690> make<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> sort

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
down just slightly just to make the sort

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.850 
down just slightly just to make the sort
of<00:00:37.440> dome<00:00:37.710> shape<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.500> you're<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
of dome shape and then you're going to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.680 
of dome shape and then you're going to
take<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.100> white<00:00:44.430> clay<00:00:44.670> make<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> decorations

take a white clay make the decorations
again<00:00:46.200> rule<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.770> log<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.160> claim<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.610> you're

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
again rule out a log of claim if you're

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:57.820 
again rule out a log of claim if you're
quite<00:00:47.969> thin<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.320> make<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.710> coil<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.399> top

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.260 

and<00:00:58.830> then<00:00:59.010> use<00:00:59.220> a<00:00:59.250> blade<00:00:59.580> to<00:00:59.640> cut<00:00:59.820> off<00:01:00.120> any

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and then use a blade to cut off any

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.219 
and then use a blade to cut off any
excess<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.500> well<00:01:02.780> you're<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.080> add<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
excess as well you're going to add a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.620 
excess as well you're going to add a
little<00:01:04.350> dots<00:01:04.890> at<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.160> bottom<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
little dots at the bottom just for the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.770 
little dots at the bottom just for the
dogs<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.650> don't<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.100> describe<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.630> then

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
dogs I don't we now describe it and then

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.140 
dogs I don't we now describe it and then
you're<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.440> make<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.890> style<00:01:11.400> for<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.880> top

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you're going to make a style for the top

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.600 
you're going to make a style for the top
as<00:01:12.450> well<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.440> is<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:13.890> difficult<00:01:14.100> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
as well this is going to be difficult so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.310 
as well this is going to be difficult so
you<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> small<00:01:15.390> store<00:01:15.720> cookie<00:01:16.110> cutter

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
you have a small store cookie cutter

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.050 
you have a small store cookie cutter
that<00:01:16.619> will<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.860> very<00:01:17.010> helpful<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.940> do

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
that will be very helpful I have to do

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
that will be very helpful I have to do
it<00:01:18.180> by<00:01:18.330> hand<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:19.290> use<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.619> pointer<00:01:19.979> tool<00:01:20.220> to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it by hand we use the pointer tool to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.480 
it by hand we use the pointer tool to
create<00:01:20.610> five<00:01:21.180> indents<00:01:21.960> around<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.800> then

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
create five indents around it and then

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.330 
create five indents around it and then
use<00:01:23.970> my<00:01:24.210> fingers<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.630> pinch<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.470> gaps<00:01:26.070> in

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
use my fingers to pinch the gaps in

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.790 
use my fingers to pinch the gaps in
between<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.760> indents<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:28.050> calc<00:01:28.259> make<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> star

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
between the indents the calc make a star

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.530 
between the indents the calc make a star
shape<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.369> hard<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.729> explain<00:01:29.970> i<00:01:30.149> hope<00:01:30.390> you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
shape it's hard to explain i hope you

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.050 
shape it's hard to explain i hope you
can<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.930> from<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.229> video<00:01:31.369> but<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> small

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
can see from the video but get a small

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.370 
can see from the video but get a small
cookie<00:01:33.420> cutter<00:01:33.660> and<00:01:33.930> it'll<00:01:34.080> be<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.350> much

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
cookie cutter and it'll be so much

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.210 
cookie cutter and it'll be so much
easier<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:36.259> should<00:01:37.259> look<00:01:37.410> like<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.830> and<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
easier it should look like this and you

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.889 
easier it should look like this and you
can<00:01:38.250> place<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> gap<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
can place this on in the gap on the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.320 
can place this on in the gap on the
fossil<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.430> done<00:01:41.910> really

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
fossil and then that's that done really

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.960 
fossil and then that's that done really
easy<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.130> we're<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> make<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
easy so now we're going to make the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.889 
easy so now we're going to make the
pitfall<00:01:45.420> seed<00:01:45.780> after<00:01:46.289> that<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.810> need

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
pitfall seed after that so all you need

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.139 
pitfall seed after that so all you need
is<00:01:49.289> some<00:01:49.320> red<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.800> white<00:01:50.160> clay<00:01:50.520> you're<00:01:51.000> going

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
is some red and white clay you're going

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.210 
is some red and white clay you're going
to<00:01:51.210> make<00:01:51.330> a<00:01:51.600> dome<00:01:51.990> shape<00:01:52.020> exactly<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.979> same

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
to make a dome shape exactly the same

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.490 
to make a dome shape exactly the same
way<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.640> did<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.270> fossil<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.960> then

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
way as you did for the fossil and then

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.969 
way as you did for the fossil and then
for<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> exclamation<00:01:56.670> mark<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.080> taper

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
for the exclamation mark you go to taper
