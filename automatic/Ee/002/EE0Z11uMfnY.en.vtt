00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730 

I<00:00:02.000> think<00:00:03.000> everybody<00:00:03.330> who<00:00:03.480> grows<00:00:03.840> corn<00:00:04.319> wants

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
I think everybody who grows corn wants

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.320 
I think everybody who grows corn wants
to<00:00:04.830> be<00:00:04.920> able<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.190> get<00:00:05.400> it<00:00:05.520> from<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:05.970> stage

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
to be able to get it from this stage

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.600 
to be able to get it from this stage
into<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.109> freezer<00:00:07.350> stage<00:00:07.710> so<00:00:08.130> that<00:00:08.160> they<00:00:08.400> can

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
into the freezer stage so that they can

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.240 
into the freezer stage so that they can
have<00:00:09.000> fresh<00:00:09.690> corn<00:00:10.019> or<00:00:10.290> fresh<00:00:10.500> tasting<00:00:10.889> corn<00:00:11.130> on

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
hopefully you'll give this one a try and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.880 
hopefully you'll give this one a try and
find<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.079> will<00:00:46.230> work<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
find out that this one will work for you

corn<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> cob<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> little<00:00:48.930> bit<00:00:49.079> tricky

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
corn on the cob is a little bit tricky

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.869 
corn on the cob is a little bit tricky
to<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.559> into<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> freezer<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.730> not

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
to get into the freezer because it's not

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.910 
to get into the freezer because it's not
all<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> same<00:00:51.360> size<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.260> comes<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
all the same size and it comes out of

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.069 
all the same size and it comes out of
the<00:00:52.980> garden<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.300> things<00:00:54.570> sticking<00:00:54.870> out

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the garden it's got things sticking out

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.990 
the garden it's got things sticking out
on<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> end<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> some<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.610> them<00:00:56.730> are<00:00:56.850> bigger

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
on the end of it some of them are bigger

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700 
on the end of it some of them are bigger
around<00:00:57.270> than<00:00:57.420> others<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.410> want<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
around than others and so we want to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.970 
around than others and so we want to
first<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.399> all<00:00:59.460> sort<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.149> size<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:01.109> that

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
first of all sort it for size and that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.579 
first of all sort it for size and that
would<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.399> only<00:01:02.460> length<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> degree<00:01:04.439> but

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
would be not only length to a degree but

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.380 
would be not only length to a degree but
also<00:01:04.830> diameter<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> blanching

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
also diameter because the blanching

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.030 
also diameter because the blanching
process<00:01:06.510> will<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.110> different<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.650> something

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
process will be different for something

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.350 
process will be different for something
that's<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.369> big<00:01:08.610> around<00:01:08.850> then<00:01:09.180> for

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that's this big around then for

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.780 
that's this big around then for
something<00:01:09.570> that's<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.080> big<00:01:10.320> around<00:01:10.790> let's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
something that's this big around let's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.490 
something that's this big around let's
go<00:01:11.939> ahead<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.270> cut<00:01:12.420> off<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.780> tail<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.290> this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
go ahead and cut off the tail on this

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.770 
go ahead and cut off the tail on this
one<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> end<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> cob<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
one or the end of the cob here not that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.539 
one or the end of the cob here not that
this<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> problem<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> freezer<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.280> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
this is a problem in the freezer but it

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.160 
this is a problem in the freezer but it
takes<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.210> space<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.020> more

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
takes up space so that it's more

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.200 
takes up space so that it's more
difficult<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.650> pack<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.159> may<00:01:20.250> poke<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> hole<00:01:20.939> in

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
difficult to pack it may poke a hole in

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.580 
difficult to pack it may poke a hole in
your<00:01:21.299> freezer<00:01:21.540> bag<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.049> kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.320> thing<00:01:22.470> so

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
your freezer bag that kind of thing so

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.780 
your freezer bag that kind of thing so
we<00:01:22.710> want<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.040> rid<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.610> reason

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
we want to get rid of it for that reason

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.240 
we want to get rid of it for that reason
we<00:01:24.479> also<00:01:24.659> want<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> cut<00:01:25.590> them<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:25.979> they're<00:01:26.130> all

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
we also want to cut them so they're all

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
we also want to cut them so they're all
similar<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.850> length<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.330> size<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.259> have

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
similar in length for size so I have

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.740 
similar in length for size so I have
some<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:29.040> cut<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.850> packing<00:01:30.450> mine

some that are cut here I'm packing mine
about<00:01:30.990> six<00:01:31.290> inches<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.770> length<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.040> could<00:01:32.280> do

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
about six inches in length you could do

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
about six inches in length you could do
yours<00:01:32.579> longer<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.119> shorter<00:01:33.150> four<00:01:33.720> inches<00:01:34.020> as<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
yours longer or shorter four inches as a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.980 
yours longer or shorter four inches as a
common<00:01:34.619> length<00:01:34.799> also<00:01:35.150> it's<00:01:36.150> simply<00:01:36.479> again<00:01:36.720> for

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
common length also it's simply again for

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.350 
common length also it's simply again for
packing<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:38.100> I'm<00:01:38.250> doing<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.700> now<00:01:38.909> I'm<00:01:39.150> not

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
packing that I'm doing that now I'm not

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.330 
packing that I'm doing that now I'm not
going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> throw<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.140> part<00:01:40.470> away<00:01:40.560> fighting

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
going to throw this part away fighting

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.740 
going to throw this part away fighting
it<00:01:41.490> rid<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.729> whatever<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.240> finger<00:01:42.420> part

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
it rid of whatever is on my finger part

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.289 
it rid of whatever is on my finger part
of<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.899> rest<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.500> corn<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.060> save

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
of the rest of the corn this I will save

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.090 
of the rest of the corn this I will save
to<00:01:45.689> either<00:01:45.899> cook<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.320> dinner<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.710> we'll<00:01:46.860> have

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
to either cook for dinner and we'll have

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.620 
to either cook for dinner and we'll have
a<00:01:47.130> little<00:01:47.460> party<00:01:47.759> eating<00:01:48.000> them<00:01:48.119> all<00:01:48.270> off<00:01:48.450> there

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
a little party eating them all off there

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.569 
a little party eating them all off there
or<00:01:48.869> more<00:01:49.140> often<00:01:49.320> we'll<00:01:49.649> use<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.250> relish

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
or more often we'll use this for relish

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.370 
or more often we'll use this for relish
so<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.299> something<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.899> say<00:01:52.079> rather

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
so that is something that you say rather

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.530 
so that is something that you say rather
than<00:01:52.500> discard<00:01:53.040> now<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.820> next<00:01:54.149> step<00:01:54.329> will<00:01:54.509> be

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
than discard now the next step will be

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.410 
than discard now the next step will be
to<00:01:54.630> measure<00:01:55.020> them<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.799> diameter<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:57.210> we'll

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to measure them for diameter so we'll

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.730 
to measure them for diameter so we'll
look<00:01:57.600> through<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.170> we'll<00:01:58.380> get<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> couple

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
look through here and we'll get a couple

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.410 
look through here and we'll get a couple
of<00:01:58.979> different<00:01:59.399> ones<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.790> diameter<00:02:00.299> is

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
of different ones the diameter is

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.450 
of different ones the diameter is
because<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.500> wider<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> bigger

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
because the the wider it is the bigger

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.800 
because the the wider it is the bigger
around<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.060> longer<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.509> takes<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
around it is the longer it takes the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.899 
around it is the longer it takes the
heat<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> center<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.700> as

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
heat to get to the center this one as

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.650 
heat to get to the center this one as
you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.060> see<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.780> little<00:02:07.530> over<00:02:07.910> two<00:02:08.910> inches

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
you can see is a little over two inches

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
you can see is a little over two inches
in<00:02:09.899> diameter<00:02:10.700> this<00:02:11.700> one<00:02:11.970> is

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
in diameter this one is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.420 
in diameter this one is
is<00:02:12.799> closer<00:02:13.219> to<00:02:13.370> one<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.420> half<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:16.010> one<00:02:16.250> is

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
is closer to one and a half this one is

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.490 
is closer to one and a half this one is
closer<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.849> one<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.359> a<00:02:17.390> half<00:02:17.599> as<00:02:17.959> are<00:02:18.349> these

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
closer to one and a half as are these

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.959 
closer to one and a half as are these
two<00:02:18.709> here<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.099> we<00:02:19.219> could<00:02:19.340> put<00:02:19.489> all<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.700> these

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:19.969 
two here so we could put all of these

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.880 
two here so we could put all of these
together<00:02:20.239> as<00:02:20.719> being<00:02:21.049> similar<00:02:21.500> in<00:02:21.650> size<00:02:21.829> and

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
together as being similar in size and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.679 
together as being similar in size and
going<00:02:22.340> into<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.640> blancher<00:02:23.000> at<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.180> same<00:02:23.420> time

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
going into the blancher at the same time

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.530 
going into the blancher at the same time
water<00:02:24.560> blanching<00:02:25.219> is<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.549> best<00:02:25.760> choice<00:02:26.090> so

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
water blanching is the best choice so

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.849 
water blanching is the best choice so
we're<00:02:26.689> going<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.840> go<00:02:26.989> ahead<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:27.349> put<00:02:27.590> these<00:02:27.799> in

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
we're going to go ahead and put these in

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.789 
we're going to go ahead and put these in
to<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:29.150> water<00:02:29.359> blanch<00:02:29.810> your<00:02:30.079> basket<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:30.739> is

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
to the water blanch your basket this is

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.500 
to the water blanch your basket this is
also<00:02:31.040> sometimes<00:02:31.489> called<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.909> spaghetti<00:02:32.120> pot

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
also sometimes called a spaghetti pot

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.970 
also sometimes called a spaghetti pot
because<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.900> water<00:02:33.079> can<00:02:33.260> go<00:02:33.409> in<00:02:33.590> real<00:02:33.769> quick

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
because the water can go in real quick

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.190 
because the water can go in real quick
and<00:02:34.010> drain<00:02:34.459> away<00:02:34.700> real<00:02:34.939> fast<00:02:34.969> it's<00:02:35.750> important

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
and drain away real fast it's important

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.110 
and drain away real fast it's important
that<00:02:36.349> you<00:02:36.439> start<00:02:36.769> and<00:02:37.010> stop<00:02:37.040> cooking<00:02:37.609> as<00:02:37.879> fast

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
that you start and stop cooking as fast

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.509 
that you start and stop cooking as fast
as<00:02:38.299> you<00:02:38.389> can<00:02:38.569> when<00:02:38.810> you're<00:02:38.930> blanching

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
as you can when you're blanching

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.890 
as you can when you're blanching
blanching<00:02:40.519> is<00:02:40.700> valuable<00:02:41.389> if<00:02:41.540> you're<00:02:41.569> going<00:02:41.840> to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
blanching is valuable if you're going to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.569 
blanching is valuable if you're going to
keep<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.139> in<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.349> freezer<00:02:42.530> any<00:02:42.859> longer<00:02:43.400> than

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
keep it in the freezer any longer than

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.080 
keep it in the freezer any longer than
one<00:02:43.819> month<00:02:44.090> because<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.599> deactivate<00:02:45.439> enzymes

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
one month because it deactivate enzymes

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.640 
one month because it deactivate enzymes
that<00:02:47.090> cause<00:02:47.269> nutritional<00:02:47.900> loss<00:02:48.049> flavor<00:02:48.409> loss

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
that cause nutritional loss flavor loss

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.490 
that cause nutritional loss flavor loss
quality<00:02:49.280> loss<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.849> also<00:02:50.239> cleans<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.019> outside

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
quality loss it also cleans the outside

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.339 
quality loss it also cleans the outside
it<00:02:52.040> destroys<00:02:52.430> bacteria<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.780> get<00:02:54.019> a<00:02:54.049> higher

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
it destroys bacteria so you get a higher

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.740 
it destroys bacteria so you get a higher
quality<00:02:54.620> product<00:02:55.129> if<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.939> put<00:02:56.209> both<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.480> these

quality product if you put both of these

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.229 
quality product if you put both of these
in<00:02:57.019> at<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:57.500> same<00:02:57.739> time<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.669> one<00:02:58.939> will<00:02:59.090> not

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
in at the same time this one will not

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.179 
in at the same time this one will not
heat<00:02:59.599> enough<00:03:00.049> or<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:00.500> one<00:03:00.680> will<00:03:00.829> heat<00:03:01.010> too

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
heat enough or this one will heat too

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.129 
heat enough or this one will heat too
much<00:03:01.219> the<00:03:01.939> one<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.180> heats<00:03:02.569> not<00:03:02.689> enough

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
much the one that heats not enough

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.080 
much the one that heats not enough
you'll<00:03:03.349> actually<00:03:03.709> activate<00:03:04.250> enzymes<00:03:04.459> and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
you'll actually activate enzymes and

you'll actually activate enzymes and
increase<00:03:05.450> your<00:03:05.480> rate<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.959> spoilage<00:03:06.379> one<00:03:06.950> that

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
increase your rate of spoilage one that

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.490 
increase your rate of spoilage one that
doesn't<00:03:07.280> clench<00:03:07.790> long<00:03:08.239> enough<00:03:08.569> you'll<00:03:09.439> find

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
doesn't clench long enough you'll find

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.220 
doesn't clench long enough you'll find

this will take as long as it took to

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.089 
this will take as long as it took to
blanch<00:04:05.689> so<00:04:06.019> that<00:04:06.169> if<00:04:06.259> you<00:04:06.379> had<00:04:06.560> ears<00:04:06.829> that<00:04:06.979> were

one and a quarter to one and a half you

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.800 
one and a quarter to one and a half you
do<00:04:12.199> this<00:04:12.349> for<00:04:12.680> nine<00:04:13.129> minutes<00:04:13.519> and

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
diameter you do this for 11 minutes so

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.360 
diameter you do this for 11 minutes so
that<00:04:17.230> you<00:04:17.440> make<00:04:17.590> sure<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.829> you<00:04:17.919> stop<00:04:18.220> the

cooking quickly otherwise you get that

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.720 
cooking quickly otherwise you get that
long<00:04:20.230> cooking<00:04:20.650> time<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.220> cobby<00:04:21.430> tastes
