to<00:00:20.110> fly<00:00:20.289> the<00:00:20.350> brushed<00:00:20.740> motor<00:00:21.010> and<00:00:21.430> that<00:00:22.119> motor

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
to fly the brushed motor and that motor

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.509 
to fly the brushed motor and that motor
wasn't<00:00:22.630> very<00:00:22.750> good<00:00:22.810> at<00:00:22.960> all<00:00:23.080> it<00:00:23.440> uh<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:24.220> speed

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
wasn't very good at all it uh the speed

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.490 
wasn't very good at all it uh the speed
control<00:00:24.580> kept<00:00:25.000> messing<00:00:25.330> up<00:00:25.449> and<00:00:25.660> I<00:00:26.259> for

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
control kept messing up and I for

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
throttle would cut out and you'd lose

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.359 
throttle would cut out and you'd lose
control<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.470> service<00:00:29.830> to<00:00:30.009> you<00:00:30.070> while<00:00:30.220> it

control the service to you while it

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.600 
control the service to you while it
would<00:00:30.519> cut<00:00:30.699> out<00:00:30.730> and<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.920> is<00:00:33.010> didn't<00:00:33.280> work<00:00:33.400> I've

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
would cut out and it is didn't work I've

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.460 
would cut out and it is didn't work I've
had<00:00:33.820> any<00:00:33.940> power<00:00:34.240> and<00:00:34.420> everything<00:00:34.510> so<00:00:35.350> we

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
had any power and everything so we

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.100 
had any power and everything so we
changed<00:00:35.860> it<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:37.239> got<00:00:37.450> this<00:00:37.630> one<00:00:37.870> I've<00:00:37.989> seen

pulls<00:00:56.590> it<00:00:56.710> with<00:00:57.160> no<00:00:57.310> problem<00:00:57.700> we<00:00:57.850> fought

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
pulls it with no problem we fought

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.370 
pulls it with no problem we fought
around<00:00:58.810> a<00:00:59.220> half<00:01:00.220> throttle<00:01:00.520> just<00:01:00.910> under<00:01:01.180> it<00:01:01.210> and

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
around a half throttle just under it and

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.259 
around a half throttle just under it and
then<00:01:02.380> I<00:01:02.410> just<00:01:02.860> hit<00:01:03.310> it<00:01:03.340> wide<00:01:03.520> open<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.880> go<00:01:04.000> up<00:01:04.150> or

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
then I just hit it wide open to go up or

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.390 
then I just hit it wide open to go up or
whatever<00:01:04.390> bit<00:01:04.659> stuff<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:05.740> get<00:01:05.890> set<00:01:06.159> up<00:01:06.189> in<00:01:06.340> the

whatever bit stuff to get set up in the
Holy<00:01:06.610> weighs<00:01:06.820> anything<00:01:07.020> didn't<00:01:08.020> add<00:01:08.200> any

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
Holy weighs anything didn't add any

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.140 
Holy weighs anything didn't add any
weight<00:01:08.530> really<00:01:08.830> long<00:01:09.700> same<00:01:09.880> ways<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.090> little

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
weight really long same ways a little

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.719 
weight really long same ways a little
more<00:01:10.450> is<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.630> motor<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:11.310> mean<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.399> motor<00:01:12.549> the

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
more is the motor I mean the motor the

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.630 
more is the motor I mean the motor the
battery<00:01:13.920> because<00:01:14.920> I<00:01:15.070> had<00:01:15.189> to<00:01:15.249> go<00:01:15.340> up<00:01:15.429> into<00:01:15.579> the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
battery because I had to go up into the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.919 
battery because I had to go up into the
three<00:01:15.909> steps<00:01:16.179> and<00:01:16.359> actually<00:01:16.600> get<00:01:16.659> us<00:01:16.780> a<00:01:16.810> little

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
three steps and actually get us a little

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.440 
three steps and actually get us a little
bit<00:01:17.049> bigger<00:01:17.399> now<00:01:18.399> is<00:01:18.549> it<00:01:18.670> was<00:01:18.850> really<00:01:19.240> easy<00:01:19.299> to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
bit bigger now is it was really easy to

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.190 
bit bigger now is it was really easy to
do<00:01:19.630> but<00:01:20.350> original<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.159> wires<00:01:21.369> came<00:01:21.759> out<00:01:22.200> right

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
do but original the wires came out right

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.499 
do but original the wires came out right
back<00:01:23.439> here<00:01:23.679> in<00:01:23.859> what<00:01:24.100> underneath<00:01:24.549> and<00:01:24.819> ran<00:01:25.390> on

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
back here in what underneath and ran on

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.209 
back here in what underneath and ran on
top<00:01:25.659> of<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.869> wing<00:01:26.049> and<00:01:26.259> I<00:01:26.859> came<00:01:27.069> out<00:01:27.189> here

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
top of the wing and I came out here

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.770 
top of the wing and I came out here
which<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:29.200> couldn't<00:01:29.649> do<00:01:29.770> with<00:01:29.950> this<00:01:30.039> one<00:01:30.219> here

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
which I couldn't do with this one here

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.760 
which I couldn't do with this one here
plus<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.899> want<00:01:32.079> to<00:01:32.140> mount<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.469> speed<00:01:32.710> control

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
plus I want to mount the speed control

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.620 
plus I want to mount the speed control
on<00:01:33.009> top<00:01:33.219> I<00:01:33.429> guess<00:01:33.579> maybe<00:01:33.789> later<00:01:34.090> we<00:01:34.270> could<00:01:34.359> cut

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
on top I guess maybe later we could cut

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.690 
on top I guess maybe later we could cut
something<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.200> then<00:01:35.380> push<00:01:36.069> the<00:01:36.100> speak<00:01:36.520> until

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
something and then push the speak until

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.539 
something and then push the speak until
in<00:01:36.850> there<00:01:36.969> so<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.119> looks<00:01:37.329> a<00:01:37.389> little<00:01:37.479> cleaner

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
in there so it looks a little cleaner

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.889 
in there so it looks a little cleaner
but<00:01:39.549> what<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.700> did<00:01:39.880> this<00:01:39.939> is<00:01:40.119> right<00:01:40.450> here<00:01:40.659> i<00:01:40.689> cut

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
but what I did this is right here i cut

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.950 
but what I did this is right here i cut
a<00:01:40.929> hole<00:01:41.109> out<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.549> ran<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.850> wires<00:01:43.030> down<00:01:43.240> i<00:01:43.569> had

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
a hole out and ran the wires down i had

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.169 
a hole out and ran the wires down i had
to<00:01:44.049> cut<00:01:44.200> another<00:01:44.259> hole<00:01:44.439> out<00:01:44.740> right<00:01:44.920> here<00:01:45.189> i<00:01:45.399> can

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
to cut another hole out right here i can

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:47.309 
to cut another hole out right here i can
grab<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:46.479> wires<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:46.869> pull<00:01:47.020> them<00:01:47.079> underneath

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
grab the wires and pull them underneath

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.309 
grab the wires and pull them underneath
and<00:01:48.240> trying<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.299> try<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.719> keep<00:01:49.899> it<00:01:50.049> clean<00:01:50.229> as

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
and trying to try to keep it clean as

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.870 
and trying to try to keep it clean as
possible<00:01:50.409> even<00:01:51.009> though<00:01:51.310> this<00:01:51.459> is<00:01:51.670> still

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
possible even though this is still

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.739 
possible even though this is still
sitting<00:01:52.090> here<00:01:52.319> but<00:01:53.319> um<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:55.090> works<00:01:55.299> really<00:01:55.479> good

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
sitting here but um it works really good

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.359 
sitting here but um it works really good
we're<00:01:56.049> happy<00:01:56.229> this<00:01:56.530> set<00:01:56.740> up<00:01:56.859> in<00:01:56.950> it's<00:01:57.069> easy<00:01:57.100> to

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
we're happy this set up in it's easy to

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.520 
we're happy this set up in it's easy to
fly<00:01:57.549> and<00:01:57.819> you<00:01:58.030> can<00:01:58.689> get<00:01:58.780> up<00:01:58.899> and<00:01:58.929> cut<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.350> motor

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
fly and you can get up and cut the motor

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.770 
fly and you can get up and cut the motor
off<00:01:59.619> and<00:02:00.009> glide<00:02:00.189> forever<00:02:00.609> I'm<00:02:01.420> going<00:02:01.539> to<00:02:01.600> glide

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
off and glide forever I'm going to glide

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.199 
off and glide forever I'm going to glide
for<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.020> long<00:02:02.170> time<00:02:02.639> you<00:02:03.639> kind<00:02:03.759> of<00:02:03.880> need<00:02:03.969> to<00:02:04.029> try

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
for a long time you kind of need to try

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.269 
for a long time you kind of need to try
to<00:02:04.270> do<00:02:04.389> some<00:02:04.569> thermal<00:02:04.929> hunting<00:02:05.889> with<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.130> and

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:06.279 
to do some thermal hunting with it and

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:07.469 
to do some thermal hunting with it and
see<00:02:06.399> how<00:02:06.429> it<00:02:06.549> does<00:02:06.729> home<00:02:07.029> and<00:02:07.179> keep<00:02:07.299> it<00:02:07.420> up

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
see how it does home and keep it up

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.620 
see how it does home and keep it up
without<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.779> motive<00:02:08.580> then<00:02:09.580> anyway<00:02:09.850> we'll

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
without the motive then anyway we'll

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.030 
without the motive then anyway we'll
give<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.869> shot<00:02:10.899> with<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.290> flying<00:02:11.500> around<00:02:11.709> some

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
give it a shot with a flying around some

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.150 
give it a shot with a flying around some
and<00:02:12.990> we'll<00:02:13.990> see<00:02:14.170> how<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.319> goes<00:02:14.410> oh<00:02:14.939> here<00:02:15.939> goes

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.520 

when<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.220> give<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.489> stock<00:02:19.730> motor<00:02:20.530> comes

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
when you give it a stock motor comes

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.910 
when you give it a stock motor comes
right

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
right

too what we like about this one here is
that<00:03:22.920> came<00:03:23.099> with<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.310> ailerons<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:25.099> instead

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
that came with the ailerons and instead

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.880 
that came with the ailerons and instead
of<00:03:26.250> writer<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.610> elevator<00:03:26.940> only<00:03:27.829> because<00:03:28.829> a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
of writer and elevator only because a

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.710 
of writer and elevator only because a
bunch<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.220> now<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.459> they<00:03:29.970> have<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.360> Corrado

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
bunch of now you they have this Corrado

bunch of now you they have this Corrado
elevator<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.379> rudder<00:03:31.409> and<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:31.890> turns

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
elevator and rudder and it turns

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.039 
elevator and rudder and it turns
different<00:03:32.459> letters<00:03:32.819> which<00:03:33.510> leaves<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.930> right

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
different letters which leaves it right

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.170 
different letters which leaves it right
on<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.319> to<00:03:34.470> turn<00:03:34.620> compound<00:03:35.069> depend<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.120> how

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
on this to turn compound depend on how

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.400 
on this to turn compound depend on how
to<00:03:36.239> eat<00:03:36.450> if<00:03:36.540> we're<00:03:36.629> going<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.989> might<00:03:37.200> use<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
to eat if we're going to I might use the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.170 
to eat if we're going to I might use the
rudder<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.680> turn<00:03:37.890> it's<00:03:38.670> nice<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.030> have<00:03:39.120> a

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
rudder to turn it's nice to have a

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.970 
rudder to turn it's nice to have a
L'Orange<00:03:39.599> you<00:03:40.019> can<00:03:40.170> fly<00:03:40.319> like<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> normal<00:03:40.799> phone

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
L'Orange you can fly like a normal phone

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.910 
L'Orange you can fly like a normal phone
more<00:03:41.519> or<00:03:41.579> less<00:03:42.349> alternate<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.379> rudder<00:03:43.620> I'll

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
more or less alternate the rudder I'll

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.020 
more or less alternate the rudder I'll
turn<00:03:44.160> left<00:03:45.950> speaking<00:03:46.950> my<00:03:47.099> pipe<00:03:48.090> bank<00:03:48.420> with<00:03:48.629> us

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
turn left speaking my pipe bank with us

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.190 
turn left speaking my pipe bank with us
so<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.120> go<00:03:51.239> either<00:03:51.390> way<00:03:51.510> with<00:03:51.599> it's<00:03:51.959> good<00:03:52.109> to

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
so you go either way with it's good to

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.280 
so you go either way with it's good to
have<00:03:52.260> both<00:03:52.470> we<00:03:52.890> like<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.310> have<00:03:53.700> them<00:03:53.849> do<00:03:53.970> a

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
have both we like that I have them do a

have both we like that I have them do a
you<00:03:55.290> know<00:03:55.409> cut<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.769> surfaces<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.310> add

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
you know cut the surfaces and add

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.339 
you know cut the surfaces and add
something<00:03:56.640> like<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.940> later<00:04:00.049> hear<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.319> motor

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
something like that later hear the motor

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:10.369 
something like that later hear the motor
off<00:04:01.680> right<00:04:02.430> now<00:04:02.579> I'm<00:04:02.640> using<00:04:02.730> relative<00:04:03.180> time

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:21.420 

yep<00:04:11.580> camera<00:04:12.629> another<00:04:13.629> part<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:13.989> me

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.980 

there<00:04:22.430> there's<00:04:22.610> no<00:04:22.760> motive<00:04:23.170> button<00:04:24.170> around

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
there there's no motive button around

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.910 
there there's no motive button around
it's<00:04:26.990> kind<00:04:27.140> of<00:04:27.290> something<00:04:27.500> like<00:04:27.710> what<00:04:27.890> I

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
it's kind of something like what I

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.150 
it's kind of something like what I
learned<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.220> fly<00:04:28.340> on<00:04:28.640> one<00:04:28.820> time<00:04:29.330> ago<00:04:29.540> I<00:04:30.320> had<00:04:31.130> a

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
learned to fly on one time ago I had a

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.720 
learned to fly on one time ago I had a
plane<00:04:31.880> call<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.240> gear<00:04:32.450> so<00:04:32.720> status<00:04:33.350> 2000<00:04:33.890> and<00:04:34.130> is

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
plane call it gear so status 2000 and is

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.580 
plane call it gear so status 2000 and is
the<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.850> RF<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.630> it<00:04:35.720> was<00:04:35.840> electric<00:04:36.230> but<00:04:36.440> there's

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
the a RF and it was electric but there's

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.980 
the a RF and it was electric but there's
a<00:04:36.650> lot<00:04:36.830> different<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:37.940> had<00:04:38.060> a<00:04:38.090> brush<00:04:38.360> motor<00:04:38.630> and

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
a lot different it had a brush motor and

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.980 
a lot different it had a brush motor and
the<00:04:39.860> big<00:04:40.130> heavy<00:04:40.460> battery<00:04:40.820> packs<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.330> the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
the big heavy battery packs and the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.050 
the big heavy battery packs and the
servers<00:04:42.380> were<00:04:42.410> small<00:04:42.800> but<00:04:42.830> not<00:04:43.220> like<00:04:43.580> this<00:04:43.610> is

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
servers were small but not like this is

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.900
