phenomenal day but what makes the

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.140 
phenomenal day but what makes the
difference<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.940> his<00:05:12.120> bait<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.810> know<00:05:14.000> it<00:05:15.000> was

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
difference is his bait you know it was

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.210 
difference is his bait you know it was
impossible<00:05:15.509> before<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.410> find<00:05:16.650> a<00:05:16.770> bait<00:05:17.009> that

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
impossible before to find a bait that

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.330 
impossible before to find a bait that
had<00:05:17.520> both<00:05:18.180> action<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:18.870> durability<00:05:19.410> he<00:05:20.160> had

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
had both action and durability he had

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.520 
had both action and durability he had
one<00:05:20.580> of<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.759> other<00:05:20.970> either<00:05:21.570> was<00:05:21.930> so<00:05:22.110> durable

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
one of the other either was so durable

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.279 
one of the other either was so durable
that<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:22.919> fish<00:05:23.130> like<00:05:23.370> a<00:05:23.400> stick<00:05:23.849> or<00:05:24.479> it<00:05:24.840> had<00:05:25.020> so

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
that it fish like a stick or it had so

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.469 
that it fish like a stick or it had so
much<00:05:25.500> action<00:05:26.039> that<00:05:26.250> if<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.580> got<00:05:26.729> one<00:05:26.970> bite<00:05:27.240> to

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
much action that if you got one bite to

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.089 
much action that if you got one bite to
bear<00:05:27.690> with<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.289> bait<00:05:28.500> was<00:05:28.650> tore<00:05:28.919> in<00:05:29.070> half

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
bear with the bait was tore in half

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.730 
bear with the bait was tore in half
right<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.330> tail<00:05:30.599> would<00:05:30.810> be<00:05:30.870> bit<00:05:31.229> off<00:05:31.440> and

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
right and the tail would be bit off and

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.249 
right and the tail would be bit off and
all<00:05:31.889> that<00:05:32.160> exactly<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.330> this<00:05:33.479> I<00:05:33.720> find<00:05:33.990> that

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
all that exactly and this I find that

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.890 
all that exactly and this I find that
you<00:05:34.740> just<00:05:34.919> don't<00:05:35.099> have<00:05:35.220> that<00:05:35.340> at<00:05:35.639> all<00:05:35.789> no<00:05:36.210> this

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
you just don't have that at all no this

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.409 
you just don't have that at all no this
thing<00:05:37.139> is<00:05:37.169> so<00:05:37.470> durable<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.970> know<00:05:39.090> this<00:05:39.270> is

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
thing is so durable you know this is

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.999 
thing is so durable you know this is
only<00:05:39.570> my<00:05:39.780> second<00:05:40.229> one<00:05:40.349> today<00:05:40.590> and<00:05:40.919> I'll

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
only my second one today and I'll

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.240 
only my second one today and I'll
probably<00:05:41.220> call<00:05:41.580> it<00:05:41.699> twenty<00:05:42.030> fish<00:05:43.039> the<00:05:44.039> thing

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
probably call it twenty fish the thing

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.430 
probably call it twenty fish the thing
is<00:05:44.370> just<00:05:44.550> it's<00:05:45.000> phenomenal<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:45.840> like<00:05:46.110> what<00:05:46.349> I'm

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
is just it's phenomenal I like what I'm

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.320 
is just it's phenomenal I like what I'm
seeing<00:05:46.740> in<00:05:47.009> it<00:05:47.130> I<00:05:47.310> haven't<00:05:47.580> seen<00:05:47.759> it<00:05:48.120> in<00:05:48.150> any

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
seeing in it I haven't seen it in any

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.529 
seeing in it I haven't seen it in any
other<00:05:48.570> bait<00:05:48.930> thus<00:05:49.410> far<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:50.039> and<00:05:50.880> I<00:05:50.970> think<00:05:51.240> I

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
other bait thus far and and I think I

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.029 
other bait thus far and and I think I
think<00:05:51.870> we<00:05:51.990> got<00:05:52.139> something<00:05:52.410> going<00:05:52.620> here<00:05:52.800> with

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
think we got something going here with

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.189 
think we got something going here with
this<00:05:53.250> I<00:05:53.490> think<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.270> market<00:05:54.720> is<00:05:54.810> gonna<00:05:55.020> be

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
this I think the market is gonna be

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.990 
this I think the market is gonna be
phenomenal<00:05:55.380> for<00:05:55.919> this<00:05:56.070> bait<00:05:56.310> it's<00:05:56.669> gonna<00:05:56.789> be

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
phenomenal for this bait it's gonna be

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.680 
phenomenal for this bait it's gonna be
in<00:05:57.090> high<00:05:57.240> demand<00:05:57.349> once<00:05:58.349> it's<00:05:58.500> released
