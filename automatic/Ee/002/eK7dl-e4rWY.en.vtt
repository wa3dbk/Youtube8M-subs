00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.980
 good morning Good afternoon Good night 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.500
 good morning, now I'm going to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.329
 present how to improve your souls without 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.329
 need to be in every moment 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.430
 in my bag I have a helmet and I have a 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:22.029
 layer which will serve me at 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.439
 next example that I look for each 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.439
 who debuts perfects 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.160
 let's go to my helmet let's go to the part 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:42.110
 internal is allowed for cases 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.110
 one more that is in the tables 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.760
 and automatically 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:54.710
 if it is spent that does have to be from 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.500
 Same color so you do not 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.350
 so it's from the same unit if you put 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.840
 for example 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.890
 on another level 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.890
 is going to show you 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:14.880
 which showed that they are the lowest 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.060
 80 to 74 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.650
 a previous example 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.440
 the same 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:28.900
 86 will pass 86 and 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.340
 the first one has been free so think 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.640
 and ready 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.510
 this already happens to be in my bag or what 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.000
 You can use for the next 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.150
 loose that well 2000 gold I'm not going to 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.150
 to take advantage of 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.450
 that's all friends let's continue 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.570
