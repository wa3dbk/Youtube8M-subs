one of the myths for December 21st 2012
is<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.180> Earth's<00:00:06.359> axes<00:00:07.109> are<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:08.099> to

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
is that the Earth's axes are going to

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.540 
is that the Earth's axes are going to
somehow<00:00:08.340> shift<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:10.200> rotation<00:00:11.010> axes<00:00:11.309> can't

made a simple chart to get an idea you

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.680 
made a simple chart to get an idea you
know<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:34.010> what<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.730> actual<00:02:34.910> facts<00:02:35.450> are

telling<00:02:36.019> us<00:02:36.459> so<00:02:37.459> from<00:02:37.900> 1999<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.470> 2009<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:41.450> can

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
telling us so from 1999 to 2009 you can

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.940 
telling us so from 1999 to 2009 you can
see<00:02:41.930> there's<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.380> clear<00:02:43.209> trend<00:02:44.209> of<00:02:44.510> increasing

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
see there's a clear trend of increasing

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.380 
see there's a clear trend of increasing
earthquakes<00:02:46.269> but<00:02:47.269> oh<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:49.519> blue<00:02:49.760> lines<00:02:50.060> are

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
earthquakes but oh the blue lines are

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.530 
earthquakes but oh the blue lines are
the<00:02:50.480> total<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:52.340> yellow<00:02:52.640> lines<00:02:53.000> are

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
the total the yellow lines are

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.330 
the total the yellow lines are
everything<00:02:54.109> less<00:02:55.010> than<00:02:55.250> five<00:02:55.579> and<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:58.069> pink

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
everything less than five and the pink

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.860 
everything less than five and the pink
line<00:02:58.549> is<00:02:58.850> 5<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.390> above<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.680> going<00:03:01.579> back<00:03:01.730> to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
line is 5 and above so going back to

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.740 
line is 5 and above so going back to
2009<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:03.859> see<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.340> there's<00:03:04.819> a<00:03:04.910> huge<00:03:05.329> drop

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
2009 you see that there's a huge drop

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.490 
2009 you see that there's a huge drop
off<00:03:06.549> because<00:03:07.549> of<00:03:08.090> those<00:03:08.450> earthquakes<00:03:08.840> that

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
off because of those earthquakes that

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.410 
off because of those earthquakes that
the<00:03:10.250> USGS<00:03:10.970> is<00:03:11.150> no<00:03:11.389> longer<00:03:11.769> locating<00:03:13.269> but<00:03:14.269> if

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
the USGS is no longer locating but if

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.770 
the USGS is no longer locating but if
you<00:03:14.540> look<00:03:14.720> at<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.109> major<00:03:15.350> earthquakes<00:03:16.780> you

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
you look at the major earthquakes you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.430 
you look at the major earthquakes you
see<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.230> trend<00:03:18.590> continues<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:19.370> increase<00:03:20.440> but

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
see the trend continues to increase but

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.879 
see the trend continues to increase but
without<00:03:22.310> those<00:03:22.579> earthquakes<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:24.620> whole

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
without those earthquakes this whole

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.300 
without those earthquakes this whole
chart<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.609> just<00:03:25.850> it's<00:03:26.750> no<00:03:27.079> longer<00:03:27.350> comparable

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
chart you just it's no longer comparable

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.000 
chart you just it's no longer comparable
you<00:03:28.670> there's<00:03:29.239> no<00:03:29.480> way<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:30.019> get<00:03:30.230> any<00:03:30.470> idea

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
you there's no way you can get any idea

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.680 
you there's no way you can get any idea
of<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.489> total<00:03:32.389> trending<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.400> think<00:03:35.180> this<00:03:35.540> is

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
of the total trending so I think this is

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.979 
of the total trending so I think this is
another<00:03:36.049> way<00:03:36.380> that<00:03:37.040> they're<00:03:37.700> trying<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.720> hide

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
another way that they're trying to hide

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.600 
another way that they're trying to hide
more<00:03:39.350> evidence<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.930> just<00:03:41.930> as<00:03:42.310> just<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.430> let

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
more evidence and just as just to let

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.140 
more evidence and just as just to let
you<00:03:43.730> know<00:03:43.879> for<00:03:44.140> 2012<00:03:45.189> these<00:03:46.189> are<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.610> total

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
you know for 2012 these are the total

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.520 
you know for 2012 these are the total
earthquakes

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
earthquakes

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.380 
earthquakes
that<00:03:48.800> are<00:03:48.950> reported<00:03:49.580> as<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:50.209> 97<00:03:51.130> 2012<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.459> this

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
that are reported as of 97 2012 and this

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.190 
that are reported as of 97 2012 and this
is<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.660> pro-rata<00:03:54.500> just<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.250> get<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.840> very<00:03:56.840> rough

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
is a pro-rata just to get a very rough

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.559 
is a pro-rata just to get a very rough
idea<00:03:57.709> of<00:03:57.770> where<00:03:58.130> we<00:03:58.280> could<00:03:58.640> end<00:03:58.910> up<00:03:59.120> at<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.450> end

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
idea of where we could end up at the end

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.699 
idea of where we could end up at the end
of<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.750> year<00:03:59.780> this<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.800> you<00:04:01.700> know<00:04:01.850> no<00:04:02.120> way<00:04:02.709> one

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
of the year this is you know no way one

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.860 
of the year this is you know no way one
hundred<00:04:04.100> percent<00:04:04.130> indicative<00:04:05.060> of<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.420> future

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
hundred percent indicative of the future

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.180 
hundred percent indicative of the future
but<00:04:06.110> not<00:04:06.380> just<00:04:07.280> some<00:04:07.610> guesstimate<00:04:08.410> but<00:04:09.410> even

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
but not just some guesstimate but even

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.809 
but not just some guesstimate but even
with<00:04:10.459> that<00:04:10.660> without<00:04:11.660> all<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.819> earthquakes

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
with that without all the earthquakes

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.930 
with that without all the earthquakes
less<00:04:14.630> than<00:04:14.870> five<00:04:15.110> there<00:04:15.980> is<00:04:16.100> no<00:04:16.310> way<00:04:16.609> you<00:04:16.669> can

less than five there is no way you can

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.930 
less than five there is no way you can
know<00:04:17.329> what<00:04:17.989> what's<00:04:18.739> really<00:04:19.010> going<00:04:19.459> on<00:04:19.579> in<00:04:19.820> the
