00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.979 
know that when you buy like the virgin
hair<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.970> may<00:03:30.120> get<00:03:30.299> two<00:03:30.450> bundles<00:03:30.659> with<00:03:30.900> the

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
hair you may get two bundles with the

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.839 
hair you may get two bundles with the
same<00:03:31.230> curl<00:03:31.890> pattern<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.430> may<00:03:32.549> get<00:03:32.610> two

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
same curl pattern and you may get two

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.520 
same curl pattern and you may get two
bundles<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.269> have<00:03:33.390> different<00:03:33.629> curl<00:03:34.110> patterns

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
bundles and have different curl patterns

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.640 
bundles and have different curl patterns
so<00:03:35.269> that's<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.420> lot<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.840> have<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.349> work<00:03:37.500> through

not<00:04:26.520> be<00:04:26.700> restricted<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.360> one<00:04:27.930> hair<00:04:28.470> sighs<00:04:29.090> she

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
not be restricted to one hair sighs she

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.300 
not be restricted to one hair sighs she
just<00:04:30.120> left<00:04:30.479> her<00:04:30.570> perimeter<00:04:30.930> out<00:04:31.110> her<00:04:31.229> edges<00:04:31.650> so

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
just left her perimeter out her edges so

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.620 
just left her perimeter out her edges so
it's<00:04:32.639> just<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.849> little<00:04:33.090> bit<00:04:33.210> of<00:04:33.300> her<00:04:33.419> natural

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
it's just a little bit of her natural

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.760 
it's just a little bit of her natural
hair<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:34.020> she's<00:04:34.169> gonna<00:04:34.289> have<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.560> worry

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
hair that she's gonna have to worry

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.320 
hair that she's gonna have to worry
about<00:04:34.889> but<00:04:37.310> yeah<00:04:38.310> blending<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:39.000> things<00:04:39.180> like

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
about but yeah blending and things like

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.540 
about but yeah blending and things like
that<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:39.930> looser<00:04:40.380> pattern<00:04:40.710> too<00:04:40.889> or<00:04:41.250> if<00:04:41.460> you

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
that it looser pattern too or if you

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.800 
that it looser pattern too or if you
have<00:04:41.639> tighter<00:04:41.910> curl<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.360> can<00:04:42.450> get<00:04:42.539> a<00:04:42.570> tighter

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
have tighter curl you can get a tighter

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.650 
have tighter curl you can get a tighter
curl<00:04:43.050> pattern<00:04:43.380> but<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.550> looser<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:45.240> me<00:04:45.419> is<00:04:45.630> a

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
curl pattern but the looser to me is a

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.800 
curl pattern but the looser to me is a
little<00:04:45.810> easier<00:04:46.320> to<00:04:47.039> blend<00:04:47.280> because<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.690> can

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
little easier to blend because you can

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.510 
little easier to blend because you can
do<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:48.960> barely<00:04:49.260> curl<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:49.919> then<00:04:50.039> it<00:04:50.160> just<00:04:50.280> kind

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
do a barely curl and then it just kind

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.500 
do a barely curl and then it just kind
of<00:04:50.550> falls<00:04:50.729> in<00:04:51.030> place<00:04:51.060> or<00:04:51.450> whatever<00:04:51.570> so

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
of falls in place or whatever so

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.360 
of falls in place or whatever so
you<00:04:52.720> know<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.050> then<00:04:53.140> also<00:04:53.320> once<00:04:54.100> you<00:04:54.220> have

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
you know and then also once you have

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.370 
you know and then also once you have
those<00:04:54.550> cruises<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.300> have<00:04:55.450> those<00:04:55.660> nights

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
those cruises and you have those nights

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.900 
those cruises and you have those nights
where<00:04:56.620> you<00:04:56.650> have<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.100> captain's<00:04:57.520> dinner<00:04:57.670> or

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
where you have the captain's dinner or

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.970 
where you have the captain's dinner or
whatever<00:04:58.150> you<00:04:58.750> can<00:04:58.900> flatten<00:04:59.380> it<00:04:59.680> out<00:04:59.770> and

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
whatever you can flatten it out and

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.070 
whatever you can flatten it out and
it'll<00:05:00.100> all<00:05:00.220> blend<00:05:00.550> beautifully<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.780> it's<00:05:01.930> not

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
it'll all blend beautifully and it's not

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.570 
it'll all blend beautifully and it's not
too<00:05:02.320> tight<00:05:02.560> or<00:05:02.590> something<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.220> you<00:05:03.340> can't

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
too tight or something that you can't

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.820 
too tight or something that you can't
flatten<00:05:03.880> out<00:05:04.210> so<00:05:04.960> it's<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.140> lot<00:05:05.290> easier<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.710> work

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
flatten out so it's a lot easier to work

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.720 
flatten out so it's a lot easier to work
with<00:05:06.600> but<00:05:07.830> basically<00:05:08.830> that's<00:05:09.040> it<00:05:09.310> your

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
with but basically that's it your

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.270 
with but basically that's it your
