this is a Kevlar fuel system and as you
can<00:02:12.870> see<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.170> have<00:02:13.230> lots<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.880> horizontal

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
can see we have lots of horizontal

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.759 
can see we have lots of horizontal
baffles<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.300> there<00:02:15.510> now<00:02:16.380> if<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:16.530> didn't<00:02:16.739> have

baffles in there now if we didn't have

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.860 
baffles in there now if we didn't have
these<00:02:16.980> horizontal<00:02:17.250> baffles<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.450> fuel<00:02:18.720> would

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
these horizontal baffles the fuel would

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.479 
these horizontal baffles the fuel would
surge<00:02:19.140> around<00:02:19.470> particularly<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.099> breaking

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
surge around particularly the breaking

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.699 
surge around particularly the breaking
with<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> high<00:02:20.849> IG<00:02:21.750> there<00:02:21.930> was<00:02:22.050> any<00:02:22.290> cornering

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
with a high IG there was any cornering

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.070 
with a high IG there was any cornering
in<00:02:23.220> each<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.610> baffles<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.599> little<00:02:24.870> flat

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
in each of the baffles the little flat

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.809 
in each of the baffles the little flat
files<00:02:25.319> which<00:02:25.830> allow<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.099> fuel<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.459> go<00:02:26.550> down

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
files which allow the fuel to go down

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.140 
files which allow the fuel to go down
another<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.080> as<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.349> fuel<00:02:28.560> fueled<00:02:29.099> rains<00:02:29.489> fuel

another so as the fuel fueled rains fuel

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.820 
another so as the fuel fueled rains fuel
could<00:02:30.299> never<00:02:30.480> come<00:02:30.720> above<00:02:31.349> one<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.709> these

could never come above one of these
horizontal<00:02:32.130> baffles<00:02:32.519> by<00:02:33.420> doing<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
horizontal baffles by doing this you

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.440 
horizontal baffles by doing this you
keep<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.860> center<00:02:35.160> gravity<00:02:35.340> as<00:02:35.730> always<00:02:36.120> as<00:02:36.299> low

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
keep the center gravity as always as low

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.660 
keep the center gravity as always as low
as<00:02:36.569> possible<00:02:36.799> there<00:02:37.799> are<00:02:37.860> also<00:02:37.950> lots<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.430> pipes

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
as possible there are also lots of pipes

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.880 
as possible there are also lots of pipes
and<00:02:39.090> pumps<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.750> here<00:02:39.959> these<00:02:40.319> are<00:02:40.470> positioned

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
and pumps in here these are positioned

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.580 
and pumps in here these are positioned
strategically<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:42.569> feed<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.900> engine<00:02:43.260> while

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
strategically to feed the engine while

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.220 
strategically to feed the engine while
also<00:02:43.830> allowing<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.610> fuel<00:02:44.819> cell<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.150> breathe

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.420 

we've<00:02:49.230> spoken<00:02:49.590> about<00:02:49.769> all<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.099> technical

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
we've spoken about all the technical

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.589 
we've spoken about all the technical
components<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> car<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.420> how<00:02:51.540> we

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
components on the car and how we

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.870 
components on the car and how we
position<00:02:51.870> them<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.530> package<00:02:52.829> them<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.190> guess

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
position them and package them I guess

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.030 
position them and package them I guess
the<00:02:53.970> final<00:02:54.269> piece<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> jigsaw<00:02:54.870> now<00:02:55.079> is<00:02:55.410> to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
the final piece of the jigsaw now is to

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.069 
the final piece of the jigsaw now is to
position<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.430> driver<00:02:56.670> some<00:02:57.569> say<00:02:57.750> he's<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
position the driver some say he's the

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.690 
position the driver some say he's the
most<00:02:58.200> important<00:02:58.620> part<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.010> car<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.459> we're

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
most important part of the car so we're

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.910 
most important part of the car so we're
so<00:02:59.970> let's<00:03:00.150> get<00:03:00.239> him<00:03:00.329> in<00:03:00.450> it's<00:03:01.260> important<00:03:01.890> to

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
so let's get him in it's important to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.979 
so let's get him in it's important to
refit<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.910> are<00:03:03.000> not<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.359> a<00:03:03.450> normal<00:03:03.720> position

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
refit you are not in a normal position

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.860 
refit you are not in a normal position
you<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.190> lot<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.430> forces<00:03:06.000> especially<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.780> a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
you have a lot of forces especially in a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.710 
you have a lot of forces especially in a
crash<00:03:07.109> I<00:03:07.440> had<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.100> big<00:03:08.459> accident<00:03:08.640> last<00:03:09.209> year<00:03:09.359> in

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
crash I had a big accident last year in

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.009 
crash I had a big accident last year in
in<00:03:10.350> Monaco<00:03:10.859> so<00:03:11.100> we<00:03:11.850> we<00:03:12.180> quite<00:03:12.450> know<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.870> it's

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
in Monaco so we we quite know that it's

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.590 
in Monaco so we we quite know that it's
a<00:03:13.139> safe<00:03:13.680> car<00:03:14.010> should<00:03:14.459> we<00:03:14.519> get<00:03:14.609> you<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:14.850> then<00:03:15.030> of

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
a safe car should we get you in then of

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.599 
a safe car should we get you in then of
course<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:17.519> shouldn't<00:03:17.730> comfy<00:03:18.090> well<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.609> know

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
course you shouldn't comfy well I know

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.660 
course you shouldn't comfy well I know
this<00:03:21.569> how<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.930> looks<00:03:22.139> as<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:23.069> told<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.459> not<00:03:23.609> a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
this how it looks as I told you not a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.759 
this how it looks as I told you not a
very<00:03:23.940> comfortable<00:03:24.090> position<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.410> be<00:03:25.530> sitting

very comfortable position to be sitting
in<00:03:26.250> two<00:03:27.239> hours<00:03:27.600> we<00:03:27.840> spoke<00:03:28.049> about<00:03:28.170> getting<00:03:28.829> all

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
in two hours we spoke about getting all

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.069 
in two hours we spoke about getting all
the<00:03:29.040> components<00:03:29.400> as<00:03:30.209> low<00:03:30.420> down<00:03:30.450> on<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.840> cars

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
the components as low down on the cars

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.920 
the components as low down on the cars
as<00:03:31.709> as<00:03:32.400> possible<00:03:32.850> obviously<00:03:33.030> your<00:03:33.450> new

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
as as possible obviously your new

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.050 
as as possible obviously your new
edition<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.380> component<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.700> as<00:03:35.970> you

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
edition of the component to it so as you

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.960 
edition of the component to it so as you
can<00:03:36.150> see<00:03:36.590> your<00:03:37.590> sort<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:37.829> backside<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.489> ten

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
can see your sort of backside is ten

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.520 
can see your sort of backside is ten
millimeters<00:03:39.480> away<00:03:39.600> from<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.959> tarmac<00:03:40.350> not

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
millimeters away from the tarmac not

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.590 
millimeters away from the tarmac not
sure<00:03:40.739> which<00:03:41.160> obviously<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:42.060> know<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.239> feel

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
sure which obviously you know you feel

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.569 
sure which obviously you know you feel
when<00:03:42.870> you're<00:03:43.010> when<00:03:44.010> you're<00:03:44.130> racing<00:03:44.310> in<00:03:44.519> the

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
when you're when you're racing in the

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.809 
when you're when you're racing in the
car<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:45.389> usually<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.660> good<00:03:45.810> gauge<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.700> tell<00:03:47.700> as

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
car it's usually a good gauge to tell as

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.520 
car it's usually a good gauge to tell as
if<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.030> car<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.329> too<00:03:48.510> low<00:03:48.720> because<00:03:48.930> their

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
if the car is too low because their

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.470 
if the car is too low because their
backside<00:03:50.489> maybe<00:03:50.700> gets<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.000> little<00:03:51.120> bit<00:03:51.299> more

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
backside maybe gets a little bit more

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.009 
backside maybe gets a little bit more
yeah<00:03:52.350> are<00:03:52.470> still<00:03:52.680> there<00:03:52.889> fear<00:03:53.310> small<00:03:54.269> touch<00:03:54.480> ya

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
yeah are still there fear small touch ya

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.200 
yeah are still there fear small touch ya
back<00:03:55.680> there<00:03:55.709> yeah

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.490 

safety<00:04:00.210> is<00:04:00.270> obviously<00:04:00.540> paramount<00:04:00.990> in<00:04:01.140> Formula

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
safety is obviously paramount in Formula

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.920 
safety is obviously paramount in Formula
One<00:04:01.620> obviously<00:04:02.100> if<00:04:02.490> anything<00:04:02.940> does<00:04:03.120> happen<00:04:03.270> we

One obviously if anything does happen we

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.480 
One obviously if anything does happen we

at<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.260> track<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:11.130> actual<00:04:11.250> chassis<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.970> one

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
at the track the actual chassis is one

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.940 
at the track the actual chassis is one
big<00:04:12.420> safe<00:04:12.600> haven<00:04:12.990> for<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.200> driver<00:04:13.410> we<00:04:13.800> make

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
big safe haven for the driver we make
