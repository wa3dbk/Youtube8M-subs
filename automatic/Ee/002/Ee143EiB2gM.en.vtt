I

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.359 

so<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.960> award-winning<00:00:22.529> ego<00:00:22.830> technology<00:00:23.250> that

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
so the award-winning ego technology that

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.380 
so the award-winning ego technology that
we're<00:00:23.460> using<00:00:23.580> your<00:00:23.759> own<00:00:23.820> flashpoint<00:00:24.269> has

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
we're using your own flashpoint has

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.970 
we're using your own flashpoint has
allowed<00:00:24.570> us<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> represent<00:00:24.930> war<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> scale

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
allowed us to represent war on a scale

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.040 
allowed us to represent war on a scale
never<00:00:26.009> before<00:00:26.340> seen<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.210> allows<00:00:27.390> us<00:00:27.419> to<00:00:27.930> take

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
never before seen it allows us to take

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.420 
never before seen it allows us to take
advantage<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.770> multi<00:00:29.250> core

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
advantage of the multi core

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.240 
advantage of the multi core
functionality<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.090> each<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.329> the<00:00:30.390> platforms

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
functionality in each of the platforms

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.170 
functionality in each of the platforms
also<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> beautiful<00:00:32.640> system<00:00:32.879> is<00:00:32.970> that<00:00:33.000> it's

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
also the beautiful system is that it's

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.229 
also the beautiful system is that it's
modular<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.320> requirements<00:00:35.239> changes

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
modular so as the requirements changes

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.170 
modular so as the requirements changes
people's<00:00:36.960> expectations<00:00:37.589> change<00:00:37.650> as

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
people's expectations change as

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.250 
people's expectations change as
competitive<00:00:39.180> games<00:00:39.390> come<00:00:39.629> out<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.989> i<00:00:40.110> love

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
competitive games come out and i love

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.110 
competitive games come out and i love
the<00:00:40.379> benchmark<00:00:40.829> we're<00:00:41.280> able<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> assess<00:00:41.879> those

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the benchmark we're able to assess those

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.329 
the benchmark we're able to assess those
and<00:00:42.390> build<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.960> into<00:00:43.320> our<00:00:43.350> cross<00:00:43.920> platform

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
and build that into our cross platform

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.250 
and build that into our cross platform
technology<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> dynamic<00:00:45.329> shelia<00:00:45.659> system<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
technology the dynamic shelia system is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.500 
technology the dynamic shelia system is
has<00:00:47.220> already<00:00:47.339> been<00:00:47.550> developed<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.120> an<00:00:48.210> ego

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
has already been developed with an ego

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.689 
has already been developed with an ego
so<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.899> leverage<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.890> flash<00:00:50.070> point<00:00:50.370> but

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
so we leverage that with flash point but

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.430 
so we leverage that with flash point but
it<00:00:51.030> enabled<00:00:51.510> us<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> put<00:00:51.870> shadows<00:00:52.170> into<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
it enabled us to put shadows into the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.650 
it enabled us to put shadows into the
into<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> game<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:53.399> early<00:00:53.609> on<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.510> you'll

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
into the game very early on and you'll

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.939 
into the game very early on and you'll
see<00:00:54.899> shadows<00:00:55.620> move<00:00:56.340> you'll<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.510> sunset

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
see shadows move you'll see the sunset

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.889 
see shadows move you'll see the sunset
rise<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.519> coloration<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.329> system<00:01:00.780> will

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
rise the coloration of the system will

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.180 
rise the coloration of the system will
change<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.320> well<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.949> all<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
change as well so all the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.490 
change as well so all the
post-processing<00:01:02.820> linked<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.809> with

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
post-processing linked in with the with

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
post-processing linked in with the with
the<00:01:04.530> time<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.920> day<00:01:05.039> we<00:01:05.759> use<00:01:05.880> deferred<00:01:06.179> light

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the time of day we use deferred light

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.779 
the time of day we use deferred light
and<00:01:06.570> really<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.960> gain<00:01:07.429> performance<00:01:08.429> because

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
and really to gain performance because

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:10.760 
and really to gain performance because
you<00:01:08.910> can<00:01:09.030> add<00:01:09.179> hundreds<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.110> lights<00:01:10.380> into<00:01:10.649> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you can add hundreds of lights into the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.859 
you can add hundreds of lights into the
system<00:01:11.160> and<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.270> performance<00:01:12.720> doesn't

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
system and the performance doesn't

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.109 
system and the performance doesn't
really<00:01:13.110> drop<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:14.009> the<00:01:14.160> traditional<00:01:14.640> renders

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
really drop in the traditional renders

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.609 
really drop in the traditional renders
you<00:01:15.240> would<00:01:15.360> limit<00:01:15.539> your<00:01:15.720> lights<00:01:15.899> to<00:01:16.200> maybe<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
you would limit your lights to maybe a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.130 
you would limit your lights to maybe a
max<00:01:17.310> where's<00:01:18.119> deferred<00:01:18.450> lighting<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> can

max where's deferred lighting you can

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.529 
max where's deferred lighting you can
easily<00:01:19.289> bet<00:01:19.710> over<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.390> really

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
easily bet over and you can really

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.510 
easily bet over and you can really
change<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.899> mood<00:01:22.080> look<00:01:22.500> at<00:01:22.679> the<00:01:22.830> whole

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
change the mood look at the whole

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.820 
change the mood look at the whole

was<00:01:26.250> straightforward<00:01:26.610> system<00:01:27.209> for<00:01:27.509> operation

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
was straightforward system for operation

as possible to do this we create ways of
connecting<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:54.430> tool<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.730> the<00:01:54.820> game<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:55.420> you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
connecting the tool to the game so you

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.900 
connecting the tool to the game so you
can<00:01:55.720> see<00:01:55.900> certain<00:01:56.170> changes<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.800> medium<00:01:59.820> one<00:02:00.820> of

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
the good things in the tools that you

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.290 
the good things in the tools that you
can<00:02:02.140> change<00:02:02.380> things<00:02:02.620> on<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:02.950> fly<00:02:03.300> without

can change things on the fly without

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.930 
can change things on the fly without
