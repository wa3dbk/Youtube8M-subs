 but at the end of a time 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:50.739
 that was taken out of the air 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.969
 unjustly and that after that happened 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.819
 May the friends of telemundo's friends forgive me 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:57.990
 but never again 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.729
 Telemundo did again 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.819
 what it was 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.779
 that was something to see 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.450

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.299
 disagreements by health professionals 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.190
 of that cancellation of everything I always said that that marked in his life and that 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.479
 it hit him hard 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.900
 p if I had followed it has been done and I'm sure of that still 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.720
 a currela no force because he needed to like to work him 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.189
 I liked what I did 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:33.240
 i not only telemundo the advertising agency 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.080
 percent the big companies the pharmacist the people who have the 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.120
 monetary power to advertise your product Puerto Rican television are the 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.470
 that they have to show their face now at this time for the artistic class 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.349
 by Puerto Rico technicians are the ones that have the capacity 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.730
 the advertising agency and its clients are the ones that have to take off their faces 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.180
 hour 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.330
 the producer this product offers a channel 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.160
 he was seen I get many of the voice of selena I honestly I have 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.129
 many mixed feelings of this one in that sector was emptied first for that 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.800
 produce choupo ten years 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.199
 this 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.580
 I understand that it was the 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.870
 and nador salt 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.849
 that started the local productions 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.190
 day after day on channel 2 they weighed with that from 2 o'clock 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.290
 this 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.339
 i 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.009
 I have my feeling 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.840
 hoon this mind I think it was a loss 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.029
 amazing 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:35.490
 i as well you said this 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.620
 By the way, I had discussed with 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.830
 in thousands of occasions with the same 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.750
 we have been given little pink saint said several companion that was showing to 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.909
 that's 2 o'clock 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.559
 of what 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:50.059
 the duckling exit 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:52.430
 telemundo eye 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:00.060
 frame not only put the end of an era if I did not frame also the cpi 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.979
 change 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.039
 of audience 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.759
 CD from Telemundo to other channels 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:05.750
 this 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.920
 and not for publicly underestimating such a Sonoran motive now this happens to 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.279
 be the cessation of tera 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:16.449
 i but percent if i definitely think it was a shock 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.119
 the years passed 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:21.369
 Already 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:25.669
 it was tempered while we continued with kouri it gives a strong fao units 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.840
 the orchestra was discovered that in the first stage does not have the addicts to 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.770
 india because of the fact it was passed 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.860
 I found out about a church 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.659
 or emanuel step or a fix a step marc anthony 12 and mentioning clear this to the 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:43.970
 You know what happened at 12 o'clock and where are they now, look at the percent 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:49.520
 and indigence the clear one is this so that in an icon it was an icon definitely 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.550
 maybe 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.490
 I am thinking that if the facts 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.360
 strong 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.659
 the vast majority thinking about having an end 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:57.860
 but I do not think 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.669
 that will be dry
