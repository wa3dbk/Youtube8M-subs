00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
okay so the first step is to take the

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.620 
okay so the first step is to take the
leash<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.260> a<00:00:07.559> fix<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.340> your<00:00:08.580> right<00:00:09.059> hand<00:00:09.389> I'm

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
leash in a fix it to your right hand I'm

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.560 
leash in a fix it to your right hand I'm
right-handed<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.280> hold<00:00:11.519> my<00:00:11.700> net<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.240> my

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
right-handed and I hold my net and my

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.720 
right-handed and I hold my net and my
leash<00:00:12.959> in<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.379> right<00:00:13.620> hand<00:00:13.830> most<00:00:14.190> people<00:00:14.549> do<00:00:14.639> it

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
leash in my right hand most people do it

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.210 
leash in my right hand most people do it
the<00:00:14.849> exact<00:00:15.209> opposite<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.260> however<00:00:16.860> my

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the exact opposite of this however my

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.310 
the exact opposite of this however my
theory<00:00:17.700> is<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:18.330> you're<00:00:18.570> right-handed<00:00:18.780> you're

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
theory is if you're right-handed you're

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.500 
theory is if you're right-handed you're
stronger<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.190> arm<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.700> that's<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.360> arm

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
stronger in that arm and that's the arm

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.600 
stronger in that arm and that's the arm
doing<00:00:21.780> all<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.200> work<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.800> if<00:00:23.040> you<00:00:23.160> really<00:00:23.370> want

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
doing all the work so if you really want

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.430 
doing all the work so if you really want
to<00:00:23.700> throw<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.000> thing<00:00:24.210> far<00:00:24.540> make<00:00:24.870> it<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
to throw this thing far make it a

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.130 
to throw this thing far make it a
perfect<00:00:26.010> circle<00:00:26.430> then<00:00:27.090> use<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.810> right<00:00:28.110> hand

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
