the latest and greatest in fact this

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.370 
the latest and greatest in fact this
system<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.269> unique<00:00:24.600> we've<00:00:24.810> applied<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
system is so unique we've applied for a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.800 
system is so unique we've applied for a
patent<00:00:25.740> what<00:00:26.400> makes<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.760> unique<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
patent what makes it unique is the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.080 
patent what makes it unique is the
sliding<00:00:28.109> rollers<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.740> bottom<00:00:28.849> this<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
sliding rollers on the bottom this is a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.179 
sliding rollers on the bottom this is a
headless<00:00:30.570> system<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.529> gives<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.949> all

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
headless system so it gives you that all

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.690 
headless system so it gives you that all
glass<00:00:32.660> look<00:00:33.660> with<00:00:34.020> no<00:00:34.260> header<00:00:34.530> which<00:00:35.430> means

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
glass look with no header which means

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.970 
glass look with no header which means
you<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:35.969> more<00:00:36.180> glass<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.780> less<00:00:36.989> metal<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
you have more glass and less metal the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.530 
you have more glass and less metal the
way<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> system<00:00:38.610> works<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.329> two

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
way the system works is we have two

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.450 
way the system works is we have two
rollers<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.020> go<00:00:40.320> into<00:00:40.620> holes<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> glass

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
rollers that go into holes in the glass

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.959 
rollers that go into holes in the glass
just<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.629> regular<00:00:43.050> door<00:00:43.620> hinge<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.820> we

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
just like a regular door hinge then we

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
just like a regular door hinge then we
have<00:00:45.149> special<00:00:45.750> clamps<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.829> need<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.010> be

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
have special clamps that can need to be

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279 
have special clamps that can need to be
clamped<00:00:47.430> onto<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.940> wall<00:00:48.149> or<00:00:48.420> glass-to-glass

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
clamped onto the wall or glass-to-glass

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.200 
clamped onto the wall or glass-to-glass
if<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.829> want<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.190> glass<00:00:50.309> return<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
if you want to have a glass return and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.270 
if you want to have a glass return and
this<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.050> made<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.260> half-inch<00:00:52.890> or<00:00:53.070> 12

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
this is made with half-inch or 12

this is made with half-inch or 12
millimeter<00:00:53.730> glass<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.199> key<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.649> is

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
millimeter glass and the key to it is

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.860 
millimeter glass and the key to it is
the<00:00:55.980> track<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.610> bottom<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the track on the bottom we have a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.650 
the track on the bottom we have a
sliding<00:00:58.410> track<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:59.399> actually<00:00:59.820> has<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> mound

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
sliding track that actually has a mound

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.709 
sliding track that actually has a mound
where<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> roller<00:01:01.859> rolls<00:01:02.219> back<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.699> forth<00:01:02.940> so

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
where the roller rolls back and forth so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.000 
where the roller rolls back and forth so
when<00:01:03.809> you're<00:01:03.930> doing<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> installation<00:01:04.890> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
when you're doing the installation it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.370 
when you're doing the installation it
doesn't<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.610> totally<00:01:05.820> perfect<00:01:06.380> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
doesn't have to be totally perfect to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560 
doesn't have to be totally perfect to
still<00:01:07.650> roll<00:01:07.890> perfectly<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.000> rounded

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
still roll perfectly on that rounded

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.280 
still roll perfectly on that rounded
roller<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.560> bottom<00:01:11.689> it<00:01:12.689> slides<00:01:13.020> back<00:01:13.140> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
roller on the bottom it slides back and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
roller on the bottom it slides back and
forth<00:01:13.530> very<00:01:13.860> nicely<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:14.939> keeps<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.360> down

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
forth very nicely and what keeps it down

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
forth very nicely and what keeps it down
there<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.049> new<00:01:16.259> back<00:01:16.500> plate<00:01:16.830> once<00:01:17.640> you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
there is this new back plate once you

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.130 
there is this new back plate once you
have<00:01:17.880> adjusted<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> rollers<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:18.990> can

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
have adjusted the rollers and they can

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.840 
have adjusted the rollers and they can
adjust<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.740> down<00:01:19.830> three<00:01:20.310> quarters<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.729> an

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
adjust up and down three quarters of an

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.100 
adjust up and down three quarters of an
inch<00:01:20.909> once<00:01:21.270> they've<00:01:21.450> been<00:01:21.540> installed<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
inch once they've been installed in the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.310 
inch once they've been installed in the
glass<00:01:22.409> from<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.400> back<00:01:23.700> there's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.320> adjustment

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
glass from the back there's a adjustment

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.780 
glass from the back there's a adjustment
that<00:01:25.409> will<00:01:25.500> adjust<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> rollers<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> down

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that will adjust the rollers up and down

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.310 
that will adjust the rollers up and down
so<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.180> level<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.020> doesn't

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
so you can level it out so it doesn't

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.770 
so you can level it out so it doesn't
tilt<00:01:28.530> or<00:01:28.770> roll<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.820> one<00:01:29.970> direction<00:01:30.180> more<00:01:30.630> than

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
tilt or roll in one direction more than

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.230 
tilt or roll in one direction more than
the<00:01:30.840> other<00:01:30.960> direction<00:01:31.290> once<00:01:32.130> that's<00:01:32.369> set<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the other direction once that's set you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.179 
the other direction once that's set you
put<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> back<00:01:33.869> plate<00:01:34.200> which<00:01:34.799> actually

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
put on the back plate which actually

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.130 
put on the back plate which actually
goes<00:01:35.369> down<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.880> locks<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> back<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.990> the
