00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.290
 swarms are often formed in 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.190
 urban nuclei that are very 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.190
 difficult to access 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.700
 located in a hydration source that 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.470
 agitated from the most difficult part of the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.510
 subject of having to be hung with 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.010
 vertical works heat bites 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.399
 etc 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.989
 Well, in this case the honeycomb is a 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.370
 only channel along throughout the board 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.890
 of hydration then it is quite 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.260
 complicated to remove it you have to try 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.719
 save the queen to all possible breeding 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.240
 and the honey reserves to take it to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.740
 hospital apiary or isolation 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.740
 before recovering it 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.149
 we put the queen in the cages 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.600
 we uncover a little bit with wax and honey 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.270
 to serve as food 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.259
 and we introduce it with the pictures of 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.750
 breeding it is important to take the queen or 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.760
 at least egg so they can create a 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.980
 Queen 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.630
 when a person detects that he has a 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.070
 in exchange for your home first know 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.290
 if they are bees or wasps 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.940
 the bees are protected and now 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.680
 they are trying to declare themselves 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.770
 unesco heritage in addition to the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.110
 bee as pollinating agent that is what 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.550
 that you never have to do is seal the 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.230
 entrance where they enter because that 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.750
 cavity communicates with other cavities and 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.510
 if we seal you can go out by 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.250
 light bulbs handles blind 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.900
 Ez plugs and you can flood the house 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.030
 from hai we had to evict many 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.920
 houses that's why they do something else 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.080
 the people who should not do it 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.310
 It is also not to throw a chemical 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.290
 throw a chemical into the only thing that 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.210
 they get is to move through that partition 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.130
 the swarm to another place that go down in 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.650
 marjah difficult to extract what from where 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.260
 it is originally the first thing that 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.140
 does with the swarm is to lock him in a 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.990
 Rehabilitation colony is checked 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.140
 if there is a queen if she has food or if 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.330
 any disease suffers only 10% of 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.330
 they are subsequently viable
