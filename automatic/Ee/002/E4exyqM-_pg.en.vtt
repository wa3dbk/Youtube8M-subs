and it puts it back into your inventory

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.910 
and it puts it back into your inventory
however<00:00:55.250> if<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.850> wired<00:00:57.059> first<00:00:57.920> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
however if you have it wired first you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.270 
however if you have it wired first you
need<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.390> take<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> wire<00:01:00.750> out<00:01:01.190> before<00:01:02.190> you

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
need to take the wire out before you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.359 
need to take the wire out before you
take<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> machine<00:01:02.730> out<00:01:03.920> otherwise<00:01:04.920> there's<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
take the machine out otherwise there's a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.170 
take the machine out otherwise there's a
chance<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.820> you'll<00:01:05.970> lose<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.360> machine<00:01:08.180> next

incorrectly it will remain flat when
placed<00:01:47.490> correctly<00:01:48.860> you'll<00:01:49.860> notice<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.310> it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
placed correctly you'll notice that it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.450 
placed correctly you'll notice that it
tilts<00:01:50.759> towards<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> solar<00:01:51.600> boiler<00:01:52.460> I've

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
tilts towards the solar boiler I've

diminishing<00:02:02.250> returns<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.090> set<00:02:03.270> them

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
diminishing returns so I just set them

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.270 
diminishing returns so I just set them
up<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.750> circle<00:02:04.140> all<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.290> way<00:02:04.409> around<00:02:04.500> eight
