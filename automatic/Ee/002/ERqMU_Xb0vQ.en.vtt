00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.570
 Thank you guys, thank you very much for being there. 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.400
 watching this video in this video here and 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.840
 I'll show you what the difference is 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.670
 between the words edit and treat here 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.800
 In Brazil, we used words. 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.770
 to define things in the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.980
 one of the wrong words that 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.430
 It is quite wrong to use the word 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.529
 edit to handle photos are two 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.920
 completely different things and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.330
 word edit it does not mean to treat 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.430
 the concert the photo word edit 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.220
 means choosing the photos as 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.489
 highlighted in the dictionary netÃ£o is a verb 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.500
 transitive right to print publishing to put 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.860
 sale of a writer's work from a 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.390
 artist does not establish the good 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.820
 a text and light neither so and edit a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.420
 text is to go there and correct this 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.659
 text making cuts in the text that strips 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.020
 those things that do not even serve as the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.390
 editing a video for example on an island 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.280
 video editing it is called Island 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.370
 editing because it serves to make 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.770
 cuts off any video program 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.110
 nowadays it is to edit a video 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.560
 but it is to make the cuts in the scenes 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.400
 and join the scenes that we want or 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.700
 of course not 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.040
 in the whole video and edit is that neither the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.620
 people make a selection of our 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.580
 photographs we pick up several 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.550
 photographs as is the case here and do 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.180
 marks here so you can edit this 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:48.120
 huge amount that has 599 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.050
 photos and the edition I made 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.650
 here I took the most were not 351 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.510
 photos here with these tags all 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.510
 which I did here then another edition 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.570
 that I did is just this serve with the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:10.019
 labels here have 261 pictures that I 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.250
 I edited the 599 and took from them 260 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.800
 a photo 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.220
 but that does not mean that I treated the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.520
 Image 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.360
 athar the image that is the correct image 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.940
 You make the colors change. 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.210
 increase the contrast take it off 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.060
 that and that makes this treatment here O 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.760
 meaning of treating receiving care 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.270
 or dealing with health problems 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.850
 of someone then that will bring to is to take care of 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.160
 someone like that then in photography 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.130
 It's the same thing as we are. 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.410
 treating the image because it is not good 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.990
 visually and we are putting more 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.130
 contrast of putting more like 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.220
 darker and making these changes in 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.990
 of the color of photography ever 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.630
 removing something by erasing the 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.420
 for example has already exceeded 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.490
 treatment and became image manipulation 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.500
 because you're already manipulating that 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.670
 image by taking things or placing 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.830
 other things ne 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.400
 and are three things one different from the other 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.720
 editing an image is you making a 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.910
 choose from many images of some 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.190
 images that will be published is a 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.010
 photo editor of a newspaper by 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.890
 example he chooses the photographs that 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.010
 will be published in singles between 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.720
 many photos one or the other that will 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.019
 be published in the subject neh 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.670
 who will treat the image the photographer who 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.910
 probably he already sent the image 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.030
 treated and in the treatment of the 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.790
 treat the image is when the photographer has 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.610
 edited chose these photos 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.100
 best and he fixes image he does 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.140
 a treatment in the image so that the 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.620
 curls are better I declare this 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.110
 know more it changes the densities of 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.130
 photography and curls is not even a 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.040
 Handling treatment is when you 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.140
 took the routine a post erased some 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.390
 thing of photography or else included 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.750
 something else in photography and this is already 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.180
 manipulation or even treatment is you 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.700
 arrange your photo in the colors 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.610
 intensities 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.010
 edit the photo is to choose the 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.890
 best photos of a group and 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.560
 manipulate the image is you erase or 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.540
 put things inside that same picture 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.130
 good, this is it , guys, thank you 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.960
 and video tissues until a range is 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.610
 Did you like to share favorite and 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.820
 comment also thank you and until the next
