00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 to 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.280
 and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.869
 now all today I bring you the tutorial of 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.099
 Panic 360 or 360 aerial and good for 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.410
 start 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.340
 you have to look very dominated manny and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.340
 180 euros 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.850
 and 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:47.610
 and it would be very convenient for you to know 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.760
 good to say it somehow in 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.790
 point the bunny and the 180 so that you 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.070
 cost less to flex the legs to 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.489
 raise them and increase height in each other 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.860
 since it is indispensable to get what 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.900
 good first 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:10.050
 You must take 3 636 this stage are super 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.360
 dominate and ximo with the turn very good 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.990
 when you have a very good turn that 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.990
 you do 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.070
 the pivots already almost reaching 36 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.810
 Well, it's about time you started it 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.509
 Ironing for ironing is not very 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.229
 simple just change what you're going to upload 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:35.619
 the legs when you're at 130 the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.020
 feeling of raising the legs is like 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.530
 that you are turning and when you arrive 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.780
 at 180 you get like in the box 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.870
 it would also help a lot to look 6 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.540
 always down I do not know to say 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.440
 but it's up to catch a lot 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.340
 impulse 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.380
 any synergy you do so while 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 that you are crouched pulling again 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.670
 upwards you start to turn then 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.010
 the bike has to be this way 0 degrees 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.040
 at 180 you have to be up so 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.050
 maximum possible and when you are more or 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.350
 less for 180 is when you have to 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.010
 flex to flex you have to like 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.610
 get in the box 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.470
 at the beginning it costs a little but if you 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.200
 you really put in one day you can 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.950
 get it right only that you know how to flex 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.319
 well 1 181 go and well I do not think that you 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.920
 it costs a lot of good then when you see 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:40.060
 by 180 you must do this flex 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.690
 legs and if you can you can stretch the 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.260
 arms a little bit down to 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.769
 that alone in three marias and the bike 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.700
 when you already get it done this 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.920
 first times you will stay in 270 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.520
 you will stay like this 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.870
 and good and only to learn how to do it 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.310
 360 will perfect the turn or the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.310
 entry impulse 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.930
 then you must take much more inertia 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.230
 jump much stronger up 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.980
 and do the same and you'll see how 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.200
 just doing leg flexion and 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.190
 pulling but using the hip 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.140
 like doing movement like this 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.140
 you will finish doing the entire rotation 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.390
 well this would be the explanation for 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.819
 that we do not have ramps or bags for 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.769
 start those that have a bomb a 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.110
 inclined plane to start throwing it 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.900
 then you can start practicing there 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.310
 but you have to be careful because 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.930
 coming out of ramp tends to aim 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.329
 a lot when doing this 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.329
 you must flex many legs 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.010
 and once you know how to make it bowl and 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.630
 of inclined plane because it would not have 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.049
 many difficulties but do it from 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.020
 manny well that has been all any 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.690
 doubt leave it to me in the comments 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.740
 and good like subscribe if it is not and 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.740
 until the next video
