 then we have here at the side 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.400
 if you can see that i hope you can 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.810
 It usually can not be 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.600
 but I really do 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.250
 buttons here, for example, the brightness 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.590

 1 1 button on all the buttons 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.800
 your keyboard just off switch so 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.540
 then you can not press anything anymore 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.580
 Here we have what I think is good 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.130
 have a big enter button up here 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.019

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.410
 media gravel here from f5 with stop 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.980
 then start replay play forward 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.790
 You have an e-mail hotkey internet here 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.430
 Explorer again I prove exactly 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.870
 you can just that keyboard 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.920
 is switched off and then you still have 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.650
 the calculator 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.330
 Here you can go before him from here 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.060

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.680

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.040
 then your player we just stood there 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.900
 If you have a page you have a page 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.000
 a little that really does not matter then 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.769
 element here then light up these little ones 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.670
 then slit depending on which fabian 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:03:00.060
 then yes, here is here 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.380
 three four buttons possible here are something 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.790
 darker than the others may have 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.700
 now already seen so the offices 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.069
 and the backspace button as well as o &amp; s 7 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.180
 are a bit darker like other buttons 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.780
 I think we can see it 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.660
 I do not know if that is intentional or 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.849
 or what that means then have 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.700
 we have all this again or we have 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.800
 the usb cable is gilded here in front 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.930
 and has a dark blue here 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.610
 Driver short ran so like shoelace 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.690
 may just be here 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.790
 recognize a bit better here 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.319
 comparison to the black is something 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.209
 blue so dark blue 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.040
 if I as so place it on the keyboard 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.640
 as it is on or through the camera 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.590
 then come out here on the 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.769
 bottom we have here by default 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.160
 Just like that stood feet miro fold 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.930

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.849

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.230
 The keyboard is nice too 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:04:03.459
 yes does not slip your table back and forth 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:05.519
 just the keyboard then I would 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.170
 say what you get from an unboxing 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.000

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.790

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.829
 machines color modes etc 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.600
