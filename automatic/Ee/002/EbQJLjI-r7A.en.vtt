00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello today I'm going to teach you how to decorate your 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.620
 Nails with diffused colors is very 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.620
 simple 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.650
 you will need to 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.460
 The first thing you're going to do is paint your 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.010
 white nails remember to give two layers 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.630
 to have a more uniform color and 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.630
 let it dry very well 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.240
 Take your sponge for makeup and put 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.690
 a line of colors of your enamel 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.000
 choose the colors that you like the most 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.820
 must necessarily be derived from 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.970
 some color have fun combining the 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.970
 colors 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.270
 press the sponge on your nails 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.500
 the stronger the more pressures 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.390
 dark will be the color 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.390
 they are like little taps 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.820
 and we repeat the procedure with each 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.820
 one of our nails 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.570
 do not necessarily have to be three 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.310
 colors measures the size of you and you 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.640
 will determine how many colors you can 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.640
 to fit 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.760
 you will notice that your fingers will be left 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.640
 stained 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.390
 do not worry about that, it's acetone and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.390
 the cot mt 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.399
 time to use the rhinestones I chose 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.649
 a pastel pink tone what are you going to do 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.709
 is to take a little of your enamel 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.680
 transparent and put a little bit in the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.489
 Where you want to go diamond and 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.769
 a little bit on the tip or the stick 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.489
 You take my darn and put it with 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.489
 very careful 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.510
 do not worry about the glue on 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.170
 gluing them with the enamel is more than 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.170
 enough 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.370
 I chose to put them on the middle finger and on 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.590
 thumb 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.190
 you can put in place more 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.190
 serious 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.390
 ready our final step is to put a 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.870
 transparent enamel coating in all 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.930
 our nails 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.379
 I told you it was going to be easy 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.269
