00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.510
 It's okay, I'll explain to you today. 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:20.949
 how to install the kit is composed noob 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:23.710
 an 8101 printer accessory 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.089
 two-sided printing is already 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.130
 connected 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:31.599
 the USB cable and the power cable also 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.430
 so what are you going to do? 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:39.270
 the printer is connected to you will 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.270
 open the printer 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.250
 as soon as you open the cart 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.560
 print head will focus will be 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.310
 position in front of you 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:01:01.710
 so now you will make sure 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:01.710
 that the kit will open the breath 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:11.450
 will cause the ink is level 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.640
 Why this here is very important. 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.910
 because if you are overweight here 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.759
 ink will put a lot of pressure on the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.410
 and the cartridge will not work. 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.479
 properly 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:30.960
 So you open the breather, you've leveled the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.110
 and then you can prepare the cartridge 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.080
 to put in the printer leaves the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.990
 reservoir at exactly the same level 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:47.119
 printer never above and never below 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.390
 Here I can lift the reservoir. 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.490
 because the hose is closed 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.030
 If the hose is open I will not 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.640
 Can I lift how much if I do not? 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.869
 see a lot of ink pressure and then it goes 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.180
 end 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:12.350
 you might go if then what you will 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:15.230
 Do you raise white lever? 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.730
 position the print head there 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.400
 kacha she low is in this certificate 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:30.120
 that the print head is 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:33.000
 positioned right take the cartridge there 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.959
 Yes, you have to see if the hose is working. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.519
 Of course she's not all tart here at home. 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.720
 with the fans 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:49.410
 You'll make the cartridge come. 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:54.900
 that it stays sharp will position the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:58.579
 cartridge around here can care for 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.280
 that's why the black hose 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.870
 so that it is very fruity here 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.480
 not much 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.820
 You do not have to leave the lawyer anymore. 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.950
 also not be able to leave very fair and 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.769
 sure he's straight 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.269
 so that the pipe will not bend this 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.390
 can not happen 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:23.099
 so he has to be quite right 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.870
 so the team is loose is not even me 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:31.440
 imported or too loose so that it does not 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:38.010
 stay in excess of hose there you 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:40.769
 will put the room a book, right? 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:48.019
 it is ready to be placed 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:48.019
 so you put one until there was a click 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:59.400
 you push the print head to 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:04.019
 back there as soon as our printer it already 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.170
 goes with the support for you to place the 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:12.180
 hose are you do not get what goes 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:18.650
 come here leave one space 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.650
 hose that is sufficient 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.330
 and will roll over there putting it on 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.810
 the printer here 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.810
 leaving there on the side 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:40.669
 so you can already open the hose 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:46.620
 loosen the clamp and also're already can 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:48.930
 close the printer and then she'll just go 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.780
 will work alone and will do the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.720
 cartridge and head recognition 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.650
 printing and both blocking what 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.490
 can print normal do not forget that 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.669
 after he goes 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.750
 and if the cartridge any excess paint 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.680
 that has in room jo will go back to the 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.729
 reservoir 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.139
 we had leveled the paint only 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.349
 now as he is recognizing the 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.250
 cartridge excess is coming to 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.210
 reservoir 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.280
 this will increase the pressure again to 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.389
 printer will normally align 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:32.759
 automatically after that you go 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:35.479
 level again after she has done the 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:39.080
 alignment to print a sheet 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:42.210
 So you will pick up and go again. 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.250
 put the cartridge to lower a 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.000
 tank to level again is 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.310
 the ink level does not make this movement 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.370
 while the teacher is pulling 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:59.030
 ink such a final order you can 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.030
 destabilize to reach 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.650
 Ai is coming to 20 years Carlos
