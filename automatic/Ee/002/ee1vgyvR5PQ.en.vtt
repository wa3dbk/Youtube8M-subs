00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.660
 dear friends shop forcing he 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.890
 presents to your attention a brief 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.490
 knife review 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:16.650
 from spider to spider to civilian railing 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.720
 Levich you bombard the floor with your two 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.920
 the knife 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:26.760
 one of them costs about 10,000 rubles 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.990
 of which are 4 times cheaper to the eye 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.370
 why is it being asked why 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.110
 because 11 tag on the other from 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.800
 unknown brother asian 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.480
 who made an exact copy and gives 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.850
 yourself for their megan posing as 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.870
 Americans or at least for the Japanese 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.039
 asserts that let's just save 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.140
 try to figure out what they are 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.149
 differ in principle what is seen not 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.160
 armed look right away let's 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.000
 Immediately make it clear this is our 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.379
 this original knife is fake 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.189
 fake replica first what's right away 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.189
 striking 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.390
 Basically, this car is riveted. 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.229
 about riveted on the other hand in them ends 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.890
 see what torksy 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:24.570
 on the original spider to and which torxes 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.850
 go on cues but such is enough 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.820
 clumsy copy so say why 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.719
 cut-out on the block 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:41.289
 on the original there is this cutout 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:44.929
 after all on faking it 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:49.179
 the Nazis then a little bit basically on 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:53.090
 they are the same size yes they converge 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.909
 there is a slightly different slant on which 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.250
 lies down in the woods you on a trench he still 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.829
 the picture is less flat with dates shallow 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.929
 and in size they are basically the same 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:07.989
 but this is part of the front handle it 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.069
 different in shape 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:11.739
 slightly different if you pay 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.390
 attention and again 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:23.390
 rivets more shiny more rounded 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:25.519
 and in principle very clearly on the same axis 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.709
 axial in general, all copies that I saw 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.540
 they have trouble on their mouth if you can 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:37.099
 I understand this fake from this gives 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.510
 wife firstly not polished and 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.329
 Secondly, they are not so few 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.150
 round or adyghe that's proper 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.440
 further that we see so on the first 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.069
 impression all clip 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.000
 principle clips like a spider of another 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:59.049
 size with villain small on 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.540
 original on not original it is more in 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:06.200
 principle the same 2 point clip 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:10.519
 it turns out the screws in this case are very 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.959
 look like let's try to open it with us 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:19.060
 the original notch is missing from us 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:22.420
 not the original opens the same much 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.780
 you announce said practically with frost 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:32.120
 blade shape but it is proportional 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:35.630
 it looks like a descent 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.430
 more stupid that is not a descent carriage here 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.520
 this one is more stupid to silver 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.380
 there is a spider to a bigger corner for half a year 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.480
 it turns out more explicit if you look 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.020
 i.e. spider edge original it is wider 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.020
 than this one here is Chinese gonna 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.019
 Respectively more registry so let's say 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:04.610
 then principle thickness butt thickness 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:06.470
 butt are identical in them then what else 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.530
 say on it we are in principle marking 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.630
 until we see what's on the original spa 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.850
 berka spider is pickled more like this 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.959
 obviously yes this is what we don't know can 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.570
 be this laser can 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.060
 chemical etching here is the question 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.690
 Painted with a lid than such a cover 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.850
 that clings to the nail and marking 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.060
 directly spider whom g10 and network 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.000
 city ​​japan on the other hand on the original 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.190
 they are stamped on her original they just 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.930
 drawn here is another distinctive 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.000
 a feature that you can just 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.860
 eyes closed if you are given these two 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.200
 knife you just understand it because 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.419
 here is this knife it weighs well I don’t know much 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.560
 more than the original the original is easier 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:53.110
 just obviously easier basically 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.110
 look at the thickness of the handle just on 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.820
 because u original civilian and u 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.310
 him as you can see the backlog button and she 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.280
 shifted a little bit god he goes alone 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:12.580
 the inside of her original die 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:17.910
 dies 2 and even the button itself 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:21.120
 Panov's castle is somewhat thicker 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.410
 in fact on the same so specifically 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.270
 so that these some there do not know in 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.550
 utilitarian their quality yes how will they 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.090
 fulfill its role in general the role of this 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.590
 knife she is very very very foggy and 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.420
 aggressive burden 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.690
 I saw somewhere from the photos on the Internet 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.710
 what can you perfectly get 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.180
 cucumbers know from the banks here 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.060
 pickled cucumber can be from the bottom 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.740
 pick up from that I heard some 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.690
 fables that this is originally a knife for 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.510
 some land mines who fought there 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.490
 drug cartel before what once supposedly 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.260
 he had some kind of notch on the tip 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.419
 because the tips immediately remained 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.250
 summer in the victim's body but in general the name 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.550
 civile it translates as civilian to 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.800
 some kind of civil and in urban so 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.990
 let's say a resident of denmark military but not 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.090
 less is not the only meaning of it 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.430
 knife which i see is cutting people up 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.640
 nutria cut here aggressive cuts so 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.560
 that you did not log in first 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.800
 curved cutting edge with hook 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.810
 that cling that is, if we don’t know 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.850
 now for the aggression which will go 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.130
 suffered you suffered if cut 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.050
 man with a backpack on his shoulders and in 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.430
 leather jacket yes but no time cuts there 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.250
 don't know any other knife with her 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.410
 serrateor sharpening cut through 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.479
 more on an injection here this sypanet he 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.130
 cuts through all impress so it will not be sent 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:41.110
 how are you really because it's scary 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.880
 knife well knife for self defense over 10 thousand 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.800
 rubles 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.130
 very strange thing so essentially i 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.020
 it seems that either one and the other knife 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.400
 despite the price difference four times 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.180
 they are essentially their purpose 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.640
 will perform but what to take that original and 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.430
 neoriginal case backwater yes it's up to you 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.470
 there 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:04.130
 and the Chinese do well and still need 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.030
 pay tribute 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:10.700
 original in my opinion thank you very much with 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.650
 you were a shop farce he remind you 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.390
 about the fact that in addition to the online store we 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.930
 there is a retail store which we 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:20.120
 always happy to see you and you can 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:24.790
 come to look see any
