00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
I was it was hard work at 69 I thought

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.250 
I was it was hard work at 69 I thought
we<00:01:51.700> showed<00:01:51.850> with<00:01:52.000> great<00:01:52.180> resolve<00:01:52.450> when<00:01:53.170> we

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
we showed with great resolve when we

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.870 
we showed with great resolve when we
came<00:01:53.380> through<00:01:53.620> and<00:01:53.770> scored<00:01:54.160> two<00:01:54.340> late<00:01:54.370> late

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
came through and scored two late late

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.090 
came through and scored two late late
rise<00:01:55.120> and<00:01:55.420> three<00:01:56.170> late<00:01:56.320> riser<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.800> finished

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
rise and three late riser and finished

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.620 
rise and three late riser and finished
them<00:01:57.250> off<00:01:57.370> I<00:01:57.610> thought<00:01:58.150> that<00:01:58.300> was<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.420> character

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
them off I thought that was a character

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.060 
them off I thought that was a character
to<00:01:58.930> show<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.170> character<00:01:59.470> of<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.650> team<00:01:59.680> and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
to show the character of the team and

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.560 
to show the character of the team and
hopefully<00:02:00.880> we<00:02:01.060> can<00:02:01.180> use<00:02:01.300> that<00:02:01.420> as<00:02:01.540> a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
hopefully we can use that as a

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.030 
hopefully we can use that as a
springboard<00:02:01.690> for<00:02:02.110> other<00:02:02.320> things<00:02:02.410> to<00:02:02.710> come
