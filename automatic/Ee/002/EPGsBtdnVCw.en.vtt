00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:09.509
 all intended 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.529
 In Davos, you remember there are several 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.379
 disturbs micro-damage 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.959
 money baku 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.560
 and what else did something show you 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.159
 who can bring anyone 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.509
 but still not too big a difference 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.589
 mastery therefore as it were 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.749
 it is not clear that the composition of which 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.289
 and all one hundred percent at the cottage therefore 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.469
 act well understand tracked 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.350
 all week we have 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.840
 all results of all workouts 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.660

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.920
 n.a families matches appraisal district and on what 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.380
 we are working now training what 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.750
 specifically work out and 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.000
 the main task is just not to lose here 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.060
 former form 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.690
 whether that does not meet the former form 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.950
 so much work is needed 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.860
 work naturally 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.560
 attacking the Treasury got their own 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.950
 various gaming activities 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.060
 models 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.670
 similar interaction between 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.730
 by players in various combinations therefore on 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.670
 what actually always works 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.780
 Wernikov here you said about big 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.010
 skill differences 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.230
 but in vain space 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.750
 pakistan search ii opponents some 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.160
 matches 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.150
 but we couldn't do it because from 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.330
 so to speak 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.250
 we are sure that our double is all lines 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.020
 why order teams second division 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.030
 mushta 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.619
 we played with that saturn 2 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.620
 backup composition for lunch 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.250
 victory is why the team is first 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.460
 Division and given that they are Khabensky 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.260
 there will be cup fights 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.830
 the thirteenth nobody agreed with us 5 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.680
 seconds 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.310
 then she will refuse 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.909
 as equal he is only just 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.100
 recruit less he spent three workouts 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.100
 in the general group after semi-annual creeps 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.970
 he is the first control temples 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.830
 so far it is difficult because they try 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.990
 he really wants but for now of course the percentage and 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.360
 still 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.550
 far from optimal conditions 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.280
 You can reliably say that Shender 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.570
 attended to the center of defense edge coupon 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.179
 match 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.209
 Could you please give him that option but 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.679
 someone strains 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.269
 but if the ank maybe play and lead 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.109
 Berezutsky dresser in the eurozone that is 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.479
 try different options 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:22.929
 but he was not sprained ankle 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.929
 the buyer is we all okay 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:29.559
 honda acura at the end of training yesterday there 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.989
 not worth attaching to that 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.139
 felt great discomfort 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:34.219
 so 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:35.280
 we decided to give a reason
