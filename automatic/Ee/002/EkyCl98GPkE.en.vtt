 Hello everyone in today's video, we 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.240
 Let's look at the tablet functionality by 706 in 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.240
 last video you could see 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:21.450
 unpacking how he came here how can 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:24.500
 see i put on the case basically good 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:29.760
 case I won't say anything bad about him 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:32.640
 Here I installed the application on it 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.480
 let's probably start with multitouch check 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 how many fingers he has supported here 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.590
 five fingers 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:53.430
 good very multitouch for this money 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:58.070
 Here we also look at antutu in antutu 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.070
 also a very good result he showed 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:09.840
 so 9550 you can see this 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:13.500
 turns a brand called android here 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:19.380
 once one 422 android system is worth it 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.040
 dual core processor costs resolution 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.340
 screen 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.340
 758 by 480 5 megapixel camera here 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.150
 what else 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:41.620
 but frontalka 03 by the way I want to say 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.600
 a very good battery tested it 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:51.830
 on the battery on the brightest backlight 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.630
 2 hours solo played toy pokamis 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:59.450
 he did not sit down and sound 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.460
 the maximum battery itself here if 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.880
 I'm not mistaken 4000 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.880
 or hours so not on mark 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:21.860
 not on the 64 fps mark here is the 806 display 800 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:32.840
 on 438 video accelerator cook in sej 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:35.690
 x-540 so paused to odigitriya 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:44.140
 his heart here are two cores how can you 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:48.799
 see now the system here is the model by 706 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:54.980
 422 is the same as what we saw in 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:57.940
 past programs here is battery voltage 4 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.940
 1073 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.890
 But in general, what to say on this 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.670
 tablet for your money very 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.470
 beautiful 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.980
 I recommend everyone to choose a device very much 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.130
 good let 's start let's say 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.200
 some kind of toy 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:29.470
 no lags I assure you you will not see 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.470
 The g-sensor is nice and pretty good. 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.210
 you guys would see the installation using 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:02.270
 which rents it is just something like 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:05.490
 still by my tripod did not reach so 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:17.130
 adapting than have apologize 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:19.970
 for it is here that we are now on the largest 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.970
 ra brightness 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:30.530
 no sensor lag pleasant obedient 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.620
 how do they attack 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:57.590
 scoundrel in general now they will kill me 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:05:02.450
 and I think this will end up in the overview 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.730
 general i'm a loser on this video i will 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.870
 end 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:12.290
 the main conclusion I already said 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:16.180
 the tablet is worth the money and I think it 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:19.070
 need to take so recommend everyone 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.160

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.160
