00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.219 
exam because remember he didn't finish
it<00:01:16.340> last<00:01:16.460> time<00:01:16.729> you<00:01:17.329> already<00:01:17.479> eaten<00:01:17.719> pass<00:01:17.990> him

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
it last time you already eaten pass him

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.870 
it last time you already eaten pass him
whatever<00:01:18.469> but<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.130> time<00:01:19.280> he<00:01:19.399> wants<00:01:19.639> to<00:01:19.729> pass

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
whatever but this time he wants to pass

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.359 
whatever but this time he wants to pass
it<00:01:20.149> and<00:01:20.270> get<00:01:20.420> that<00:01:20.710> license<00:01:21.710> done<00:01:21.950> but<00:01:22.280> I'm

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
it and get that license done but I'm

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.649 
it and get that license done but I'm
pretty<00:01:22.549> sure<00:01:22.670> he'll<00:01:22.939> be<00:01:23.030> able<00:01:23.179> to<00:01:23.420> do<00:01:23.539> it

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
pretty sure he'll be able to do it

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.179 
pretty sure he'll be able to do it
because<00:01:23.840> no<00:01:24.020> kill<00:01:24.439> was<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.590> really<00:01:24.889> strong<00:01:25.130> guy

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
because no kill was a really strong guy

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.149 
because no kill was a really strong guy
and<00:01:25.899> he's<00:01:26.899> even<00:01:27.049> stronger<00:01:27.409> now<00:01:27.649> so<00:01:27.859> i'm<00:01:27.920> pretty

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
and he's even stronger now so i'm pretty

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.609 
and he's even stronger now so i'm pretty
sure<00:01:28.369> kill<00:01:28.639> will<00:01:29.450> do<00:01:29.569> fine<00:01:29.810> with<00:01:30.109> that<00:01:30.139> exam

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
sure kill will do fine with that exam

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.109 
sure kill will do fine with that exam
really<00:01:30.889> i'm<00:01:30.950> not<00:01:31.069> like<00:01:31.249> to<00:01:31.429> worry<00:01:31.609> about<00:01:31.850> that

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
really i'm not like to worry about that

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.270 
really i'm not like to worry about that
so<00:01:32.659> he's<00:01:32.869> off<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.139> do<00:01:33.229> that<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:33.619> now<00:01:33.740> just
