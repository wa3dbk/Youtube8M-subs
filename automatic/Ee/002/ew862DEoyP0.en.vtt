have<00:00:48.380> to<00:00:48.500> say<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:48.890> AI<00:00:49.190> was<00:00:49.550> very<00:00:49.910> aggressive

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
have to say the AI was very aggressive

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.840 
have to say the AI was very aggressive
but<00:00:50.810> anyway<00:00:51.080> on<00:00:51.290> to<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.740> patch<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.670> most

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
but anyway on to the patch so the most

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.900 
but anyway on to the patch so the most
notable<00:00:53.450> fix<00:00:54.230> is<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.890> they've<00:00:55.310> improved<00:00:55.730> the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
notable fix is that they've improved the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.020 
notable fix is that they've improved the
performance<00:00:56.030> of<00:00:56.600> online<00:00:57.200> races<00:00:57.680> haven't<00:00:58.670> said

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
performance of online races haven't said

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.360 
performance of online races haven't said
what<00:00:59.300> I<00:00:59.570> imagine<00:01:00.080> it's<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.440> lag<00:01:00.650> compensation

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
what I imagine it's the lag compensation

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.460 
what I imagine it's the lag compensation
software<00:01:02.000> they're<00:01:02.150> using<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.260> match

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
software they're using and the match

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.530 
software they're using and the match
making<00:01:03.980> one<00:01:04.640> I<00:01:04.670> wouldn't<00:01:05.059> be<00:01:05.119> matchmaking

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
making one I wouldn't be matchmaking

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.760 
making one I wouldn't be matchmaking
because<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:05.960> choose<00:01:06.170> what<00:01:06.380> lobbies<00:01:06.650> are

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
because you choose what lobbies are

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.160 
because you choose what lobbies are
going<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.150> but<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.329> lag<00:01:08.600> compensation

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
going to but the lag compensation

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.620 
going to but the lag compensation
software<00:01:09.799> is<00:01:09.979> what<00:01:10.189> I<00:01:10.220> think<00:01:10.579> they<00:01:10.820> fixed<00:01:11.150> or

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
software is what I think they fixed or

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.359 
software is what I think they fixed or
they<00:01:11.780> tweet<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:12.979> gives<00:01:13.070> better

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
they tweet so it gives better

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.430 
they tweet so it gives better
performance<00:01:14.000> however<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.930> should<00:01:14.960> note<00:01:15.409> that

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
performance however you should note that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.460 
performance however you should note that
if<00:01:16.130> there's<00:01:16.430> 12<00:01:16.790> or<00:01:17.030> more<00:01:17.060> players<00:01:17.450> who<00:01:18.050> use

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
if there's 12 or more players who use

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.130 
if there's 12 or more players who use
voice<00:01:18.740> chat<00:01:19.100> this<00:01:19.909> does<00:01:20.240> reduce<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.900> frame

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
voice chat this does reduce the frame

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.430 
voice chat this does reduce the frame
rate<00:01:21.409> for<00:01:21.740> everyone<00:01:21.770> else<00:01:22.420> next<00:01:23.420> is<00:01:23.570> that<00:01:24.050> the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
rate for everyone else next is that the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.380 
rate for everyone else next is that the
wobbling<00:01:24.920> effects<00:01:25.400> which<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.640> talked<00:01:25.880> about<00:01:26.030> in

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
wobbling effects which I talked about in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.510 
wobbling effects which I talked about in
one<00:01:26.570> of<00:01:26.600> my<00:01:26.750> previous<00:01:27.020> videos<00:01:27.620> which<00:01:28.010> I<00:01:28.130> posted

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
one of my previous videos which I posted

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.450 
one of my previous videos which I posted
on<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.760> original<00:01:29.120> cp9<00:01:29.570> channel<00:01:30.340> there<00:01:31.340> was<00:01:31.430> a

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
on the original cp9 channel there was a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.000 
on the original cp9 channel there was a
wobbling<00:01:31.909> effect<00:01:32.330> in<00:01:32.990> chase<00:01:33.350> view<00:01:33.590> which<00:01:33.830> they

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
wobbling effect in chase view which they

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.969 
wobbling effect in chase view which they
added<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:34.750> some<00:01:35.750> liked<00:01:35.990> it<00:01:36.260> so<00:01:36.470> I'm<00:01:36.560> hated<00:01:36.860> it

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
added and some liked it so I'm hated it

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.760 
added and some liked it so I'm hated it
was<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.280> Marmite<00:01:37.760> addition<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.659> game<00:01:38.840> but

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
was a Marmite addition to the game but

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.730 
was a Marmite addition to the game but
they<00:01:40.430> reduced<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.090> wobbling<00:01:41.479> now<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
they reduced the wobbling now so the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.170 
they reduced the wobbling now so the
people<00:01:43.040> that<00:01:43.159> did<00:01:43.370> find<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.760> annoying<00:01:43.940> the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
people that did find it annoying the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.390 
people that did find it annoying the
won't<00:01:44.390> find<00:01:44.690> it<00:01:44.870> as<00:01:45.049> annoying<00:01:45.470> now<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.250> people

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
won't find it as annoying now and people

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.450 
won't find it as annoying now and people
that<00:01:46.610> liked<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:47.120> it<00:01:47.330> still<00:01:47.870> is<00:01:48.140> there<00:01:48.470> next<00:01:49.100> is

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
that liked it it still is there next is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.390 
that liked it it still is there next is
AI<00:01:49.970> controlled<00:01:50.690> electric<00:01:51.290> cars<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:52.159> your

AI controlled electric cars so your

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.370 
AI controlled electric cars so your

opponent cars or your car and b-spec
they<00:01:55.220> will<00:01:55.400> now<00:01:55.490> pit<00:01:55.790> in<00:01:55.970> automatically<00:01:56.659> to

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
they will now pit in automatically to

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.020 
they will now pit in automatically to
recharge<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.650> battery<00:01:58.040> when<00:01:58.280> it's<00:01:58.430> run<00:01:58.610> out<00:01:58.760> I

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
recharge the battery when it's run out I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.969 
recharge the battery when it's run out I
assume<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.960> should<00:02:00.260> have<00:02:00.350> been<00:02:00.560> doing<00:02:00.799> this

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
assume it should have been doing this

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.530 
assume it should have been doing this
from<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.250> beginning<00:02:01.369> but<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:01.940> didn't<00:02:02.270> and

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
from the beginning but it didn't and

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.770 
from the beginning but it didn't and
that's<00:02:03.049> fixed<00:02:03.680> next<00:02:04.610> up<00:02:04.760> they<00:02:05.030> reduce<00:02:05.510> the

next<00:03:27.590> up<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.100> another<00:03:28.400> bug<00:03:28.639> which<00:03:29.420> was<00:03:29.600> fixed<00:03:30.019> I

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
next up is another bug which was fixed I

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.770 
next up is another bug which was fixed I
actually<00:03:30.319> got<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.040> myself<00:03:31.519> where<00:03:31.940> if<00:03:32.299> you

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
actually got this myself where if you

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.410 
actually got this myself where if you
start<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:33.260> game<00:03:33.290> without<00:03:34.190> signing<00:03:34.850> in<00:03:35.180> online

start the game without signing in online

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.520 
start the game without signing in online
and<00:03:36.019> then<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.859> save<00:03:37.280> in<00:03:38.030> GT<00:03:38.630> mode<00:03:38.870> or<00:03:39.170> even

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
and then you save in GT mode or even

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.250 
and then you save in GT mode or even
just<00:03:39.560> in<00:03:39.889> the<00:03:40.069> main<00:03:40.250> menu<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:41.540> cars<00:03:41.870> and

back<00:03:44.780> they'd<00:03:45.109> become<00:03:45.380> unusable<00:03:45.859> I<00:03:46.310> don't<00:03:47.239> know

back they'd become unusable I don't know

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.449 
back they'd become unusable I don't know
why<00:03:47.510> but<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:47.989> guess<00:03:48.560> that's<00:03:48.590> how<00:03:48.859> it<00:03:48.889> was<00:03:49.010> coded

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
why but I guess that's how it was coded

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.660 
why but I guess that's how it was coded
and<00:03:49.870> never<00:03:50.870> dress<00:03:51.170> that<00:03:51.380> now<00:03:51.590> so<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:52.519> know<00:03:52.609> you

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
and never dress that now so you know you

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.370 
and never dress that now so you know you
can<00:03:52.790> go<00:03:53.060> into<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.389> game<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.780> then<00:03:53.959> log<00:03:54.170> in

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
can go into the game and then log in

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.580 
can go into the game and then log in

the other fixes now they fixed an issue

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.199 
the other fixes now they fixed an issue
where<00:04:12.889> electric<00:04:13.400> cars<00:04:13.639> they<00:04:13.970> wouldn't

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
where electric cars they wouldn't

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.089 
where electric cars they wouldn't
recharge<00:04:14.780> in<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.049> pit<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:16.010> know

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
recharge in the pit and you know

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.529 
recharge in the pit and you know
obviously<00:04:16.250> they'd<00:04:16.609> become<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:16.880> mobile<00:04:17.299> and

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
obviously they'd become a mobile and

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.779 
obviously they'd become a mobile and
that<00:04:18.500> would<00:04:18.680> be<00:04:18.829> kind<00:04:19.160> of<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.400> end<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.669> the

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
that would be kind of the end of the

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.810 
that would be kind of the end of the
race<00:04:20.079> another<00:04:21.079> issue<00:04:21.260> they<00:04:21.530> fixed<00:04:22.039> is<00:04:22.160> when

got reported to them they fix that and
finally<00:04:37.870> we've<00:04:38.800> improved<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.460> force

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
finally we've improved the force

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.200 
finally we've improved the force

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
where this level 10 of the force

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.590 
where this level 10 of the force
feedback<00:04:46.900> adjustment<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:47.980> this<00:04:48.190> was

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
feedback adjustment and this was

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.780 
feedback adjustment and this was
