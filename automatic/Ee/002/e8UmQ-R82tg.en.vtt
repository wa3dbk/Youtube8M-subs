00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
so much further ahead of the curve but

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.610 
so much further ahead of the curve but
at<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.209> end<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.600> day<00:02:40.810> everything<00:02:41.530> would

very afraid of the media in the
beginning<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:10.959> used<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.410> think<00:03:11.530> Facebook<00:03:11.950> was

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
beginning I used to think Facebook was

to be honest and then I realized I could
either<00:03:17.470> be<00:03:17.829> that<00:03:18.549> person<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.970> gets<00:03:19.150> left

either be that person that gets left

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.680 
either be that person that gets left
behind<00:03:20.070> or<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.430> person<00:03:21.820> who<00:03:21.940> jumps<00:03:22.269> on<00:03:22.390> board

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
behind or the person who jumps on board

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.960 
behind or the person who jumps on board
and<00:03:23.110> embraces<00:03:23.769> this<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.310> started<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.760> see
