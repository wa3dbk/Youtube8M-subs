stuff inside iOS 5.1 beta 3 and it looks

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.049 
stuff inside iOS 5.1 beta 3 and it looks
like<00:00:47.190> they're<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.879> actually

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
like they're going to be actually

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.869 
like they're going to be actually
changing<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.020> few<00:00:49.440> features<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
changing a few features one of the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.459 
changing a few features one of the
specific<00:00:51.480> features<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.110> looks<00:00:52.320> like

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
specific features that it looks like

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.680 
specific features that it looks like
they're<00:00:52.620> changing<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> they're<00:00:54.120> having<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
they're changing is they're having the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.860 
they're changing is they're having the
enable<00:00:55.289> 3g<00:00:55.860> option<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.510> means<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
enable 3g option so this means that

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.779 
enable 3g option so this means that
instead<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.739> automatically<00:00:59.340> switching

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
instead of just automatically switching

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.420 
instead of just automatically switching
to<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> 3g<00:01:00.600> network<00:01:01.020> when<00:01:01.559> you're<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> 3g

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
to a 3g network when you're in a 3g

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.609 
to a 3g network when you're in a 3g
network<00:01:02.460> you'll<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.539> able<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.750> switch<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> 2g

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
network you'll be able to switch to a 2g

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.740 
network you'll be able to switch to a 2g
network<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.339> will<00:01:05.519> save<00:01:05.850> battery<00:01:06.689> life

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
network and this will save battery life

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.160 
network and this will save battery life
arm<00:01:07.880> now<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.939> wouldn't<00:01:09.270> technically<00:01:09.810> really
