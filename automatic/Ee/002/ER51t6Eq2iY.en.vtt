now<00:01:41.600> let's<00:01:41.689> take<00:01:41.840> our<00:01:41.960> hardware<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.560> we'll<00:01:42.920> go

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
now let's take our hardware and we'll go

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.200 
now let's take our hardware and we'll go
ahead<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.220> install<00:01:43.570> down<00:01:44.570> at<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.750> bottom

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.399 

double<00:01:48.210> check<00:01:48.390> ur<00:01:48.420> fit<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.170> we'll<00:01:49.290> go<00:01:49.350> ahead

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
double check ur fit then we'll go ahead

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.389 
double check ur fit then we'll go ahead
and<00:01:49.500> tighten<00:01:49.590> down<00:01:49.770> these<00:01:50.009> fasteners<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
and tighten down these fasteners and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.590 
and tighten down these fasteners and
then<00:01:53.399> there's<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.729> more<00:01:53.909> hole<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.450> got<00:01:54.570> a
