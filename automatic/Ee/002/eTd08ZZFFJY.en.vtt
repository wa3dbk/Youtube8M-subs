you<00:01:11.640> know<00:01:11.700> everything<00:01:12.090> from<00:01:12.329> the<00:01:12.450> tree

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
you know everything from the tree

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.690 
you know everything from the tree
running<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.229> running<00:01:13.590> around<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.340> the

running like running around it in the
treetops<00:01:15.650> jumping<00:01:16.650> from<00:01:16.830> branch<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.310> branch

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
treetops jumping from branch to branch

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.390 
treetops jumping from branch to branch
how<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.780> handle<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> slopes<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.130> rocks

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
how we handle the slopes and the rocks

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.399 
how we handle the slopes and the rocks
where<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.479> place<00:01:21.720> our<00:01:21.870> hand<00:01:22.110> holds

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
where we can place our hand holds

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.460 
where we can place our hand holds
everything<00:01:22.770> had<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.159> redone<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:25.380> know

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
everything had to be redone so you know

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.830 
everything had to be redone so you know
it<00:01:25.620> created<00:01:26.010> this<00:01:26.130> sort<00:01:26.940> of<00:01:27.000> huge<00:01:27.299> period<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it created this sort of huge period of

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.969 
it created this sort of huge period of
time<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.260> beginning<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> project

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
time at the beginning of the project

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.039 
time at the beginning of the project
where<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.970> know<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.210> were<00:01:30.299> redefining<00:01:30.900> what

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
where you know we were redefining what

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
where you know we were redefining what
we<00:01:31.320> were<00:01:31.440> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> capable<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.460> doing

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
we were going to be a capable of doing

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.450 
we were going to be a capable of doing
and<00:01:32.940> how<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.930> would<00:01:34.229> affect<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.280> world

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and how that would affect the the world

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.000 
and how that would affect the the world
design<00:01:36.080> so<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.140> know<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.470> spent<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.799> lot<00:01:37.979> of

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
design so you know we spent a lot of

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.920 
design so you know we spent a lot of
time<00:01:38.190> with<00:01:38.520> our<00:01:38.580> world<00:01:39.270> people<00:01:39.690> with<00:01:39.810> our

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
time with our world people with our

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.140 
time with our world people with our
animators<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.650> our<00:01:40.799> engineers<00:01:41.250> all<00:01:41.790> sort<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
animators with our engineers all sort of

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850 
animators with our engineers all sort of
coordinating<00:01:42.810> together<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.260> figure<00:01:43.409> out<00:01:43.619> okay

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
coordinating together to figure out okay

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.039 
coordinating together to figure out okay
what's<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> right<00:01:44.490> sort<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.360> mixture<00:01:45.810> of

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
what's the right sort of mixture of

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.960 
what's the right sort of mixture of
ingredients<00:01:46.200> how<00:01:46.830> far<00:01:47.100> apart<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.760> put

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
ingredients how far apart can we put

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.570 
ingredients how far apart can we put
things<00:01:48.350> how<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.619> trees<00:01:49.770> work<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.490> know

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
things how do the trees work you know

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.580 
things how do the trees work you know
can<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:50.970> generate<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.570> trees<00:01:51.810> procedurally

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
can we generate the trees procedurally

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
can we generate the trees procedurally
using<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.130> real<00:01:53.670> trees<00:01:54.000> something<00:01:54.330> like

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
using like real trees something like

honest<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.489> been<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.849> frontier<00:02:09.209> you

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
honest have you been in the frontier you

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:10.789 
honest have you been in the frontier you
can't<00:02:09.509> really<00:02:09.629> tell<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.200> been<00:02:10.379> hand<00:02:10.560> placed

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
can't really tell it's been hand placed

it looks like a forest there are various
bits<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.189> know<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.790> sort<00:02:14.970> of

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
bits you know you have to sort of

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.789 
bits you know you have to sort of
sometimes<00:02:15.629> stand<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.230> look<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.470> go<00:02:16.590> right

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
sometimes stand and look and go right

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.920 
sometimes stand and look and go right
there's<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.250> branch<00:02:17.579> need<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.879> get<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:18.780> it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
there's the branch need to get to but it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.990 
there's the branch need to get to but it
is<00:02:19.049> a<00:02:19.079> very<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.680> looks<00:02:19.920> very<00:02:20.159> natural<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.849> it

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
spoils you get on the other side so if

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.959 
spoils you get on the other side so if
you<00:04:34.090> use<00:04:34.270> like<00:04:34.719> a<00:04:34.750> firearm<00:04:35.349> or

you use like a firearm or

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.209 
you use like a firearm or
your<00:04:36.089> arrows<00:04:36.449> something<00:04:36.899> like<00:04:37.019> that<00:04:37.229> it's

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
your arrows something like that it's

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.029 
your arrows something like that it's
less<00:04:38.669> going<00:04:38.879> to<00:04:38.939> be<00:04:38.999> very<00:04:39.229> exactly<00:04:40.229> right<00:04:40.559> so

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
less going to be very exactly right so

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.489 
less going to be very exactly right so
it's<00:04:41.610> less<00:04:41.939> beneficial<00:04:42.419> for<00:04:42.749> you<00:04:42.839> we<00:04:43.169> want<00:04:43.439> you
