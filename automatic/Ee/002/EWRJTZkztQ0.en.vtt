for<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.480> on<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.840> probably<00:00:33.989> going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> be

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
for it on this is probably going to be

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.280 
for it on this is probably going to be
one<00:00:34.559> take<00:00:34.890> which<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:36.020> different<00:00:37.020> from<00:00:37.140> my

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
one take which is different from my

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.690 
one take which is different from my
other<00:00:37.320> videos<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:37.920> usually<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.460> million

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
other videos they usually have a million

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.369 
other videos they usually have a million
different<00:00:38.790> takes<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> lot

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
different takes it's going to be a lot

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.880 
different takes it's going to be a lot
easier<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.680> edit<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.489> um<00:00:42.649> alright<00:00:43.649> so

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
easier to edit this one is um alright so

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.380 
easier to edit this one is um alright so

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
are old men there are a lot of old men

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.930 
are old men there are a lot of old men
um<00:02:22.010> but<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.310> notice<00:02:23.460> you<00:02:23.610> don't<00:02:23.700> have<00:02:23.820> a

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
um but if you notice you don't have a

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.340 
um but if you notice you don't have a
father<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:25.580> um<00:02:26.580> blue<00:02:27.570> doesn't<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.200> any

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
father and um blue doesn't have any

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.110 
father and um blue doesn't have any
parents<00:02:29.480> in<00:02:30.480> general<00:02:31.470> one<00:02:32.030> actually<00:02:33.030> you

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
parents in general one actually you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.760 
parents in general one actually you
don't<00:02:33.210> you<00:02:33.720> only<00:02:33.840> have<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.230> think<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.560> only<00:02:34.650> one

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
don't you only have I think the only one

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.320 
don't you only have I think the only one
you<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.010> fought<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.640> have<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.820> father<00:02:36.060> in

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
you have a fought you have a father in

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.150 
you have a fought you have a father in
his<00:02:36.570> gen3<00:02:39.140> that's<00:02:40.140> because<00:02:40.530> he's<00:02:40.830> just<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
his gen3 that's because he's just a

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:50.300 
his gen3 that's because he's just a
story<00:02:41.580> arc<00:02:41.850> thing<00:02:44.150> um<00:02:47.420> yeah<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
story arc thing um yeah and so the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.449 
story arc thing um yeah and so the
theory<00:02:50.670> think<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.390> says<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.930> um<00:02:52.170> all<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
theory think it says that um all the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.640 
theory think it says that um all the
adult<00:02:54.240> men<00:02:54.480> went<00:02:54.810> off<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.050> fight<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.380> war

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
adult men went off to fight in the war

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.900 
adult men went off to fight in the war
and<00:02:55.680> many<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.280> them<00:02:56.459> died<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:01.640> yeah<00:03:02.640> so

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
and many of them died so and yeah so

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.280 
and many of them died so and yeah so
there's<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.270> lot<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.480> evidence<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:04.020> support

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
there's a lot of evidence to support

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.580 
there's a lot of evidence to support
this<00:03:04.560> theory<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:06.240> main<00:03:06.480> thing<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.959> when

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
this theory the main thing is that when

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.320 
this theory the main thing is that when
lieutenant<00:03:07.740> Serge<00:03:08.190> says<00:03:08.610> electric<00:03:09.180> pokemon

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
lieutenant Serge says electric pokemon

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.230 
lieutenant Serge says electric pokemon
saved<00:03:09.660> me<00:03:09.840> during<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.230> war<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:14.459> yeah<00:03:14.970> and

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
saved me during the war and so yeah and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.110 
saved me during the war and so yeah and
if<00:03:15.720> there<00:03:16.170> was<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.320> war<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.940> affects<00:03:17.940> the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
if there was a war it affects the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.110 
if there was a war it affects the
question<00:03:18.480> are<00:03:18.600> they<00:03:18.780> fighting<00:03:19.080> with<00:03:19.790> guns<00:03:20.790> or

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
question are they fighting with guns or

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.000 
question are they fighting with guns or
solely<00:03:21.450> with<00:03:21.630> pokemon<00:03:22.080> or<00:03:22.260> mix<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.769> both

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
solely with pokemon or mix of both

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.240 
solely with pokemon or mix of both
because<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.120> anime<00:03:24.480> there<00:03:24.720> are<00:03:24.810> guns<00:03:25.250> but

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
because in the anime there are guns but

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.130 
because in the anime there are guns but
in<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.550> games<00:03:26.790> there<00:03:27.000> are<00:03:27.090> not<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.840> I

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
in the games there are not and so I

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.470
