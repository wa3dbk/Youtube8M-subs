00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.810
 Hello everyone, we will do today 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.349
 here's a review 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.059
 condensed milk means firstly it 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.539
 Rogachev as I said in other videos 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.850
 Rogachev I searched for almost a year so nothing 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.890
 like us and no I do not know about what in 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.560
 Minsk shops well, not that I am the goal 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.760
 set myself exactly find well as soon as 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.150
 here is this somewhere in the department where there is 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.280
 condensed milk pay attention here finally 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.680
 I found something but this bank except everything 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.890
 Other things I would be interested only by 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.059
 one simple reason 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.609
 written condensed milk 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:45.920
 sterilized fat 87 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:48.109
 percent listen condensed milk so flop 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.749
 there will not be that there is something liquid but 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.999
 to be so liquid because i 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:55.219
 I know that there is a pasteurized or 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.079
 stylized milk is guschina and 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.999
 milk is still some products but here 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.050
 such that there was condensed milk on condensed milk on 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:03.589
 must be thick 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.879
 hence the name is condensed but not 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.790
 less let's look at the jar 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:20.090
 open and try anyone interested 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:21.770
 We pause we read let's open to 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.780
 besides, what can I say that this jar I 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.060
 I did not buy this bank today 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.780
 time was in the fridge so well 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.520
 how do you see this to me like me 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.520
 it seems just some kind of advertising move 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.730
 until the fucking blah blamed everything around everything's 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.210
 milk spray means firstly how 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.910
 you see this experienced where even close 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.410
 there is nothing condensed 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.410
 this is ordinary pasteurized milk 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:09.660
 I'll try it guys this is ordinary 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.060
 pasteurized milk no condensed milk 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.620
 and it doesn't even smell like that 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.930
 I ca n't say anything bad about it 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.690
 bad is not good water to milk fat 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.580
 pasteurized milk but when I have 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.500
 Many brains save 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.380
 buyers we come to the shop see 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.340
 condensed milk then we want to see a goose 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.680
 they are pasteurized milk and honestly 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.410
 saying here I am this bank when picked up 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.290
 I took her pasteurized milk 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.160
 I took like a can of condensed milk you understand because 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.489
 what's the first thing that catches milk 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.980
 condensed is the first word condensed 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.970
 and if condensed milk means so 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.489
 must be condensed milk and it's crap 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.580
 maybe the product is good but nasa happens 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.380
 so not as well and this product 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.180
 I can not evaluate because it is pure 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.790
 clean water in my kidalovo 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.769
 here and if somewhere there on the singer on 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.620
 in a small font that is not something that you 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.140
 searched for the most important thing for the consumer 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.850
 written in large font and I have to 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.070
 see what i buy 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.519
 actually that's all I wanted 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.799
 said that there is ordinary milk 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.630
 frankly more accurate pasteurized milk 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.540
 which if you will buy 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.340
 open then open away from 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.160
 anything that could get dirty 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.900
 this is the second time 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.030
 of course one could pierce two 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.160
 holes I would have done and slip opened 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.960
 for myself i needed to show you what 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.570
 it is here that there is an ordinary 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.440
 get hold of someone condensed here at all 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.840
 there is nothing i basically expected that 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.700
 it will be i thought the sweetest but she 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.680
 turned out to be not even sweet well 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.490
 saying everybody thank you all for your attention and up 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.490
 meeting in the next video
