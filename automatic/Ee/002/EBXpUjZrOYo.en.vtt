00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.720
 good companions 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.109
 to the final thoughts on the 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.230
 green beret knife of a magnet 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.920
 well we have finished the tests 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.160
 has passed all some with very good 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.980
 note others have cost more the truth is 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.810
 that I was surprised that in the court of 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.649
 The cut was so badly damaged 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.489
 by the thickness of the sheet the truth is what 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.619
 what has caught my attention 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:35.260
 excellent on the machete or we have already 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:38.320
 seen or beats a few nostrils 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.480
 good also in the cut of sea or more 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.670
 Thin in the sea cut or thicker 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.670
 as I say a little bit penalized by him 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.429
 by him also by emptying the width 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.420
 emptied this subtracts a lot much cut 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:56.600
 but good and also in the cuts 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.129
 fine I see it very good very good good 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.110
 very good for the thickness it has and the 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.839
 size that has nothing to do with the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.360
 Razor of 24 for example but good in 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.130
 As for a big knife, well, yes 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.409
 I would have had a flat cut the cut 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.670
 it would be much better because with the brought 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.729
 masters something cut is sometimes equal to 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.450
 difficult that these or worse and we go and 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.399
 is that it has no comparison 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.230
 but good in terms of capabilities 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.740
 very good 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.860
 well as I say we have seen that what 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.990
 which is the knife itself because it is 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.310
 perfect does not have any hard nicks 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.920
 has nothing I have not done anything to him or 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.110
 it is as it is as it has left the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.290
 I'm going to clean it and such 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.250
 which I'll go back and man 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.250
 this week 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.330
 and nothing really that good what to 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.220
 a pretty knife 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.980
 pretty good as I said by the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.600
 price that sheet geometry has is 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.840
 what I said I would have left it in 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.460
 its original size and the handle yes gentlemen 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.550
 of cv others I tell them to study it 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.810
 better because good is what we have seen 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.530
 and as I say I have a big hand 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.960
 for small hands and I do not want it or 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.280
 imagine accordingly nothing 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.230
 It's a knife that 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.180
 the truth is that you have to have it in 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.629
 account 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.329
 and good and honestly if it were not for 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.719
 these things because our cutlery 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:38.610
 national would be stagnant I see that 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:42.050
 lately, some 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.300
 two years of two years here 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.580
 Spanish cutlery has been put 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.040
 the batteries at all levels and it seems 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.370
 that are taking out interesting things and 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.370
 that are listening to the user a lot 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:00.050
 I find it very good and highly recommended and 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.760
 I do not expect what you think 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.640
 that you have it I hope that also 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.930

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.030
 greeting and we 'll see you already 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.540

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.730
