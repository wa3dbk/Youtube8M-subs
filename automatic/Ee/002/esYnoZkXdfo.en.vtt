work it took us round about four months
I<00:03:14.060> reckon<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.480> get<00:03:14.660> to<00:03:15.410> this<00:03:15.530> stage<00:03:15.800> doing<00:03:16.130> it

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
I reckon to get to this stage doing it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.920 
I reckon to get to this stage doing it
whenever<00:03:16.430> we<00:03:16.700> can<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.180> running<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.570> business

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
whenever we can and running the business

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.240 
whenever we can and running the business
as<00:03:18.110> well<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:21.110> yeah<00:03:21.380> as<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:21.590> said<00:03:21.769> that<00:03:21.890> extra

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
as well and yeah as I said that extra

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.370 
as well and yeah as I said that extra
height<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.700> think<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.360> height<00:03:23.600> at<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.900> lowest

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
height I think the height at the lowest

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.870 
height I think the height at the lowest
point<00:03:24.590> for<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.100> lowest<00:03:25.310> point<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.550> pitch<00:03:25.700> is

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
point for the lowest point of pitch is

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.080 
point for the lowest point of pitch is
two<00:03:26.060> point<00:03:26.330> seven<00:03:26.720> meters<00:03:27.640> so<00:03:28.640> they're<00:03:28.790> not<00:03:28.910> at

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
two point seven meters so they're not at

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.020 
two point seven meters so they're not at
the<00:03:29.180> top<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.810> think<00:03:29.900> it's<00:03:30.140> three<00:03:30.410> meters<00:03:31.030> maybe

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
the top I think it's three meters maybe

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.470 
the top I think it's three meters maybe
a<00:03:32.660> bit<00:03:32.780> more<00:03:33.610> so<00:03:34.610> just<00:03:34.790> here<00:03:35.000> we're<00:03:35.090> gonna<00:03:35.239> have
