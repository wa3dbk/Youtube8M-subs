00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.820
 good afternoon personal são paulo followed by abe psdb forum 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.970
 I am bringing here today another audit or good for who is 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.329
 starting 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.489
 of a maneuver known as an incident so let's go 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.070
 basically griffith you will use 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.189
 your finger 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.979
 thumb 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.170
 as if it were with tweezers 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.010
 and you will put the pen 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.020
 between the two pressing 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.330
 I know how good it is if you have a goat you press in public to 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
 rubber of the chain the rooster carijó 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.160
 here is the home page 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.420
 so it's expensive 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.410
 now 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.740
 what will you do 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.960
 you will get 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960
 play the cane now 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.740
 in a way that you do not need to invest the hand 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.900
 she plays ii 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.830
 so that initial momentum was given 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.830
 hehe the grid slip in your hand 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.090
 so come on games 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.220
 but not now 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.790
 and of course it will end up falling in a circle 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.930
 so it's going 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.620
 play 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.330
 she will fall a circle 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.690
 and then taking advantage of this meeting will give when she takes the first lap 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.230
 You'll be complete. 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.360
 in the thumb as it was post-industrial so what are you going to do it from here 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.830
 You're going to take your thumb. 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 and in his place we put the bangu 2 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.260
 I'll put your finger 2 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.290
 so do not go to portugal to another position 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.890
 so what it takes for you to do it from here gives a boost 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.240
 and bring it back 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.170
 have very well 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.420
 there is no game 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.220
 I played 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.780
 I fell on the circuit 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.810
 andrade is the first and circus 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.240
 you switch 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.189
 or beauty 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.119
 by the way 2 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:14.969
 then provide tutors 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.560
 And when there is here, what are you going to do? 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.679
 if you will give a boost with the hand 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.679
 in a way that she does it from here 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.299
 passing emotion left by fear 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.869
 in time 2 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:30.569
 so it will pass 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.239
 for this vain here 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.389
 You're going to try to find the truth so that Elano can beat you. 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.809
 under the plane 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.529
 and handle 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.529
 that's it, come on and stay like this 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.379
 Thank you good night, I hope you guys get it.
