00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.490
 So what we have here is one like that 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.370
 called cauliflower plant 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.099
 Canned plants live in the jungle of 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.040
 Borneo and the jungle are there 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.780
 problem how do i get light and one 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.289
 possibility is i use others 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.060
 plants as stirrup holders and waxes 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.279
 easy on that can do that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.400
 plants and these are so-called 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.230
 plant epiphytes plant the problem 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 is now when I'm on top of another 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.710
 Plant on it seats I have none 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.140
 contact to the ground 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.300
 So I have too few nutrients 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.489
 All nitrogen is a problem 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.350
 they can plant themselves 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.989
 they come together and they are just here 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.450
 So these are a leaves 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.829
 and so outgrow and in this can 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.050
 in principle, they have gastric juice and so on 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.640
 catch small flies and these 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.520
 They catch the fly by that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.410
 attract chemically they imitate namely 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.390
 the fragrance of a female fly 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.190
 So the male flies are flying 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.559
 then, so to speak, love and fly 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.590
 then fall into the pot and rows 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.100
 this gastric juice will be digested and then 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.810
 she can plant her nitrogen it 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 gives related can plants the let 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.210
 think of something more absurd 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.979
 namely the large cans have the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.869
 So have the form of a toilet 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.780
 from the loo and the lure actually 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.540
 squirrel are to these squirrel 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.350
 very crazy for a white sweet 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.400
 fabric so on the cover this kanne 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.320
 is upset and so they are there 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.840
 get there they have to be put on the pot 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.100
 to sit around the cover in the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.990
 moment where they lived 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.329
 the whole thing acts as a whole 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.040
 Bad laxatives make it easier 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.140
 in the jug and the cane plant 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 has also got its nitrogen so 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.340
 a typical example of how to plant the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.979
 yes actually are not mute 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.950
 can move with chemical signals 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.950
 cleverly manipulating their environment
