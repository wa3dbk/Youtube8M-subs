in<00:00:39.190> this<00:00:39.550> small<00:00:39.730> area<00:00:39.910> needs<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.809> all<00:00:40.929> work

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
in this small area needs to all work

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.799 
in this small area needs to all work
together<00:00:41.609> what<00:00:42.609> I've<00:00:42.760> chosen<00:00:43.179> here<00:00:43.629> is<00:00:43.719> a

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
together what I've chosen here is a

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.180 
together what I've chosen here is a
scheme<00:00:44.019> with<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.170> little<00:00:44.379> bit<00:00:44.589> of<00:00:44.620> punchy

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
scheme with a little bit of punchy

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.220 
scheme with a little bit of punchy
orange<00:00:45.579> in<00:00:45.760> which<00:00:46.059> is<00:00:46.210> quite<00:00:46.449> nice<00:00:46.690> in<00:00:46.929> a<00:00:46.989> small

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
orange in which is quite nice in a small

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.919 
orange in which is quite nice in a small
room<00:00:47.499> it<00:00:47.679> gives<00:00:47.890> it<00:00:47.980> a<00:00:48.100> lot<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.429> vibrancy<00:00:49.059> so

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
room it gives it a lot of vibrancy so

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.729 
room it gives it a lot of vibrancy so
I've<00:00:50.350> started<00:00:50.710> with<00:00:51.010> flooring<00:00:51.699> now<00:00:52.739> assuming

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
I've started with flooring now assuming

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.229 
I've started with flooring now assuming
that<00:00:53.949> you're<00:00:54.129> putting<00:00:54.370> your<00:00:54.519> own<00:00:54.579> flooring

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
that you're putting your own flooring

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.840 
that you're putting your own flooring
down<00:00:55.480> I<00:00:56.339> possibly<00:00:57.339> for<00:00:57.579> this<00:00:57.699> particular

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
down I possibly for this particular

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.569 
down I possibly for this particular
scheme<00:00:58.420> would<00:00:58.600> choose<00:00:58.870> this<00:00:59.199> some<00:00:59.589> nice<00:01:00.100> grade

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
scheme would choose this some nice grade

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.140 
scheme would choose this some nice grade
oak<00:01:01.109> flooring<00:01:02.109> with<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.859> wide<00:01:03.100> plank<00:01:03.609> will

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
oak flooring with the wide plank will

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.380 
oak flooring with the wide plank will
make<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.570> small<00:01:04.780> room<00:01:05.049> seem<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.799> lot<00:01:05.950> bigger

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
make the small room seem a lot bigger

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.460 
make the small room seem a lot bigger
alternatively<00:01:07.390> if<00:01:07.720> you<00:01:07.899> have<00:01:08.110> an<00:01:08.350> existing

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
alternatively if you have an existing

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.760 
alternatively if you have an existing
floor<00:01:09.399> a<00:01:10.119> wood<00:01:10.630> floor<00:01:10.899> or<00:01:11.170> stone<00:01:11.439> floor<00:01:11.680> or

floor a wood floor or stone floor or
something<00:01:11.890> like<00:01:12.159> that<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.399> might<00:01:12.640> just<00:01:12.820> want

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
something like that you might just want

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.069 
something like that you might just want
to<00:01:13.090> put<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.299> rug<00:01:13.600> down<00:01:13.899> this<00:01:14.530> is<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.979> flat<00:01:15.280> weave

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
to put a rug down this is a flat weave

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.920 
to put a rug down this is a flat weave
wool<00:01:17.079> rug<00:01:17.409> in<00:01:17.680> tones<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.700> gray<00:01:19.030> which<00:01:19.689> has<00:01:19.899> a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
wool rug in tones of gray which has a

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.530 
wool rug in tones of gray which has a
border<00:01:20.500> all<00:01:20.829> around<00:01:21.369> it<00:01:21.880> so<00:01:22.149> that<00:01:22.299> would<00:01:22.450> be

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
border all around it so that would be

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.959 
border all around it so that would be
very<00:01:22.689> practical<00:01:23.130> easy<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.369> roll<00:01:24.520> up<00:01:24.729> when<00:01:24.880> you

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
very practical easy to roll up when you

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.249 
very practical easy to roll up when you
when<00:01:25.180> you're<00:01:25.390> finished<00:01:25.719> with<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.930> when<00:01:26.170> you

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
when you're finished with it when you

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.459 
when you're finished with it when you
move<00:01:26.439> on<00:01:26.649> and<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:28.030> would<00:01:28.210> sit<00:01:28.479> very<00:01:28.899> well<00:01:29.079> on

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
move on and that would sit very well on

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.920 
move on and that would sit very well on
the<00:01:29.680> floor<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.189> unite<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.369> sitting<00:01:33.369> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the floor and unite the the sitting and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.249 
the floor and unite the the sitting and
sleeping<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:35.170> living<00:01:35.320> area<00:01:35.829> of<00:01:35.950> your<00:01:36.159> space

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
sleeping and living area of your space

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.630 
sleeping and living area of your space
so<00:01:38.259> we've<00:01:38.380> got<00:01:38.560> our<00:01:38.590> flowing<00:01:39.039> let's<00:01:39.369> look<00:01:39.490> at

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
so we've got our flowing let's look at

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.340 
so we've got our flowing let's look at
the<00:01:39.729> walls<00:01:39.939> now<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.450> again<00:01:40.750> it's<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:41.020> small

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
the walls now and again it's a small

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.959 
the walls now and again it's a small
room<00:01:41.380> so<00:01:41.799> instead<00:01:42.039> of<00:01:42.189> just<00:01:42.340> painting<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.850> all

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
room so instead of just painting it all

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.420 
room so instead of just painting it all
white<00:01:43.240> let's<00:01:43.600> do<00:01:43.780> something<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.229> bit<00:01:44.259> more

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
white let's do something a bit more

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.670 
white let's do something a bit more
adventurous<00:01:45.430> I<00:01:46.000> think<00:01:46.299> and<00:01:46.479> let's<00:01:47.380> look<00:01:47.530> at

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
adventurous I think and let's look at

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.340 
adventurous I think and let's look at
some<00:01:47.799> different<00:01:47.979> wall<00:01:48.369> coverings<00:01:49.299> here<00:01:50.170> I've

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
some different wall coverings here I've

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.279 
some different wall coverings here I've
looked<00:01:50.770> at<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.219> textural<00:01:52.210> vinyl<00:01:52.780> which<00:01:52.960> is<00:01:53.079> very

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
looked at a textural vinyl which is very

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.569 
looked at a textural vinyl which is very
practical<00:01:53.560> it's<00:01:54.549> like<00:01:55.200> woven<00:01:56.200> linen<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.280> it

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
practical it's like woven linen and it

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.580 
practical it's like woven linen and it
has<00:01:57.759> little<00:01:58.000> flecks<00:01:58.299> of<00:01:58.420> gray<00:01:58.719> so<00:01:59.020> this<00:01:59.229> would

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
has little flecks of gray so this would

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.010 
has little flecks of gray so this would
give<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.340> space<00:02:00.579> a<00:02:00.640> nice<00:02:01.030> textural<00:02:01.869> quality

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
give the space a nice textural quality

for<00:03:16.010> curtains<00:03:18.490> which<00:03:19.490> I<00:03:19.610> think<00:03:19.880> would<00:03:20.180> work

for curtains which I think would work

very well it's got a quite a lot of

very well it's got a quite a lot of
white<00:03:22.700> background<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:23.600> it's<00:03:23.750> not

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
white background so it's not

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.960 
white background so it's not
overwhelmingly<00:03:24.680> dark<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.340> brings<00:03:25.610> in<00:03:25.820> that

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
overwhelmingly dark and brings in that

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.440 
overwhelmingly dark and brings in that
orange<00:03:26.180> accent<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:28.460> vertical<00:03:28.970> will<00:03:29.090> make<00:03:29.270> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
orange accent the vertical will make the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.240 
orange accent the vertical will make the
room<00:03:29.570> feel<00:03:29.600> taller<00:03:30.350> as<00:03:30.680> well<00:03:30.950> which<00:03:31.220> is

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
room feel taller as well which is

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.640 
room feel taller as well which is
probably<00:03:32.000> what<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:32.510> might<00:03:32.660> need<00:03:32.960> in<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.320> studio
