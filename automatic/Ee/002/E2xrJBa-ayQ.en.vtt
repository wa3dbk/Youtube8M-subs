00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
hi I'm Tony Newton from expert village

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.700 
hi I'm Tony Newton from expert village
and<00:00:05.040> we're<00:00:05.190> going<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.490> talk<00:00:05.819> about<00:00:06.470> usage<00:00:07.470> of

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
and we're going to talk about usage of

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.990 
and we're going to talk about usage of
the<00:00:08.040> risk<00:00:08.280> for<00:00:08.570> dynamic<00:00:09.570> control<00:00:10.760> okay

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
the risk for dynamic control okay

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.550 
the risk for dynamic control okay
now<00:00:12.510> if<00:00:12.810> we're<00:00:13.020> playing<00:00:13.350> let's<00:00:14.130> say<00:00:15.470> let<00:00:16.470> me

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
now if we're playing let's say let me

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:54.779 
now if we're playing let's say let me
give<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> better<00:00:16.949> example

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.900 

okay<00:00:55.750> so<00:00:55.809> you'll<00:00:56.109> see<00:00:56.320> what's<00:00:56.890> going<00:00:57.250> on<00:00:57.370> is

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
okay so you'll see what's going on is

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.950 
okay so you'll see what's going on is
when<00:00:58.390> I<00:00:58.420> play<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.890> order<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.309> get<00:01:00.579> good

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
when I play in order to get good

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.100 
when I play in order to get good
dynamics<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.649> can<00:01:02.699> use<00:01:03.699> your<00:01:03.940> wrist<00:01:04.299> as<00:01:04.689> a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
dynamics you can use your wrist as a

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.600 
dynamics you can use your wrist as a
pivot<00:01:06.149> so<00:01:07.149> let's<00:01:07.630> say<00:01:07.899> we<00:01:08.380> just<00:01:08.680> play<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:09.220> simple

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
pivot so let's say we just play a simple

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.529 
pivot so let's say we just play a simple
chord<00:01:09.850> again<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:12.340> if<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.670> played<00:01:12.909> if<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.149> want<00:01:13.420> to

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
chord again now if I played if I want to

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.460 
chord again now if I played if I want to
play<00:01:13.720> this<00:01:13.899> chord<00:01:14.170> soft<00:01:14.619> I<00:01:15.390> don't<00:01:16.390> just<00:01:17.200> do

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
play this chord soft I don't just do

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:29.779 
play this chord soft I don't just do
that<00:01:17.710> I<00:01:17.950> can<00:01:18.280> control<00:01:18.729> it<00:01:19.000> from<00:01:19.299> my<00:01:19.630> wrist<00:01:19.990> by

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:36.660 

so<00:01:30.789> you<00:01:30.819> can<00:01:31.060> go<00:01:31.210> from<00:01:31.420> very<00:01:31.630> soft<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:36.369> very

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
so you can go from very soft the very

00:01:36.670 --> 00:02:11.640 
so you can go from very soft the very
loud<00:01:36.940> on<00:01:40.619> chords<00:01:47.759> single<00:01:48.759> notes

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.410 

and<00:02:12.650> all<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.130> is<00:02:13.550> risk<00:02:13.880> control<00:02:14.270> and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
and all of that is risk control and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.990 
and all of that is risk control and
that's<00:02:14.540> what<00:02:14.810> gives<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.620> able<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.190> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
that's what gives you the able to the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.680 
that's what gives you the able to the
ability<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.780> express<00:02:18.110> yourself<00:02:18.730> by<00:02:19.730> utilizing

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
ability to express yourself by utilizing

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.730 
ability to express yourself by utilizing
your<00:02:21.200> risk

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
your risk

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.590 
your risk
now<00:02:21.950> with<00:02:22.130> Neff<00:02:22.400> we<00:02:22.580> will<00:02:22.790> talk<00:02:23.000> about<00:02:23.300> using

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
now with Neff we will talk about using

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.380 
now with Neff we will talk about using
the<00:02:23.810> arm<00:02:24.050> together<00:02:24.770> with<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.250> wrist<00:02:25.489> but<00:02:26.180> the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
the arm together with the wrist but the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.900 
the arm together with the wrist but the
risk<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.170> pivot<00:02:27.560> point<00:02:27.830> for<00:02:28.340> everything

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
risk is the pivot point for everything

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:50.869 
risk is the pivot point for everything
that<00:02:29.150> goes<00:02:29.180> on

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.879
