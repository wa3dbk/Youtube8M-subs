00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.310 
pollution coming out of diesel number
two<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:56.009> we'll<00:01:56.130> put<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.520> out<00:01:57.320> diesel

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
two so we'll put that one out diesel

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.039 
two so we'll put that one out diesel
number<00:01:58.649> two<00:01:58.829> competing<00:01:59.369> product<00:01:59.939> here

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
number two competing product here

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.359 
number two competing product here
so<00:02:01.469> fuel<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> fuel<00:02:02.280> additive<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:04.369> I'll

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
so fuel is a fuel additive and I'll

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.980 
so fuel is a fuel additive and I'll
maybe<00:02:05.640> see<00:02:05.850> pollution<00:02:06.299> coming<00:02:06.509> out<00:02:06.719> for<00:02:06.869> that

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
maybe see pollution coming out for that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.859 
maybe see pollution coming out for that
one<00:02:07.140> okay<00:02:08.660> okay

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
one okay okay

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.720 
one okay okay
and<00:02:10.520> we'll<00:02:11.520> take<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> xp3

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
and we'll take the xp3

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.860 
and we'll take the xp3
this<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.000> one<00:02:15.150> we're<00:02:15.329> excited<00:02:15.689> about

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
this is the one we're excited about

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.289 
this is the one we're excited about
because<00:02:16.379> it<00:02:16.500> doesn't<00:02:16.920> pollute<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.790> now<00:02:21.000> if<00:02:21.180> you

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
because it doesn't pollute so now if you

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.839 
because it doesn't pollute so now if you
look<00:02:21.329> at<00:02:21.659> these<00:02:21.840> q-tips<00:02:22.230> our<00:02:22.980> competing

the<00:02:29.879> difference<00:02:30.269> on<00:02:30.420> those<00:02:30.629> three<00:02:31.310> how<00:02:32.310> many

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
the difference on those three how many

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.949 
the difference on those three how many
of<00:02:32.549> you<00:02:32.640> think<00:02:32.790> you're<00:02:33.000> clean<00:02:33.269> engines<00:02:33.720> better

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
of you think you're clean engines better

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.890 
of you think you're clean engines better
than<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.319> dirty<00:02:34.500> engine<00:02:35.090> xp3<00:02:36.090> actually<00:02:36.750> will

than a dirty engine xp3 actually will

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.960 
than a dirty engine xp3 actually will
clean<00:02:37.109> your<00:02:37.290> engine<00:02:37.680> it'll<00:02:38.250> clean<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.579> carbon

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
clean your engine it'll clean the carbon

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.789

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
clean engines more efficient but it

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.110 
clean engines more efficient but it

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
now what we're going to do water is a

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.099 
now what we're going to do water is a
problem<00:02:56.489> in<00:02:56.879> fuel<00:02:57.180> I'm<00:02:57.419> going<00:02:57.629> to<00:02:57.720> add<00:02:57.810> ten

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
problem in fuel I'm going to add ten

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.509 
problem in fuel I'm going to add ten
drops<00:02:58.139> of<00:02:58.560> water<00:02:58.769> in<00:02:58.980> each<00:02:59.099> one<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.400> these

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
drops of water in each one of these

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:09.780 
drops of water in each one of these
samples<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:01.290> count<00:03:01.560> with<00:03:01.739> me<00:03:01.769> here

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.880 

do<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.910> again

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:29.040 

okay<00:03:18.490> and<00:03:18.700> tell<00:03:18.880> her<00:03:18.940> again

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.960 

okay<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:29.620> we<00:03:29.860> got<00:03:30.040> plenty<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.430> water<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:30.730> out

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
okay so we got plenty of water and out

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.670 
okay so we got plenty of water and out
we<00:03:31.450> want<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.600> make<00:03:31.750> sure<00:03:31.780> we<00:03:31.990> put<00:03:32.140> enough<00:03:32.410> water

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
we want to make sure we put enough water

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.680 
we want to make sure we put enough water
in<00:03:32.890> that<00:03:33.100> one<00:03:33.280> now<00:03:33.820> one<00:03:34.240> thing<00:03:34.270> what<00:03:34.570> you'll

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
in that one now one thing what you'll

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.510 
in that one now one thing what you'll
notice<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.230> we<00:03:35.380> have<00:03:35.470> separation<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.400> the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
notice is that we have separation in the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.120 
notice is that we have separation in the
two<00:03:36.700> products<00:03:37.180> in<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.450> diesel<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:38.080> in<00:03:39.010> the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
two products in the diesel and in the

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.490 
two products in the diesel and in the
competing<00:03:39.610> product<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.270> then<00:03:40.840> xp3<00:03:41.230> you

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
competing product and then xp3 you

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.650 
competing product and then xp3 you
notice<00:03:41.800> one<00:03:42.070> homogenous<00:03:42.850> solution<00:03:43.360> you<00:03:43.480> see

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
notice one homogenous solution you see

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.630 
notice one homogenous solution you see
that<00:03:43.870> just<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.200> water<00:03:44.440> in<00:03:44.710> itself<00:03:45.040> went

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
that just the water in itself went

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.580 
that just the water in itself went
totally<00:03:45.850> into<00:03:46.240> solution<00:03:46.750> what<00:03:47.200> we'll<00:03:47.350> do<00:03:47.470> is

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
totally into solution what we'll do is

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.750 
totally into solution what we'll do is
with<00:03:47.800> the<00:03:47.920> diesel<00:03:48.220> number<00:03:48.430> two<00:03:48.520> we're<00:03:48.670> going

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
with the diesel number two we're going

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.970 
with the diesel number two we're going
to<00:03:48.820> mix<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.180> up<00:03:49.240> a<00:03:49.450> little<00:03:49.570> bit<00:03:49.720> here<00:03:50.080> we'll

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
to mix that up a little bit here we'll

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.470 
to mix that up a little bit here we'll
take<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.400> do<00:03:51.460> the<00:03:51.580> same<00:03:51.760> thing<00:03:52.060> here<00:03:52.240> with<00:03:52.330> the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
take and do the same thing here with the

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.030 
take and do the same thing here with the
competing<00:03:52.780> product<00:03:53.290> but<00:03:53.380> mix<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.770> a<00:03:53.800> little

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
competing product but mix that a little

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.740 
competing product but mix that a little
up<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.550> now<00:03:55.030> what<00:03:55.210> we're<00:03:55.360> going<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.510> do<00:03:55.660> is

now<00:04:04.150> let's<00:04:04.420> see<00:04:04.600> what<00:04:04.780> happens<00:04:05.200> with<00:04:05.620> the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
now let's see what happens with the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.020 
now let's see what happens with the
diesel<00:04:06.280> number<00:04:06.850> two<00:04:07.030> with<00:04:07.210> water<00:04:07.480> in<00:04:12.030> you

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
diesel number two with water in you

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.780 
diesel number two with water in you
notice<00:04:13.420> how<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.630> water<00:04:14.250> mixed<00:04:15.250> with<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.520> fuel

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
notice how the water mixed with the fuel

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.270 
notice how the water mixed with the fuel
is<00:04:16.060> not<00:04:16.720> very<00:04:17.020> efficient<00:04:17.739> in<00:04:17.890> burning<00:04:18.220> you

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
is not very efficient in burning you

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.580 
is not very efficient in burning you
hear<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.580> sizzle<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.090> pop<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.570> crack<00:04:20.320> going

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
hear the sizzle and pop and crack going

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.230 
hear the sizzle and pop and crack going
on<00:04:20.680> actually<00:04:21.070> that's<00:04:21.250> very<00:04:21.459> damaging<00:04:21.700> to<00:04:22.120> the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
on actually that's very damaging to the

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.030 
on actually that's very damaging to the
engine<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:22.780> that's<00:04:23.200> why<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.440> engines<00:04:23.890> will

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
engine and that's why the engines will

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.890 
engine and that's why the engines will
miss<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.250> little<00:04:24.610> bit<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:24.910> condensation<00:04:25.480> water

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
miss a little bit the condensation water

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.810 
miss a little bit the condensation water
is<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.140> problem<00:04:26.380> in<00:04:26.710> fuel<00:04:26.920> let's<00:04:27.430> look<00:04:27.610> at<00:04:27.730> the

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
is a problem in fuel let's look at the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.220 
is a problem in fuel let's look at the
competing<00:04:28.270> product<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.570> same<00:04:31.810> thing<00:04:32.080> to

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
competing product and the same thing to

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.990 
competing product and the same thing to
happen<00:04:32.290> here<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.800> sizzle<00:04:33.190> fireworks<00:04:33.700> going

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
happen here the sizzle fireworks going

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.210 
happen here the sizzle fireworks going
off<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.480> again<00:04:34.930> you<00:04:35.050> see<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.320> soot<00:04:36.010> coming

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
off and again you see the soot coming

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.620 
off and again you see the soot coming
off<00:04:36.460> okay<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:37.530> now<00:04:38.530> we'll<00:04:38.740> take<00:04:38.920> xp3<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:40.000> do

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
off okay and now we'll take xp3 and do

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.410 
off okay and now we'll take xp3 and do
the<00:04:40.780> same<00:04:40.960> thing<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:42.130> we'll<00:04:42.700> light<00:04:42.880> that<00:04:43.120> one

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
the same thing and we'll light that one

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.010 
the same thing and we'll light that one
and<00:04:43.600> how<00:04:43.900> many<00:04:43.960> of<00:04:44.170> you<00:04:44.290> can<00:04:44.500> see<00:04:44.770> the

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
and how many of you can see the

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.040 
and how many of you can see the
difference<00:04:47.020> there<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:49.210> flame<00:04:49.480> is<00:04:49.660> burning<00:04:49.690> if

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
difference there the flame is burning if

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.980 
difference there the flame is burning if
I<00:04:50.140> move<00:04:50.320> it<00:04:50.440> side<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.650> see<00:04:50.950> it<00:04:51.840> burning<00:04:52.840> that's

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
I move it side to see it burning that's

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.590 
I move it side to see it burning that's
with<00:04:53.170> water<00:04:53.410> in<00:04:53.680> but<00:04:54.580> now<00:04:54.730> if<00:04:54.850> I<00:04:55.000> look<00:04:55.180> at<00:04:55.450> it

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
with water in but now if I look at it

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.050 
with water in but now if I look at it
and<00:04:55.750> then<00:04:56.200> hold<00:04:56.350> them<00:04:56.500> up<00:04:56.620> again<00:04:56.950> I've<00:04:57.190> got<00:04:57.790> the

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
and then hold them up again I've got the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.550 
and then hold them up again I've got the
the<00:04:58.780> xp3<00:04:59.470> on<00:04:59.800> my<00:05:00.310> left<00:05:00.640> a<00:05:01.230> competing<00:05:02.230> product

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
the xp3 on my left a competing product

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.050 
the xp3 on my left a competing product
and<00:05:02.800> diesel<00:05:03.130> number<00:05:03.400> two<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.670> only<00:05:03.850> thing<00:05:04.000> you

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
and diesel number two the only thing you

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.490 
and diesel number two the only thing you
see<00:05:04.240> is<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.390> little<00:05:04.480> black<00:05:04.750> paper<00:05:05.170> let's

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
see is the little black paper let's

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.840 
see is the little black paper let's
start<00:05:05.710> starting<00:05:06.190> to<00:05:06.250> burn<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.460> black<00:05:06.640> paper

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
start starting to burn the black paper

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.720 
start starting to burn the black paper
with<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.090> q-tip<00:05:07.390> stayed<00:05:07.600> nice<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:07.990> clean

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
with the q-tip stayed nice and clean

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.909 
with the q-tip stayed nice and clean
again<00:05:09.730> a<00:05:10.000> clean<00:05:10.330> engines<00:05:10.780> better<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:11.500> we

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
again a clean engines better and we

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.950 
again a clean engines better and we
actually<00:05:12.070> can<00:05:12.430> take<00:05:12.640> water<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.360> make<00:05:13.840> it

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
actually can take water and make it

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.230 
actually can take water and make it
become<00:05:14.260> part<00:05:14.470> of<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.680> fuel<00:05:15.030> what<00:05:16.030> I<00:05:16.060> actually

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
become part of the fuel what I actually

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.730 
become part of the fuel what I actually
did<00:05:16.450> is<00:05:16.570> I<00:05:16.660> brought<00:05:16.720> water<00:05:17.050> finding<00:05:17.530> paste

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
did is I brought water finding paste

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.900 
did is I brought water finding paste

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
color cut they use this to find water

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.130

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
put just a little bit on the q-tip if it

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.490 
put just a little bit on the q-tip if it
turns<00:05:27.460> red<00:05:27.760> there's<00:05:28.030> water<00:05:28.300> in<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.630> fuel<00:05:28.870> so

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
turns red there's water in the fuel so

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.940 
turns red there's water in the fuel so
let<00:05:29.650> me<00:05:29.770> know<00:05:29.890> if<00:05:30.010> you<00:05:30.130> see<00:05:30.340> any<00:05:30.490> red<00:05:30.820> in<00:05:31.950> there

before your eyes how it'll take that

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:20.330 
before your eyes how it'll take that
water<00:06:13.770> and<00:06:14.010> put<00:06:14.160> it<00:06:14.280> into<00:06:14.490> solution<00:06:19.340> so

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
water and put it into solution so

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.490 
water and put it into solution so
literally<00:06:20.760> without<00:06:21.450> even<00:06:21.720> stirring<00:06:22.200> it<00:06:22.320> up

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
literally without even stirring it up

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.360 
literally without even stirring it up
you<00:06:23.010> saw<00:06:23.250> the<00:06:23.310> water<00:06:23.550> and<00:06:23.940> and<00:06:24.360> in<00:06:24.660> xp3<00:06:25.320> and<00:06:25.830> the

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
you saw the water and and in xp3 and the

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.620 
you saw the water and and in xp3 and the
diesel<00:06:26.670> number<00:06:26.850> to<00:06:26.970> come<00:06:27.120> into<00:06:27.300> one<00:06:27.480> solution

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
diesel number to come into one solution

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.930 
diesel number to come into one solution
now<00:06:28.380> let's<00:06:28.680> take<00:06:28.890> the<00:06:29.220> other<00:06:29.430> end<00:06:29.700> of<00:06:29.820> the

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
now let's take the other end of the

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.270 
now let's take the other end of the
q-tip<00:06:30.210> that<00:06:31.080> was<00:06:31.260> used<00:06:31.500> for<00:06:31.590> the<00:06:31.800> diesel<00:06:32.160> and

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
q-tip that was used for the diesel and

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.280 
q-tip that was used for the diesel and
now<00:06:32.850> let's<00:06:33.090> see<00:06:33.240> how<00:06:33.330> it<00:06:33.390> burns<00:06:33.630> with<00:06:33.870> water

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
now let's see how it burns with water

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:42.020 
now let's see how it burns with water
xp3<00:06:35.160> and<00:06:35.670> diesel<00:06:36.540> number<00:06:37.020> two<00:06:40.670> so<00:06:41.670> we<00:06:41.820> take<00:06:42.000> a

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
xp3 and diesel number two so we take a

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.040 
xp3 and diesel number two so we take a
dirty<00:06:42.390> burning<00:06:42.840> product<00:06:43.350> and<00:06:43.580> burn<00:06:44.580> it<00:06:44.700> clean

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
dirty burning product and burn it clean

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.320 
dirty burning product and burn it clean
okay<00:06:46.220> well<00:06:47.220> let's<00:06:47.400> see<00:06:47.550> what<00:06:47.700> happens<00:06:48.060> now<00:06:48.210> if

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
okay well let's see what happens now if

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.390 
okay well let's see what happens now if
we<00:06:48.390> just<00:06:48.480> take<00:06:48.720> this<00:06:49.110> and<00:06:49.380> dump<00:06:49.920> it<00:06:50.070> into<00:06:50.220> the

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
we just take this and dump it into the

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.630 
we just take this and dump it into the
competing<00:06:50.790> product<00:06:52.910> and<00:06:54.680> again<00:06:55.680> you<00:06:56.280> see<00:06:56.310> how

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.640 
competing product and again you see how

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.610 
competing product and again you see how
it's<00:06:56.820> mixing<00:06:57.240> up<00:06:57.450> we<00:06:57.870> got<00:06:58.020> a<00:06:58.050> little<00:06:58.230> bit<00:06:58.500> of

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
it's mixing up we got a little bit of

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.750 
it's mixing up we got a little bit of
the<00:06:58.680> product<00:06:58.920> on<00:06:59.160> the<00:06:59.280> bottom<00:06:59.550> you<00:06:59.610> can<00:06:59.670> see

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
the product on the bottom you can see

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.580 
the product on the bottom you can see
it's<00:07:00.000> starting<00:07:00.300> to<00:07:00.330> mix<00:07:00.540> all<00:07:00.750> on<00:07:00.930> its<00:07:01.080> own<00:07:01.230> see

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
it's starting to mix all on its own see

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.070 
it's starting to mix all on its own see
how<00:07:01.680> it's<00:07:01.830> going<00:07:02.010> clear<00:07:02.720> let's<00:07:03.720> just<00:07:03.900> give<00:07:04.050> it

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
how it's going clear let's just give it

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.590 
how it's going clear let's just give it
one<00:07:04.170> flip<00:07:04.530> for<00:07:04.740> speed<00:07:05.580> it<00:07:05.700> up<00:07:05.850> you<00:07:06.390> can<00:07:06.570> see

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
one flip for speed it up you can see

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.740 
one flip for speed it up you can see
it's<00:07:06.810> one<00:07:06.990> homogenous<00:07:07.620> solution<00:07:08.100> now

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750 
it's one homogenous solution now

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.000 
it's one homogenous solution now
remember<00:07:09.750> he<00:07:09.870> had<00:07:09.990> a<00:07:10.140> competing<00:07:10.650> product

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.010 
remember he had a competing product

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.580 
remember he had a competing product
water<00:07:11.520> water<00:07:12.330> finding<00:07:12.750> pace<00:07:12.960> in<00:07:13.200> all<00:07:13.350> of<00:07:13.500> it

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
water water finding pace in all of it

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.560 
water water finding pace in all of it
and<00:07:14.040> I<00:07:14.190> will<00:07:14.310> take<00:07:14.460> the<00:07:14.580> other<00:07:14.700> end<00:07:14.820> of<00:07:15.060> the<00:07:15.180> xp3

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
and I will take the other end of the xp3

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.620 
and I will take the other end of the xp3
q-tip<00:07:16.200> here<00:07:16.410> a<00:07:16.590> clean<00:07:17.010> one<00:07:17.220> and<00:07:17.370> drop<00:07:18.240> it<00:07:18.450> in

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
q-tip here a clean one and drop it in

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.920 
q-tip here a clean one and drop it in
and<00:07:19.460> now<00:07:20.460> I<00:07:20.520> had<00:07:20.700> to<00:07:20.880> dirty<00:07:21.090> burning<00:07:21.570> products

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
and now I had to dirty burning products

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.820 
and now I had to dirty burning products
in<00:07:22.110> xp3<00:07:22.620> and<00:07:23.010> look<00:07:23.460> what<00:07:23.610> happens<00:07:24.620> again<00:07:25.620> you

in xp3 and look what happens again you

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.790 
in xp3 and look what happens again you
can<00:07:26.040> see<00:07:26.280> that<00:07:26.940> we<00:07:27.120> literally<00:07:27.480> take<00:07:28.140> a<00:07:28.380> dirty

can see that we literally take a dirty

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800 
can see that we literally take a dirty
burning<00:07:29.190> product<00:07:29.640> and<00:07:29.790> burn<00:07:30.210> it<00:07:30.360> clean<00:07:30.600> that's

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810
