00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
conditions and stuff like that because

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.840 
conditions and stuff like that because
it<00:02:20.510> just<00:02:20.660> looks<00:02:20.900> absolutely<00:02:21.260> gorgeous<00:02:21.850> but

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
it just looks absolutely gorgeous but

it just looks absolutely gorgeous but
another<00:02:23.120> thing<00:02:23.390> is<00:02:23.570> you<00:02:23.690> know<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.080> idea<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.740> a

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
another thing is you know the idea of a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.190 
another thing is you know the idea of a
voice<00:02:25.160> protagonist<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.060> think<00:02:26.570> is<00:02:26.720> going<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.050> be

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
voice protagonist I think is going to be

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.560 
voice protagonist I think is going to be
a<00:02:27.470> big<00:02:28.070> selling<00:02:28.490> point<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.940> those<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.360> are

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
a big selling point to those that are

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.780 
a big selling point to those that are
casual<00:02:30.230> fans<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.740> those<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:30.980> want<00:02:31.280> someone

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
casual fans and those that want someone

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.820

that's<00:02:31.880> actually<00:02:32.270> speaking<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:32.900> screen<00:02:33.350> to

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
that's actually speaking on screen to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.830 
that's actually speaking on screen to
see<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.310> sort<00:02:34.520> of<00:02:34.640> interaction<00:02:35.090> like<00:02:35.570> The

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
see that sort of interaction like The

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.480 
see that sort of interaction like The
Witcher<00:02:36.110> through<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:36.440> know<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.770> lot<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.220> which

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
Witcher through you know a lot of which

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.130 
Witcher through you know a lot of which
are<00:02:37.640> three<00:02:37.850> fans<00:02:38.120> will<00:02:38.300> jump<00:02:38.570> on<00:02:38.720> board

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
are three fans will jump on board

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.200

fallout<00:02:39.680> 4<00:02:39.920> immediately<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.640> think<00:02:40.970> just

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
fallout 4 immediately I think just

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.720 
fallout 4 immediately I think just
because<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.570> that<00:02:42.080> reason<00:02:42.110> alone<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:43.040> really<00:02:43.580> do

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
because of that reason alone I really do

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.060 
because of that reason alone I really do
think<00:02:43.940> player<00:02:44.330> interaction<00:02:44.810> with<00:02:45.290> NPCs<00:02:45.860> is

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
think player interaction with NPCs is

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.640 
think player interaction with NPCs is
extremely<00:02:46.910> important<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:48.110> also<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.470> know

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
extremely important but also you know
