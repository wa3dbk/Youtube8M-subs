00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.399 
type them into my computer because I
like<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.420> just<00:01:53.570> have<00:01:53.750> them<00:01:53.929> all<00:01:54.110> in<00:01:54.289> one<00:01:54.320> place

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.870 

so<00:02:00.409> now<00:02:00.560> on<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.830> how<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:00.979> study<00:02:01.340> for<00:02:01.520> online

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
so now on to how I study for online

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.310 
so now on to how I study for online
tests<00:02:02.150> which<00:02:02.390> are<00:02:02.510> tests<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:02.870> are<00:02:03.020> outside

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
tests which are tests that are outside

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.410 
tests which are tests that are outside
of<00:02:03.380> class<00:02:03.620> and<00:02:03.950> our<00:02:04.040> open<00:02:04.400> book<00:02:04.550> so<00:02:04.880> if<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:05.270> on

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
of class and our open book so if it's on

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.320 
of class and our open book so if it's on
a<00:02:05.450> reading<00:02:05.960> way<00:02:06.620> to<00:02:06.680> Google<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.970> thing<00:02:08.179> and

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
a reading way to Google the thing and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.570 
a reading way to Google the thing and
try<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.479> find<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.810> PDF<00:02:09.259> version<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:10.459> that

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
try to find a PDF version of it so that

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.949 
try to find a PDF version of it so that
I<00:02:10.610> can<00:02:10.759> just<00:02:10.910> search<00:02:11.060> key<00:02:11.360> term<00:02:11.600> so<00:02:11.750> I'm<00:02:11.810> taking

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
I can just search key term so I'm taking

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.690 
I can just search key term so I'm taking
the<00:02:12.140> test<00:02:12.319> even<00:02:12.590> if<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:12.890> have<00:02:13.100> read<00:02:13.430> the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
the test even if you have read the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.430 
the test even if you have read the
actual<00:02:13.850> piece<00:02:14.209> it<00:02:14.360> makes<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> lot<00:02:14.930> easier<00:02:14.990> to

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
actual piece it makes it a lot easier to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.610 
actual piece it makes it a lot easier to
take<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.770> test<00:02:16.270> if<00:02:17.270> it's<00:02:17.510> on<00:02:17.690> class<00:02:18.020> material

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
take the test if it's on class material

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.310 
take the test if it's on class material
or<00:02:18.890> anything<00:02:19.760> else<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.030> save<00:02:20.240> it<00:02:20.330> as<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.450> PDF<00:02:20.750> my

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
or anything else I save it as a PDF my

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.020 
or anything else I save it as a PDF my
notes<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:21.830> took<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.610> can<00:02:22.850> just

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
notes that I took so that I can just

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.520 
notes that I took so that I can just
search<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:23.630> here's<00:02:23.870> how<00:02:23.990> I<00:02:24.020> study<00:02:24.230> for

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
search so here's how I study for

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.160 
search so here's how I study for
in-class<00:02:25.010> tests<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:25.790> are<00:02:25.880> not<00:02:26.060> open<00:02:26.270> book<00:02:26.630> so

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
in-class tests that are not open book so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.960 
in-class tests that are not open book so
I<00:02:27.500> will<00:02:27.650> take<00:02:27.800> any<00:02:28.040> online<00:02:28.430> classes<00:02:28.819> that<00:02:28.880> I

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
I will take any online classes that I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.580 
I will take any online classes that I
just<00:02:29.180> talked<00:02:29.420> about<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.930> will<00:02:30.140> copy<00:02:30.350> the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
just talked about and I will copy the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.199 
just talked about and I will copy the
answers<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.010> questions<00:02:31.370> into<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.730> Quizlet

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
answers and questions into a Quizlet

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.820 
answers and questions into a Quizlet
file<00:02:32.420> because<00:02:32.750> then<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:32.989> makes<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.320> super

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
file because then it makes it super

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.430 
file because then it makes it super
duper<00:02:34.100> easy<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:35.150> study<00:02:35.600> from<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:36.080> because

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
duper easy to study from that because

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.620 
duper easy to study from that because
it's<00:02:36.590> like<00:02:36.739> flashcard<00:02:37.310> website<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.269> I<00:02:38.300> really

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
it's like flashcard website so I really

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.500 
it's like flashcard website so I really
like<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.230> then<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.820> will<00:02:40.820> take<00:02:40.940> my<00:02:41.000> notes

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
like that and then I will take my notes

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.910 
like that and then I will take my notes
and<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.110> will<00:02:42.260> come<00:02:42.380> up<00:02:42.470> with<00:02:42.560> study<00:02:42.769> guide

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
and I will come up with study guide

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.920 
and I will come up with study guide
questions<00:02:42.950> from<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.850> notes<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.330> here<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.720> have

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
questions from the notes so here I have

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.240 
questions from the notes so here I have
a<00:02:44.959> question<00:02:45.260> right<00:02:45.410> there<00:02:45.620> who<00:02:45.860> has<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.130> most

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
a question right there who has the most

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.190 
a question right there who has the most
important<00:02:47.180> impact<00:02:47.510> on<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.720> environment<00:02:47.840> and

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
important impact on the environment and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.810 
important impact on the environment and
the<00:02:48.290> answers<00:02:48.560> humans<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.370> I'd<00:02:49.459> make<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:49.760> a

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
the answers humans so I'd make that a

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.910 
the answers humans so I'd make that a
question<00:02:50.269> on<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.450> flash<00:02:50.720> card<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:51.230> then<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.680> just

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
question on a flash card and then I just

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.410 
question on a flash card and then I just
go<00:02:52.040> through<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.430> find<00:02:52.550> questions<00:02:52.970> like<00:02:53.150> what

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
go through and find questions like what

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.000 
go through and find questions like what
did<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.660> real<00:02:53.810> conference<00:02:54.170> accomplish<00:02:54.709> stuff

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
did the real conference accomplish stuff

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.530 
did the real conference accomplish stuff
like<00:02:55.130> that<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.580> then<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:55.880> put<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.330> into

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
like that and then I put that into

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.509 
like that and then I put that into
Quizlet<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.769> thank<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.130> guys<00:02:58.160> for<00:02:58.310> watching
