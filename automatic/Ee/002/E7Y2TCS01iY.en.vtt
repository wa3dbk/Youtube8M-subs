it you know when he was sick he always

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.120 
it you know when he was sick he always
questioned<00:04:20.270> his<00:04:20.390> ability<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:20.870> do<00:04:21.140> things<00:04:21.350> and

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
then after you know being in the pool

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.410
