00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.310
 do not 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.340
 normal you do not do the your idea to drop your 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 bases from here to there much better 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.200
 much better in those improved in many 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.450
 aspects we have improved in then in the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.420
 physical work and touch ball if 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.220
 we are still a little bit obviously missing 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.560
 very much a new half-time 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.210
 season and this one and we work 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.799
 still a lot about what 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.200
 we abandon the goal this year 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.119
 approaching the goal in a way 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.220
 relational but be the champion we have 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.170
 with what to start having a new team 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.939
 we totally have to carry 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.010
 I 'm not going to stop here is to not play anymore 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.750
 iconic and other girls with university 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.250
 well I have a very responsibility 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.410
 great to be playing here because 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.740
 I'm a decade then I have to 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.420
 play a good role I like a lot 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.030
 how are we united 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.909
 It is to have a lot of communication between 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.340
 others came a season playing here 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.100
 but we've had parties write more 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.349
 and it really has been a very, very 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.880
 nice experience I really like this 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.430
 sport is like a distraction calls me 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.440
 a lot of attention 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.830
 more than the school more than the scholarship 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.310
 it's something that I like and I'm 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.310
 pleased to be here
