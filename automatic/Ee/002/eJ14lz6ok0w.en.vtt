00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.470
 we are a blade we are a company producing 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.910
 auto chemistry for professionals often 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.880
 ask how to wash 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.740
 the car we decided something really little things 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.590
 let's wash the tank especially since the wedge 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.570
 famous tanker for his shampoo and so 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.420
 you see 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.460
 t-34 is a combat vehicle of the 44th year of release 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.260
 courtesy of the museum 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.199
 armored vehicles in Cuba 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.880
 we were given a tank not specially washed and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.590
 this moment we have it further 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.590
 dirty for the purity of the experiment 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.690
 So we proceed to wash if your tank 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.700
 car or other means 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.040
 movement heavily polluted 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.050
 first thing you need to bring down the grace 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.559
 body surface water jet under 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.559
 high pressure 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.710
 I covered our tank with active foam 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.030
 we use at the same time foamy nozzle and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.980
 shampoo tankman divorced 14 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.530
 leaving the car in the foam for two or three minutes 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.600
 no wonder foam is called active 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.549
 the moment molecules innovation 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.010
 detergent penetrates deep into 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.260
 dirt and literally rip off dirt 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.590
 from the surface of the body without damaging 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.970
 this paintwork machine 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.970
 wash off the foam with a stream of water under high 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.140
 pressure while moving upwards 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.140
 this is a mandatory rule 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.750
 here is our tank as a whole is clean however we 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.570
 we find out not yielded washing 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.179
 heavy pollution is oil stains 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.759
 complex chemical composition besides 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.490
 old tools use blade 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.909
 engine cover pi-1 composition waiting 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.689
 two three minutes and wash off all the body water 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.329
 T-34 tank clean you yourself saw what 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.549
 capable of our detergent gently and 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.619
