00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
them up a bit into smaller pieces so I
just<00:01:24.659> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.869> pulsed<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> Vitamix<00:01:25.920> until<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
just kind of pulsed the Vitamix until I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.280 
just kind of pulsed the Vitamix until I
have<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> right<00:01:26.700> consistency<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.630> throw<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
have the right consistency and throw the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.710 
have the right consistency and throw the
almonds<00:01:28.619> into<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.040> large<00:01:29.430> bowl<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.970> then<00:01:30.509> I'm

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
almonds into a large bowl and then I'm

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.969 
almonds into a large bowl and then I'm
gonna<00:01:30.869> put<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> oats<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.890> I'm

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
gonna put in the oats with that I'm

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.020 
gonna put in the oats with that I'm
going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> put<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.490> measurements<00:01:32.909> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
going to put all the measurements you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.880 
going to put all the measurements you
need<00:01:33.060> down<00:01:33.570> below<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.259> think<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.740> just

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
need down below but I think you can just

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.170 
need down below but I think you can just
kind<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.070> put<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.400> whatever<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.759> want<00:01:35.790> it's

kind of put in whatever you want it's
not<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.600> baking<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.229> don't<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> be

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
not like baking you don't have to be

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.380 
not like baking you don't have to be
strict<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.130> your<00:01:38.369> measurements<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.060> just

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
strict with your measurements I just

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.690 
strict with your measurements I just
kind<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.689> guesstimate<00:01:40.619> now<00:01:41.220> I'm<00:01:41.369> gonna<00:01:41.520> head

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
kind of guesstimate now I'm gonna head

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.210 
kind of guesstimate now I'm gonna head
over<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.450> hob<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.200> my<00:01:43.380> little<00:01:43.530> pan<00:01:43.920> I'm

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
over to the hob and in my little pan I'm

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.370 
over to the hob and in my little pan I'm
gonna<00:01:44.399> mix<00:01:44.610> together<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.149> coconut<00:01:45.960> oil<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380

maple syrup and the cinnamon and put on

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.270 
maple syrup and the cinnamon and put on
quite<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.930> low<00:01:49.170> heat<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.500> until<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.130> all

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
quite a low heat just until it's all

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.740 
quite a low heat just until it's all
melted<00:01:50.460> together<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.299> shouldn't<00:01:51.570> take<00:01:51.600> very

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
melted together it shouldn't take very

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.510 
melted together it shouldn't take very
long<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.680> I'm<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.799> gonna<00:01:52.979> pull<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
long and then I'm just gonna pull that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.550 
long and then I'm just gonna pull that
into<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.060> bowl<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.479> almonds<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.079> oats<00:01:55.290> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
mix that all together it sort of creates

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.380 
mix that all together it sort of creates
a<00:01:57.659> sticky<00:01:57.930> oat<00:01:58.380> consistency<00:01:59.340> now<00:01:59.820> my<00:01:59.939> oven<00:02:00.270> was

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
a sticky oat consistency now my oven was

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.310 
a sticky oat consistency now my oven was
already<00:02:00.630> preset<00:02:00.869> at<00:02:01.350> 180<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.549> UK<00:02:03.509> terms<00:02:03.990> I

already preset at 180 in UK terms I
don't<00:02:04.350> know<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.799> is

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
don't know what that is

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.310 
don't know what that is
everyone<00:02:05.450> else<00:02:05.630> but<00:02:05.840> I'm<00:02:05.929> sure<00:02:06.079> you<00:02:06.170> can

everyone else but I'm sure you can

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.380 
everyone else but I'm sure you can
google<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:06.770> I'm<00:02:07.399> just<00:02:07.549> gonna<00:02:07.640> lay<00:02:07.939> out<00:02:07.969> the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
google it and I'm just gonna lay out the

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.869 
google it and I'm just gonna lay out the
oats<00:02:08.629> onto<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> baking<00:02:09.890> tray<00:02:10.099> you<00:02:10.519> can<00:02:10.729> use

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
oats onto a baking tray you can use

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.030 
oats onto a baking tray you can use
grease<00:02:11.120> proof<00:02:11.420> paper<00:02:11.480> it's<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:12.560> hard<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.830> say

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
grease proof paper it's so hard to say

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.500 
grease proof paper it's so hard to say
if<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.580> want<00:02:13.790> but<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.000> feel<00:02:14.209> like<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.360> doesn't

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
if you want but I feel like it doesn't

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.790 
if you want but I feel like it doesn't
really<00:02:14.660> make<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.870> difference<00:02:15.019> I'm<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.650> going

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
really make a difference I'm just going

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.860 
really make a difference I'm just going
to<00:02:15.830> lay<00:02:15.980> out<00:02:16.099> onto<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.610> tray<00:02:16.879> pretty<00:02:17.209> flat<00:02:17.569> and

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
to lay out onto the tray pretty flat and

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.540 
to lay out onto the tray pretty flat and
then<00:02:18.019> throw<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.440> into<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.769> oven<00:02:18.800> I<00:02:19.310> don't

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
then throw it into the oven I don't

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.009 
then throw it into the oven I don't
really<00:02:19.670> know<00:02:19.790> exactly<00:02:19.910> how<00:02:20.450> long<00:02:20.599> you<00:02:20.720> keep<00:02:20.870> it

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
really know exactly how long you keep it

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.570 
really know exactly how long you keep it
in<00:02:21.140> there<00:02:21.349> for<00:02:21.379> maybe<00:02:21.769> around<00:02:22.010> twenty<00:02:22.549> to

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
in there for maybe around twenty to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.610 
in there for maybe around twenty to
thirty<00:02:22.970> minutes<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:23.569> just<00:02:23.629> keep<00:02:23.989> checking<00:02:24.319> it

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
thirty minutes but just keep checking it

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.960 
thirty minutes but just keep checking it
make<00:02:24.860> sure<00:02:24.950> it's<00:02:25.099> not<00:02:25.190> burning<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.849> can

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
make sure it's not burning you can

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.820 
make sure it's not burning you can
always<00:02:26.150> turn<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.480> heat<00:02:26.660> down<00:02:26.690> move<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.709> around

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
always turn the heat down move it around

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.190 
always turn the heat down move it around
a<00:02:28.280> bit<00:02:28.310> shake<00:02:28.760> up<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.150> oats<00:02:29.299> try<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.840> keep<00:02:30.049> them

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
a bit shake up the oats try to keep them

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.050 
a bit shake up the oats try to keep them
quite<00:02:30.410> flat<00:02:30.769> but<00:02:31.400> you'll<00:02:31.519> know<00:02:31.670> it's<00:02:31.849> ready

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
quite flat but you'll know it's ready

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.910 
quite flat but you'll know it's ready
because<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.629> will<00:02:32.750> start<00:02:32.959> looking<00:02:33.170> golden

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
because it will start looking golden

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.830 
because it will start looking golden
crispy<00:02:34.459> brown<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.450> would<00:02:35.569> smell

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
crispy brown and it would smell

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.860 
crispy brown and it would smell
delicious<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.519> then<00:02:37.670> when<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.299> time<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.690> up

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
delicious so then when the time is up

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.270 
delicious so then when the time is up
and<00:02:39.049> you're<00:02:39.200> ready<00:02:39.349> to<00:02:39.380> take<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:39.680> out<00:02:39.920> just

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
and you're ready to take it out just

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.460 
and you're ready to take it out just
leave<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:40.940> cool<00:02:41.299> mix<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.989> up<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.260> bit<00:02:42.290> and

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
leave it to cool mix it up a bit and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.990 
leave it to cool mix it up a bit and
what<00:02:42.739> might<00:02:42.950> happen<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.549> does<00:02:43.670> kind<00:02:43.940> of

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
what might happen is it does kind of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.819 
what might happen is it does kind of
harden<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.569> stick<00:02:44.810> together<00:02:44.989> but<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.410> find<00:02:45.680> if

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
harden and stick together but I find if

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.170 
harden and stick together but I find if
you<00:02:45.890> just<00:02:46.010> get<00:02:46.130> like<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.280> knife<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:46.760> break<00:02:47.000> it

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
you just get like a knife and break it

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.600 
you just get like a knife and break it
up<00:02:47.360> it's<00:02:47.930> nice<00:02:48.110> easy<00:02:48.380> get<00:02:48.590> some<00:02:48.799> large<00:02:49.040> chunks

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
up it's nice easy get some large chunks

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.100 
up it's nice easy get some large chunks
and<00:02:49.730> some<00:02:49.790> smaller<00:02:50.150> chunks<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:50.690> then<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.930> like

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
and some smaller chunks and then I like

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.960 
and some smaller chunks and then I like
to<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.349> put<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.680> into<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> jar<00:02:52.040> it's<00:02:52.760> not

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
to just put it into a jar it's not

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.610 
to just put it into a jar it's not
really<00:02:53.360> it's<00:02:53.510> kind<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.810> like<00:02:53.959> granola<00:02:54.410> but

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
really it's kind of like granola but

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.559 
really it's kind of like granola but
it's<00:02:54.769> more<00:02:55.099> just<00:02:55.310> like<00:02:55.400> oats<00:02:55.760> but<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.120> tastes

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
it's more just like oats but it tastes

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.910 
it's more just like oats but it tastes
delicious<00:02:56.720> because<00:02:57.319> it's<00:02:57.560> got<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.769> maple

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
delicious because it's got the maple

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.680 
delicious because it's got the maple
syrup<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.519> there<00:02:58.700> which<00:02:58.849> I<00:02:58.970> think<00:02:59.000> isn't

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
syrup in there which I think isn't

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.420 
syrup in there which I think isn't
unhealthy<00:03:00.290> at<00:03:00.470> all<00:03:00.680> it's<00:03:00.860> like<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.980> really<00:03:01.280> good

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
unhealthy at all it's like a really good

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.970 
unhealthy at all it's like a really good
sweetener<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.870> slight<00:03:03.200> cinnamon<00:03:03.680> as<00:03:03.829> well

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
sweetener and a slight cinnamon as well

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.530 
sweetener and a slight cinnamon as well
I<00:03:04.010> don't<00:03:04.280> even<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:04.640> cinnamon<00:03:05.120> but<00:03:05.299> I<00:03:05.360> think

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
I don't even like cinnamon but I think

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.170 
I don't even like cinnamon but I think
this<00:03:05.629> works<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.260> well<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.739> use<00:03:07.549> this<00:03:07.819> in<00:03:08.150> the
