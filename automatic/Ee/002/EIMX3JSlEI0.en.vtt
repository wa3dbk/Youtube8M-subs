00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.430
 hello guys and girls here I bring you 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.500
 another tutorial this time 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.860
 I will show how to optimize or accelerate the 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.260
 internet in windows 8 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.820
 before doing so we need to create a 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.860
 restoration point because 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.860
 we will modify the windows registry 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.650
 we give advanced configuration 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.890
 system protection 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.380
 here are the available units 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.660
 they give to create 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.500
 here they put the name they want to give 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.500
 to the point of restoration 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.980
 they give in creating and the 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.280
 process of creating the point of 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.280
 restoration 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:05.690
 once finished they give in to accept and 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.690
 now we look for the execute command 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.560
 they repeat and they give in to accept 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.280
 It will be opened to the Windows registry will 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.470
 click on key local machine 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.940
 system 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.940
 occur with ton set 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.690
 and services 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.690
 here they look for the folder that says tc I ask 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.549
 here we will have to create a new value 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.530
 the word value is for systems of 32 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.080
 bits 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.600
 the word value is for systems of 64 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.550
 bits 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.290
 to know how many bits is your 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.220
 computer must go to the properties 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.160
 of the system as you can see mine is of 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.060
 32 bits so I have to create the 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.060
 word value 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.860
 ah 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.350
 to the value they put the name that is in 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.350
 screen 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.440
 we were 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:54.050
 now they give you right click modify 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.050
 and they exaggerate 7 and 3 x 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.440
 now we close the registry and will need 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.590
 restart the computer 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.590
 yes 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.610
 let's do a test by downloading a 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.610
 one gigabyte file 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.640
 as you can see it 's going down to 500 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.640
 kilobytes per second and increasing 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.880
 with nothing 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.640
 ah 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.460
 no way 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.830
 good friends I hope you served them the 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.250
 tutorial I will continue uploading videos all 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:52.080
