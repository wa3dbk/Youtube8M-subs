00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
three of the wheels together I thought

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.749 
three of the wheels together I thought
I'd<00:00:09.360> just<00:00:09.950> kind<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.010> show<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.190> how<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.580> one

I'd just kind of show you how this one
goes<00:00:11.910> together<00:00:12.120> nothing<00:00:13.080> too<00:00:13.679> major<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.099> wheel

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
goes together nothing too major a wheel

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.970 
goes together nothing too major a wheel
as<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> wheel<00:00:15.080> to<00:00:16.080> some<00:00:16.260> extent<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.680> mean<00:00:16.830> there

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
as a wheel to some extent I mean there

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.310 
as a wheel to some extent I mean there
is<00:00:17.100> different<00:00:17.400> types<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.730> course<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.320> so

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
is different types of course but so

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.870 
is different types of course but so
there<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.560> go<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> plastic<00:00:20.340> centerpiece

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
there we go so the plastic centerpiece

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.140 
there we go so the plastic centerpiece
inside<00:00:21.680> with<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> foam<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.550> foam<00:00:23.760> strip

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
inside with the foam the foam strip

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.670 
inside with the foam the foam strip
stuck<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.779> there<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.199> just<00:00:25.410> kind<00:00:25.590> of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
stuck in there and that just kind of

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.439 
stuck in there and that just kind of
gives<00:00:25.890> these<00:00:26.130> two<00:00:26.460> pieces<00:00:26.730> something<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.269> sit

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449

screws<00:02:28.600> which<00:02:28.840> sucks<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.380> wheel<00:02:29.560> together

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
screws which sucks the wheel together

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.440 
screws which sucks the wheel together
the<00:02:30.880> two<00:02:31.060> pieces<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.630> wheel<00:02:31.810> together<00:02:32.020> and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the two pieces of the wheel together and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.390 
the two pieces of the wheel together and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
short screws in polanta long screws put

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.150 
short screws in polanta long screws put
two<00:02:38.890> more<00:02:39.250> short<00:02:39.550> ones<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.880> you<00:02:40.000> know<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:44.160> so

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
two more short ones in you know so so

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:55.640 
two more short ones in you know so so
now

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.730 

the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.890 

pressing<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.640> nuts<00:03:00.970> into<00:03:01.210> the<00:03:01.390> back<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.600> the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
pressing the nuts into the back of the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.210 
pressing the nuts into the back of the
rim<00:03:02.110> is<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.790> bit<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:04.030> nuisance<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:06.100> one<00:03:06.190> of

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
rim is a bit of a nuisance so one of

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.470 
rim is a bit of a nuisance so one of
those<00:03:06.370> things<00:03:06.580> they<00:03:06.790> should<00:03:07.000> just<00:03:07.030> drop<00:03:07.420> right

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
those things they should just drop right

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.610 
those things they should just drop right
in<00:03:07.870> there<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.430> know<00:03:10.200> sometimes<00:03:11.200> they<00:03:11.560> try

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
in there but you know sometimes they try

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.290 
in there but you know sometimes they try
and<00:03:11.890> go<00:03:12.010> in<00:03:12.130> every<00:03:12.280> which<00:03:12.520> way<00:03:12.550> except<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.180> way

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
and go in every which way except the way

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.750 
and go in every which way except the way
they're<00:03:13.450> supposed<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.950> now<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.370> can<00:03:18.730> see

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
they're supposed to so now you can see

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.730 
they're supposed to so now you can see
so<00:03:19.180> these<00:03:19.360> screws<00:03:19.720> here<00:03:19.990> are<00:03:20.110> considerably

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
so these screws here are considerably

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.700 
so these screws here are considerably
shorter<00:03:21.190> than<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.430> two<00:03:21.610> long<00:03:21.790> ones<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.150> see

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
shorter than the two long ones you see

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.410 
shorter than the two long ones you see
but<00:03:23.710> now<00:03:23.890> they<00:03:24.130> reach<00:03:24.400> because<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.030> two<00:03:25.180> long

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
but now they reach because the two long

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:34.120 
but now they reach because the two long
ones<00:03:25.890> squeezed<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.040> all<00:03:27.130> together<00:03:27.340> for<00:03:27.760> me

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130
