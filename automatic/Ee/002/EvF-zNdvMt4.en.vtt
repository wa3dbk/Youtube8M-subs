00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.210
 I think it's significant that the 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:09.040
 provincial government has decided a 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.400
 investment of almost 3 million 600 thousand 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.690
 weights of spare parts you know that the 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.710
 last week the train had 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.829
 inconvenience broke the whole of the 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.869
 machine to the 90 73 today was already repaired 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.239
 we get that through a company 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.800
 friend they lent us the spare parts already 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.199
 from this budget this new 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.390
 departure that was authorized we are going to 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.890
 regularize that situation has been spoken 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.810
 of the criticisms they have received for 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.660
 means of the press in the last time 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.350
 the authorities of the Patagonian train 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.910
 I have always received some sticks for the 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.610
 situation of which it is but 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.230
 I think if you take stock of the year 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.660
 past and what is being done 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.490
 so far the balance is still 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.410
 positive because from the situation that 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.590
 we leave the train has a situation 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.170
 really very bad to the current situation 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.780
 we are in the difference that I think 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.370
 is more in favor than against what 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.760
 it happened I repeat are old machines 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.280
 we still do not have 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.290
 new machines that we send to repair 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.780
 the trailers of pere so we're 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.370
 still in the transition has rules 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.160
 million in this case any arrangement 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.810
 means resources not so much what 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.240
 we ask let's say what happens in a 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.670
 moment those resources were cut by 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.260
 financial situations of the province 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.630
 then that generated us some 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.310
 difficulty but from this 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.420
 difficulty that is like it turns to 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.940
 become aware that they have 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.950
 Patagonian must be sustained above all 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.560
 because of the importance it has for 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.990
 our province in a whole area very 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.880
 wide that is the entire southern line not only 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.920
 in the transport of cargo but also 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.660
 passenger transport beyond the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.160
 machinery is talking about the possibility of 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:53.250
 improve and change the ways the roads today 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.930
 a very good news of this meeting is 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.000
 that we already started working with a 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.729
 technique that we did not have a machine that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.820
 it was incorporated that makes a weld 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.740
 complete the union of the rails that 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.840
 is being done in the repair in 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.560
 Buenos Aires and we are starting to 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.319
 do us here 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.330
 in our province or that in that 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.330
 meaning is an advance more than interesting
