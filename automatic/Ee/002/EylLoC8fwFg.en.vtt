00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:09.050 
inside of that we'll say six columns six
let's<00:02:54.239> duplicate<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.489> now<00:02:56.489> if<00:02:56.549> we<00:02:56.700> refresh

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.590 

Oh<00:03:10.010> it'll<00:03:11.010> automatically<00:03:11.459> try<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.760> compile

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
Oh it'll automatically try to compile

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.510 
Oh it'll automatically try to compile
like<00:03:12.840> sass<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.410> stuff<00:03:13.560> like<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.890> down<00:03:14.250> into

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
like sass and stuff like that down into

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.570 
like sass and stuff like that down into
one<00:03:14.730> file<00:03:15.260> so<00:03:16.260> what<00:03:16.770> we<00:03:16.860> need<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.069> do<00:03:17.310> is

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
one file so what we need to do is

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.500 
one file so what we need to do is
uncomment<00:03:18.270> this<00:03:18.450> line<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.060> actual

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
uncomment this line so that the actual

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.170 
uncomment this line so that the actual
style<00:03:21.980> stylists<00:03:22.980> are<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.640> CSS<00:03:24.060> that

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
style stylists are the the CSS that

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.309 
style stylists are the the CSS that
we're<00:03:24.300> using<00:03:25.250> will<00:03:27.650> show<00:03:28.650> up<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.810> we<00:03:30.930> refresh

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
we're using will show up so we refresh

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.910 
we're using will show up so we refresh
now<00:03:31.500> we<00:03:31.590> got<00:03:31.739> like<00:03:31.830> those<00:03:31.950> light<00:03:32.160> backgrounds

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
now we got like those light backgrounds

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.870 
now we got like those light backgrounds
go<00:03:34.920> over<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:39.830> well<00:03:40.830> if<00:03:40.950> you're<00:03:41.100> compiling<00:03:41.430> sass

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
go over to well if you're compiling sass

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.720 
go over to well if you're compiling sass
then<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.300> can<00:03:42.450> go<00:03:42.570> in<00:03:42.900> here<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.500> go<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.160> fonts

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
then you can go in here and go to fonts

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.610 
then you can go in here and go to fonts
and<00:03:44.970> just<00:03:45.300> prefix<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.989> with<00:03:46.200> HTTP<00:03:48.470> but<00:03:49.470> we're

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
and just prefix this with HTTP but we're

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.890 
and just prefix this with HTTP but we're
we're<00:03:49.769> not<00:03:49.950> compiling<00:03:50.640> sass<00:03:50.910> right<00:03:51.150> now<00:03:51.269> we

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
we're not compiling sass right now we

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.900 
we're not compiling sass right now we
will<00:03:52.080> in<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.260> next<00:03:52.380> tutorial<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:53.370> right<00:03:53.819> now

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
will in the next tutorial so right now

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.309 
will in the next tutorial so right now
we're<00:03:54.090> we're<00:03:54.209> not<00:03:54.239> if<00:03:54.600> we<00:03:54.720> just<00:03:54.870> put<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.110> on<00:03:55.260> our

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
we're we're not if we just put it on our

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.360 
we're we're not if we just put it on our
localhost<00:03:56.810> now<00:03:57.810> we're<00:03:57.959> getting<00:03:58.230> those<00:03:58.680> custom

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
localhost now we're getting those custom

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.110 
localhost now we're getting those custom
fonts<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:01.110> that's<00:04:02.069> how<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.250> get<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.459> project<00:04:02.700> up

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
fonts so that's how you get a project up

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.259 
fonts so that's how you get a project up
and<00:04:03.360> going<00:04:03.900> really<00:04:04.019> fast<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:05.190> then<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:06.209> know

and going really fast and then you know

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.750 
and going really fast and then you know

and<00:05:10.560> if<00:05:10.920> we<00:05:11.540> disable<00:05:12.540> this<00:05:16.940> just<00:05:17.940> calming<00:05:18.630> out

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
and if we disable this just calming out

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
that's how you get a project with Gumby

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.550 
that's how you get a project with Gumby
up<00:05:25.890> and<00:05:26.160> going<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.810> then<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.110> can<00:05:28.230> start<00:05:28.470> like

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
up and going and then you can start like

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.020 
up and going and then you can start like
overriding<00:05:29.190> things<00:05:29.460> like<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.880> background

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
color you know like to the nav so you

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.450 
color you know like to the nav so you
just<00:05:35.010> go<00:05:35.190> in<00:05:35.220> look<00:05:35.640> at<00:05:35.820> what's<00:05:37.160> like<00:05:38.160> how<00:05:38.310> it's

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
just go in look at what's like how it's

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.590 
just go in look at what's like how it's
getting<00:05:38.580> its<00:05:38.760> background<00:05:38.940> color<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.480> like

and making it look how you want so
that's<00:05:53.520> just<00:05:53.670> the<00:05:53.850> quickest<00:05:54.180> way<00:05:54.410> like<00:05:55.410> if

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
that's just the quickest way like if

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.380 
that's just the quickest way like if
you're<00:05:55.680> not<00:05:55.800> using<00:05:55.980> SAS<00:05:56.340> and<00:05:56.730> if<00:05:57.180> you're<00:05:57.300> not

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
you're not using SAS and if you're not

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.290 
you're not using SAS and if you're not
using<00:05:57.890> claim<00:05:58.890> eight<00:05:59.100> which<00:05:59.580> claim<00:05:59.970> it's<00:06:00.120> an

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
using claim eight which claim it's an

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.780 
using claim eight which claim it's an
even<00:06:00.570> quicker<00:06:00.720> way<00:06:01.050> and<00:06:01.320> SAS<00:06:02.220> is<00:06:02.430> an<00:06:02.520> even

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
even quicker way and SAS is an even

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.190 
even quicker way and SAS is an even
better<00:06:02.970> way<00:06:03.090> to<00:06:03.150> do<00:06:03.300> this<00:06:03.420> stuff<00:06:03.630> but<00:06:03.960> you<00:06:04.140> know

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
better way to do this stuff but you know

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.630 
better way to do this stuff but you know
if<00:06:04.380> you<00:06:04.470> don't<00:06:04.620> know<00:06:04.740> SAS<00:06:05.010> and<00:06:05.280> you<00:06:05.370> don't<00:06:05.520> like

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640
