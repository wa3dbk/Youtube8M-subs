00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.850
 hello to all friends the bad experience 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.260
 we comment samsung galaxy s 5 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.530
 not for the complaining review for 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.270
 show you the 5.0 update that 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.570
 finally arrives officially on 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.490
 samsung galaxy s 5 no brand for some 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.710
 branded in theory should be 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.269
 released a few months later some 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.949
 day was a few weeks ago 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.539
 know that in the end they succeeded 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.880
 really in a disparate way then 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.680
 so much so that this on these five per 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.240
 example that my friend passed me 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.530
 with which of course I spoke for 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.840
 have some opinions or some opinions 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.070
 day usage has arrived some 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.110
 day before the launch 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 official 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.610
 in short, he said all of them 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.990
 various so we hope that everything happens 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.910
 obviously bob is almost vetoed at 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.290
 lake just to give some 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.270
 we have specific information 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.270
 with inch full hd processor 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.880
 snapdragon 801 something with 2gb of ram 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.710
 16 expandable internal damons e 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.720
 whatever 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.320
 now let's wait for it to finish one 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.939
 for me to do everything, obviously for me 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.299
 have therefore reminds us to close 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.460
 drink the hooks of the perfect cover 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.439
 After we chose general and fruita 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.179
 even a little from what I see anyway 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.520
 speaking point that my friend has me 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.899
 lent from this point of view there is not 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.429
 there were neither improvements nor 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.469
 worse for the suite ai 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.569
 must a unchanged so can and not there 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.240
 we are lag in the screens 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.759
 main in the blue me menu and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.359
 anything else ok so no kind of 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.609
 problem has changed a little design like 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:41.369
 see here for example the slide and for 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:44.280
 the university has turned yellow and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.499
 especially like su on the android 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.100
 stop when you press see what remains 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:52.139
 only by bar and one by or a 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.060
 beckham also given a little to the layout 

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:56.399
 I'm not as good as we are 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.130
 however, it seems to me to be a e 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.259
 widget frameworks when they are turned on that a 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.039
 the available shape has changed 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.250
 we go immediately to the settings a 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:14.400
 then see information on the device 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.830
 we obviously have 5.0 here it is 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.760
 the lollipop therefore also that beautiful 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.100
 play if you want 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.750
 hate my record and 28 for the record 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.000
 interested to know, I played very little 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.800
 but he does n't want to go on 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.690
 even if it was good for me to talk a little 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.980
 problems that have arisen 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.500
 always talking to this enemy like 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.000
 he lent he confirms his 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.190
 primacy a moment and I must say that 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.350
 actually some applications there 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.760
 obviously puts a lot to open up e 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.920
 also cut out for example 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.280
 now on the browser directly or already 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:52.260
 loaded the courier desktop we wait 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.880
 a moment Corriere della Sera in short 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.440
 red the opening of the closing of the like 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.840
 applications is quite loose 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.120
 according to him compared to the old woman 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.020
 android version however we put 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.970
 view of the expo and also told me that 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.220
 In short several times had to turn off 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.900
 switch on the device again because it is in 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.120
 some applications like maybe whatsapp 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.890
 facebook and anything else 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.330
 the trainer screen then froze 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.680
 which left the application certain 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.170
 of choice especially when there are 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.360
 there are many applications open 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.130
 small problems is to say that not here 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.959
 was made factory restored 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.810
 after update then as I say 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.750
 I always recommend doing the red tea 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.790
 phone maybe backup then put on 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.500
 in everything because anyway when I am 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.120
 heavy updates important second 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.820
 it's always good to do it so it might 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.160
 be that with restoring things 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.250
 be better these are together 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.860
 problems, however, water and fluid 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.760
 burgundy now in the scholten though 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.760
 also the browser 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.019
 if it seems to me it does not look good I do not see 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.709
 perhaps high problems of your ha 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.560
 improved flash rendering of 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.790
 image of the writings therefore not 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.440
 it looks bad to me 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.090
 we go out to see you when you put it there 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.530
 is crushed sami definitely a lot 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.239
 compared to what I remember I 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.760
 in short, even trying two terminals 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.070
 so this is a bit your account 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.320
 the battery instead were not that 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.380
 they have relations with the use of mine 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.590
 camera friend let's see for a moment too 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.479
 here we do nothing new interfaces 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.070
 practically always the same thing to say 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.290
 then a video cooked way 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.599
 basically there are these 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.560
 problemini but I think of course how 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.800
 ease 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.990
 but the future type 56.1 and whatever else 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.330
 can fix in any case I 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.669
 I advise you to reason the files 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.110
 factory reset as there 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.240
 it should be some problems either 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.650
 if not, keep them so that you get a 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.290
 next update maybe 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.389
 fixes these little bugs there 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.980
 I am therefore for this video is all if 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.020
 you have a nasty to me too 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.460
 comments as always gorge thin light al 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.169
 video sharing and anything else 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.850
 see in the next videos a below 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.850
 doria supplement is not worth hello
