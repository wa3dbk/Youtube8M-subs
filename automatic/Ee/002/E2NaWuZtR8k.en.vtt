which<00:00:41.370> i<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:41.519> is<00:00:41.699> very<00:00:41.940> rare<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.749> his<00:00:43.229> field

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
which i think is very rare in his field

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.069 
which i think is very rare in his field
he's<00:00:44.280> clearly<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.909> absorbed<00:00:45.449> in<00:00:45.449> architecture

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
he's clearly so absorbed in architecture

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.840 
he's clearly so absorbed in architecture
and<00:00:46.199> just<00:00:46.319> loves<00:00:46.859> everything<00:00:47.129> about<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and just loves everything about it and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.629 
and just loves everything about it and
then<00:00:47.940> he<00:00:48.569> translates<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.559> into<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:50.010> class<00:00:50.280> so

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:50.639 
then he translates that into a class so

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:53.689 
then he translates that into a class so
so<00:00:50.909> well<00:00:51.179> it's<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.289> possible<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.370> will

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
so well it's not possible you will

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.709 
so well it's not possible you will
through<00:00:54.210> your<00:00:54.389> entire<00:00:54.719> life<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:56.299> embrace<00:00:57.299> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
through your entire life the embrace you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.410 
through your entire life the embrace you
will<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:59.449> consumed<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:01.489> architecture<00:01:02.489> when<00:01:03.389> I

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
will be consumed in architecture when I

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.719 
will be consumed in architecture when I

my mom's just like she went back to
parents<00:01:13.500> day<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:13.920> almost<00:01:14.390> exclusively

Larry's<00:01:40.920> philosophy<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.789> he's<00:01:42.299> he's<00:01:42.659> all

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
Larry's philosophy is that he's he's all

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.319 
Larry's philosophy is that he's he's all
about<00:01:42.960> people<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.619> he's<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.920> about<00:01:44.329> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
about people and he's all about the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.929 
about people and he's all about the
broader<00:01:45.600> sense<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.350> being<00:01:47.070> an<00:01:47.219> architect<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
broader sense of being an architect and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.200 
broader sense of being an architect and
being<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.420> society<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.210> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
being in society and it's not just the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.560 
being in society and it's not just the
lines<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.689> paper<00:01:51.719> and<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.950> design<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.969> it's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
lines on paper and the design it's it's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.950 
lines on paper and the design it's it's
it's<00:01:54.990> about<00:01:55.259> people<00:01:55.469> in<00:01:55.740> their<00:01:55.890> lives<00:01:56.039> so<00:01:56.960> if

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it's about people in their lives so if

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.220 
it's about people in their lives so if
you<00:01:58.140> don't<00:01:58.469> know<00:01:58.829> something<00:01:58.859> about<00:01:59.340> it

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
you don't know something about it

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.040 
you don't know something about it
it's<00:02:00.530> not<00:02:00.830> just<00:02:01.360> rot<00:02:02.360> chose<00:02:02.600> not<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.990> be

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
it's not just rot chose not to be

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.870 
it's not just rot chose not to be
interested<00:02:03.470> in<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.070> actually<00:02:04.100> is<00:02:04.670> a

interested in that but it actually is a
