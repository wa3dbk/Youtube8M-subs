that<00:02:07.990> asana<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:08.860> Katy<00:02:09.250> thought<00:02:09.459> actually

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
that asana and Katy thought actually

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.840 
that asana and Katy thought actually
together<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.509> if<00:02:11.320> so<00:02:11.890> like<00:02:12.160> if<00:02:12.310> she<00:02:12.430> just<00:02:12.640> like

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
together and if so like if she just like

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.940

she<00:02:13.150> has<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.540> be<00:02:13.570> ignorance<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.500> situation

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
she has to be ignorance and situation

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.750 
she has to be ignorance and situation
it's<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.100> only<00:02:15.190> thing<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.400> could<00:02:15.519> think<00:02:15.579> of

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
it's the only thing I could think of

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.819 
it's the only thing I could think of
because<00:02:15.850> if<00:02:16.120> not<00:02:16.269> she's<00:02:16.750> kind<00:02:17.320> of<00:02:17.410> same<00:02:17.590> thing

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
because if not she's kind of same thing

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
would have been a little bit more

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.580 
would have been a little bit more
interesting<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:01.720> Katie<00:03:02.140> Thor<00:03:02.380> would<00:03:02.470> have

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
interesting and Katie Thor would have

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.530

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
can't always win I can't always get the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.890 
can't always win I can't always get the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
prize at the end of the tunnel and I

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.700 
prize at the end of the tunnel and I
think<00:03:08.080> that<00:03:08.200> would<00:03:08.290> have<00:03:08.350> been<00:03:08.410> better<00:03:08.620> for

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
think that would have been better for

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.680 
think that would have been better for
his<00:03:08.920> character<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:09.400> it's<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.270> good<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.660> bad

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
his character so it's a good and a bad

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.870 
his character so it's a good and a bad
it<00:03:11.110> was<00:03:11.230> good<00:03:11.440> for<00:03:11.590> she<00:03:11.740> knows<00:03:11.920> character<00:03:12.400> kind

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
it was good for she knows character kind

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.640 
it was good for she knows character kind
of<00:03:13.000> bad<00:03:13.180> in<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.450> sense<00:03:13.660> like<00:03:13.840> okey<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:14.470> guess

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
of bad in a sense like okey so guess

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.780 
of bad in a sense like okey so guess
who's<00:03:14.800> we<00:03:14.920> yet<00:03:15.100> again<00:03:15.340> if<00:03:15.490> you<00:03:15.610> would<00:03:15.730> have

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
who's we yet again if you would have

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.880 
who's we yet again if you would have
accepted<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.480> can't<00:03:16.960> ultimately<00:03:17.170> get<00:03:17.710> what<00:03:17.860> I

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
accepted I can't ultimately get what I

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.590 
accepted I can't ultimately get what I
want<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.310> then<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.850> would<00:03:18.970> have<00:03:19.030> smile<00:03:19.390> I

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
want and then it would have smile I

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.340 
want and then it would have smile I
think<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:19.960> would<00:03:20.050> have<00:03:20.140> been<00:03:20.230> more

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
think it would have been more

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.960 
think it would have been more
interesting<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:21.010> more<00:03:21.430> suitable<00:03:21.910> for

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440

it<00:04:18.310> do<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.520> think<00:04:18.580> that<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.970> was<00:04:19.090> kind<00:04:19.540> of<00:04:19.600> too

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
it do you think that it was kind of too

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.840 
it do you think that it was kind of too
simplistic<00:04:20.220> obviously<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.250> think<00:04:21.370> most<00:04:21.669> can

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
simplistic obviously I think most can

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.370 
simplistic obviously I think most can
agree<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.240> it<00:04:22.330> doesn't<00:04:22.660> live<00:04:22.780> up<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:22.960> what

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
agree that it doesn't live up to what

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.200 
agree that it doesn't live up to what
gun<00:04:23.560> Gale<00:04:23.740> had<00:04:23.950> previously<00:04:24.430> established<00:04:24.610> but

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
gun Gale had previously established but

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.460 
gun Gale had previously established but
ultimately<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.780> was<00:04:25.810> still<00:04:26.110> good<00:04:26.320> and

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
ultimately it was still good and

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.260 
ultimately it was still good and
enjoyable<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.400> art<00:04:27.580> animation<00:04:27.760> never

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
enjoyable and the art animation never

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.760 
enjoyable and the art animation never
faltered<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:28.960> definitely<00:04:29.350> gotta<00:04:29.500> praise

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
faltered and I definitely gotta praise

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.260 
faltered and I definitely gotta praise
