can just start brushing that way and I'm

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.049 
can just start brushing that way and I'm
pretty<00:00:43.860> much<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.489> wrapping<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
pretty much just going to be wrapping it

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.440 
pretty much just going to be wrapping it
in<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> circle<00:00:46.230> um<00:00:46.520> anyone<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.149> you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
in like a circle um anyone can like you

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.510 
in like a circle um anyone can like you
can<00:00:48.570> do<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> any<00:00:48.960> way<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.260> want<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
can do it any way that you want but the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.580 
can do it any way that you want but the
general<00:00:50.940> idea<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.350> in

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
general idea is to get it all in in

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.040 
general idea is to get it all in in
circle<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> did<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.239> then<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.629> secure

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
circle so I did that and then I secure

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350 
circle so I did that and then I secure
with<00:00:55.230> bobby<00:00:55.260> pins<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.820> not<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> be

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
with bobby pins and it's not going to be

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.540 
with bobby pins and it's not going to be
perfect<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.870> don't<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.440> frustrated<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:59.340> it's

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
perfect so don't get frustrated if it's

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.459 
perfect so don't get frustrated if it's
not<00:00:59.730> perfect<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.690> mine<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> not

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
not perfect as you can see mine is not

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.740 
not perfect as you can see mine is not
perfect<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.160> any<00:01:02.280> way<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.600> pretty

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
perfect in any way but that is pretty

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.810 
perfect in any way but that is pretty
much<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:05.280> takes<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.580> lot<00:01:05.790> of

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
much all that I do it takes a lot of

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.359 
much all that I do it takes a lot of
practice<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.930> perfect<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.680> since<00:01:08.280> I

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
practice to get it perfect and since I

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.160 
practice to get it perfect and since I
can<00:01:08.520> really<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.939> back<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.450> my<00:01:09.479> head<00:01:09.810> mine

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
is just a little sloppy but it still

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.810
