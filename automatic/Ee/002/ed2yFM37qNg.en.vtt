00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
say yes for this now depending on how

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.939 
say yes for this now depending on how
fast<00:02:58.579> your<00:02:59.579> internet<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.799> determined<00:03:01.799> how

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:01.949 
fast your internet is determined how

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.649 
fast your internet is determined how
long<00:03:02.129> it<00:03:02.250> takes<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.699> download<00:03:02.819> but<00:03:03.209> most<00:03:03.480> of

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
long it takes to download but most of

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.220 
long it takes to download but most of
these<00:03:03.750> are<00:03:04.019> very<00:03:04.079> very<00:03:04.409> small<00:03:04.769> files<00:03:05.340> indeed

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
these are very very small files indeed

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.569 
these are very very small files indeed
so<00:03:07.230> basically<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.829> should<00:03:07.859> if<00:03:08.310> you're<00:03:08.519> a

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
so basically you should if you're a

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.250 
so basically you should if you're a
technician<00:03:08.909> you<00:03:09.150> should<00:03:09.389> recognize<00:03:09.629> a<00:03:09.870> lot<00:03:10.169> of

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
technician you should recognize a lot of

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.709 
technician you should recognize a lot of
these<00:03:10.349> tools<00:03:10.879> blue<00:03:11.879> screen<00:03:12.180> view<00:03:12.389> and<00:03:12.569> what

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
these tools blue screen view and what

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.409 
these tools blue screen view and what
not<00:03:12.959> cure<00:03:13.260> ports<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.859> so<00:03:14.549> on<00:03:14.760> now<00:03:15.180> if<00:03:15.299> you've

again<00:03:52.739> as<00:03:53.009> I<00:03:53.040> said<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.609> can<00:03:53.790> also<00:03:53.970> run<00:03:54.359> this<00:03:54.509> as

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
again as I said you can also run this as

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.920 
again as I said you can also run this as
a<00:03:54.780> portable<00:03:55.169> application<00:03:55.949> on<00:03:56.159> your<00:03:56.430> USB<00:03:56.930> thumb

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
drive and basically run it from there so

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.240 
drive and basically run it from there so
you<00:04:00.479> don't<00:04:00.569> have<00:04:00.659> to<00:04:00.840> install<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.259> at<00:04:01.500> all<00:04:01.680> ok

that's the installation part nearly

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.650 
that's the installation part nearly
finished<00:04:07.889> now<00:04:09.289> just<00:04:10.289> a<00:04:10.409> few<00:04:10.680> more

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.960
