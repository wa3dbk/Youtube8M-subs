hex at least not a hex though because of

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.380 
hex at least not a hex though because of
the<00:06:04.810> way<00:06:04.960> that<00:06:05.200> I<00:06:05.260> saw<00:06:05.590> her<00:06:05.710> play<00:06:05.980> know<00:06:06.340> when<00:06:07.300> he

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
the way that I saw her play know when he

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.910 
the way that I saw her play know when he
picked<00:06:07.630> quarters<00:06:08.050> the<00:06:08.380> cross<00:06:08.590> their<00:06:08.770> place

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
picked quarters the cross their place

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.150 
picked quarters the cross their place
book<00:06:09.160> was<00:06:09.340> really<00:06:09.610> bad<00:06:09.820> where<00:06:10.570> I<00:06:10.990> think<00:06:11.710> at

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
book was really bad where I think at

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.860 
book was really bad where I think at
least<00:06:12.280> I<00:06:12.430> believe<00:06:12.490> so<00:06:12.940> what<00:06:13.540> he<00:06:13.600> picked<00:06:13.810> a

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
least I believe so what he picked a

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.780 
least I believe so what he picked a
quarter<00:06:14.170> with<00:06:14.350> someone<00:06:14.650> with<00:06:14.800> what<00:06:15.370> he<00:06:15.430> know

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
quarter with someone with what he know

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.610 
quarter with someone with what he know
someone<00:06:16.060> was<00:06:16.240> there<00:06:16.420> i<00:06:16.660> think<00:06:17.380> his<00:06:17.440> cross

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
someone was there i think his cross

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.570 
someone was there i think his cross
their<00:06:17.770> place<00:06:17.950> it<00:06:18.070> was<00:06:18.160> a<00:06:18.220> little<00:06:18.340> bit<00:06:18.460> better

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
their place it was a little bit better

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.670 
their place it was a little bit better
but<00:06:18.820> i<00:06:18.880> don't<00:06:19.060> remember<00:06:19.750> for<00:06:20.110> sure<00:06:20.140> i<00:06:20.350> don't

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
but i don't remember for sure i don't

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.400 
but i don't remember for sure i don't
remember<00:06:20.800> getting<00:06:21.070> headshots<00:06:21.400> all<00:06:22.410> the

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
remember getting headshots all the

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.160 
remember getting headshots all the
people<00:06:23.650> that<00:06:23.800> he<00:06:23.860> peaked<00:06:24.100> at<00:06:24.250> quarters<00:06:25.170> but

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170
