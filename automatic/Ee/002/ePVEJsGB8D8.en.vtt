narration<00:00:21.970> and<00:00:22.269> I<00:00:22.449> said<00:00:22.869> cool<00:00:23.079> when<00:00:23.409> the<00:00:23.529> first

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
narration and I said cool when the first

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.790 
narration and I said cool when the first
time<00:00:23.949> the<00:00:24.070> script<00:00:24.339> came<00:00:24.519> I<00:00:24.759> found<00:00:25.509> it<00:00:25.659> very

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
time the script came I found it very

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.279 
time the script came I found it very
shallow<00:00:26.800> I<00:00:27.159> felt<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:27.789> action<00:00:28.630> was<00:00:28.749> there<00:00:28.810> I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
shallow I felt the action was there I

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.200 
shallow I felt the action was there I
felt<00:00:29.679> the<00:00:30.009> storyline<00:00:30.699> was<00:00:30.849> there<00:00:31.060> the

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
felt the storyline was there the

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.100 
felt the storyline was there the
development<00:00:31.989> of<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.110> character<00:00:33.989> he<00:00:34.989> was

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
development of the character he was

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.869 
development of the character he was
almost<00:00:35.260> humanoid<00:00:35.859> rather<00:00:36.129> than<00:00:36.280> being<00:00:36.460> human

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
almost humanoid rather than being human

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.270 
almost humanoid rather than being human
and<00:00:37.000> they<00:00:37.239> said<00:00:37.420> well<00:00:37.600> talk<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.410> us<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:38.800> that's

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
and they said well talk to us and that's

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.790 
and they said well talk to us and that's
and<00:00:39.760> we<00:00:39.850> basically<00:00:40.239> rebuilt<00:00:40.600> a<00:00:41.320> bit<00:00:41.469> of<00:00:41.559> Sam's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
and we basically rebuilt a bit of Sam's

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.470 
and we basically rebuilt a bit of Sam's
character<00:00:42.309> that<00:00:42.670> was<00:00:42.789> the<00:00:42.910> very<00:00:43.000> first<00:00:43.120> game

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
character that was the very first game
