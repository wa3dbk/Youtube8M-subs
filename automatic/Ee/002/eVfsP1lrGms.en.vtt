00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
old whip you can either dual wield old

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.710 
old whip you can either dual wield old
whips<00:01:52.409> or<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.759> one<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.509> your

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
whips or you can just have one on your

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.100 
whips or you can just have one on your
bill<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.200> think<00:01:55.290> every<00:01:56.040> build<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.820> benefit<00:01:57.360> by

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
bill I think every build can benefit by

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.520 
bill I think every build can benefit by
just<00:01:58.409> simply<00:01:58.740> using<00:01:59.340> an<00:01:59.490> old<00:01:59.729> whip<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> would

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
just simply using an old whip so I would

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.319 
just simply using an old whip so I would
definitely<00:02:01.649> say<00:02:01.950> equipped<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.090> see

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
definitely say equipped it if you see

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.179 
definitely say equipped it if you see
somebody<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.170> scimitar<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.009> know

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
somebody with that scimitar you know

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.399 
somebody with that scimitar you know
they're<00:02:05.369> gonna<00:02:05.520> parry<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.329> if<00:02:07.200> they're

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
they're gonna parry and if they're

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.680 
they're gonna parry and if they're
trying<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.799> go<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.190> parries<00:02:08.580> bust<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.539> out

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
trying to go for the parries bust it out

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
trying to go for the parries bust it out
and<00:02:09.989> smack

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
and smack

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.650 
and smack
with<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.040> and<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.520> should<00:02:11.910> shut<00:02:12.240> them<00:02:12.420> down

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
with it and that should shut them down

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.590 
with it and that should shut them down
and<00:02:13.190> hopefully<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.370> prevent<00:02:15.120> people<00:02:15.390> from

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
and hopefully we can prevent people from

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.630 
and hopefully we can prevent people from
doing<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.410> glitch<00:02:16.710> because<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.400> said

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
