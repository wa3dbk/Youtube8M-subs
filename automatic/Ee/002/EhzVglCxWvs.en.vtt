what I have done as I've taken i'm using

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.369 
what I have done as I've taken i'm using
my<00:00:48.070> photopolymer<00:00:49.070> on<00:00:49.250> stamp<00:00:50.059> which<00:00:50.719> is<00:00:50.960> very

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
my photopolymer on stamp which is very

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.490 
my photopolymer on stamp which is very
flexible<00:00:51.949> and<00:00:52.730> i'm<00:00:53.210> just<00:00:53.570> going<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.079> take<00:00:54.440> it

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
flexible and i'm just going to take it

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.849 
flexible and i'm just going to take it
and<00:00:54.949> lay<00:00:55.550> it<00:00:55.579> on<00:00:55.879> my<00:00:56.090> card<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.750> decide<00:00:57.289> what

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
and lay it on my card to decide what

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.349 
and lay it on my card to decide what
type<00:00:58.430> of<00:00:58.460> arch<00:00:59.300> i<00:00:59.690> want<00:01:00.199> so<00:01:01.100> let's<00:01:01.640> just<00:01:02.059> lay

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
type of arch i want so let's just lay

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.229 
type of arch i want so let's just lay
that<00:01:02.390> down<00:01:02.660> I<00:01:03.410> think<00:01:04.160> that<00:01:04.339> looks<00:01:04.580> pretty<00:01:04.910> good

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
that down I think that looks pretty good

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.980 
that down I think that looks pretty good
then<00:01:05.840> I'm<00:01:05.990> just<00:01:06.140> going<00:01:06.410> to<00:01:06.530> lay<00:01:07.130> my<00:01:07.990> clear

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
then I'm just going to lay my clear

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.120 
then I'm just going to lay my clear
block<00:01:09.500> on<00:01:09.830> top<00:01:10.959> always<00:01:11.959> easier<00:01:12.709> when<00:01:12.770> you're

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
block on top always easier when you're

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.410 
block on top always easier when you're
doing<00:01:13.550> this<00:01:13.819> without<00:01:14.720> a<00:01:14.959> camera<00:01:15.259> on<00:01:16.000> so<00:01:17.000> there

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
doing this without a camera on so there

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.219 
doing this without a camera on so there
we<00:01:17.569> go<00:01:17.599> got<00:01:18.410> my<00:01:18.649> arch<00:01:18.920> going<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.209> bring<00:01:20.599> in<00:01:20.929> my

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
we go got my arch going to bring in my

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.309 
we go got my arch going to bring in my
baked<00:01:21.500> brown<00:01:21.860> sugar<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.660> just<00:01:23.660> stamp<00:01:24.050> that

that paper piercing mat again because

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.180 
that paper piercing mat again because
this<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:33.020> photopolymer<00:01:34.009> i<00:01:34.190> find<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.450> on

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
this is photopolymer i find that on

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.249 
this is photopolymer i find that on
stamping<00:01:37.190> on<00:01:37.399> a<00:01:37.429> paper<00:01:37.819> piercing<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:38.690> works

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
stamping on a paper piercing that works

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.999 
stamping on a paper piercing that works
the<00:01:39.530> best<00:01:39.739> and<00:01:40.160> so<00:01:41.090> i<00:01:41.119> just<00:01:41.750> did<00:01:42.110> that<00:01:42.349> arch<00:01:42.709> at

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
the best and so i just did that arch at

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.589 
the best and so i just did that arch at
the<00:01:43.280> top<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:47.030> at<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.899> bottom<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.560> my<00:01:48.590> card<00:01:49.599> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
is a reverse stamping technique I'm

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.670 
is a reverse stamping technique I'm
going<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:35.310> ink<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.970> fern<00:02:36.390> I've<00:02:36.720> brought<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.560> a

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
going to ink that fern I've brought in a

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.740 
going to ink that fern I've brought in a
piece<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.040> wax<00:02:38.640> paper<00:02:38.940> I'm<00:02:39.810> going<00:02:40.379> to<00:02:41.420> stamp<00:02:42.420> on

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
piece of wax paper I'm going to stamp on

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.500 
piece of wax paper I'm going to stamp on
that<00:02:42.900> wax<00:02:43.200> paper<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.069> then<00:02:44.670> turn<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.150> over

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
that wax paper and then turn it over

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.150 
that wax paper and then turn it over
like<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:47.340> get<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.849> mirrored<00:02:48.510> image<00:02:49.230> I'm<00:02:49.739> just

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
like so to get a mirrored image I'm just

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.550 
like so to get a mirrored image I'm just
going<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.459> rub<00:02:51.000> oops<00:02:51.750> guess<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.230> should<00:02:52.410> be

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
going to rub oops guess I should be

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.140 
going to rub oops guess I should be
bringing<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.160> more<00:02:53.400> into<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.700> camera<00:02:53.970> I'm

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
bringing that more into the camera I'm

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.289 
bringing that more into the camera I'm
going<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.540> rub<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.739> wax<00:02:56.099> paper<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.849> ink<00:02:57.090> is

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
going to rub that wax paper the ink is

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.750 
going to rub that wax paper the ink is
laid<00:02:57.540> on<00:02:57.569> top<00:02:57.750> now<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.890> should<00:02:59.190> turn<00:02:59.489> out

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
laid on top now this should turn out

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.660 
laid on top now this should turn out
just<00:02:59.790> a<00:03:00.329> hair<00:03:01.109> lighter<00:03:01.470> which<00:03:01.859> it<00:03:02.040> did<00:03:02.280> because

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
just a hair lighter which it did because

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.050 
just a hair lighter which it did because
technically<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.530> stamped<00:03:04.530> off<00:03:04.680> but<00:03:05.430> again<00:03:05.760> it

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
technically I stamped off but again it

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.059 
technically I stamped off but again it
gives<00:03:06.239> me<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.720> mirrored<00:03:07.170> image<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.950> the

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
gives me that mirrored image for the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.789 
gives me that mirrored image for the
fern<00:03:08.370> what<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.180> have<00:03:09.510> done<00:03:09.840> then<00:03:10.200> if<00:03:10.470> I

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
fern what I have done then if I

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.710 
fern what I have done then if I
continued<00:03:11.430> stamping<00:03:12.060> with<00:03:12.090> some<00:03:12.450> different

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
continued stamping with some different

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.940 
continued stamping with some different
on<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:14.129> little<00:03:14.340> flowers<00:03:15.090> in<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.599> set<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.260> cut

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
on the little flowers in that set I cut

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.729 
on the little flowers in that set I cut
out<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.340> flaw<00:03:17.639> or<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.329> butterfly<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.169> used

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
out the flaw or the butterfly and used

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.610 
out the flaw or the butterfly and used
the<00:03:20.220> gold<00:03:20.549> glimmer<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.900> put<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.169> butterfly

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
the gold glimmer to put the butterfly

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.610 
the gold glimmer to put the butterfly
yet<00:03:22.889> so<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.549> butterfly<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.359> I<00:03:24.419> cut<00:03:24.870> out<00:03:24.900> was

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
yet so the butterfly that I cut out was

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.099 
yet so the butterfly that I cut out was
left<00:03:25.889> over<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:26.880> then<00:03:27.090> what<00:03:27.299> I<00:03:27.329> did<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:27.840> had

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
left over so then what I did I had

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.190 
left over so then what I did I had
already<00:03:28.290> stamped<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.519> took<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.209> stamped

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
already stamped it I took that stamped

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.770 
already stamped it I took that stamped
butterfly<00:03:31.799> from<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.579> inside<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.419> card

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
butterfly from the inside of this card

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.979 
butterfly from the inside of this card
and<00:03:34.530> put<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:34.829> on<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> top<00:03:35.669> of<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.060> card<00:03:36.419> so

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
and put it on the top of this card so

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.069 
and put it on the top of this card so
using<00:03:37.650> on<00:03:37.919> that<00:03:38.220> butterfly<00:03:38.700> again<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:39.780> there's

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
using on that butterfly again so there's

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.129 
using on that butterfly again so there's
some<00:03:40.519> while<00:03:41.519> moments<00:03:41.970> for<00:03:42.180> today<00:03:42.449> hope<00:03:42.840> you've
