00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
this is the shape on your wiring diagram

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.510 
this is the shape on your wiring diagram
for<00:00:15.929> an<00:00:16.020> electrical<00:00:16.500> ground<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.359> this<00:00:18.529> is<00:00:19.529> the

the ground point access to the wires
behind<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.670> taillights<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.270> through<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
behind the taillights is through the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
behind the taillights is through the

trunk it's on the left hand side and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.120 
trunk it's on the left hand side and
there's<00:01:09.540> only<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.810> screw<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.380> holds<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.979> the

there's only one screw that holds on the
black<00:01:11.369> plastic<00:01:11.700> cover<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.510> we're<00:01:12.869> gonna<00:01:12.990> take

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
black plastic cover so we're gonna take

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.960 
black plastic cover so we're gonna take
this<00:01:13.320> screw<00:01:13.650> out<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.189> way<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.640> get

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
this screw out and that way we can get

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:26.770 
this screw out and that way we can get
at<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> Y

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.270 

once<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> cover<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.259> out<00:01:28.469> of<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.649> way<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:29.130> can

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
once the cover is out of the way we can

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.620 
once the cover is out of the way we can
start<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> look<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.030> grounding<00:01:30.420> point

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
start to look for that grounding point

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.270 
start to look for that grounding point
these<00:01:31.170> connections<00:01:31.710> may<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:32.039> have<00:01:32.189> been

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
these connections may not have been

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.100 
these connections may not have been
touched<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.759> decades<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.420> expect<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.899> lot<00:01:34.079> of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
touched in decades so expect a lot of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.319 
touched in decades so expect a lot of
dirt<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.469> corrosion<00:01:34.710> here<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> grounding

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
dirt and corrosion here is a grounding

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.359 
dirt and corrosion here is a grounding
point<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.810> black<00:01:37.259> wire<00:01:37.530> under<00:01:38.009> an<00:01:38.130> eight

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
point a black wire under an eight

point a black wire under an eight
millimeter<00:01:38.579> nut<00:01:39.030> let's<00:01:39.990> get<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> ratcheting

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
millimeter nut let's get a ratcheting

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:51.679 
millimeter nut let's get a ratcheting
wrench<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:41.700> we've<00:01:41.820> got<00:01:50.689> from

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
wrench on it and see what we've got from

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.450 
wrench on it and see what we've got from
the<00:01:51.840> factory<00:01:52.289> there's<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.679> flat<00:01:52.979> washer

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
the factory there's a flat washer

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.429 
the factory there's a flat washer
between<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:53.939> nut<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.810> ring<00:01:54.990> connector

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
between the nut and the ring connector

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.200 
between the nut and the ring connector
let's<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:56.069> that<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> way<00:01:56.670> notice

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
let's get that out of the way notice

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.910 
let's get that out of the way notice
there's<00:01:57.509> no<00:01:57.689> washer<00:01:58.110> between<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.740> ring

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
there's no washer between that ring

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.669 
there's no washer between that ring
connector<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.459> the<00:01:59.549> body<00:02:00.289> it<00:02:01.289> looks<00:02:01.530> like

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
connector in the body it looks like

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:02.899 
connector in the body it looks like
there<00:02:01.799> was<00:02:01.860> an<00:02:02.009> earlier<00:02:02.310> attempt<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.759> make<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
there was an earlier attempt to make a

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.399 
there was an earlier attempt to make a
better<00:02:03.119> ground<00:02:03.360> by<00:02:03.569> scratching<00:02:03.929> some<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.349> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
better ground by scratching some of the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.499 
better ground by scratching some of the
paint<00:02:04.590> away<00:02:04.709> let's<00:02:05.459> use<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> wire<00:02:05.939> brush<00:02:05.970> on

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
paint away let's use a wire brush on

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.539 
paint away let's use a wire brush on
this<00:02:06.720> get<00:02:07.140> some<00:02:07.289> of<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.470> dirt<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.709> rust<00:02:08.369> out

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
this get some of the dirt and rust out

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.580 
this get some of the dirt and rust out
of<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> way<00:02:08.849> maybe<00:02:09.420> use<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> little<00:02:09.810> sandpaper

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
of the way maybe use a little sandpaper

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.160 
of the way maybe use a little sandpaper
to<00:02:11.099> touch<00:02:11.340> up<00:02:11.549> those<00:02:11.670> scratches<00:02:12.299> and<00:02:12.480> make

to touch up those scratches and make

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.809 
to touch up those scratches and make
them<00:02:13.290> shiny<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.769> connect<00:02:14.040> better<00:02:16.819> don't

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
them shiny to connect better don't

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.400 
them shiny to connect better don't
forget<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.329> ring<00:02:18.540> terminal<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:19.200> going

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
forget that the ring terminal is going

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.199 
forget that the ring terminal is going
to<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.590> some<00:02:19.769> corrosion<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.340> as<00:02:20.640> well<00:02:20.819> so

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
to have some corrosion on it as well so

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.449 
to have some corrosion on it as well so
let's<00:02:21.810> get<00:02:21.930> out<00:02:22.049> that<00:02:22.200> sandpaper<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.980> really

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
let's get out that sandpaper and really

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.539 
let's get out that sandpaper and really
scuff<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.970> up<00:02:24.150> good<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:25.530> object<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.370> is

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
scuff this up good the object of this is

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.250
