video showing what I did here I put a
1/10<00:00:17.529> servo<00:00:18.529> in<00:00:19.000> gives<00:00:20.000> a<00:00:20.090> thing<00:00:20.300> way<00:00:20.810> better

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
1/10 servo in gives a thing way better

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.550 
1/10 servo in gives a thing way better

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
the steering is the same kind of

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.150 
the steering is the same kind of
steering<00:00:40.089> as<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.360> t2<00:00:40.839> but<00:00:41.650> it's<00:00:41.769> a<00:00:41.860> shaft
