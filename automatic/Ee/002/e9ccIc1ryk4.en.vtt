00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
parts so I wonder if they're going to be

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.689 
parts so I wonder if they're going to be
adding<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.690> into<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.920> certain<00:01:02.219> way<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> earn

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
adding that into the certain way to earn

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.149 
adding that into the certain way to earn
the<00:01:03.000> gear<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.260> whether<00:01:04.559> that's<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> be

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the gear or whether that's going to be

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.460 
the gear or whether that's going to be
in<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> Supply<00:01:05.729> Drop<00:01:05.790> rotations<00:01:06.720> also<00:01:07.200> i

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
in the Supply Drop rotations also i

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.380 
in the Supply Drop rotations also i
think<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.040> outfit<00:01:08.400> does<00:01:08.640> look<00:01:08.880> pretty<00:01:09.060> cool

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
think that outfit does look pretty cool

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.000 
think that outfit does look pretty cool
and<00:01:09.869> also<00:01:09.990> if<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.320> take<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> look<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and also if you take a look at the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.370 
and also if you take a look at the
picture<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> right<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.360> girl<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.869> see

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
picture to the right of the girl you see

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.289 
picture to the right of the girl you see
two<00:01:13.680> other<00:01:13.950> pictures<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.939> completely

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
two other pictures that are completely

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.230 
two other pictures that are completely
blurred<00:01:16.110> out<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.009> i<00:01:17.040> think<00:01:17.130> those<00:01:17.549> are<00:01:17.580> still

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
blurred out so i think those are still

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.910 
blurred out so i think those are still
you<00:01:18.540> know<00:01:18.630> secrets<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.409> haven't<00:01:19.680> announced

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you know secrets that haven't announced

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.219 
you know secrets that haven't announced
anything<00:01:20.340> about<00:01:20.759> those<00:01:20.970> outfits<00:01:21.479> yet<00:01:21.780> so

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
anything about those outfits yet so

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.539 
anything about those outfits yet so
that's<00:01:22.380> probably<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.979> something<00:01:23.369> that

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that's probably is something that

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.219 
that's probably is something that
they're<00:01:23.759> gonna<00:01:23.939> look<00:01:24.390> forward<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
they're gonna look forward to in the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.469 
they're gonna look forward to in the
future<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.340> kind<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.210> know<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
future and I kind of think you know that

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.700 
future and I kind of think you know that
there's<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.409> four<00:01:28.680> different

there's for you see four different

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950 
there's for you see four different
characters<00:01:29.579> we're<00:01:30.060> getting<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.420> close<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
characters we're getting really close to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.830 
characters we're getting really close to

with<00:01:34.170> they're<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> drop<00:01:34.799> each<00:01:35.130> one

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
with they're going to drop each one

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.899 
with they're going to drop each one
right<00:01:36.390> before<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.869> certain<00:01:37.290> number<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.710> DLC<00:01:38.400> so
