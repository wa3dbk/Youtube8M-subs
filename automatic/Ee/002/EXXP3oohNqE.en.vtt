transactions<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:04.410> was<00:00:04.560> added<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.100> couple<00:00:05.609> of

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
transactions that was added a couple of

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.970 
transactions that was added a couple of
days<00:00:05.819> ago<00:00:06.000> in<00:00:06.150> call<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.750> duty<00:00:06.960> black<00:00:07.109> ops<00:00:07.410> 2<00:00:07.740> and

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
days ago in call of duty black ops 2 and

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.560 
days ago in call of duty black ops 2 and
they<00:00:08.490> added<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.760> bunch<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.059> them<00:00:09.240> along<00:00:09.510> with

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
they added a bunch of them along with

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.480 
they added a bunch of them along with
the<00:00:09.960> camo<00:00:10.349> packs<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.130> could<00:00:11.309> download

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the camo packs that you could download

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.339 
the camo packs that you could download
and<00:00:11.820> each<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.090> these<00:00:12.179> are<00:00:12.240> 160<00:00:13.139> microsoft

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
and each of these are 160 microsoft

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.670 
and each of these are 160 microsoft
points<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.670> what<00:00:15.299> happens<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
points so what happens is this is the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.010 
points so what happens is this is the
creative<00:00:17.190> class<00:00:17.660> microtransaction<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.840> how

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
creative class microtransaction and how

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.070 
creative class microtransaction and how
it<00:00:19.109> works<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:20.220> pay<00:00:20.490> 160<00:00:21.300> microsoft<00:00:21.539> points

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
it works is you pay 160 microsoft points

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.089 
it works is you pay 160 microsoft points
and<00:00:22.850> basically<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.060> get<00:00:24.269> 10<00:00:24.750> sets<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.380> custom

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
and basically you get 10 sets of custom

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.849 
and basically you get 10 sets of custom
classes<00:00:26.580> now<00:00:26.760> what<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.840> means<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.849> each<00:00:29.849> set

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
classes now what this means is each set

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.380 
classes now what this means is each set
only<00:00:31.859> has<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.369> amount<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.700> custom<00:00:33.030> classes

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
only has the amount of custom classes

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.170 
only has the amount of custom classes
that<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.899> unlocked<00:00:34.260> via<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.309> creative

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that you have unlocked via the creative

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.600 
that you have unlocked via the creative
class<00:00:36.380> tokens<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:37.980> get<00:00:38.219> those<00:00:38.399> from

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
class tokens so you get those from

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.430 
class tokens so you get those from
prestiging<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> get<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> token<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.290> use

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
prestiging you get a token you can use

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.290 
prestiging you get a token you can use
it<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.710> an<00:00:40.920> extra<00:00:41.190> class<00:00:41.399> slot<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.879> start

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
it on an extra class slot so you start

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.389 
it on an extra class slot so you start
out<00:00:42.420> with<00:00:42.450> 5<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.680> 6<00:00:43.980> classes

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
out with 5 then you get 6 classes

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.150 
out with 5 then you get 6 classes
obviously<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.160> micro

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
obviously now with this micro

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.639 
obviously now with this micro
transaction<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.329> get<00:00:48.539> 10<00:00:48.840> sets<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.320> doesn't

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
transaction you get 10 sets that doesn't

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.369 
transaction you get 10 sets that doesn't
mean<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.129> 10<00:00:50.520> created<00:00:51.480> class<00:00:51.780> slots<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
mean you get 10 created class slots it

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.069 
mean you get 10 created class slots it
means<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.920> get<00:00:53.039> 10<00:00:53.430> sets<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.000> whatever<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
means you get 10 sets of whatever the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.049 
means you get 10 sets of whatever the
amount<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.590> class<00:00:56.100> slots<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.610> already<00:00:56.820> have

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
amount of class slots you already have

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.900 
amount of class slots you already have
so<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:58.079> 10<00:00:58.559> created<00:00:59.399> class<00:00:59.609> slots

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
so you see I have 10 created class slots

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.939 
so you see I have 10 created class slots
unlocked<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.840> account<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:01.859> I

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
unlocked on my account just because I

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.740 
unlocked on my account just because I
prestiged<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.579> use<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:02.910> tokens<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.420> created

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
prestiged I use my tokens on created

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.429 
prestiged I use my tokens on created
class<00:01:03.960> slots<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.519> means<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.439> change

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
class slots so this means you can change

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.370 
class slots so this means you can change
each<00:01:07.770> class<00:01:08.280> set<00:01:09.030> individually<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.049> have

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
each class set individually so you have

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.219 
each class set individually so you have
you<00:01:10.770> see<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.400> ten<00:01:11.610> classes<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.780> here

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
you see here I have ten classes now here

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.750 
you see here I have ten classes now here
I<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.470> another<00:01:13.560> ten<00:01:13.979> classes<00:01:14.189> which<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.640> could

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
I have another ten classes which I could

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.520 
I have another ten classes which I could
change<00:01:14.939> separately<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.140> thing<00:01:16.409> is

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
change separately and the thing is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.440 
change separately and the thing is
before<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> game<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> pick<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
before a game you have to pick one of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.350 
before a game you have to pick one of
these<00:01:18.600> class<00:01:19.049> set<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.740> sets<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.759> pick<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
these class set it's sets to pick and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.740 
these class set it's sets to pick and
then<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.080> could<00:01:22.229> only<00:01:22.409> choose<00:01:22.830> from<00:01:22.860> those

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
then you could only choose from those

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.120 
then you could only choose from those
between<00:01:24.750> five<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.140> ten<00:01:25.500> classes<00:01:25.770> depending

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
between five and ten classes depending

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.830 
between five and ten classes depending
on<00:01:26.369> how<00:01:26.490> many<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.880> unlocked<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.720> can

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
on how many you have unlocked you can

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.469 
on how many you have unlocked you can
only<00:01:27.960> choose<00:01:28.140> between<00:01:28.320> those<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.119> each<00:01:30.119> game

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
only choose between those in each game

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.620 
only choose between those in each game
so<00:01:30.780> say<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> pick<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.560> class<00:01:31.829> set<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.630> before

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
so say I pick the class set one before

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.969 
so say I pick the class set one before
the<00:01:33.810> game<00:01:33.990> starts<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.590> while<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the game starts you know while in the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.770 
the game starts you know while in the
pre<00:01:35.159> game<00:01:35.310> Lobby<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.759> will<00:01:36.060> only<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.540> access

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
pre game Lobby I will only have access

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.030 
pre game Lobby I will only have access
to<00:01:37.049> these<00:01:37.470> ten<00:01:38.220> classes<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:40.259> game<00:01:40.590> until

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
to these ten classes in that game until

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.380 
to these ten classes in that game until
the<00:01:41.159> next<00:01:41.310> name<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.790> switch<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.150> say

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the next name I can switch it to say

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
the next name I can switch it to say
class<00:01:42.689> at<00:01:42.930> 3:00<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.740> might<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.189> some

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
class at 3:00 or I might have some

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.950 
class at 3:00 or I might have some
different<00:01:44.880> class<00:01:45.180> setups<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.659> different

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
different class setups for different

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.270 
different class setups for different
situations<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.799> could<00:01:46.950> pick<00:01:47.100> from

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
situations and then I could pick from

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.389 
situations and then I could pick from
these<00:01:47.460> ten<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.470> one<00:01:49.470> thing<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> note<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
these ten so one thing to note like I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.219 
these ten so one thing to note like I
said<00:01:50.610> before<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.030> only<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.659> many<00:01:51.869> class

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
said before you only have as many class

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.920 
said before you only have as many class
slots<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.310> each<00:01:53.460> set<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.420> unlock<00:01:54.750> so

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
slots in each set as you have unlock so

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.270 
slots in each set as you have unlock so
on<00:01:55.020> my<00:01:55.110> other<00:01:55.229> account<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.649> only<00:01:55.799> have<00:01:56.009> six

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
on my other account I only have six

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.789 
on my other account I only have six
created<00:01:56.670> class<00:01:56.880> slots<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:58.170> means<00:01:58.680> I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
created class slots and that means I

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.249 
created class slots and that means I
have<00:01:58.920> ten<00:01:59.219> created<00:01:59.640> clock<00:01:59.820> class<00:02:00.479> sets<00:02:00.780> with

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
have ten created clock class sets with

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.010 
have ten created clock class sets with
six<00:02:01.590> slots<00:02:01.799> each<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.280> that's<00:02:02.430> only<00:02:02.640> 60<00:02:03.360> create

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
six slots each so that's only 60 create

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.789 
six slots each so that's only 60 create
a<00:02:04.079> class<00:02:04.380> slots<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:06.170> total<00:02:07.170> whereas<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.770> I

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
a class slots in total whereas here I

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.430 
a class slots in total whereas here I
have<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> hundred<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.879> ten<00:02:09.440> actual

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
have a hundred because I have ten actual

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.320 
have a hundred because I have ten actual
slots<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:11.009> lock<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.459> hope<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.640> cleared<00:02:12.180> up

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
slots on lock so I hope that cleared up

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.180 
slots on lock so I hope that cleared up
the<00:02:13.080> situation<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.830> little

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the situation a little

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.040 
the situation a little
with<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.750> microtransactions<00:02:15.750> because<00:02:15.930> at

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
with the microtransactions because at

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.930 
with the microtransactions because at
first<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.470> actually<00:02:16.500> thought<00:02:16.980> they<00:02:17.490> just<00:02:17.520> give

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
first I actually thought they just give

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.000 
first I actually thought they just give
you<00:02:17.970> ten<00:02:18.270> more<00:02:18.480> creative<00:02:19.230> class<00:02:19.440> slots<00:02:19.770> like

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
in that sit but it's actually a little

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.120 
in that sit but it's actually a little
bit<00:02:21.690> more<00:02:21.990> detailed<00:02:22.470> than<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.980> just
