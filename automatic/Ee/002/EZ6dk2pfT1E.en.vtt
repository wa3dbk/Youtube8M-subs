the<00:00:00.570> hardest<00:00:01.110> things<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.469> do<00:00:01.770> with<00:00:01.920> technology

00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:02.629 
the hardest things to do with technology

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.910 
the hardest things to do with technology
another<00:00:03.629> they're<00:00:04.049> impossible<00:00:04.440> but<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
another they're impossible but the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.440 
another they're impossible but the
hardest<00:00:05.279> thing<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.460> do<00:00:05.670> technology<00:00:06.180> have<00:00:06.299> to

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
hardest thing to do technology have to

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.379 
hardest thing to do technology have to
do<00:00:06.600> with<00:00:06.779> if<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:07.710> like<00:00:07.859> molten<00:00:08.389> sensory

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
do with if you like molten sensory

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.410 
do with if you like molten sensory
perception<00:00:10.099> challenges<00:00:11.099> those<00:00:11.910> Rises<00:00:12.300> and

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
perception challenges those Rises and

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.820 
perception challenges those Rises and
now<00:00:12.509> we've<00:00:12.690> made<00:00:12.840> progress<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.469> those<00:00:13.590> by<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
now we've made progress on those by the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.580 
now we've made progress on those by the
way<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.490> know<00:00:14.900> humanoid<00:00:15.900> robots<00:00:16.379> have

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
way so you know humanoid robots have

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.680 
way so you know humanoid robots have
made<00:00:16.740> huge<00:00:16.949> progress<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.880> bit<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.420> sense

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
made huge progress a bit to sense

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.260 
made huge progress a bit to sense
environments<00:00:19.439> made<00:00:20.039> huge<00:00:20.250> progress<00:00:20.550> but

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
environments made huge progress but

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.090 
environments made huge progress but
we've<00:00:21.420> not<00:00:21.630> made<00:00:21.840> anywhere<00:00:22.529> near<00:00:22.769> as<00:00:22.890> much

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
we've not made anywhere near as much

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.340 
we've not made anywhere near as much
progress<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.269> as<00:00:24.480> we've<00:00:24.630> made<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
progress on that as we've made in the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.970 
progress on that as we've made in the
more<00:00:25.710> reasoning<00:00:26.340> thinking<00:00:26.939> tasks<00:00:27.980> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
more reasoning thinking tasks the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.160 
more reasoning thinking tasks the
knowledge<00:00:29.460> work<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.570> reason<00:00:30.869> why<00:00:30.960> those

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
knowledge work and the reason why those

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.160 
knowledge work and the reason why those
two<00:00:31.430> differences<00:00:32.430> are<00:00:32.790> interesting<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.809> that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
two differences are interesting is that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.229 
two differences are interesting is that
so<00:00:34.530> I'll<00:00:34.649> stay<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.670> called<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so I'll stay with the the called the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.209 
so I'll stay with the the called the
physical<00:00:36.809> sensory<00:00:37.350> perception<00:00:37.829> end<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> that

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
physical sensory perception end of that

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
physical sensory perception end of that
spectrum<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.480> end<00:00:39.870> up<00:00:40.050> still<00:00:40.260> needed<00:00:40.530> you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
spectrum you end up still needed you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.619 
spectrum you end up still needed you
actually<00:00:40.890> build<00:00:41.160> machines<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.850> actually

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
actually build machines that actually

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.630 
actually build machines that actually
cost<00:00:42.870> money<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.559> arms<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.100> legs<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
cost money that have arms and legs and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.690 
cost money that have arms and legs and
whatever<00:00:45.739> physical<00:00:46.739> things<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.309> will<00:00:47.460> move

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
whatever physical things that will move

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.810 
whatever physical things that will move
things<00:00:48.030> around<00:00:48.739> it's<00:00:49.739> also<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.219> place<00:00:50.399> where

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
things around it's also the place where

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.119 
things around it's also the place where
there's<00:00:51.690> there'll<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.140> an<00:00:52.289> abundance<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
there's there'll be an abundance of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.319 
there's there'll be an abundance of
human<00:00:53.820> labor<00:00:54.449> available<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
human labor available and so the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.200 
human labor available and so the
combination<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.260> costs<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.030> much

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
combination of the costs not so much

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.510 
combination of the costs not so much
progress<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.620> availability<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.129> human

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
progress and the availability of human

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.670 
progress and the availability of human
labor<00:01:02.760> will<00:01:03.390> probably<00:01:03.750> mean<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.140> we'll<00:01:04.350> see

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
labor will probably mean that we'll see

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.820 
labor will probably mean that we'll see
less<00:01:05.640> automation<00:01:06.420> happen<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:07.080> because

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
less automation happen there because

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.950 
less automation happen there because
there's<00:01:08.040> always<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.729> an

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
there's always going to be an

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.179 
there's always going to be an
alternative<00:01:09.960> whereas<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> go<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
alternative whereas if you go to the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.500 
alternative whereas if you go to the
other<00:01:11.280> end<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> spectrum<00:01:11.939> where<00:01:12.420> it's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
other end of the spectrum where it's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
other end of the spectrum where it's
mostly<00:01:12.780> thinking<00:01:13.140> work<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.010> algorithm<00:01:14.640> that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
mostly thinking work the algorithm that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.810 
mostly thinking work the algorithm that
does<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.689> medical<00:01:15.920> diagnosis<00:01:16.920> or<00:01:17.220> pattern

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
does the medical diagnosis or pattern

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.730 
does the medical diagnosis or pattern
recognition<00:01:18.420> or<00:01:18.540> image<00:01:18.869> recognition<00:01:19.140> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
recognition or image recognition is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.679 
recognition or image recognition is
essentially<00:01:20.490> an<00:01:20.580> algorithm<00:01:21.180> there's<00:01:21.540> no

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
essentially an algorithm there's no

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.300 
essentially an algorithm there's no
moving<00:01:21.930> parts<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.770> speak

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
moving parts so to speak

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.460 
moving parts so to speak
so<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> economists<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:24.869> very<00:01:25.080> very<00:01:25.290> low

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
so the economists that are very very low

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.530 
so the economists that are very very low
and<00:01:25.710> by<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.310> we've<00:01:26.700> made<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:27.210> progress

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and by the way we've made more progress

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.719 
and by the way we've made more progress
there<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.680> last<00:01:28.860> five<00:01:29.189> years<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.640> we've

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
there in the last five years and we've

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.670 
there in the last five years and we've
made<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> last<00:01:30.299> 50<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.290> machine

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
made in the last 50 with machine

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.319 
made in the last 50 with machine
learning<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.070> deep<00:01:32.250> learning<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.820> by<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
learning and deep learning and by the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.120 
learning and deep learning and by the
way<00:01:33.630> that's<00:01:34.200> where<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> labor<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
way that's where the labor and the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.100 
way that's where the labor and the
skills<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.670> short<00:01:35.880> supply<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.780> when<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
skills are in short supply so when you

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.760 
skills are in short supply so when you
put<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> technology<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:39.060> labor

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
put the technology and the labor

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.830 
put the technology and the labor
economics<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.950> go<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.670> which<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.659> a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
economics that go with it which is a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
economics that go with it which is a
shortage<00:01:43.350> you'll<00:01:43.770> likely<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.189> see<00:01:44.369> more<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.610> it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
shortage you'll likely to see more of it

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.550 
shortage you'll likely to see more of it
actually<00:01:45.000> being<00:01:45.240> applied<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.409> look

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
actually being applied there if you look

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.620 
actually being applied there if you look
at<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> sector<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.490> manufacturing<00:01:48.450> for

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
at the sector like manufacturing for

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.530 
at the sector like manufacturing for
example<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> pick<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> period<00:01:50.729> 2000

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
example you know a pick a period 2000

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.410 
example you know a pick a period 2000
2008<00:01:52.310> 2000<00:01:53.310> ages<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.119> was<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
2008 2000 ages because that was the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.700 
2008 2000 ages because that was the
start<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> recession<00:01:55.579> in<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:57.090> period

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
start of the recession in that period

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.139 
start of the recession in that period
much<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> conversation<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.880> had<00:02:00.119> about

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
much of the conversation we had about

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.179 
much of the conversation we had about
you<00:02:00.869> know<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.259> five<00:02:01.500> point<00:02:01.799> eight<00:02:01.920> million

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you know the five point eight million

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.120 
you know the five point eight million
jobs<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:02.790> lost<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.390> manufacturing<00:02:04.380> was

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
jobs we lost in in manufacturing was

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.479 
jobs we lost in in manufacturing was
always<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> conversation<00:02:05.790> about<00:02:06.119> offshoring

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
always a conversation about offshoring

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.029 
always a conversation about offshoring
now<00:02:08.489> when<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.819> look<00:02:09.030> back<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:10.470> various

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
now when we look back and various

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.770 
now when we look back and various
economists<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.819> different<00:02:12.180> estimates<00:02:12.599> of

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
economists have different estimates of

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.559 
economists have different estimates of
this<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.290> our

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
this we have our

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.610 
this we have our
but<00:02:13.989> for<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.709> most<00:02:14.890> part<00:02:15.450> roughly<00:02:16.450> about<00:02:16.620> 20%

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
but for the most part roughly about 20%

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.009 
but for the most part roughly about 20%
of<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:17.980> jobs<00:02:18.280> lost<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.879> that<00:02:19.060> period<00:02:19.359> were<00:02:19.840> in

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
of the jobs lost in that period were in

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.979 
of the jobs lost in that period were in
fact<00:02:20.260> due<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.650> offshoring<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:22.090> rest<00:02:22.359> was<00:02:22.959> a

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
fact due to offshoring the rest was a

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.229 
fact due to offshoring the rest was a
combination<00:02:23.799> of<00:02:24.060> Technology<00:02:25.060> driven

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
combination of Technology driven

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.929 
combination of Technology driven
automation<00:02:26.200> as<00:02:26.409> well<00:02:27.069> as<00:02:27.189> shortfalls<00:02:27.730> in

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
automation as well as shortfalls in

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.000 
automation as well as shortfalls in
demand<00:02:28.389> at<00:02:28.719> some<00:02:29.349> level<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.769> you've<00:02:29.859> got

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
demand at some level and you've got

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.470 
demand at some level and you've got
economies<00:02:30.489> like<00:02:30.609> the<00:02:30.670> United<00:02:30.790> States<00:02:31.090> where

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
economies like the United States where

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.899 
economies like the United States where
something<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:32.109> you<00:02:32.560> know<00:02:32.650> 60%<00:02:33.129> of<00:02:33.430> our<00:02:33.489> GDP

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
something like you know 60% of our GDP

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.599 
something like you know 60% of our GDP
growth<00:02:34.180> comes<00:02:34.510> from<00:02:34.799> household<00:02:35.799> and<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:36.459> know

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
growth comes from household and you know

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.030 
growth comes from household and you know
and<00:02:36.849> consumer<00:02:37.719> consumption<00:02:38.319> and<00:02:38.650> spending

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
and consumer consumption and spending

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.800 
and consumer consumption and spending
it's<00:02:39.669> going<00:02:39.909> to<00:02:39.969> be<00:02:40.030> important<00:02:40.450> for<00:02:40.569> people<00:02:40.780> to

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
it's going to be important for people to

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.099 
it's going to be important for people to
be<00:02:40.900> able<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.169> consume<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.609> spend<00:02:43.329> to<00:02:43.870> drive

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
be able to consume and spend to drive

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.740 
be able to consume and spend to drive
GDP<00:02:44.829> so<00:02:45.099> people<00:02:45.489> aren't<00:02:45.639> earning<00:02:46.209> anything

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
GDP so people aren't earning anything

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.970 
GDP so people aren't earning anything
because<00:02:47.019> they're<00:02:47.139> not<00:02:47.230> working<00:02:47.439> whatever<00:02:47.859> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
because they're not working whatever the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.159 
because they're not working whatever the
case<00:02:48.129> may<00:02:48.340> be<00:02:48.370> what<00:02:49.000> happens<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.629> so<00:02:50.139> I

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:50.169 
case may be what happens to that so I

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.839 
case may be what happens to that so I
think<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.530> question<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.040> automation<00:02:51.609> is

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
think this question of automation is

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.089 
think this question of automation is
actually<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> bigger<00:02:52.540> deal<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.169> think<00:02:53.439> we<00:02:53.889> got

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
actually a bigger deal I think we got

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.319 
actually a bigger deal I think we got
distracted<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.819> little<00:02:55.030> bit<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.239> the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
distracted a little bit of the

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.909 
distracted a little bit of the
offshoring<00:02:55.780> question<00:02:56.349> of<00:02:56.469> course<00:02:56.709> that's

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919 
offshoring question of course that's

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.740 
offshoring question of course that's
that's<00:02:57.159> real<00:02:57.459> but<00:02:57.939> the<00:02:58.030> bigger<00:02:58.209> question<00:02:58.719> is

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
that's real but the bigger question is

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.489 
that's real but the bigger question is
what<00:02:59.260> happens<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.859> work
