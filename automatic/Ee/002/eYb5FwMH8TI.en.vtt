00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.210
 the decision is made 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.380
 Minister Klink indicated on 9 June that the contribution from the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.379
 medical specialists to save costs in healthcare 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.829
 Amount to 375 million 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.499
 the order and tbs are still a discussion about the amount 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.960
 and whether the medical specialist should now pay for it 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.239
 but the fact is that it will happen 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.839
 So now it is important to see what effect this has on the income of the 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.189
 medical specialists 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.890
 the savings of 375 million will be achieved in three ways 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.570
 in the first place for the compensation scheme of the supporters 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.750
 adjusted 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.020
 in addition, the standard times are adjusted downwards and if there is another 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.270
 amount remains so you can be lowered along the river 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.380
 In addition, the Minister Klink also determined that the indexation of the 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.940
 hourly rate for 2009 income is 65 percent of and in 2010 zero percent 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.040
 what exactly does this mean for the arrival of the medical specialist 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.760
 If you assume that the support is around 30 percent in reverse 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.810
 shall go 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.789
 then the 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.320
 other medical specialists on this rate 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.420
 m4n standard time 4 to 5 percent must surrender to a total of 375 million 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.080
 savings 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.160
 if you still take account of indexation with her account 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.340
 then the decline will amount to two to three percent 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.850
 how does a medical specialist ensure that this is not too big 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.270
 has a negative effect on your income 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.630
 First of all, you can look at the cost side. Take that cost is critical 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.900
 examine your own costs but also those of the partnership 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.929
 You can also have an income side 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:38.940
 to increase 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.030
 that can be easier than it seems 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.220
 by taking a good look at your delizée registration 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.510
 sit around the table with each other and see if there is room for improvement 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.570
 In many cases, that appears to be possible 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.650
 Of course it is very important to have a grip on your own babies 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.260
 registration process 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.170
 Every partnership should know who earns them income and how they e-mail it 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.170
 efficiency and making the right choices 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.270
 the quality of care is of course certainly not overlooked 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.329
 lost 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.779
 In addition, an improved registration process calls for more transparency 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.669
 a major disadvantage of an improved delizée registration is that this will 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.439
 lead to a budget overrun 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.260
 what in turn appears again in the following year will lead to one 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.669
 rate reduction 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.579
 This is really no reason not to have improved outgoing registration 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.449
 to go 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.619
 this trend has been initiated by the introduction of market forces in healthcare 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.169
 the intention is that it ultimately leads to free rates and 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.319
 even one free in the reef 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.829
 it is therefore important to enter that set of budget overruns 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.919
 today not to leave it to politics and the 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.999
 interest groups, which is why they themselves influence this 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.760
 because of such an improvement they did the registration and remember your colleague 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.639
 medical specialists are also increasingly registering themselves 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.419
 which in turn will probably lead to a tariff decrease 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.419
 it is therefore important to register well yourself 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:04.969
 make sure you know how you earn income and where you can make adjustments if necessary 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:05.969
 is 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.429
 in order to achieve the best care for the lowest price
