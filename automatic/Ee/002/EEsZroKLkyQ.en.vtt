quadrupeds so I don't think it would be
a<00:02:24.410> bird<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.740> it's<00:02:26.640> just<00:02:26.850> because<00:02:27.060> there's<00:02:27.240> so

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
a bird and it's just because there's so

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.170 
a bird and it's just because there's so
many<00:02:28.190> surnames<00:02:29.190> are<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.180> first<00:02:30.390> names<00:02:30.660> in

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
many surnames are of first names in

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.840 
many surnames are of first names in
Saxon<00:02:33.180> history<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.650> end<00:02:34.980> with<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.700> name

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
Saxon history that end with the name

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.080 
Saxon history that end with the name
wolf<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.570> Beowulf<00:02:37.470> or<00:02:37.710> Esther<00:02:38.550> wolf<00:02:38.790> or

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
wolf like Beowulf or Esther wolf or

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.640 
wolf like Beowulf or Esther wolf or
ether<00:02:39.630> wolf<00:02:39.870> or<00:02:40.400> said<00:02:41.400> rules<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.470> shows

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
ether wolf or said rules that just shows

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.910 
ether wolf or said rules that just shows
you<00:02:43.770> how<00:02:43.860> important<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.310> was<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.520> him<00:02:44.900> now<00:02:45.920> how

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you how important it was to him now how

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.730 
you how important it was to him now how
do<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.100> draw<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.460> pattern<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:49.200> way<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.380> do<00:02:49.590> it

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
do we draw this pattern the way to do it

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.480 
do we draw this pattern the way to do it
is<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.980> break<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.340> into<00:02:50.520> grids

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
is to break it into grids

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.070 
is to break it into grids
this<00:02:53.490> would<00:02:53.670> look<00:02:53.820> really<00:02:54.090> nice<00:02:54.360> as<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> border

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
this would look really nice as a border

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.550 
this would look really nice as a border
around<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.980> book<00:02:56.160> page<00:02:56.940> but<00:02:57.840> what<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.260> want<00:02:58.470> to

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
around a book page but what you want to

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.490 
around a book page but what you want to
do<00:02:58.740> in<00:02:58.980> order<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.370> make<00:02:59.670> this<00:02:59.850> pattern<00:03:00.230> easy<00:03:01.230> to

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
do in order to make this pattern easy to

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.620 
do in order to make this pattern easy to
repeat<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.760> see<00:03:02.910> how<00:03:02.970> many<00:03:03.060> steps<00:03:03.420> it

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
repeat is to see how many steps it

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.760 
repeat is to see how many steps it
breaks<00:03:03.840> up<00:03:03.990> to<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.770> grid<00:03:05.600> I'm<00:03:06.600> gonna<00:03:06.750> do<00:03:07.050> it's

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
breaks up to in a grid I'm gonna do it's

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.150 
breaks up to in a grid I'm gonna do it's
just<00:03:08.130> approximate<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:12.290> grid<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.770> there's<00:03:14.010> like

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
just approximate a grid so there's like

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:22.520 
just approximate a grid so there's like
there's<00:03:14.460> one<00:03:16.220> there's<00:03:17.220> two<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:21.290> then<00:03:22.290> there's

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
there's one there's two and then there's

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.410 
there's one there's two and then there's
three<00:03:22.770> so<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.580> can<00:03:23.730> see<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.000> would<00:03:24.060> start<00:03:24.300> to

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
three so you can see it would start to

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.310 
three so you can see it would start to
repeat<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.709> snout<00:03:25.980> here<00:03:26.959> repeats<00:03:27.959> here

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
repeat the the snout here repeats here

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.320 
repeat the the snout here repeats here
it<00:03:29.100> is<00:03:29.310> slightly<00:03:29.610> different<00:03:30.030> because<00:03:30.150> the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
it is slightly different because the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.580 
it is slightly different because the
artisan<00:03:30.690> would<00:03:30.810> have<00:03:30.900> been<00:03:31.020> fitting<00:03:31.380> this

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
artisan would have been fitting this

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.930 
artisan would have been fitting this
onto<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.580> page<00:03:32.850> or<00:03:33.480> on<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.020> the<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:35.580> design

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
onto the page or on to the the design

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.699 
onto the page or on to the the design
and<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.209> shape<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:37.080> what<00:03:37.320> he's<00:03:37.410> working<00:03:37.680> with

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
and the shape of what he's working with

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.770 
and the shape of what he's working with
or<00:03:38.010> if<00:03:38.100> she's<00:03:38.310> working<00:03:38.489> with<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:38.940> then

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
or if she's working with and then

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.150 
or if she's working with and then
there's<00:03:40.050> different<00:03:40.410> terminal<00:03:40.739> points<00:03:41.040> but

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
there's different terminal points but

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.560 
there's different terminal points but
I'm<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:41.610> gonna<00:03:41.760> show<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.000> how<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.209> repeat

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
I'm just gonna show you how to repeat

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.500 
I'm just gonna show you how to repeat
this<00:03:42.750> pattern<00:03:43.320> right<00:03:43.650> here<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:44.430> we've<00:03:45.300> got

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
this pattern right here so we've got

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.270 
this pattern right here so we've got
that<00:03:45.660> basic<00:03:46.080> grid<00:03:46.320> we're<00:03:46.770> not<00:03:46.860> gonna<00:03:46.950> want<00:03:47.190> you

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
that basic grid we're not gonna want you

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.360 
that basic grid we're not gonna want you
to<00:03:47.340> do<00:03:47.550> let's<00:03:48.090> take<00:03:48.239> your<00:03:48.360> 4-h<00:03:48.720> pencil<00:03:49.370> and

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
to do let's take your 4-h pencil and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.120 
to do let's take your 4-h pencil and
your<00:03:50.520> ruler<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.000> your<00:03:51.270> eraser<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:52.800> markers

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
your ruler and your eraser the markers

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:02.410 
your ruler and your eraser the markers
we'll<00:03:53.310> get<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.580> next<00:03:54.080> draw<00:03:55.080> on<00:03:55.739> line<00:03:59.120> with<00:04:00.120> six

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
we'll get to next draw on line with six

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.780 
we'll get to next draw on line with six
squares<00:04:03.590> draw<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.650> both<00:04:04.830> sides<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.550> your

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
squares draw on both sides of your

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.190 
squares draw on both sides of your
straightedge

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.570 

charged<00:04:12.200> up<00:04:12.410> and<00:04:12.560> down<00:04:12.680> like<00:04:12.920> this<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.460> get

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
charged up and down like this to get

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:31.390 
charged up and down like this to get
your<00:04:13.790> grid<00:04:28.960> Wow<00:04:30.020> looks<00:04:30.830> like<00:04:30.980> I'll<00:04:31.100> be<00:04:31.220> able<00:04:31.250> to

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
your grid Wow looks like I'll be able to

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.040 
your grid Wow looks like I'll be able to
fit<00:04:31.580> this<00:04:31.700> on<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:31.940> camera<00:04:32.090> with<00:04:32.330> five<00:04:32.540> so

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
fit this on the camera with five so

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:40.870 
fit this on the camera with five so
we're<00:04:33.350> gonna<00:04:33.440> work<00:04:33.650> with<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:38.410> mark<00:04:39.410> an<00:04:39.560> X<00:04:39.880> in

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
we're gonna work with that mark an X in

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:49.930 
we're gonna work with that mark an X in
each<00:04:41.210> spot<00:04:42.700> like<00:04:43.700> so<00:04:47.169> just<00:04:48.169> so<00:04:48.290> you<00:04:48.410> can<00:04:48.820> get<00:04:49.820> an

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
each spot like so just so you can get an

00:04:49.940 --> 00:05:18.380 
each spot like so just so you can get an
idea<00:04:50.270> where<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.630> center<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.200> it<00:04:51.290> is

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:26.790 

next<00:05:20.130> to<00:05:21.130> just<00:05:21.490> this<00:05:22.420> page<00:05:25.380> so<00:05:26.380> you<00:05:26.500> can<00:05:26.620> begin

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
next to just this page so you can begin

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.550 
next to just this page so you can begin
to<00:05:27.550> see<00:05:27.760> how<00:05:28.390> it<00:05:28.690> repeats

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
to see how it repeats

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.500 
to see how it repeats
so<00:05:30.430> here<00:05:30.670> is<00:05:30.790> one<00:05:31.030> grid<00:05:31.450> right<00:05:32.380> here<00:05:33.360> we<00:05:34.360> are

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
so here is one grid right here we are

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.750 
so here is one grid right here we are
going<00:05:34.810> to<00:05:34.930> transpose<00:05:35.410> this<00:05:35.620> one<00:05:35.860> into<00:05:36.550> this

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
going to transpose this one into this

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:45.480 
going to transpose this one into this
grid<00:05:37.110> so<00:05:38.110> here's<00:05:38.320> 1<00:05:38.590> 1<00:05:39.310> 2<00:05:40.210> 2<00:05:40.590> 3<00:05:41.970> 3<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:44.740> then<00:05:45.400> it

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
grid so here's 1 1 2 2 3 3 and then it

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.510 
grid so here's 1 1 2 2 3 3 and then it
will<00:05:45.640> repeat<00:05:45.970> again<00:05:46.210> 1<00:05:48.000> &amp;<00:05:49.000> 3<00:05:50.220> so<00:05:51.220> on<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.400> next

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
will repeat again 1 &amp; 3 so on the next
