00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.210
 Our video lesson today I'm teaching. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.990
 to make the homemade linen is then 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.650
 here I vote using is one that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:18.060
 those coffee line tablet's 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:23.789
 so we'll pick up and cut and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:32.070
 let's get the point here 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:36.710
 where to cut a small tablet and let's 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.710
 cutting gets so're 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:53.600
 it was like this after you cut it now 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.230
 to put inside the little eye 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.989
 I'll take a piece of dna black tatÃ¡ 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:08.330
 and with the paper cutter were paper 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:09.830
 I'll do it like this, I'll take one 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:17.229
 little doll you see 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.229
 we stayed here I took a little rodelinha 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.800
 in another round line to do in. 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:31.940
 of the eye, we 're going to be there now. 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:38.750
 using white glue even at 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:47.989
 people pass around here clothes around 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:50.899
 here the round toddynho line has been 

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:53.750
 position where we want it is 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:59.390
 that I'm going to put this on paper and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.610
 I 'm going to arrest, I 'm going to do the same with 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.009
 the other is 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.840
 I'll catch up with wool or go here 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.840
 all back 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.720
 so around dinho'll get 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:32.150
 again the other linen will position and 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:35.000
 I'll usually learn to play outside, right? 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.920
 much outside the fourth line of medicine then 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.750
 we are throwing away ensures that 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.950
 can be used to make the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:46.070
 this doll here I did the blue gives to 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.650
 You change the colors is this difficult. 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.900
 and we can also be 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.090
 doing black like the one I did 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.660
 the Olympian is in there also abandoned 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.420
 the stage chile may be using 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.870
 making one is the doll's hair 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.989
 You're seeing no one inside that's how I 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.720
 It 's a beautiful thing, but little doll is and uses 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.600
 of the tablet and lap both not 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.070
 is see as in the plastic alone 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.080
 paper both makes 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.300
 it's just you use the glue that you're going to use 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.120
 a material that you were put and 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.280
 to go around everything I did with the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.080
 normal glue that ends is how to stop you 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.250
 you can do this 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.610
 normal 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:36.130
 there you will decorate normally put 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:36.130
 the eyelashes are 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:48.910
 and making the eyebrow shade is that I 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.480
 I took a piece of paper 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.480
 tiny 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.959
 it's just you do it around that stay 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.700
 normal eye is a very simple tip and 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.230
 You can not be buying today. 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.600
 little doll because today the little doll 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.500
 very expensive is here is a diet well 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.840
 fast 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.260
 I hope you enjoyed kissing 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.260
