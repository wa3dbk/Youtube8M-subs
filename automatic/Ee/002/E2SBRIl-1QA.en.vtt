00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.310 
the professional mechanics who tell you
to<00:02:10.090> use<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.269> torque<00:02:10.600> wrench<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:10.959> think<00:02:11.079> this<00:02:11.170> was

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
to use a torque wrench I think this was

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.729 
to use a torque wrench I think this was
Tory<00:02:11.590> down<00:02:11.769> to<00:02:11.860> 15<00:02:12.220> foot-pounds<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:13.720> I'm<00:02:14.530> just

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
Tory down to 15 foot-pounds but I'm just

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.410 
Tory down to 15 foot-pounds but I'm just
gonna<00:02:14.950> do<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.129> this<00:02:15.250> way

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.259 

right<00:02:19.689> they're<00:02:20.200> not<00:02:20.319> very<00:02:20.500> tight<00:02:21.150> check<00:02:22.150> it

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
right they're not very tight check it

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.580 
right they're not very tight check it
one<00:02:22.390> more<00:02:22.540> time<00:02:24.629> let's<00:02:25.629> go<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.409> make<00:02:26.560> sure

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
one more time let's go just to make sure

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.330 
one more time let's go just to make sure
it's<00:02:26.950> not<00:02:27.750> too<00:02:28.750> tight<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.890> don't<00:02:30.069> strip

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340
