you trying to blur the lines and it
seems<00:01:56.180> really<00:01:56.390> kind<00:01:56.689> of<00:01:56.780> funny<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.140> me<00:01:57.290> over

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
seems really kind of funny to me over

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.950 
seems really kind of funny to me over
the<00:01:57.710> years<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:58.130> that's<00:01:58.490> exactly<00:01:59.270> where

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
the years that that's exactly where

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.350 
the years that that's exactly where
we've<00:02:00.140> come<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.590> now<00:02:00.799> because<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.850> lines<00:02:02.119> are

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
we've come to now because the lines are

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.010 
we've come to now because the lines are
all<00:02:02.570> blurred<00:02:03.079> and<00:02:03.640> I<00:02:04.640> just<00:02:05.479> think<00:02:05.659> that<00:02:05.810> the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
all blurred and I just think that the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.660 
all blurred and I just think that the
biggest<00:02:06.200> thing<00:02:06.409> for<00:02:06.590> me<00:02:06.829> as<00:02:07.340> far<00:02:07.729> as<00:02:09.670> having

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
biggest thing for me as far as having

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.199 
biggest thing for me as far as having
longevity<00:02:11.570> is<00:02:11.769> being<00:02:12.769> able<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.100> truly<00:02:13.730> find

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
longevity is being able to truly find

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.509 
longevity is being able to truly find

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
that they do always compared and I don't

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.750 
that they do always compared and I don't
know<00:06:03.110> if<00:06:03.230> it's<00:06:03.380> a<00:06:03.560> real<00:06:03.890> good<00:06:04.010> analogy<00:06:04.490> or<00:06:04.580> none

but I always compared songwriting to

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.920 
but I always compared songwriting to
having<00:06:08.450> kids<00:06:08.770> because<00:06:09.770> you<00:06:10.640> create<00:06:11.030> a<00:06:11.060> song

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
and you watch it grow up from birth and

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.030 
and you watch it grow up from birth and
then<00:06:17.150> you<00:06:17.360> when<00:06:17.690> you're<00:06:17.810> finally<00:06:18.140> done<00:06:18.980> with
