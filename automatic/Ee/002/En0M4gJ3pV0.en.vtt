00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello welcome to the videotutorials of 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.430
 matteo blacks 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.160
 this time we will develop in 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.889
 the area of ​​arithmetic an exercise 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.850
 that allows you to decompose a whole number 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.610
 in its prime factors remember that a 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.610
 prime number is going to be that number that 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.060
 it can only be divided between it and 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.330
 the unit divided exactly so that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.899
 your waste zero so if we want 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.329
 decompose the number 24 into its factors 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.520
 cousins ​​let's place a line 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.940
 vertical in the central part 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 and from the left side the original number 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.570
 and the results of the divisions 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.580
 then we will go dividing 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.310
 successively among the most number 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.790
 small it is possible to divide that 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.610
 number that gives us a whole division the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.930
 24 we can divide it by the most number 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.199
 small would be the 2 24 between 2 would give us 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.710
 12 turn 12 between the number plus 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.130
 small that we can divide it is 2 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.710
 12 between two would give us 6 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.479
 on 6 we can divide it between 2 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.189
 again 6 between 2 gives us 3 and 3 already 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.360
 we can not divide it between 2 but yes 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.490
 between 3 3 between 3 what would give us the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.110
 unity 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.540
 when on the left side we are 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.130
 present already the units that we have already 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.820
 finished we have already done the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.310
 decomposition of the number 24 in their 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.490
 prime factors in this case the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.510
 prime factors of the number 24 would be 2 2 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.090
 2 2 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:52.110
 being able to write the number 24 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.500
 or to say that 24 is equal to 2 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.640
 by 2 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.450
 by 2 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.450
 by 3 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.060
 se 24 equals 2 all for two times 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.060
 three 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.179
 that would be equal to 2 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.790
 raised to 33 times we get the 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.790
 number 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:26.060
 that multiplied 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.060
 by number 3 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.870
 all for two for two 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.690
 2 cubed by 3 2 by 2 4 by 2 8 by 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.030
 3 24 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.100
 well I hope this helps you to go 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.220
 understanding how to decompose a number 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.640
 whole into its prime factors we are 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.790
 in a next video mate blacks is a 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.790
 your disposal 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.440
 so that we can progress gradually
