leak Diagnostics the bullseye can find
leaks<00:00:17.200> ranging<00:00:18.099> from<00:00:18.279> very<00:00:18.730> small<00:00:18.880> to<00:00:19.210> very

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
leaks ranging from very small to very

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.589 
leaks ranging from very small to very
large<00:00:20.200> leaks<00:00:20.710> in<00:00:20.919> three<00:00:21.730> quick<00:00:22.360> and<00:00:22.390> easy

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
large leaks in three quick and easy

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.589 
large leaks in three quick and easy
steps<00:00:23.169> to<00:00:23.500> demonstrate<00:00:24.460> this<00:00:24.669> we're<00:00:25.210> going<00:00:25.480> to

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
steps to demonstrate this we're going to

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.630 
steps to demonstrate this we're going to
use<00:00:25.809> the<00:00:26.230> bullseye<00:00:26.649> leak<00:00:26.919> detector<00:00:27.460> a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
use the bullseye leak detector a

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.450 
use the bullseye leak detector a
container<00:00:28.630> and<00:00:28.930> we're<00:00:29.290> also<00:00:29.559> going<00:00:29.950> to<00:00:30.009> use<00:00:30.309> a

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
container and we're also going to use a

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.560 
container and we're also going to use a
smoke<00:00:31.119> machine<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.619> container<00:00:33.040> has<00:00:33.460> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
smoke machine so the container has a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.310 
smoke machine so the container has a
20,000<00:00:34.570> s<00:00:34.629> hole<00:00:34.809> in<00:00:35.050> it

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
20,000 s hole in it

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.979 
20,000 s hole in it
now<00:00:35.789> 20,000th<00:00:36.789> is<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:37.000> size<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.420> all<00:00:37.719> of<00:00:37.899> us

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
now 20,000th is the size that all of us

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.200 
now 20,000th is the size that all of us
need<00:00:38.199> to<00:00:38.350> be<00:00:38.469> concerned<00:00:38.890> about<00:00:39.039> because<00:00:39.850> this

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
need to be concerned about because this

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.380 
need to be concerned about because this
is<00:00:40.390> going<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.690> set<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:41.109> dtc<00:00:41.980> for<00:00:42.579> a<00:00:42.609> very<00:00:42.969> small

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
is going to set a dtc for a very small

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.709 
is going to set a dtc for a very small
leak<00:00:43.690> in<00:00:43.899> your<00:00:44.260> evap<00:00:44.800> system<00:00:45.399> on<00:00:45.550> your<00:00:45.670> car<00:00:45.940> so

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
leak in your evap system on your car so

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.899 
leak in your evap system on your car so
if<00:00:46.870> we<00:00:47.019> have<00:00:47.289> these<00:00:47.530> kind<00:00:47.829> of<00:00:47.949> leaks<00:00:48.159> we<00:00:48.730> would

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
if we have these kind of leaks we would

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.389 
if we have these kind of leaks we would
normally<00:00:49.210> smoke<00:00:49.870> them<00:00:50.109> now<00:00:50.739> smoke<00:00:51.100> works

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
normally smoke them now smoke works

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.970 
normally smoke them now smoke works
great<00:00:51.730> for<00:00:51.760> large<00:00:52.359> leaks<00:00:52.749> but<00:00:53.379> for<00:00:53.589> small

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
great for large leaks but for small

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.250 
great for large leaks but for small
leaks<00:00:54.309> smoke<00:00:54.999> doesn't<00:00:55.390> come<00:00:55.569> out<00:00:55.719> these<00:00:55.960> size

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
leaks smoke doesn't come out these size

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.439 
leaks smoke doesn't come out these size
holes<00:00:56.649> so<00:00:57.460> what<00:00:57.699> we<00:00:57.819> want<00:00:58.030> to<00:00:58.120> do<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.329> to

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
holes so what we want to do is to

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.509 
holes so what we want to do is to
demonstrate<00:00:58.600> this<00:00:59.319> so<00:00:59.829> we're<00:01:00.039> going<00:01:00.129> to<00:01:00.190> start

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
demonstrate this so we're going to start

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.459 
demonstrate this so we're going to start
the<00:01:00.729> smoke<00:01:01.030> machine<00:01:01.479> and<00:01:01.719> we're<00:01:02.140> going<00:01:02.319> to<00:01:02.379> get

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
the smoke machine and we're going to get

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.439 
the smoke machine and we're going to get
it<00:01:02.620> smoking<00:01:03.159> where<00:01:03.339> we<00:01:03.460> got<00:01:03.670> smoke<00:01:04.150> being

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
it smoking where we got smoke being

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.960 
it smoking where we got smoke being
emitted<00:01:04.750> from<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.199> machine<00:01:05.620> now<00:01:06.490> we're<00:01:06.730> going

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
emitted from the machine now we're going

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.530 
emitted from the machine now we're going
to<00:01:07.060> connect<00:01:07.510> it<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.960> container<00:01:09.540> we're

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
to connect it to the container we're

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.990 
to connect it to the container we're
filling<00:01:10.930> this<00:01:11.080> container<00:01:11.650> with<00:01:12.250> smoke<00:01:12.640> from

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
filling this container with smoke from

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.140 
filling this container with smoke from
our<00:01:13.150> smoke<00:01:13.450> machine<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:14.800> smoke<00:01:15.220> is<00:01:15.550> also

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
our smoke machine the smoke is also

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.290 
our smoke machine the smoke is also
being<00:01:16.450> put<00:01:16.720> in<00:01:16.870> with<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.110> co2<00:01:17.530> cartridge<00:01:18.010> so<00:01:19.000> co2

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
being put in with a co2 cartridge so co2

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.780 
being put in with a co2 cartridge so co2
is<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:19.930> air<00:01:20.260> pressure<00:01:20.620> for<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.520> smoke

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
is the air pressure for the smoke

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.380 
is the air pressure for the smoke
machine<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.330> work<00:01:22.620> no<00:01:23.620> this<00:01:24.160> has<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.370> 20,000<00:01:25.330> s

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
machine to work no this has a 20,000 s

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.730 
machine to work no this has a 20,000 s
calibrated<00:01:26.080> leak<00:01:26.350> right<00:01:26.890> at<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.190> block<00:01:27.430> dot

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
calibrated leak right at the block dot

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.890 
calibrated leak right at the block dot
when<00:01:29.740> we<00:01:29.920> look<00:01:30.160> we<00:01:30.430> can<00:01:30.460> see<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.540> cannot

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
when we look we can see that you cannot

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.310 
when we look we can see that you cannot
see<00:01:32.260> smoke<00:01:32.710> coming<00:01:32.950> out<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.580> small<00:01:34.030> hole<00:01:34.360> now

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
see smoke coming out that small hole now

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.960 
see smoke coming out that small hole now
what<00:01:35.440> we<00:01:35.560> need<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.830> understand<00:01:36.370> is<00:01:36.670> smoke

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
what we need to understand is smoke

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.390 
what we need to understand is smoke
won't<00:01:37.240> come<00:01:37.570> out<00:01:37.600> small<00:01:38.290> holes<00:01:38.590> very<00:01:38.950> readily

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
won't come out small holes very readily

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.000 
won't come out small holes very readily
now<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.180> can<00:01:40.330> ask<00:01:40.510> are<00:01:40.840> we<00:01:41.110> really<00:01:41.290> smoking

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
now you can ask are we really smoking

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.300 
now you can ask are we really smoking
this<00:01:42.450> well<00:01:43.450> we're<00:01:43.720> smoking<00:01:44.290> it<00:01:44.410> as<00:01:44.590> we<00:01:45.070> can<00:01:45.250> see

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
this well we're smoking it as we can see

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.410 
this well we're smoking it as we can see
so<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.450> idea<00:01:46.930> is<00:01:47.170> is<00:01:47.580> smoke<00:01:48.580> just<00:01:49.060> doesn't

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
so the idea is is smoke just doesn't

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.050 
so the idea is is smoke just doesn't
work<00:01:49.660> good<00:01:50.050> for<00:01:50.500> small<00:01:50.830> leaks<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.400> works<00:01:51.760> good

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
work good for small leaks it works good

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.570 
work good for small leaks it works good
for<00:01:52.090> large<00:01:52.600> lakes<00:01:52.990> but<00:01:53.800> these<00:01:54.040> are<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.340> kind

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
for large lakes but these are the kind

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.940 
for large lakes but these are the kind
of<00:01:54.700> leaks<00:01:54.910> that<00:01:55.480> come<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:55.870> your<00:01:56.020> shop<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.410> you

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
of leaks that come to your shop and you

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.730 
of leaks that come to your shop and you
can't<00:01:57.310> find<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:58.330> can't<00:01:58.630> find<00:01:58.990> them<00:01:59.230> because

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
can't find you can't find them because

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.280 
can't find you can't find them because
you<00:01:59.890> can't<00:02:00.160> see<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:01.390> what<00:02:01.600> we'll<00:02:01.780> do<00:02:02.020> is

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
you can't see it so what we'll do is

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.380 
you can't see it so what we'll do is
we'll<00:02:02.560> take<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.830> bullseye<00:02:03.400> leak<00:02:03.700> detector

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
we'll take the bullseye leak detector

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.059 
we'll take the bullseye leak detector
and<00:02:04.660> when<00:02:05.200> we<00:02:05.350> pass<00:02:05.590> over<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.190> black<00:02:06.430> dot<00:02:08.069> it's

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
and when we pass over the black dot it's

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.460 
and when we pass over the black dot it's
found<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.670> without<00:02:09.819> any

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
found that without any

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.490 
found that without any
the<00:02:12.470> leaf<00:02:12.680> detector<00:02:13.400> will<00:02:13.760> find<00:02:14.150> smaller<00:02:14.780> than

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
the leaf detector will find smaller than

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.270 
the leaf detector will find smaller than
a<00:02:15.530> one<00:02:16.390> ten-thousandth<00:02:17.390> lake<00:02:17.860> we'll<00:02:18.860> take<00:02:19.100> the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
a one ten-thousandth lake we'll take the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:28.500 
a one ten-thousandth lake we'll take the
bullseye<00:02:19.700> leaks<00:02:20.060> acre<00:02:20.300> solution

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.730 

this<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.620> way<00:02:29.799> to<00:02:29.860> find<00:02:30.280> leaks
