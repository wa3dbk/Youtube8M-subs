00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 all right 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.090
 hello welcome to the stick paper or scissors 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.680
 today we are going to see how to make a 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.470
 library pocket in a very very 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.660
 simple we start 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.289
 Last Sunday we made this mini 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.240
 album and I put a pocket of these 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.310
 prefabricated american craft that is 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.140
 a library pocket is called that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.759
 library pocket and I asked you 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.730
 if you want a tutorial to do what 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.470
 because as it seems very simple to me 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.610
 we needed it but many of you have 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.030
 said that you want the tutorial of 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.850
 pocket so let's go with him these are 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.480
 some examples of this kind of 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.450
 pockets 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.860
 that as I have told you already come facts 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.800
 well but good let's make one 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.650
 practically identical to do these 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.620
 pockets and that are so funny what 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.970
 It is better to use double-sided paper 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.510
 I'm going to use the same collection 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.119
 of American craft that is the collection 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.729
 mayberry this that has stripes for a 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.070
 side and as reasons for water on the other 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.880
 and the first thing I'm going to do is cut it 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.979
 to 11 and a half times 16 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.100
 once I have it cut and it's a 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.409
 rectangle 16 centimeters by 11 and a half 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.320
 the side that measures 11 and a half I'm going to 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.320
 mark a fold to a half centimeter 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.560
 as I always tell you if you do not have a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.390
 folding or biotin like this that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.119
 fold you can do it simply with 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.299
 a rule and bending and now I'm going to 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.729
 mark the side from 16 centimeters to 7 and 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.140
 medium and already 15 with which will leave me 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.140
 here a one centimeter flange 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.520
 now that I have the marks made I'm going to 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.110
 place the side that has a mark of a 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.030
 inch to the right and I'll mark 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.320
 from the top two centimeters 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.320
 and a half on each side 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.769
 and I'm going to draw a line 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.689
 until the middle of the sheet and that's 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.689
 part of here I'm going to cut 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.290
 once I have it this way I'm going to 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.710
 also cut the bottom of the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.710
 other side 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.640
 I will be like two rectangles 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.980
 zigzag positions will finally 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.530
 also cut this little square that I 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.510
 it is here where the two meet 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.650
 folds that we have made I will cut a 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.650
 little bit at an angle 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.490
 and I'm going to cut the angle also the two 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.490
 eyelashes protruding from the sides 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.100
 and now before I turn I'm going to take the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.260
 circle die cutter in my case is of 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.000
 an inch and I'm going to chop half 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.209
 circle in this part of here from the 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.380
 I'll center the rectangle 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.690
 I'm going to cut it 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.170
 if I asked them last week if 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.880
 It was better to punch it once assembled or 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.530
 without mounting and the truth is that it is 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.390
 absolutely indifferent as 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.420
 profiling I really prefer to do it 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.190
 when it's mounted because I see it more 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.200
 more focused and I become more at the idea of 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.550
 how it will end but that's a rough taste 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.740
 you see that today I miss it for 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.450
 that you see the two ways and now 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.080
 last I'm going to fold all the creases 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.080
 what have we done 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.380
 and I would have more or less the basis of 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.420
 pocket now what I'm going to do is 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.070
 round these corners for that I'm going to 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.870
 use the corner samper which is a 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.580
 rounded corners to the extent of 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.650
 a quarter of an inch if you do not have this 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.120
 type of corners rounds can 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.120
 do simply with scissors 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.220
 and once I have it rounded we're going to 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.600
 mount the pocket I will put glue 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.600
 in this little tab here 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.039
 I'm using liquid glue but 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.650
 the truth is that for this kind of 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.750
 pockets you can use any type 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.129
 of glue even the one that always 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.080
 I say do not use in your pockets 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.240
 which is the double-sided tape because 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.819
 in this case the paper will not touch 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.669
 never the part of the glue you see in 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.969
 this time the eyelash is inside 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.919
 From the pocket 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.409
 and now we are going to double the next 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.579
 tab out of the pocket in this 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.340
 moment you may have to 

00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:16.720
 accommodate it a little bit with the folder 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.720
 how am i doing now 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.080
 with a little bit of glue 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.080
 and close your pocket 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.379
 this would have the finished pocket 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.379
 this is what we have done 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:39.949
 and this is the one that I bought you can see 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:41.779
 It is virtually identical little card 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.270
 that goes inside has a measure of 7 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:46.400
 centimeters by 9 centimeters and a half and 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.389
 I'm going to round the corners of the 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.490
 same way to a quarter of an inch this 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.680
 card then you can decorate it as 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.039
 you want you can even put pictures 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.039
 inside 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.159
 you see and that's how our pocket is and so 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.779
 take care of the pocket bought what 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.759
 you have found easy and put it in 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:07.479
 practice thank you very much for the visit and 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.379
 until next time 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.379
 fun a lot 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.600
 Y
