was required to look a bit like Emma

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.640 
Stone and a bit like Mary Jane and also
have<00:01:55.150> this<00:01:55.270> sort<00:01:55.480> of<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:55.870> think<00:01:56.410> it<00:01:56.620> was

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
have this sort of I think it was

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.740 
have this sort of I think it was
attitude<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.220> Buffy<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.460> Vampire<00:01:57.550> Slayer<00:01:57.880> I'm

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
attitude of Buffy the Vampire Slayer I'm

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.420 
attitude of Buffy the Vampire Slayer I'm
really<00:01:59.140> happy<00:01:59.320> with<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.590> way<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.800> 3/4<00:02:00.220> of<00:02:00.250> you

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
really happy with the way the 3/4 of you

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.240 
really happy with the way the 3/4 of you
came<00:02:00.760> out<00:02:00.940> because<00:02:01.300> that's<00:02:01.480> the<00:02:01.600> way<00:02:01.720> I<00:02:01.750> like

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
came out because that's the way I like

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.290 
came out because that's the way I like
not<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.340> way<00:02:03.430> like<00:02:03.640> that's<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.180> most

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
not the way like that's the most

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.240 
not the way like that's the most
confident<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:04.870> feel<00:02:05.050> drawing<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:06.070> also

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
confident I feel drawing and I also

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.860 
confident I feel drawing and I also
think<00:02:06.520> it's<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.820> best<00:02:07.000> way<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.210> draw<00:02:07.660> because

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
think it's the best way to draw because

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.530 
think it's the best way to draw because
you<00:02:08.140> can<00:02:08.290> really<00:02:08.530> see<00:02:08.790> this<00:02:09.790> 3-dimensional

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
you can really see this 3-dimensional

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.210 
you can really see this 3-dimensional
object<00:02:10.869> like<00:02:11.110> for<00:02:11.290> instance<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.860> next<00:02:12.070> two

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
object like for instance the next two

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.240 
object like for instance the next two
things<00:02:12.520> I'm<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.880> be<00:02:12.970> drawing<00:02:13.210> a<00:02:14.250> front

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
things I'm going to be drawing a front

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.280 
things I'm going to be drawing a front
view<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.760> profile<00:02:16.180> view<00:02:16.210> which<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.050> hate

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
view and a profile view which I hate

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.780 
view and a profile view which I hate
drawing<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.950> actually<00:02:18.340> if<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.550> look<00:02:18.580> at

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
drawing and I actually if you look at

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.280 
drawing and I actually if you look at
any<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.000> my<00:02:19.090> comic<00:02:19.390> work<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.660> never<00:02:19.960> draw

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
any of my comic work I never draw

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.440 
any of my comic work I never draw
because<00:02:20.650> they<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.370> looks<00:02:21.610> flat<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:21.970> the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
because they just looks flat and the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.760 
because they just looks flat and the
cold<00:02:22.660> goal<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.900> think<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.380> being<00:02:23.560> in

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
cold goal I think of being in

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.520 
cold goal I think of being in
illustrators<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.640> try<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.240> create<00:02:25.690> three

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
illustrators to try and create three

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.940 
illustrators to try and create three
dimensions<00:02:26.980> while<00:02:27.520> drawing<00:02:27.790> on<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> 2d<00:02:28.360> surface

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
dimensions while drawing on a 2d surface

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.460 
dimensions while drawing on a 2d surface
so<00:02:30.120> I've<00:02:31.120> after<00:02:31.540> studying<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.930> lot<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.380> way

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
so I've after studying a lot of the way

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.430 
so I've after studying a lot of the way
Emma<00:02:32.680> Stone<00:02:32.980> looks<00:02:33.990> picking<00:02:34.990> up<00:02:35.110> little

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
Emma Stone looks picking up little

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.960 
Emma Stone looks picking up little
things<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:36.160> sort<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.610> make<00:02:36.730> up<00:02:36.880> the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
things that sort of make up the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.730 
things that sort of make up the
structure<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.390> her<00:02:37.480> face<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.840> notice<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.170> you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
structure of her face I notice that you

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.470 
structure of her face I notice that you
might<00:02:38.860> think<00:02:39.130> she<00:02:39.220> has<00:02:39.460> huge<00:02:39.820> eyes<00:02:40.090> that's

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
might think she has huge eyes that's

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.420 
might think she has huge eyes that's
what<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.630> always<00:02:40.810> thought<00:02:40.950> Jessie<00:02:41.950> doesn't<00:02:42.190> she

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
what I always thought Jessie doesn't she

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.580 
what I always thought Jessie doesn't she
really<00:02:42.670> just<00:02:42.820> has<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.210> small<00:02:43.480> head<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.960> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
really just has a small head and the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.200 
really just has a small head and the
rest<00:02:44.740> of<00:02:44.860> her<00:02:44.920> features<00:02:45.100> would<00:02:45.760> be<00:02:45.910> on<00:02:46.150> a

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
rest of her features would be on a

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.960 
rest of her features would be on a
larger<00:02:47.170> head<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.250> way<00:02:48.340> I'm<00:02:48.460> drawing<00:02:48.730> her

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
larger head so the way I'm drawing her

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.700 
larger head so the way I'm drawing her
is<00:02:49.150> basically<00:02:49.510> her<00:02:49.690> nose<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.170> eyes<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.620> the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
is basically her nose and eyes and the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.770 
is basically her nose and eyes and the
lips<00:02:50.860> sort<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.280> closer<00:02:51.460> together<00:02:51.730> where<00:02:52.600> her

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
lips sort of closer together where her

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.710 
lips sort of closer together where her
actual<00:02:53.260> head<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.650> shorter<00:02:54.190> or<00:02:54.400> not<00:02:55.360> shorter

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
actual head is shorter or not shorter

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.010 
actual head is shorter or not shorter
smaller<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:57.160> I'm<00:02:57.310> I've<00:02:57.910> whilst<00:02:58.540> drawing<00:02:58.840> the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
smaller and I'm I've whilst drawing the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.900 
smaller and I'm I've whilst drawing the
standard<00:02:59.470> I've<00:02:59.620> really<00:02:59.830> sort<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.459> knuckle

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
standard I've really sort of knuckle

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.830 
standard I've really sort of knuckle
down<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.330> lot<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.800> last<00:03:03.220> deep<00:03:04.030> details<00:03:04.510> of

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
down a lot of the last deep details of

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.430 
down a lot of the last deep details of
my<00:03:05.020> art<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.410> really<00:03:05.680> needed<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.040> fix<00:03:06.340> like

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
my art that I really needed to fix like

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.260 
my art that I really needed to fix like
working<00:03:08.440> on<00:03:08.500> drawing<00:03:08.709> better<00:03:08.980> hands<00:03:09.520> and

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270

style<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.510> that's<00:04:41.570> what<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:41.870> art<00:04:41.990> style<00:04:42.260> is

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
style and that's what it art style is

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.080 
style and that's what it art style is
you<00:04:42.560> just<00:04:42.710> keep<00:04:42.860> combining<00:04:43.580> all<00:04:43.940> your

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
you just keep combining all your

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.270 
you just keep combining all your
influences<00:04:44.570> like<00:04:44.600> for<00:04:45.020> instance<00:04:45.320> I<00:04:45.410> think<00:04:45.650> the

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
influences like for instance I think the

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.700 
influences like for instance I think the
way<00:04:46.400> I<00:04:46.430> draw<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:47.300> noses<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:47.870> lips<00:04:47.930> on<00:04:48.350> my

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
way I draw the noses and lips on my

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.010 
way I draw the noses and lips on my
females<00:04:49.490> is<00:04:49.790> definitely<00:04:50.240> Greg<00:04:50.360> Capullo<00:04:50.540> but

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
females is definitely Greg Capullo but

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.570 
females is definitely Greg Capullo but
the<00:04:51.080> eyes<00:04:51.290> I'm<00:04:51.710> really<00:04:51.920> trying<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.160> do<00:04:52.340> Jeff

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
the eyes I'm really trying to do Jeff

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.800 
the eyes I'm really trying to do Jeff
Scott<00:04:52.790> Campbell<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.330> hair<00:04:53.480> and<00:04:53.630> really

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
Scott Campbell and the hair and really

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.080 
Scott Campbell and the hair and really
try<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:53.990> do<00:04:54.200> Jeff<00:04:54.410> Scott<00:04:54.650> Campbell<00:04:54.860> so<00:04:55.280> I<00:04:55.460> guess

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
try to do Jeff Scott Campbell so I guess

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.870 
try to do Jeff Scott Campbell so I guess
