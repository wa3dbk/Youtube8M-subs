00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.000 

all<00:03:11.360> right<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.870> could<00:03:12.080> not<00:03:12.319> screw<00:03:12.800> this<00:03:12.950> thing

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
all right I could not screw this thing

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.039 
all right I could not screw this thing
and<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.459> could<00:03:13.640> not<00:03:13.760> find<00:03:14.030> any<00:03:14.239> screws<00:03:14.599> for<00:03:14.930> it

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
and I could not find any screws for it

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.589 
and I could not find any screws for it
but<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.010> seems<00:03:16.220> pretty<00:03:16.370> secure<00:03:16.580> so<00:03:17.150> I'm<00:03:17.480> just

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
but it seems pretty secure so I'm just

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.140 
but it seems pretty secure so I'm just
gonna<00:03:17.690> screw<00:03:18.200> this<00:03:18.319> pin<00:03:18.650> cover<00:03:19.340> back<00:03:19.549> on<00:03:19.790> then

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
gonna screw this pin cover back on then

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.289 
gonna screw this pin cover back on then
when<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:20.900> back<00:03:21.049> cases<00:03:21.500> on<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.890> probably

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
when the back cases on that probably

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.280 
when the back cases on that probably
keep<00:03:23.299> it<00:03:23.420> pretty<00:03:23.780> secure<00:03:24.459> anyway<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:27.110> then<00:03:27.200> it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
keep it pretty secure anyway and then it

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.190 
keep it pretty secure anyway and then it
seems<00:03:27.620> gonna<00:03:27.860> leave<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:28.099> room<00:03:28.370> in<00:03:28.549> here<00:03:28.790> and
