today to talk to you about one of the
most<00:00:03.810> high-tech<00:00:04.430> space-age<00:00:05.430> things<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:05.940> can

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
most high-tech space-age things you can

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.150 
most high-tech space-age things you can
possibly<00:00:06.270> imagine<00:00:06.540> when<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.410> comes<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.799> taking

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
possibly imagine when it comes to taking

synchronization<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.700> sounds<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.030> bit<00:00:12.120> geeky

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
synchronization it sounds a bit geeky

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.660 
synchronization it sounds a bit geeky
but<00:00:13.019> bear<00:00:13.469> with<00:00:13.500> me<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.099> prepare<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.490> be

amazed now in your SLR camera you have a

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.710 
amazed now in your SLR camera you have a
sensor<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.910> sensor<00:00:18.240> needs<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.449> particular

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
sensor this sensor needs a particular

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.300 
sensor this sensor needs a particular
amount<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.170> light<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.710> create<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.010> correct

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
amount of light to create a correct

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.700 
amount of light to create a correct
exposure<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:21.359> measured<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.900> fractions<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.590> a

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
exposure that measured in fractions of a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.790 
exposure that measured in fractions of a
second<00:00:23.070> called<00:00:23.640> your<00:00:23.820> shutter<00:00:24.119> speed<00:00:24.210> now<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
second called your shutter speed now the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.429 
second called your shutter speed now the
way<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.189> controlled<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.090> by<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> set<00:00:28.230> of

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
way this is controlled is by a set of

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.859 
way this is controlled is by a set of
shutter<00:00:28.769> curtains<00:00:29.480> when<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.570> press<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
shutter curtains when you press the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.139 
shutter curtains when you press the
shutter<00:00:30.990> button<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.859> first<00:00:32.550> cursor<00:00:32.850> moves

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
shutter button the first cursor moves

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.479 
shutter button the first cursor moves
out<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> way<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.930> then<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.070> stays<00:00:35.280> open

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
out of the way and then it stays open

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.430 
out of the way and then it stays open
for<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.910> amount<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.420> time<00:00:36.630> you've<00:00:36.870> dialed<00:00:37.140> in

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
for the amount of time you've dialed in

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.190 
for the amount of time you've dialed in
like<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.129> hundredth<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.730> second<00:00:39.170> when<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
like a hundredth of a second when the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.080 
like a hundredth of a second when the
exposure<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.739> done<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.370> second<00:00:41.760> shutter

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
exposure is done the second shutter

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.119 
exposure is done the second shutter
curtain<00:00:42.360> moves<00:00:42.899> across<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.590> close<00:00:43.800> again

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
curtain moves across to close again

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.430 
curtain moves across to close again
together<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:45.000> move<00:00:45.180> back<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.170> ready<00:00:46.379> for

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
together they move back to be ready for

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.650 
together they move back to be ready for
the<00:00:46.620> next<00:00:46.800> photo<00:00:47.090> but<00:00:48.090> hey<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.360> wasn't<00:00:48.510> this

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the next photo but hey it wasn't this

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.119 
the next photo but hey it wasn't this
meant<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:48.960> about<00:00:49.170> flushes<00:00:49.590> right<00:00:49.890> let's

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
meant to be about flushes right let's

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.590 
meant to be about flushes right let's
see<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:50.489> happens<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.059> add<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.390> flash

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
see what happens if we add in a flash

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.240 
see what happens if we add in a flash
and<00:00:51.840> trying<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> save<00:00:52.469> again<00:00:52.710> when<00:00:53.070> we're

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and trying to save again when we're

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.950 
and trying to save again when we're
talking<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.550> flash<00:00:53.940> sync<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.690> shutter

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
talking about flash sync the shutter

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.900 
talking about flash sync the shutter
speed<00:00:55.199> starts<00:00:55.590> becoming<00:00:55.710> important<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.640> let's

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
speed starts becoming important so let's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.420 
speed starts becoming important so let's
add<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.210> into<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> mix<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.070> try<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> first

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
add that into the mix and try the first

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.119 
add that into the mix and try the first
exposure<00:00:59.820> at<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.510> sixtieth<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.320> second<00:01:01.590> so

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
exposure at a sixtieth of a second so

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.470 
exposure at a sixtieth of a second so
the<00:01:02.219> first<00:01:02.370> curtain<00:01:02.640> will<00:01:02.940> move<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the first curtain will move out of the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.170 
the first curtain will move out of the
way<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.110> flash<00:01:04.350> fires<00:01:04.619> briefly<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
way the flash fires briefly and then the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.080 
way the flash fires briefly and then the
second<00:01:06.479> shutter<00:01:06.689> closes<00:01:07.229> again<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.830> an<00:01:08.790> aside

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
second shutter closes again as an aside

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
second shutter closes again as an aside
you<00:01:09.330> may<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.600> heard<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.930> first<00:01:10.409> curtain<00:01:10.710> or

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you may have heard of first curtain or

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.850 
you may have heard of first curtain or
second<00:01:11.490> curtain<00:01:11.880> flash<00:01:12.750> sync<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.710> is

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
second curtain flash sync that is

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.310 
second curtain flash sync that is
basically<00:01:14.360> whether<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.540> want<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> flash<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
basically whether you want to flash the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.039 
basically whether you want to flash the
fire<00:01:16.560> when<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.490> first<00:01:17.970> shutter<00:01:18.270> first<00:01:18.600> opens

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
fire when the first shutter first opens

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.550 
fire when the first shutter first opens
or<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.920> before<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> second<00:01:20.790> shutter<00:01:20.970> closes

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
or just before the second shutter closes

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.870 
or just before the second shutter closes
anyway<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.100> firm<00:01:23.400> grasp<00:01:23.640> of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
anyway now that we have a firm grasp of

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240 
anyway now that we have a firm grasp of
how<00:01:24.049> should<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> sync<00:01:25.350> works<00:01:25.680> let's<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.189> a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
how should I sync works let's have a

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.770 
how should I sync works let's have a
look<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:26.610> happens<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.540> speed

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
look at what happens when we up to speed

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.630 
look at what happens when we up to speed
a<00:01:27.810> little<00:01:27.960> bit<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.890> really<00:01:29.189> fast<00:01:29.430> shutter

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
a little bit at really fast shutter

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.249 
a little bit at really fast shutter
speeds<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.150> actually<00:01:30.479> happens<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
speeds what actually happens is that the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.649 
speeds what actually happens is that the
first<00:01:31.560> curtain<00:01:31.860> starts<00:01:32.610> moving<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.360> before

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
first curtain starts moving but before

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.030 
first curtain starts moving but before
it<00:01:33.780> makes<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> way<00:01:34.439> across<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
it makes it all the way across the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.190 
it makes it all the way across the
second<00:01:35.430> shutter<00:01:35.640> starts<00:01:36.000> moving<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.450> well<00:01:36.659> so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
second shutter starts moving as well so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.899 
second shutter starts moving as well so
there's<00:01:37.350> actually<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.710> small<00:01:38.070> gap<00:01:38.400> between<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
there's actually a small gap between the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.149 
there's actually a small gap between the
two<00:01:39.090> shutters<00:01:39.509> which<00:01:40.079> together<00:01:40.350> makes<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
two shutters which together makes the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.789 
two shutters which together makes the
exposure<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:42.869> let's<00:01:43.200> first<00:01:43.530> take<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
exposure right now let's first take a

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.679 
exposure right now let's first take a
quick<00:01:44.070> look<00:01:44.189> what<00:01:44.430> happens<00:01:44.850> when<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.329> find<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
quick look what happens when we find it

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.330 
quick look what happens when we find it
flash<00:01:46.020> normally<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.710> curtains<00:01:47.040> move

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
flash normally the curtains move

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.340 
flash normally the curtains move
together<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:48.540> there's<00:01:48.720> only<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.930> small<00:01:49.049> gap

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
together but there's only a small gap

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.870 
together but there's only a small gap
between<00:01:49.500> them<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.159> when<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> flash<00:01:50.610> goes<00:01:50.850> off

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
between them so when the flash goes off

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.760 
between them so when the flash goes off
only<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> small<00:01:51.750> part<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.079> your<00:01:52.259> sensor<00:01:52.560> is

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
only a small part of your sensor is

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.620 
only a small part of your sensor is
correctly<00:01:53.100> exposed<00:01:53.390> instead<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> letting

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
correctly exposed instead of letting

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.600 
correctly exposed instead of letting
that<00:01:54.899> happen<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.619> camera<00:01:55.950> manufacturers

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that happen the camera manufacturers

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.670 
that happen the camera manufacturers
came<00:01:56.909> up<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.180> something<00:01:57.329> clever<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:58.500> if

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
came up with something clever what if

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.859 
came up with something clever what if
instead<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.280> single<00:01:59.520> flash<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.630> flesh

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
instead of a single flash the flesh

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.990 
instead of a single flash the flesh
would<00:02:01.079> strobe<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.649> entire<00:02:02.130> generation<00:02:02.850> of

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
would strobe the entire generation of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.240 
would strobe the entire generation of
the<00:02:03.360> exposure<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.710> might<00:02:04.890> turn<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> little

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the exposure that might turn a little

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
the exposure that might turn a little
bit<00:02:05.460> nuts<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:06.149> remember<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.780> we're<00:02:06.899> talking

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
bit nuts but remember that we're talking

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.109 
bit nuts but remember that we're talking
about<00:02:07.290> very<00:02:07.619> very<00:02:07.890> fast<00:02:08.160> shutter<00:02:08.489> speeds<00:02:08.849> here

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
about very very fast shutter speeds here

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.940 
about very very fast shutter speeds here
so<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> flesh<00:02:09.840> would<00:02:10.050> only<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.470> pulse

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
so the flesh would only have to pulse

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.410 
so the flesh would only have to pulse
for<00:02:11.670> say<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.360> thousand

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
for say a thousand

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.110 
for say a thousand
so<00:02:14.230> instead<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.530> doing<00:02:14.770> one<00:02:15.130> bright<00:02:15.459> flash<00:02:15.790> it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
so instead of doing one bright flash it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.199 
so instead of doing one bright flash it
does<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.870> hundred<00:02:17.319> tiny<00:02:17.590> flashes<00:02:18.130> which<00:02:19.000> means

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
does a hundred tiny flashes which means

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.449 
does a hundred tiny flashes which means
that<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.540> entire<00:02:20.470> frame<00:02:20.860> gets<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> same

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
that the entire frame gets the same

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.949 
that the entire frame gets the same
amount<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.790> light<00:02:22.000> throughout<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.690> entire

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
amount of light throughout the entire

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.110 
amount of light throughout the entire
exposure<00:02:23.380> now<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.310> don't<00:02:24.459> know<00:02:24.640> about<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:25.090> but

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
exposure now I don't know about you but

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.820 
exposure now I don't know about you but
if<00:02:25.450> you're<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.630> little<00:02:25.959> bit<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.230> photography

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
if you're a little bit of a photography

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.070 
if you're a little bit of a photography
gig<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.340> have<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.730> admit<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.050> pretty

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
gig you have to admit that is pretty

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.590 
gig you have to admit that is pretty
cool
