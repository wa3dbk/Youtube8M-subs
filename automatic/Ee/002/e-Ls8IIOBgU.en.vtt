so<00:02:15.980> we<00:02:16.100> have<00:02:16.250> video<00:02:16.520> camera<00:02:16.910> we<00:02:17.210> have<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> big<00:02:17.450> we

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
so we have video camera we have a big we

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.160 
so we have video camera we have a big we
can<00:02:18.410> do<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> video<00:02:18.740> recording<00:02:19.190> here<00:02:20.050> test<00:02:21.050> that

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
can do a video recording here test that

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:33.680 
can do a video recording here test that
out<00:02:21.230> real<00:02:21.530> quick

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:42.760 

and<00:02:34.440> if<00:02:34.740> we<00:02:34.920> want<00:02:35.690> go<00:02:36.690> back<00:02:38.210> player<00:02:39.210> video

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.960 

there<00:02:43.770> we<00:02:43.860> go<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.040> other<00:02:44.190> videos<00:02:44.550> playing<00:02:44.790> the

video we just recorded pretty smooth
nice<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:49.680> focus<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.250> not<00:02:50.430> going<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.610> be

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
nice and in focus it's not going to be

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.490 
nice and in focus it's not going to be
the<00:02:50.940> most<00:02:51.090> high<00:02:51.330> res<00:02:51.570> but<00:02:51.870> it'll<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.470> job

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
the most high res but it'll get the job

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
going to go to camera mode check out the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.320 
going to go to camera mode check out the
3.2<00:03:06.840> megapixel<00:03:07.350> camera<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:07.950> with<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.090> flash

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
3.2 megapixel camera so with the flash

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.510 
3.2 megapixel camera so with the flash
here<00:03:09.690> let's<00:03:09.990> see<00:03:10.140> if<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.320> flash<00:03:10.560> decides<00:03:11.280> to

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
here let's see if the flash decides to

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.580 
here let's see if the flash decides to
go<00:03:11.670> nope<00:03:12.570> doesn't<00:03:12.900> need<00:03:13.080> flash<00:03:13.320> right<00:03:13.560> now<00:03:13.710> but

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
go nope doesn't need flash right now but

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.200 
go nope doesn't need flash right now but
that's<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.680> pretty<00:03:16.830> high-quality<00:03:17.010> image<00:03:17.550> very

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
that's a pretty high-quality image very
