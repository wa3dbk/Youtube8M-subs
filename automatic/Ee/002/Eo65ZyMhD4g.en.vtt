start to spam your moves again and this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.420 
start to spam your moves again and this
is<00:01:21.030> because<00:01:21.259> this<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> max<00:01:22.860> burst<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.280> can

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is because this is the max burst you can

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.190 
is because this is the max burst you can
do<00:01:23.490> because<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.030> full<00:01:24.270> cheese<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.780> your

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
do because you have full cheese so your

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.890 
do because you have full cheese so your
energy<00:01:25.590> will<00:01:25.710> always<00:01:26.009> stay<00:01:26.450> around<00:01:27.450> about<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
energy will always stay around about the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.550 
energy will always stay around about the
right<00:01:28.080> area<00:01:29.090> hopefully<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.329> then<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.439> will

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
right area hopefully and then you will

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.990 
right area hopefully and then you will
be<00:01:31.710> fine<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:31.979> it'll<00:01:32.640> stay<00:01:32.729> high<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
be fine and it'll stay high and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.060 
be fine and it'll stay high and
obviously<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.869> bet<00:01:34.079> even<00:01:34.650> better<00:01:34.799> way<00:01:35.040> of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
obviously the bet even better way of

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.789 
obviously the bet even better way of
having<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:36.180> having<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.840> better<00:01:37.560> thing

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
like rocks and stuff and then you can

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.550 
like rocks and stuff and then you can
consider<00:01:52.799> doing<00:01:53.070> burst<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.840> say<00:01:55.049> burst<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
consider doing burst and I say burst I

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
I'm just do it this is max burst because

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.940 
I'm just do it this is max burst because
I'm<00:02:05.219> full<00:02:05.430> energy<00:02:05.820> right<00:02:06.000> now<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.710> that's<00:02:07.710> it

your mediocre but it's not good it's not
going<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.230> be<00:02:37.290> fast<00:02:37.530> enough<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.890> they'll<00:02:38.790> be

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
going to be fast enough and they'll be

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.250 
going to be fast enough and they'll be
like<00:02:39.000> all<00:02:39.270> right<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:39.510> let's<00:02:39.660> say<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:39.870> rested

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
like all right so let's say so rested

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.480 
like all right so let's say so rested
rid<00:02:40.440> they're<00:02:40.740> just<00:02:40.770> going<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.040> pop<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.250> couple

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
rid they're just going to pop a couple

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.790 
rid they're just going to pop a couple
hots<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.780> they're<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.470> stay<00:02:43.620> up

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
hots and so they're going to stay up

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.710 
hots and so they're going to stay up
there<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.430> stay<00:02:44.670> relatively<00:02:45.360> high

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
there going to just stay relatively high

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.420 
there going to just stay relatively high
rather<00:02:46.200> than<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.650> all<00:02:46.800> coming<00:02:47.040> out<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.370> a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
rather than it all coming out and in a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.670 
rather than it all coming out and in a
few<00:02:47.580> seconds<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.330> then<00:02:49.320> getting

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
few seconds and then then getting

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.220 
few seconds and then then getting
screwed<00:02:50.040> right<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.610> they<00:02:51.210> they'll<00:02:51.570> know<00:02:51.930> and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
screwed right so they they'll know and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.350 
screwed right so they they'll know and
it's<00:02:52.980> harder<00:02:53.400> for<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.910> pull<00:02:54.210> off<00:02:54.300> your

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
it's harder for you to pull off your

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.700 
it's harder for you to pull off your
damage<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.870> let's<00:02:54.990> say<00:02:55.110> when<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.380> pop<00:02:55.590> your

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
damage and let's say when you pop your

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.140 
damage and let's say when you pop your
cooldowns<00:02:56.100> they've<00:02:56.430> already<00:02:56.550> got<00:02:56.820> their<00:02:56.850> hot

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
cooldowns they've already got their hot

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.480 
cooldowns they've already got their hot
sauna<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.660> they<00:02:57.780> can<00:02:57.930> like<00:02:58.080> or<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:59.130> know

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
sauna so they can like or you know

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.860 
sauna so they can like or you know
they've<00:02:59.730> just<00:02:59.910> got<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.120> pop<00:03:00.210> one<00:03:00.270> more<00:03:00.630> thing

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
they've just got to pop one more thing

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.970 
they've just got to pop one more thing
on<00:03:00.990> them<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.260> then<00:03:01.380> they'll<00:03:01.530> stay<00:03:01.710> topped

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
on them and then they'll stay topped

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.040 
on them and then they'll stay topped
because<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.940> know<00:03:03.030> then<00:03:03.270> they<00:03:03.690> don't<00:03:03.780> have<00:03:03.960> to

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
because you know then they don't have to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.450

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.930 
you get things ready and then you go to
someone<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:31.949> you<00:04:32.129> start<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.400> do<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.610> damage

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
someone and you start to do the damage

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.649 
someone and you start to do the damage
and<00:04:33.409> that<00:04:34.409> way<00:04:34.710> hopefully<00:04:35.639> you<00:04:36.270> know<00:04:36.330> so<00:04:36.509> your

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
and that way hopefully you know so your

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.980 
and that way hopefully you know so your
full<00:04:36.900> Cian<00:04:37.289> energy<00:04:37.889> is<00:04:38.099> about<00:04:38.879> 75<00:04:39.389> to<00:04:39.419> 80<00:04:39.690> it

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
full Cian energy is about 75 to 80 it

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.059 
full Cian energy is about 75 to 80 it
all<00:04:40.139> needs<00:04:40.169> to<00:04:40.379> be<00:04:40.440> there<00:04:40.650> because<00:04:40.770> by<00:04:41.009> the

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
all needs to be there because by the

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.890 
all needs to be there because by the
time<00:04:41.159> you<00:04:41.400> start<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.669> use<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.879> Chi<00:04:42.120> let<00:04:42.659> their

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
time you start to use the Chi let their

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.390 
time you start to use the Chi let their
I<00:04:42.930> already<00:04:43.470> at<00:04:43.620> full<00:04:43.650> energy<00:04:44.099> and<00:04:44.220> then<00:04:44.310> you

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
I already at full energy and then you

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.159 
I already at full energy and then you
just<00:04:44.550> use<00:04:44.759> it<00:04:44.879> again<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.330> it's<00:04:45.479> audio<00:04:45.900> at<00:04:46.020> full

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
just use it again and it's audio at full

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.600 
just use it again and it's audio at full
energy<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:46.680> if<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:46.860> get<00:04:46.949> Matthew<00:04:47.250> pops<00:04:47.460> you

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
energy and if you get Matthew pops you

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.059 
energy and if you get Matthew pops you
just<00:04:47.940> stay<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.180> fall<00:04:48.389> anyway<00:04:48.780> but<00:04:49.590> this<00:04:49.919> is

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
just stay it fall anyway but this is

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.460 
just stay it fall anyway but this is
going<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.280> be<00:04:50.340> even<00:04:50.430> more<00:04:51.060> important<00:04:51.659> and<00:04:51.780> 5.2

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
going to be even more important and 5.2

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.659 
going to be even more important and 5.2
because<00:04:52.740> you're<00:04:52.830> gonna<00:04:52.919> be<00:04:53.039> stacking<00:04:53.310> mastery

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
because you're gonna be stacking mastery

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.890 
because you're gonna be stacking mastery
and<00:04:53.699> you're<00:04:53.940> going<00:04:54.090> to<00:04:54.150> be<00:04:54.330> right<00:04:54.479> about<00:04:54.599> hate

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
and you're going to be right about hate

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.600 
and you're going to be right about hate
so<00:04:55.050> much<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.500> then<00:04:55.949> so<00:04:56.069> your<00:04:56.220> hate<00:04:56.400> will<00:04:56.430> be

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
so much and then so your hate will be

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.999 
so much and then so your hate will be
even<00:04:57.120> less<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:57.569> the<00:04:57.780> damage<00:04:58.050> you<00:04:58.259> do<00:04:58.470> will

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
even less so the damage you do will

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.640 
even less so the damage you do will
become<00:04:59.819> more<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.150> more<00:05:00.240> dependent<00:05:01.139> on<00:05:01.440> this

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
become more and more dependent on this

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.379 
become more and more dependent on this
system<00:05:01.919> where<00:05:02.219> you're<00:05:02.340> just<00:05:02.370> saving<00:05:02.940> up<00:05:03.180> Chi

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
system where you're just saving up Chi

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.629 
system where you're just saving up Chi
and<00:05:03.629> then<00:05:04.020> burning<00:05:04.289> and<00:05:05.219> then<00:05:05.280> keeping<00:05:05.550> an

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
and then burning and then keeping an

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.790 
and then burning and then keeping an
energy<00:05:05.969> about<00:05:06.270> 80<00:05:06.659> and<00:05:06.900> then<00:05:06.990> using<00:05:07.319> it<00:05:07.440> then

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
energy about 80 and then using it then

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.740 
energy about 80 and then using it then
when<00:05:08.069> you<00:05:08.190> need<00:05:08.849> to<00:05:08.879> and<00:05:09.000> then<00:05:09.150> when<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.509> heel

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
when you need to and then when the heel

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.450 
when you need to and then when the heel
occ<00:05:10.139> then<00:05:10.319> you're<00:05:10.469> popping<00:05:10.770> will<00:05:10.919> you<00:05:11.009> chi<00:05:11.219> and

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
occ then you're popping will you chi and

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.730 
occ then you're popping will you chi and
it<00:05:11.789> doesn't<00:05:12.060> matter<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:12.449> much<00:05:12.479> alright<00:05:13.349> so<00:05:13.500> if

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
it doesn't matter so much alright so if

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.499 
it doesn't matter so much alright so if
you're<00:05:13.889> at<00:05:14.039> like<00:05:14.280> if<00:05:14.520> you've<00:05:14.849> got<00:05:15.060> full<00:05:15.270> Chi

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
you're at like if you've got full Chi

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.839 
you're at like if you've got full Chi
and<00:05:15.780> you've<00:05:16.020> got<00:05:16.199> full<00:05:16.560> energy<00:05:16.979> use<00:05:17.370> your<00:05:17.610> Chi

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
and you've got full energy use your Chi

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.820 
and you've got full energy use your Chi
use<00:05:18.240> some<00:05:18.449> Chi<00:05:18.659> and<00:05:18.870> then<00:05:19.020> just<00:05:19.259> get<00:05:19.409> use<00:05:19.680> your

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
use some Chi and then just get use your

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.159 
use some Chi and then just get use your
energy<00:05:19.949> and<00:05:20.190> then<00:05:20.460> keep<00:05:20.940> your<00:05:21.060> Chi<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.599> energy

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
energy and then keep your Chi and energy

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.110 
energy and then keep your Chi and energy
so<00:05:22.349> just<00:05:22.530> keep<00:05:22.650> doing<00:05:22.889> this<00:05:23.009> so<00:05:23.340> keep<00:05:23.639> yourself

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
so just keep doing this so keep yourself

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.749 
so just keep doing this so keep yourself
a<00:05:24.360> trap<00:05:24.870> m75<00:05:25.650> energy<00:05:26.069> right<00:05:26.400> that's<00:05:26.580> what<00:05:26.699> you

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
a trap m75 energy right that's what you

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.740 
a trap m75 energy right that's what you
want<00:05:26.879> to<00:05:26.909> do<00:05:27.000> right<00:05:27.150> I've<00:05:27.270> gone<00:05:27.360> to<00:05:27.539> file<00:05:27.719> a

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
want to do right I've gone to file a

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.529 
want to do right I've gone to file a
look<00:05:28.080> right<00:05:28.669> you<00:05:29.669> know<00:05:29.789> I'm<00:05:29.909> still<00:05:30.150> there<00:05:30.360> I

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
look right you know I'm still there I

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.529 
look right you know I'm still there I
wait<00:05:30.750> now<00:05:31.080> now<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:32.219> then<00:05:32.610> i<00:05:32.639> use<00:05:32.849> my<00:05:33.000> Chi<00:05:33.240> and

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
wait now now and then i use my Chi and

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.260 
wait now now and then i use my Chi and
then<00:05:34.020> and<00:05:34.800> then<00:05:34.860> again<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.460> keep<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.240> there

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
then and then again and keep it there

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.570 
then and then again and keep it there
you<00:05:37.110> know<00:05:37.199> don't<00:05:37.380> let<00:05:37.500> it<00:05:37.650> get<00:05:37.740> full<00:05:37.979> just<00:05:38.430> try

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
you know don't let it get full just try

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.879 
you know don't let it get full just try
and<00:05:38.639> keep<00:05:38.759> it<00:05:38.940> like<00:05:39.419> as<00:05:39.449> you<00:05:39.960> know<00:05:40.050> quite<00:05:40.469> close

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
and keep it like as you know quite close

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.309 
and keep it like as you know quite close
as<00:05:41.069> close<00:05:41.250> as<00:05:41.460> you<00:05:41.550> can<00:05:41.699> to<00:05:41.759> the<00:05:41.940> left<00:05:42.630> to<00:05:43.289> the

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 
as close as you can to the left to the

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.309 
as close as you can to the left to the
right<00:05:43.409> sorry<00:05:43.889> without<00:05:44.400> it<00:05:44.719> being<00:05:45.719> full<00:05:46.020> so<00:05:46.229> if

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
right sorry without it being full so if

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.200 
right sorry without it being full so if
it<00:05:46.440> hits<00:05:46.620> 100<00:05:47.130> then<00:05:47.430> you're<00:05:47.610> kind<00:05:47.849> of<00:05:47.909> doing<00:05:48.029> a

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
it hits 100 then you're kind of doing a

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.730 
it hits 100 then you're kind of doing a
bad<00:05:48.360> job<00:05:48.389> unless<00:05:48.870> you're<00:05:49.050> not<00:05:49.199> on<00:05:49.319> someone<00:05:49.650> and

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
bad job unless you're not on someone and

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.350 
bad job unless you're not on someone and
then<00:05:49.860> that's<00:05:50.099> fine<00:05:50.130> if<00:05:50.699> you<00:05:50.789> not<00:05:51.029> got<00:05:51.210> full

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
then that's fine if you not got full

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.760 
then that's fine if you not got full
half<00:05:51.539> you<00:05:51.690> should<00:05:51.840> probably<00:05:52.139> just<00:05:52.319> check<00:05:52.740> a

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
half you should probably just check a

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.189 
half you should probably just check a
sphere<00:05:53.639> down<00:05:54.150> below<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:54.449> fix<00:05:54.719> by<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:54.990> time

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
sphere down below you fix by the time

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.499 
sphere down below you fix by the time
you<00:05:55.289> get<00:05:55.409> to<00:05:55.469> someone<00:05:55.830> you<00:05:56.370> you'll<00:05:56.759> then<00:05:56.819> have

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
you get to someone you you'll then have

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.450
