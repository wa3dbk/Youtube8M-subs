00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.039
 hi my name is alexander kristop in 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.280
 This review I will tell about easy and 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:15.499
 stylish laptop dell vostro 5470 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.779
 give its thickness is very similar 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.759
 ultrabook however lack of touch 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.340
 display of special awning sticker 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.990
 approver certification ultrabook not 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.529
 can be attributed to this class 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.900
 devices at the same time it is this fact 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.150
 made this model available and 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.309
 budget model appearance while 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.059
 solid aluminum cover 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.739
 stylized brushed metal 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.570
 bottom cover is removable which means that 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.449
 the model can not only be cleaned from the inside 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.260
 but also upgrade 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.260
 let's open it 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.579
 in this case, you can change 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.470
 hard drive and memory module 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.930
 by the way pay attention to the system 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.970
 cooling two powerful fans 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.580
 surprised me with their determination at work 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.130
 and here is the subwoofer 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.470
 really cool left 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.840
 sd card slot two connectors usb 30 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.030
 power connector and holes for 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.220
 kensington castle for home he can 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.220
 to be to nothing but in the office come in handy 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.990
 no one can steal your laptop but 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.210
 only if using the grinder 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.929
 right another connector usb 30 connector 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.289
 hdmi 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:38.020
 now not very common connector 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.539
 for local network and audio jack 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.860
 open the lid 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.050
 the keyboard I bend strongly and themselves 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.030
 the keys are not well spring loaded 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.910
 it does not put the feeling that you 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.190
 something pressed in principle is uncritical 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.869
 however, my impression spoiled 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.420
 move on to the most interesting part 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.239
 performance laptop works on 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.090
 intel core i3 processor and has 4 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:02.800
 gigabytes of RAM while 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.289
 memory module can be replaced 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.140
 and expand to a maximum of 8 gigabytes 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.420
 ask why, well , firstly, the memory is superfluous 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.830
 does not happen and secondly it is positive 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.069
 will affect work with some 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.069
 applications 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.939
 for content consumption and work in 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.209
 office applications 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:25.010
 this laptop is perfect especially 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.870
 during testing the laptop showed 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.930
 very good offline result 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.530
 6 hours when watching a video or 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.510
 nine hours with text 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.819
 operating system here windows 81 as 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.650
 and in all new models nothing 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.349
 I can't say anything interesting here except 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.909
 the fact that it always pleases small 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.340
 the number of pre-installed software 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:49.040
 which is often not always necessary 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.489
 the user will summarize 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.060
 laptop dell vostro 5470 laptop is clearly not 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.579
 for games 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.739
 however, its lightness and long time 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.599
 battery life lets talk about 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.620
 him as a worthy candidate among 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:10.340
 budget models 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:12.730
 Thanks for watching and while the video is on me 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.730
 does not matter
