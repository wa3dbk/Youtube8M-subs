00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
comparison to dps but I think it looks

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.980 
comparison to dps but I think it looks
it<00:01:52.400> looks<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.850> looks<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:53.120> lot<00:01:53.270> funner<00:01:53.510> than<00:01:53.630> arms

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
it looks it looks a lot funner than arms

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.130 
it looks it looks a lot funner than arms
to<00:01:54.230> me<00:01:54.760> it's<00:01:55.760> and<00:01:56.090> when<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.480> focuses<00:01:56.690> on

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
to me it's and when it focuses on

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.770 
to me it's and when it focuses on
instead<00:01:57.620> of<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:58.250> n<00:01:58.460> then<00:01:58.820> it's<00:01:59.000> like<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.480> arms

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
instead of to n then it's like the arms

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.030 
instead of to n then it's like the arms
tree<00:02:00.050> it<00:02:01.040> focuses<00:02:01.580> on<00:02:01.900> dual<00:02:02.900> wiggins<00:02:03.380> mostly

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
tree it focuses on dual wiggins mostly

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.900 
tree it focuses on dual wiggins mostly
and<00:02:04.340> that's<00:02:05.300> that's<00:02:05.990> pretty<00:02:06.440> cool<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:07.070> think

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
and that's that's pretty cool I think

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.680 
and that's that's pretty cool I think
sometimes<00:02:08.149> for<00:02:08.660> years<00:02:08.990> with<00:02:10.360> with<00:02:11.360> dual

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
sometimes for years with with dual

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.340 
sometimes for years with with dual
weapons<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.290> kind<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.590> like<00:02:12.740> rogue<00:02:13.040> wannabes

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
weapons that kind of like rogue wannabes

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.450 
weapons that kind of like rogue wannabes
again<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.380> don't<00:02:15.680> know<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.920> comparison

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
again I don't know the comparison

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.610 
again I don't know the comparison
between<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:17.150> fury<00:02:17.420> where<00:02:18.020> you're<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.410> robe

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
between a fury where you're in a robe

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.270 
between a fury where you're in a robe

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
but I know I just inside I feel like I

played a very warrior so I can't chat
about<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.470> too<00:02:31.010> much<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:34.130> next<00:02:34.340> spec<00:02:34.640> is

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
about it too much and the next spec is

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.510 
about it too much and the next spec is
his<00:02:36.230> protection<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:39.500> what<00:02:39.680> protection<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.310> is

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
his protection but what protection is is

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.330 
his protection but what protection is is
basically<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:41.300> shield<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.200> sword<00:02:42.340> shield

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
basically a shield and a sword shield

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.000 
basically a shield and a sword shield
the<00:02:43.670> enemy's<00:02:44.120> shield<00:02:44.810> an<00:02:45.080> axe<00:02:45.290> whatever

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
the enemy's shield an axe whatever

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.979 
the enemy's shield an axe whatever
whatever<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:46.580> been<00:02:46.790> it's<00:02:47.060> mainly<00:02:47.270> used<00:02:47.660> with

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
whatever it's been it's mainly used with

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.640 
whatever it's been it's mainly used with
the<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.500> which<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:49.489> mainly<00:02:49.820> with<00:02:50.180> shields

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
the is which it's mainly with shields

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.610 
the is which it's mainly with shields
shields<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.920> one<00:02:52.100> hand<00:02:52.280> wanted<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.590> what<00:02:54.590> I

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
shields and one hand wanted and what I

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.910 
shields and one hand wanted and what I
think<00:02:55.100> this<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:56.480> maybe<00:02:57.080> maybe<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.560> lot<00:02:57.800> of

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
think this is this maybe maybe a lot of

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.699 
think this is this maybe maybe a lot of
people<00:02:58.130> laid<00:02:58.459> this<00:02:58.670> for<00:02:58.940> me<00:02:59.060> but<00:02:59.269> uh<00:02:59.300> I<00:02:59.709> think

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
people laid this for me but uh I think

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.000 
people laid this for me but uh I think
is<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:02.080> every<00:03:03.080> warrior<00:03:03.350> should<00:03:03.800> be

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
is that every warrior should be

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.190 
is that every warrior should be
protection<00:03:04.610> every<00:03:05.510> warrior<00:03:05.750> should<00:03:06.080> be

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
protection every warrior should be

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.240 
protection every warrior should be
protection

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
protection

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.060 
protection

don't know but a lot of classes that
will<00:03:20.960> pretty<00:03:21.140> much<00:03:21.260> every<00:03:21.620> class<00:03:21.800> in<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.070> game

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
will pretty much every class in the game

will pretty much every class in the game
can<00:03:22.490> dps<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.980> since<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.100> warrior<00:03:25.490> is<00:03:25.610> one<00:03:25.820> of

can dps and since a warrior is one of
the<00:03:26.000> one<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.630> few<00:03:27.020> that<00:03:27.200> can<00:03:27.350> add<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.950> is

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
the one of the few that can add that is

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.030 
the one of the few that can add that is
able<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.520> tank<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.570> if<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:30.620> don't<00:03:30.800> know<00:03:30.890> what

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
able to tank and if you don't know what

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.730 
able to tank and if you don't know what
tanking<00:03:31.430> is<00:03:31.520> tanking<00:03:32.030> is<00:03:32.180> basically<00:03:32.740> when

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
tanking is tanking is basically when

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.770 
tanking is tanking is basically when
you're<00:03:33.860> running<00:03:34.070> in<00:03:34.220> an<00:03:34.340> instance<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.120> such

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
you're running in an instance and such

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.500 
you're running in an instance and such
as<00:03:35.990> if<00:03:36.290> you're<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.620> mage<00:03:36.950> your<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.700> you're<00:03:38.090> very

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
as if you're a mage your and you're very

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.590 
as if you're a mage your and you're very
vulnerable<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:39.230> attacks<00:03:40.030> when<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.060> tank<00:03:41.360> does

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
vulnerable to attacks when a tank does

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.660 
vulnerable to attacks when a tank does
is<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:41.959> tank<00:03:42.410> absorbs<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.160> damage<00:03:43.489> he's

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
is that tank absorbs the damage he's

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.640 
is that tank absorbs the damage he's
like<00:03:43.940> he's<00:03:44.420> making<00:03:44.600> sure<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.290> enemy<00:03:45.470> is

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
like he's making sure that the enemy is

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.400 
like he's making sure that the enemy is
attacking<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:47.030> tank<00:03:47.300> instead<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.140> while

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
attacking the tank instead of you while

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.880 
attacking the tank instead of you while
you're<00:03:48.739> doing<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.700> real<00:03:49.910> damage<00:03:50.650> he's<00:03:51.650> doing

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
you're doing the real damage he's doing

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.410 
you're doing the real damage he's doing
some<00:03:52.040> damage<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.370> but<00:03:52.700> not<00:03:52.880> as<00:03:53.000> much<00:03:53.150> as<00:03:53.209> the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
some damage to but not as much as the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:01.000 
some damage to but not as much as the
day<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.720> edge<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.840> course<00:03:54.200> most<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:55.300> and<00:04:00.010> but

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
day the edge of course most of and but

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.240 
day the edge of course most of and but
yeah<00:04:01.220> like<00:04:01.580> that<00:04:02.360> every<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:03.140> just<00:04:03.739> think<00:04:03.920> every

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
yeah like that every I just think every

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.070 
yeah like that every I just think every
warrior<00:04:04.489> should<00:04:04.760> be<00:04:04.910> protection<00:04:05.450> they're

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
warrior should be protection they're

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.810 
warrior should be protection they're
like<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:08.120> ones<00:04:08.360> that<00:04:08.480> can<00:04:08.930> heal<00:04:08.959> or<00:04:09.820> tank

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
like the ones that can heal or tank

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.470 
like the ones that can heal or tank
their<00:04:11.660> dps<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.769> I<00:04:12.980> believe<00:04:13.400> that's<00:04:13.610> like<00:04:13.910> four

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
their dps and I believe that's like four

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.490 
their dps and I believe that's like four
classes<00:04:15.019> like<00:04:16.090> four<00:04:17.090> or<00:04:17.209> five<00:04:17.239> I<00:04:17.500> can't

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
classes like four or five I can't

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.250 
classes like four or five I can't
remember

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
remember

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.880 
remember
good<00:04:20.410> but<00:04:20.650> Roger<00:04:21.460> some<00:04:21.820> thinking<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:23.740> other

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
good but Roger some thinking the other

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
good but Roger some thinking the other
yeah<00:04:24.850> there's<00:04:25.090> no<00:04:25.600> yeah<00:04:26.500> again<00:04:27.130> if<00:04:27.400> if<00:04:27.670> your

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
yeah there's no yeah again if if your

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.880 
yeah there's no yeah again if if your
guild<00:04:28.120> has<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.360> lot<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:28.630> tanks<00:04:29.020> in<00:04:29.140> it<00:04:29.400> then<00:04:31.890> then

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
guild has a lot of tanks in it then then

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.510 
guild has a lot of tanks in it then then
that's<00:04:33.250> that<00:04:33.700> then<00:04:34.630> I<00:04:34.720> guess<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:36.040> understand

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
that's that then I guess I understand

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.360 
that's that then I guess I understand
that<00:04:36.760> but<00:04:36.790> if<00:04:37.390> if<00:04:38.050> your<00:04:38.470> guild<00:04:38.770> is<00:04:39.040> low<00:04:39.340> on

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
that but if if your guild is low on

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.610 
that but if if your guild is low on
tanks<00:04:39.970> then<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.360> should<00:04:40.570> be<00:04:40.720> brought<00:04:40.990> I<00:04:41.290> think

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
tanks then you should be brought I think

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.820 
tanks then you should be brought I think
you<00:04:41.710> should<00:04:41.920> be<00:04:42.100> brought<00:04:42.310> because<00:04:42.900> if<00:04:43.900> you
