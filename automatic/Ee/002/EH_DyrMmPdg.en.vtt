decreased I can look for a decreased

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.830 
decreased I can look for a decreased
value<00:02:58.580> and<00:03:00.380> once<00:03:01.380> again<00:03:01.530> edit<00:03:02.040> settings

value and once again edit settings

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.240 
value and once again edit settings
hotkeys<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.500> set<00:03:04.740> hotkeys<00:03:05.220> for

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
hotkeys you can set hotkeys for

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.180 
hotkeys you can set hotkeys for
searching<00:03:05.880> for<00:03:06.090> decreased<00:03:06.540> values<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.530> all

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190
