couldn't think of 40 cards I wanted to
play<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:15.040> had<00:02:15.370> 38<00:02:15.880> one<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.150> these<00:02:16.270> was<00:02:16.390> rigged<00:02:16.630> a

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
play I had 38 one of these was rigged a

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.500 
play I had 38 one of these was rigged a
key<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.590> was<00:02:18.460> looking<00:02:18.760> through<00:02:18.910> my<00:02:18.940> box<00:02:19.210> looking

through different cars i could play i
don't<00:02:20.650> really<00:02:20.740> want<00:02:21.010> like<00:02:21.130> another<00:02:21.340> discard

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850

another<00:02:23.740> mathematician<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:25.330> we<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:25.540> cover

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
another mathematician so we just cover

another mathematician so we just cover
gak<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.050> put<00:02:26.260> three<00:02:26.410> officer<00:02:26.620> goblins<00:02:26.980> in

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
gak you put three officer goblins in

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.790 
gak you put three officer goblins in
that<00:02:28.360> felt<00:02:28.570> good<00:02:29.910> um<00:02:31.080> honestly<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.260> don't<00:02:32.500> think

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
that felt good um honestly I don't think

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.140 
that felt good um honestly I don't think
there's<00:02:33.280> enough<00:02:33.490> card<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:33.850> would<00:02:34.030> rather

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
there's enough card so I would rather

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.180 
there's enough card so I would rather
play<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:34.930> would<00:02:35.110> want<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.380> mess<00:02:35.920> with<00:02:35.950> my

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
play that I would want to mess with my

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.530 
play that I would want to mess with my
ratios<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.880> find<00:02:37.090> burning<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.510> was

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
ratios like I find burning it was

with<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:40.780> list<00:02:41.020> I<00:02:41.200> find<00:02:41.380> enough<00:02:41.560> traps

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
with this list I find enough traps

with this list I find enough traps
pretty<00:02:42.100> consistently<00:02:43.920> there's<00:02:44.920> just<00:02:45.040> not

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
pretty consistently there's just not

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.350 
pretty consistently there's just not
that<00:02:45.190> many<00:02:45.400> cars<00:02:45.670> at<00:02:45.820> one<00:02:45.910> point<00:02:46.000> like<00:02:46.090> playing

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
their decks a lot more fragile and it's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.080 
their decks a lot more fragile and it's
fine<00:03:26.110> against<00:03:26.530> CLE<00:03:27.040> in<00:03:27.100> some<00:03:27.430> situations

the necros is much less popular however
I<00:03:32.290> think<00:03:32.470> it's<00:03:32.560> still<00:03:32.709> correct<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.040> play

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
I think it's still correct to play

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.380 
I think it's still correct to play
through<00:03:33.310> my<00:03:33.459> crush<00:03:33.640> for<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.850> time<00:03:34.030> being

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
because it is still fine guard against

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.920 
because it is still fine guard against
like<00:03:35.800> ignite<00:03:36.160> CLE<00:03:36.550> Tyler<00:03:36.880> in<00:03:37.120> some<00:03:37.300> situations

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
like ignite CLE Tyler in some situations

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.750

make sure you know the mash-up inside

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:36.869 
make sure you know the mash-up inside
and<00:06:34.840> out<00:06:34.930> it's<00:06:35.919> kind<00:06:36.069> of<00:06:36.159> pretty<00:06:36.460> solid<00:06:36.759> match

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:36.879 
and out it's kind of pretty solid match

against all the new decks to fire link
is<00:06:38.770> just<00:06:38.979> so<00:06:39.129> good<00:06:39.340> against<00:06:39.580> conventional<00:06:40.090> UVO

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.149 
is just so good against conventional UVO
like<00:06:40.749> it's<00:06:41.319> not<00:06:41.409> grading<00:06:41.740> its<00:06:41.860> necros

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:43.739 
like it's not grading its necros
obviously<00:06:42.550> because<00:06:42.789> they<00:06:42.879> can<00:06:43.029> just<00:06:43.180> not<00:06:43.389> put

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:43.749

just put cards on the board and or even

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.679 
just put cards on the board and or even

00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:59.489 
or anything where they play pendulums I
just<00:06:57.699> get<00:06:57.819> so<00:06:58.029> much<00:06:58.210> value<00:06:58.360> killing<00:06:58.840> their

00:06:59.489 --> 00:06:59.499 
just get so much value killing their

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:02.159 
just get so much value killing their
commitments<00:07:00.159> for<00:07:00.249> free<00:07:00.460> so<00:07:01.180> it's<00:07:02.020> a<00:07:02.080> pretty

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:02.169 
commitments for free so it's a pretty

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:03.839 
commitments for free so it's a pretty
strong<00:07:02.439> deck<00:07:02.710> it<00:07:02.919> does<00:07:03.129> a<00:07:03.159> lot<00:07:03.370> in<00:07:03.490> the<00:07:03.520> current

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:03.849 
strong deck it does a lot in the current

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:05.399 
strong deck it does a lot in the current
meta<00:07:03.969> it<00:07:04.210> will<00:07:04.330> probably<00:07:04.779> stick<00:07:04.990> around<00:07:05.169> for<00:07:05.379> a

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:07.029 
pretty long time actually even though

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:08.939 
pretty long time actually even though
they're<00:07:07.150> not<00:07:07.180> going<00:07:07.389> to<00:07:07.479> get<00:07:07.599> new<00:07:07.810> support<00:07:08.169> the
