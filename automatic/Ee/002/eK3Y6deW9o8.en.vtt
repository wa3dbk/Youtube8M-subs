00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.660
 nail designs for autumn 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.620
 in the first option we will use 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.530
 these enamels and a brush 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.310
 we paint the nail white or a 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.830
 light color and with a brush a spike or 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.740
 a stick let's draw strokes of more 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.040
 narrower widths doing like a 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.040
 flower 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.790
 We do the whole circle 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.309
 we take another glaze a little more 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.150
 clarito and we are going to surround the drawing that 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.150
 we have done before 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.409
 we take a color even more clearly and 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:11.140
 we just filled the entire nail 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.140
 ready and this is the first design 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.060
 in this option we are going to use these 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.390
 enamels 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.299
 we paint the nail white and 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.530
 we take a sponge to do the 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:35.200
 gradient effect 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.200
 we put it in the tip to touch 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.859
 leaving the darkest color we take a 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.310
 lighter color and we place it just 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.310
 over 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.310
 now with just white 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.310
 place it on top 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.140
 and now yes with the long brush we are going to 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.740
 do the drawing we draw lines 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:07.560
 Unequal doing the tree 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.560
 we are giving it the shape on the fly 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.910
 and you are already seeing how it looks 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.910
 complicated but it 's really easy 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.530
 we finish with the details and ready this 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.530
 it is the result 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.890
 in this option we are going to use these 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.330
 three of smart is a sponge and a pick 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.330
 we paint the nail white 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.370
 and we're going to do the gradient with the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.370
 sponge and it is orange 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.380
 center out 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.080
 we take the barb and a colored enamel 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.100
 Brown 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.880
 and we are going to draw several sheets with 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.300
 uneven spots and a little bit of 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.300
 patience 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.690
