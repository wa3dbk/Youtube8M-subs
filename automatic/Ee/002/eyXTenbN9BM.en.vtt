there<00:01:49.220> it's<00:01:49.400> very<00:01:49.460> brittle<00:01:49.939> and<00:01:50.060> chassis<00:01:50.450> if

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
there it's very brittle and chassis if

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.120 
there it's very brittle and chassis if
you<00:01:51.080> were<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.259> take<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.439> fall<00:01:51.680> from<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:51.950> very

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
you were to take a fall from the very

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.190 
you were to take a fall from the very
top<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.549> you<00:01:52.820> could<00:01:52.970> potentially<00:01:53.750> fall

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
top of that you could potentially fall

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.350 
top of that you could potentially fall
down<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.500> hillside<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:55.520> think<00:01:55.939> this<00:01:56.030> kind<00:01:56.210> is

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
down the hillside I think this kind is

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.240 
down the hillside I think this kind is
really<00:01:56.540> fun<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:57.079> get<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.470> really<00:01:57.619> cool<00:01:57.710> view<00:01:57.979> of

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
really fun you get a really cool view of

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.039 
really fun you get a really cool view of
Las<00:01:58.400> Vegas<00:01:58.430> strip<00:01:58.970> line<00:01:59.180> from<00:01:59.540> there<00:01:59.689> also<00:01:59.960> you

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
Las Vegas strip line from there also you

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.210 
Las Vegas strip line from there also you
can<00:02:00.200> see<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.439> rest<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.740> boulders<00:02:01.009> in

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
can see the rest of the boulders in

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.730 
can see the rest of the boulders in
craft<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.750> I<00:02:02.990> think<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:03.290> is<00:02:03.380> probably<00:02:03.530> one

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
craft and I think this is probably one

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.679 
craft and I think this is probably one
of<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.890> best-kept<00:02:04.220> secrets<00:02:04.610> in<00:02:04.820> Red<00:02:05.479> Rocks

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
of the best-kept secrets in Red Rocks

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:06.819 
of the best-kept secrets in Red Rocks
because<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.170> doesn't<00:02:06.409> get<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.530> whole<00:02:06.590> lot<00:02:06.740> of

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
because it doesn't get a whole lot of

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.670 
because it doesn't get a whole lot of
traffic<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.369> you're<00:02:07.520> also<00:02:07.640> working<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:08.119> really

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680

Boulder you're going to start up on a
pretty<00:02:26.990> good-sized<00:02:27.710> rail<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:29.150> then<00:02:29.300> just

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
pretty good-sized rail and then just

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.750 
pretty good-sized rail and then just
blast<00:02:29.840> up<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.230> top<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:31.400> top<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
climate is a little bit sharp so you're

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.560 
climate is a little bit sharp so you're
gonna<00:02:33.440> wanna<00:02:33.680> maybe<00:02:34.400> not<00:02:34.820> stick<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.300> in<00:02:35.390> slip

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
gonna wanna maybe not stick it in slip

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.810 
gonna wanna maybe not stick it in slip
off<00:02:35.980> as<00:02:36.980> soon<00:02:37.160> as<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.280> get<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.520> you're<00:02:37.700> just

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
off as soon as you get it you're just

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.460 
off as soon as you get it you're just
gonna<00:02:37.940> grab<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.300> high<00:02:38.510> foot<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.140> then<00:02:39.290> make

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
gonna grab a high foot and then make

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.650 
gonna grab a high foot and then make
toll<00:02:39.650> over<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:39.920> push<00:02:40.070> over<00:02:40.340> great<00:02:41.150> climb<00:02:41.420> it's

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
toll over and push over great climb it's

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.480 
toll over and push over great climb it's
also<00:02:41.840> right<00:02:42.230> across<00:02:42.410> from<00:02:42.620> potato<00:02:42.980> chips<00:02:43.190> so

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
also right across from potato chips so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.760 
also right across from potato chips so
tape<00:02:44.060> chips<00:02:44.300> is<00:02:44.480> probably<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.320> best<00:02:45.590> one

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
tape chips is probably the best one

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.200 
tape chips is probably the best one
Boulder<00:02:46.190> you'll<00:02:46.340> ever<00:02:46.460> come<00:02:46.730> across<00:02:46.820> in<00:02:47.180> your

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
Boulder you'll ever come across in your

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.920 
Boulder you'll ever come across in your
entire<00:02:47.480> life

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
entire life

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.540 
entire life
so<00:02:48.020> definitely<00:02:48.770> warm<00:02:49.010> up<00:02:49.130> on<00:02:49.250> potato<00:02:49.520> chips

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
so definitely warm up on potato chips

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.250 
so definitely warm up on potato chips
and<00:02:49.880> then<00:02:49.970> hit<00:02:50.120> this<00:02:50.210> thing<00:02:50.270> up

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
and then hit this thing up

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.930 
and then hit this thing up
last<00:02:52.680> time<00:02:52.860> we<00:02:53.069> go<00:02:53.190> over<00:02:53.310> with<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.520> guys<00:02:53.670> is

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
last time we go over with you guys is

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.330 
last time we go over with you guys is
called<00:02:54.240> month<00:02:54.840> or<00:02:54.960> inch<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.560> v7<00:02:56.160> it's

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
called month or inch this is a v7 it's

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.580 
called month or inch this is a v7 it's
at<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.640> end<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.880> Red<00:02:57.150> Springs<00:02:57.390> it's<00:02:58.080> on<00:02:58.319> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
at the end of Red Springs it's on the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.400 
at the end of Red Springs it's on the
turtle<00:02:58.980> shell<00:02:59.160> Boulder<00:02:59.580> so<00:03:00.080> for<00:03:01.080> this<00:03:01.170> climb

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
turtle shell Boulder so for this climb

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.900 
turtle shell Boulder so for this climb
you're<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> start<00:03:01.980> on<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.160> pretty<00:03:02.670> large

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
you're a start on a pretty large

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.730 
you're a start on a pretty large
positive<00:03:03.330> jug<00:03:03.780> at<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.110> very<00:03:04.350> beginning<00:03:04.680> of

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
positive jug at the very beginning of

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.470 
positive jug at the very beginning of
the<00:03:04.860> face<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:05.970> from<00:03:06.150> there<00:03:06.300> you're<00:03:06.390> up

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the face and then from there you're up

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.780 
the face and then from there you're up
on<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.690> crimp<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.530> then<00:03:08.040> go<00:03:08.220> over<00:03:08.340> ten<00:03:08.640> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
on the crimp and then go over ten the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.760 
on the crimp and then go over ten the
other<00:03:08.910> jug<00:03:09.150> after<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.290> get<00:03:10.410> your<00:03:10.560> feet

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
other jug after that you get your feet

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.350 
other jug after that you get your feet
set<00:03:10.800> up<00:03:11.160> pretty<00:03:11.370> high<00:03:11.550> for<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.970> rollover

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
set up pretty high for this rollover

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.000 
set up pretty high for this rollover
move<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:13.140> you're<00:03:13.230> gonna<00:03:13.320> get<00:03:13.440> onto<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.709> bad

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
move that you're gonna get onto a bad

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.160 
move that you're gonna get onto a bad
side<00:03:14.370> pool<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:14.910> then<00:03:15.300> work<00:03:15.510> over<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:15.990> left

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
side pool and then work over to the left

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.830 
side pool and then work over to the left
hand<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.820> worst<00:03:18.180> hand<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.720> you'll

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
like I did that lip is really positive

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.770 
like I did that lip is really positive
from<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.830> angle<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.850> if<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.330> hit<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.660> you're

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
from that angle and if you hit it you're

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.960 
from that angle and if you hit it you're
gonna<00:03:42.900> end<00:03:43.050> up<00:03:43.080> sticking<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:44.100> get<00:03:44.850> your

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
throw them up to the top and then walk

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.660 
throw them up to the top and then walk
up<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.510> slab<00:03:48.980> this<00:03:49.980> climb<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.370> really<00:03:50.550> really

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
up the slab this climb is really really

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.729 
up the slab this climb is really really
cool<00:03:50.880> because<00:03:51.300> there's<00:03:52.110> not<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.290> lot<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.500> people

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
cool because there's not a lot of people

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.410 
cool because there's not a lot of people
that<00:03:52.830> go<00:03:52.890> out<00:03:52.980> there<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.220> climb<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.760> if<00:03:54.209> you

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
that go out there and climb and if you

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.610 
that go out there and climb and if you
are<00:03:54.600> climbing<00:03:54.959> out<00:03:55.050> there<00:03:55.230> you're<00:03:55.380> pretty

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
are climbing out there you're pretty

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.840 
are climbing out there you're pretty
much<00:03:55.709> just<00:03:55.769> climbing<00:03:56.220> with<00:03:56.340> tourists<00:03:56.760> that

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
much just climbing with tourists that

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.280 
much just climbing with tourists that
are<00:03:56.910> walking<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.420> easy<00:03:57.570> trails<00:03:57.870> around<00:03:58.019> there

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
are walking the easy trails around there

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.840 
are walking the easy trails around there
and<00:03:58.440> then<00:03:58.860> I'm<00:03:58.980> thinking<00:03:59.010> climbing<00:03:59.610> is<00:03:59.700> pretty

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
and then I'm thinking climbing is pretty

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.400 
and then I'm thinking climbing is pretty
cool<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.209> taking<00:04:00.510> pictures<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:01.140> are

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
cool and taking pictures of you and are

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.640 
cool and taking pictures of you and are
wondering<00:04:02.400> how<00:04:02.579> you<00:04:03.260> can<00:04:04.260> climb<00:04:04.410> Mount

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
wondering how you can climb Mount

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.800 
wondering how you can climb Mount
Everest<00:04:04.769> or<00:04:05.220> whatever<00:04:05.549> but<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.570> climb<00:04:06.720> is

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
Everest or whatever but the climb is

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.870 
Everest or whatever but the climb is
really<00:04:06.989> really<00:04:07.170> fun<00:04:07.380> feet<00:04:07.980> seven<00:04:08.340> seven<00:04:08.790> easy

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
really really fun feet seven seven easy

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.449 
really really fun feet seven seven easy
points<00:04:09.329> get<00:04:09.840> out<00:04:09.930> there<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.200> do<00:04:10.290> it

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
points get out there and do it

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.030 
points get out there and do it
so<00:04:12.299> that's<00:04:12.569> rap<00:04:12.810> for<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.319> best-kept<00:04:13.680> secrets

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
so that's rap for the best-kept secrets

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.270 
so that's rap for the best-kept secrets
in<00:04:14.310> Red<00:04:14.670> Rock<00:04:15.169> or<00:04:16.169> I<00:04:16.229> guess<00:04:16.530> just<00:04:16.709> three<00:04:17.009> climbs

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
in Red Rock or I guess just three climbs

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.099 
in Red Rock or I guess just three climbs
that<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:18.000> don't<00:04:18.359> feel<00:04:18.539> like<00:04:18.600> get<00:04:18.900> enough

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
that I don't feel like get enough

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.920
