00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello everyone with you tank how long have we been 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.670
 I didn't see you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.219
 came from vacation and immediately ran 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.620
 watch stream but meanwhile let's 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.440
 open the stickers that I bought 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.990
 I know that for example in fnatic olof master 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.930
 now I am quite expensive for the tariff 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.810
 h9 autographed capsules 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.539
 and I will probably open them with them and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:33.149
 let's start right away i just wonder what 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:36.930
 well what do i drop out of these pronax 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:41.070
 so well olofmeister runs along the sides 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.860
 left and right first did not go well and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.200
 how will it look like something in Volyn 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.270
 I will now try to apply a sticker 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.489
 for example on any blog, and water 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.230
 so here it will look but on 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.730
 really not very happy because 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.660
 it would be possible to make a background 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.910
 more interesting 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.460
 But what kind of person do you know how? 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.340
 School board with gradient well 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.290
 shorter somehow not very much further fnatic 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.770
 go open 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.170
 gi-vi two such letters are straight for the whole 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.480
 this one 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.590
 cream zik so live with us now 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.810
 eat pronax and grimes again aiming 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.030
 so only olofmeister 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.830
 this is a very interesting sport 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.170
 expensive 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.500
 Nakleechka with this so gi-vi on the idea either 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.330
 either olofmeister plush will be as follows 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.460
 so thank you at least for such a random 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.970
 the same sticker does not come across 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:41.550
 because a couple at least I stick 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.300
 and orphans and live well, does not want us 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.320
 getting caught 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.030
 olofmeister let's continue to like 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.940
 Of course half as much 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.500
 let's play maybe half here he is 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.390
 where is he here a marker there is at least one 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.700
 but it is a plus it provided i 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.340
 stocked 9 pieces and some by 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.460
 buy one or two well there are four on 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.360
 dollar yes and try with this master 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.790
 will pronax hello 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.550
 scroll further so we have 3 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.280
 fnatic pronax stickers 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.810
 again pronax well i don't know and then 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.540
 see how much it will cost well and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.140
 actually at the actual price at all 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:33.900
 the current price will not be in a year 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:39.130
 be interested with is get out this guy 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.040
 so on playing games on holiday i'm not 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.640

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.709
 finally already the whole and the five we have 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.880

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:54.160
 cool letter such as the euro so there is 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.160

 this is written by edward does not sink anyone 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.799
 I donâ€™t hide that Edward is one of my favorites 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.160
 its players at all from all the teams are very 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:28.060
 like this character let's say this 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.610

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.080
 I'm attracted to the guardian warden too 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.850
 good guy who fucks like 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.750

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.830

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.350
 toilet probably the crown and there is gedza 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.030

 also such a team that everyone 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.310
 differently called no one at all 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.610
 such a person who would be right 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:45.070
 named although although there may be 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:49.420

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.260
