that's<00:04:18.230> pretty<00:04:18.500> much<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.680> whole<00:04:18.800> game

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
that's pretty much the whole game

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.800

because as a seat just in our Beijing

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.540 
because as a seat just in our Beijing

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
the princess and stuff like that because

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.150 
the princess and stuff like that because
once<00:04:32.840> again<00:04:32.960> she's<00:04:33.260> been<00:04:33.410> kidnapped<00:04:33.560> surprise

once again she's been kidnapped surprise

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.700 
once again she's been kidnapped surprise
surprise<00:04:34.490> but<00:04:35.210> prefer<00:04:35.960> but<00:04:36.320> pretty<00:04:36.650> much

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
surprise but prefer but pretty much

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.050 
surprise but prefer but pretty much
everything<00:04:37.100> I<00:04:37.250> can<00:04:37.460> see<00:04:37.640> about<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:37.940> game

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
everything I can see about the game

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.510 
everything I can see about the game
unfortunately<00:04:38.420> because<00:04:39.170> it<00:04:39.410> is<00:04:39.920> here<00:04:40.130> unlike

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
unfortunately because it is here unlike

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.610 
unfortunately because it is here unlike
pmo<00:04:40.940> your<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.240> hasn't<00:04:41.510> got<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.810> lot<00:04:42.260> of<00:04:42.290> like

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
pmo your it hasn't got a lot of like

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.050 
pmo your it hasn't got a lot of like
depth<00:04:42.920> to<00:04:43.160> work<00:04:43.250> with<00:04:43.430> things<00:04:43.700> that<00:04:43.790> you<00:04:43.940> can

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
depth to work with things that you can

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.300 
depth to work with things that you can
do<00:04:44.240> out<00:04:44.420> and<00:04:44.690> about<00:04:44.900> it's<00:04:45.470> not<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.800> bad<00:04:45.950> game<00:04:46.130> or

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
do out and about it's not a bad game or

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.530 
do out and about it's not a bad game or
anything<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.670> think<00:04:46.850> it's<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:47.000> fantastic<00:04:47.510> game

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
anything I think it's a fantastic game

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.790 
anything I think it's a fantastic game
and<00:04:47.900> obviously<00:04:47.990> it's<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.350> first<00:04:48.590> time<00:04:48.740> it's

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
and obviously it's the first time it's

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.010 
and obviously it's the first time it's
actually<00:04:49.160> came<00:04:49.340> out<00:04:49.460> over<00:04:49.640> in<00:04:49.850> Europe<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.690> I'm

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
actually came out over in Europe so I'm

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.870 
actually came out over in Europe so I'm
especially<00:04:51.890> chopped<00:04:52.130> about<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.580> because

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
especially chopped about that because

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.700 
especially chopped about that because
I've<00:04:53.120> finally<00:04:53.330> been<00:04:53.570> able<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:53.900> play<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.080> but

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
I've finally been able to play it but

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.190 
I've finally been able to play it but
basically<00:04:55.310> if<00:04:55.880> you<00:04:56.090> could<00:04:56.240> only<00:04:56.330> get<00:04:56.630> one<00:04:56.870> that

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
basically if you could only get one that

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.900 
basically if you could only get one that
would<00:04:57.320> probably<00:04:57.650> see<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.860> try<00:04:58.130> pit<00:04:58.370> Mario<00:04:58.730> ouch

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
would probably see a try pit Mario ouch

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.330 
would probably see a try pit Mario ouch
I<00:04:59.230> know<00:05:00.230> what's<00:05:00.410> a<00:05:00.470> hundred<00:05:00.740> points<00:05:00.890> more<00:05:01.190> but

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
I know what's a hundred points more but

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.590 
I know what's a hundred points more but
as<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:01.520> see<00:05:01.700> there<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:01.970> a<00:05:02.000> little<00:05:02.240> bit<00:05:02.360> more<00:05:02.510> to

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
as I see there is a little bit more to

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.730 
as I see there is a little bit more to
do<00:05:02.780> because<00:05:02.990> you<00:05:03.140> can<00:05:03.290> just<00:05:03.320> go<00:05:03.620> around

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
do because you can just go around

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.590 
do because you can just go around
finding<00:05:04.460> things<00:05:04.700> like<00:05:04.880> hitting<00:05:05.180> trees<00:05:05.420> and

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
finding things like hitting trees and

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.540 
finding things like hitting trees and
stuff<00:05:05.750> like<00:05:05.900> that<00:05:05.960> but<00:05:06.320> both<00:05:07.160> are<00:05:07.370> still

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
stuff like that but both are still

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.220 
stuff like that but both are still
amazing<00:05:07.940> games<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:08.420> well<00:05:08.690> worthy<00:05:08.930> of<00:05:09.170> a

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
amazing games and well worthy of a

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.410 
amazing games and well worthy of a
purchase<00:05:09.620> so<00:05:10.310> I'll<00:05:10.670> shut<00:05:10.910> up<00:05:10.940> again<00:05:11.210> just<00:05:11.390> for

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
purchase so I'll shut up again just for

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.030 
purchase so I'll shut up again just for
a<00:05:11.540> little<00:05:11.630> bit<00:05:11.750> more<00:05:11.930> just<00:05:12.170> to<00:05:12.320> basically<00:05:12.500> late

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
a little bit more just to basically late

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.590 
a little bit more just to basically late
listen<00:05:13.310> to<00:05:13.370> some<00:05:13.520> of<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.640> music<00:05:13.730> which<00:05:14.270> sounds

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
listen to some of the music which sounds

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.660 
listen to some of the music which sounds
pretty<00:05:14.810> damn<00:05:14.960> good<00:05:15.170> and<00:05:15.400> graphically<00:05:16.400> as<00:05:16.580> you

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
pretty damn good and graphically as you

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.760 
pretty damn good and graphically as you
can<00:05:16.820> see<00:05:17.030> it's<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.450> kind<00:05:17.690> of<00:05:17.780> suit<00:05:17.990> or<00:05:18.170> 3d<00:05:18.560> look

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
can see it's a kind of suit or 3d look

00:05:18.770 --> 00:06:44.210 
can see it's a kind of suit or 3d look
so<00:05:18.980> again<00:05:19.220> it<00:05:19.370> looks<00:05:19.400> pretty<00:05:19.820> damn<00:05:19.940> good

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.350 

so<00:06:45.220> that<00:06:45.370> we<00:06:45.460> call<00:06:45.610> them<00:06:45.729> that's<00:06:46.000> a<00:06:46.090> bit<00:06:46.240> the

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
so that we call them that's a bit the

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.240 
so that we call them that's a bit the
music<00:06:46.750> and<00:06:46.960> also<00:06:47.289> a<00:06:47.319> couple<00:06:47.590> fights<00:06:47.830> just<00:06:48.130> to

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
music and also a couple fights just to

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.070 
music and also a couple fights just to
show<00:06:48.610> you<00:06:48.669> a<00:06:48.759> bit<00:06:48.909> more<00:06:48.970> about<00:06:49.330> what<00:06:49.840> you<00:06:49.870> do

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
show you a bit more about what you do

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.570 
show you a bit more about what you do

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
to be able to kill you in one so you

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.909 
to be able to kill you in one so you
want<00:07:25.479> to<00:07:25.570> use<00:07:25.659> a<00:07:25.690> mushroom<00:07:26.050> or<00:07:26.110> something<00:07:26.409> and

you can also operate your magic attack
and<00:07:28.780> magic<00:07:29.080> defense<00:07:29.229> so<00:07:29.860> that's<00:07:30.039> basically

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.250 
and magic defense so that's basically

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.670 
and magic defense so that's basically
for<00:07:30.759> when<00:07:30.969> you<00:07:31.030> do<00:07:31.150> attacks<00:07:31.479> like<00:07:31.659> these<00:07:31.900> you

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
for when you do attacks like these you

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.290 
for when you do attacks like these you
can<00:07:32.830> obviously<00:07:33.219> awkward<00:07:33.610> how<00:07:33.820> much<00:07:34.030> how

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
can obviously awkward how much how

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.089 
can obviously awkward how much how
powerful<00:07:34.719> they<00:07:34.870> are<00:07:34.900> friends<00:07:35.349> but<00:07:35.710> if<00:07:35.860> you<00:07:35.979> get

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:36.099 
powerful they are friends but if you get

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:38.040 
powerful they are friends but if you get
attacked<00:07:36.190> by<00:07:36.490> its<00:07:36.729> acts<00:07:36.880> like<00:07:37.030> these<00:07:37.240> how<00:07:37.780> much

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.050 
attacked by its acts like these how much

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.870 
attacked by its acts like these how much
you<00:07:38.199> can<00:07:38.349> take<00:07:38.380> before<00:07:38.710> you<00:07:38.860> die

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:39.880 
you can take before you die

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.250 
you can take before you die
so<00:07:40.060> that's<00:07:40.540> pretty<00:07:40.750> much<00:07:40.870> everything<00:07:41.050> there
