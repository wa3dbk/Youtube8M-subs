00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.570 
into the crease and then blending it up
with<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.740> great<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.130> sort<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.430> help

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
straight away and then again that do the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.540 
straight away and then again that do the
same<00:02:37.110> on<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.380> other<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.100> avoid<00:02:38.130> is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
same on the other I and so avoid is

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.370 
same on the other I and so avoid is
dying<00:02:38.820> into<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.210> outer<00:02:39.390> third<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.110> eye<00:02:40.140> as

dying into the outer third of the eye as
well<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.920> then<00:02:41.400> make<00:02:41.610> sure<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.940> blend<00:02:42.270> that

products<00:02:45.630> at<00:02:45.750> all<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.950> then<00:02:47.550> we're<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:47.730> to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
products at all and then we're going to

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.490 
products at all and then we're going to
go<00:02:47.850> in<00:02:48.030> with<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.360> darker<00:02:48.840> shade<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.350> is

more of a plummy shade rather than a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.670 
more of a plummy shade rather than a
brine<00:02:51.300> because<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:51.960> wanted<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.350> incorporate

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
the lid a little bit more than the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.750 
the lid a little bit more than the
others<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.770> deepen<00:03:20.130> up<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> look<00:03:20.490> a<00:03:20.580> bit

others just to deepen up the look a bit

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.090

and<00:03:20.910> make<00:03:21.270> it<00:03:21.420> Elizabeth<00:03:21.660> more<00:03:22.290> interesting

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
and make it Elizabeth more interesting

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.740 
and make it Elizabeth more interesting
and<00:03:23.310> then<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.030> course<00:03:24.060> we're<00:03:24.330> going<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.510> blend

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
and then of course we're going to blend

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.390 
and then of course we're going to blend
the<00:03:24.870> eye<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.350> same<00:03:25.620> brush<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.220> has<00:03:26.340> a

intensify that again as well and then

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.390 
intensify that again as well and then
it's<00:03:36.930> time<00:03:37.050> for<00:03:37.230> gel<00:03:37.410> liner<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.830> apparently<00:03:38.310> I

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
it's time for gel liner and apparently I

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.160

like to be now to shop for this part and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.350 
like to be now to shop for this part and
then<00:03:40.950> I'm<00:03:41.250> just<00:03:41.489> doing<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.910> as<00:03:42.060> per<00:03:42.239> usual

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
then I'm just doing that as per usual

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.479 
then I'm just doing that as per usual
this<00:03:42.630> is<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.780> gel<00:03:43.020> liner<00:03:43.260> it's<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.709> Topshop<00:03:44.250> gel

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
liner and I quite like it it's not as

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.160 
liner and I quite like it it's not as
black<00:03:48.030> as<00:03:48.239> I'd<00:03:48.360> like<00:03:48.570> but<00:03:48.600> it's<00:03:48.930> still<00:03:49.110> a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
black as I'd like but it's still a

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.440 
black as I'd like but it's still a
lovely<00:03:49.620> gel<00:03:49.860> liner<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.850> I'm<00:03:50.970> doing<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.300> on

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
lovely gel liner and I'm doing that on

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.610 
lovely gel liner and I'm doing that on
both<00:03:51.630> sides<00:03:51.980> obviously<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:54.170> then<00:03:55.170> once<00:03:55.440> we

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
both sides obviously and then once we

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.100 
both sides obviously and then once we
have<00:03:55.770> done<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.010> we<00:03:56.700> can<00:03:56.730> what<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:57.600> wanted<00:03:58.020> to

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
have done that we can what I wanted to

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.199 
have done that we can what I wanted to
go<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.290> with<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.590> lighter<00:03:58.800> pink<00:03:59.130> in<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.730> sort<00:04:00.090> of

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
go in with a lighter pink in the sort of

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.750 
go in with a lighter pink in the sort of
center<00:04:00.600> pi<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.020> crease<00:04:01.290> just<00:04:01.560> because<00:04:02.550> I

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
center pi of the crease just because I

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.760 
center pi of the crease just because I
wanted<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.060> keep<00:04:03.270> it<00:04:03.390> bright<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.750> awake<00:04:04.500> and

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
wanted to keep it bright and awake and

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.920 
wanted to keep it bright and awake and
then<00:04:05.100> it's<00:04:05.220> going<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.430> curl<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.760> lashes<00:04:05.930> and

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
then it's going to curl the lashes and

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.300 
then it's going to curl the lashes and
apply<00:04:07.260> our<00:04:07.800> mascara<00:04:08.520> as<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.830> course<00:04:10.860> we

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
apply our mascara as so and of course we

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.650 
apply our mascara as so and of course we
want<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.550> do<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.760> on<00:04:11.850> both<00:04:11.880> eyes<00:04:12.270> as<00:04:12.510> well

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
want to do that on both eyes as well

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.909 
want to do that on both eyes as well
because<00:04:13.020> we<00:04:13.170> don't<00:04:13.380> want<00:04:13.739> odd-eyes

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.229
