00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:04.770
 There is an error indication and will pass through all systems 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.300
 Offer is by the sale of fixed of Taiwan and Taiwan 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.929
 Kao is awake-scribus 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.740
 It is raising the price in the utilization of the Entrada 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.220
 So more than a kilometer provided 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.619
 I will introduce you how to make it easy 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.480

 We want to make Aoba Ward function 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.710
 Raw previous model 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.380
 It's because everyone is familiar 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.380
 With condensed milk 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.630
 These four 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.020
 Mix and make while scraping ice 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.970
 It is like shaved ice 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.900
 Let's make it 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.900
 Imitating 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.420
 In and out

 Amango Rogoro 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.840
 Possibility of writing 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.840
 Enter the number 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.070
 Some people write it here 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 Condensed milk 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.960
 Honey for that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960
 I will do it for a while 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.800
 Affirming the same audition 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.130
 So far so far 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.320
 How to make performer Ikiri-cho was uniquely related 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.570
 Overturn 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.570

 I will do my best like this 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.759
 I talked with the same exercise 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.759

 Let's ask the Lord this season 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.290
 The objection seems to be the yellow of the root number 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.599
 It's easy to do so when you talk 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.429
 Do not you think it is strange 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.959
 Spring lies 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.499
 Well then today is my friend's 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:53.119
 Tezuka-san, I'm asking you to come from the beginning of the year and eat it 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:54.589
 Let's eat 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:55.970
 Set the same version 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.389
