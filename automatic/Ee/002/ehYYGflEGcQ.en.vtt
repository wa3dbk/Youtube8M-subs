00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.789 

thanks<00:00:03.070> to<00:00:03.159> card<00:00:03.400> fan<00:00:03.639> I<00:00:04.509> like<00:00:05.230> to<00:00:05.259> look<00:00:05.529> at<00:00:05.709> my

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:05.799 
thanks to card fan I like to look at my

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.690 
thanks to card fan I like to look at my
dress<00:00:06.009> as<00:00:06.189> well<00:00:06.370> and<00:00:06.779> are<00:00:07.779> two<00:00:07.959> years<00:00:08.080> old<00:00:08.290> and

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
dress as well and are two years old and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.670 
dress as well and are two years old and
I<00:00:09.700> think<00:00:10.210> that<00:00:10.570> it's<00:00:10.750> mostly<00:00:11.170> maintenance

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:11.680 
I think that it's mostly maintenance

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.089 
I think that it's mostly maintenance
that<00:00:12.130> helps<00:00:12.640> them<00:00:13.230> look<00:00:14.230> good<00:00:16.769> but<00:00:17.769> then<00:00:17.980> again

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
that helps them look good but then again

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.130 
that helps them look good but then again
it's<00:00:18.580> also<00:00:18.880> your<00:00:19.060> hair<00:00:19.269> type<00:00:19.449> it's<00:00:19.929> going<00:00:20.109> to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
it's also your hair type it's going to

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.470 
it's also your hair type it's going to
be<00:00:20.470> a<00:00:20.499> big<00:00:20.769> factor<00:00:22.079> and<00:00:23.339> time<00:00:24.339> as<00:00:24.579> well<00:00:24.759> for<00:00:25.449> I

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
be a big factor and time as well for I

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.599 
be a big factor and time as well for I
don't<00:00:25.689> want<00:00:25.900> to<00:00:25.990> say<00:00:26.079> that<00:00:26.289> because<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
don't want to say that because the

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.669 
don't want to say that because the
neglect<00:00:28.060> method<00:00:28.480> you<00:00:28.749> can<00:00:28.900> get<00:00:29.109> dreads<00:00:29.380> and

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:29.679 
neglect method you can get dreads and

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.290 
neglect method you can get dreads and
they<00:00:29.800> don't<00:00:29.890> look<00:00:30.070> good<00:00:30.249> for<00:00:30.489> a<00:00:30.519> long<00:00:30.730> time<00:00:30.999> if

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
they don't look good for a long time if

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.420 
they don't look good for a long time if
I<00:00:31.419> did<00:00:31.599> that<00:00:31.630> way<00:00:31.960> that<00:00:32.410> mine<00:00:32.680> wouldn't<00:00:33.250> even

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
I did that way that mine wouldn't even

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.670 
I did that way that mine wouldn't even
look<00:00:33.550> this<00:00:33.789> good<00:00:33.969> right<00:00:34.270> now<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:35.469> then

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
look this good right now so then

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.770 
look this good right now so then
obviously<00:00:36.070> maintenance<00:00:36.850> is<00:00:37.030> playing<00:00:37.600> a<00:00:37.750> role

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
obviously maintenance is playing a role

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
obviously maintenance is playing a role
in<00:00:38.109> this<00:00:38.260> but<00:00:39.449> it's<00:00:40.449> not<00:00:40.660> just<00:00:41.050> maintenance

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
in this but it's not just maintenance

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.490 
in this but it's not just maintenance
and<00:00:42.850> I<00:00:42.940> say<00:00:43.120> that<00:00:43.149> because<00:00:43.390> I<00:00:43.899> did<00:00:44.199> a<00:00:44.230> lot<00:00:44.440> of

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
and I say that because I did a lot of

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.700 
and I say that because I did a lot of
maintenance<00:00:44.769> when<00:00:45.100> they<00:00:45.219> were<00:00:45.280> young<00:00:45.730> and<00:00:46.710> it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
maintenance when they were young and it

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.669 
maintenance when they were young and it
still<00:00:48.219> took<00:00:48.550> about<00:00:48.969> a<00:00:49.120> year<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.600> get<00:00:49.929> them<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.649> a

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
still took about a year to get them to a

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.130 
still took about a year to get them to a
good<00:00:51.250> looking<00:00:51.850> like<00:00:52.090> till<00:00:52.359> I<00:00:52.390> was<00:00:52.690> really

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
good looking like till I was really

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.959 
good looking like till I was really
happy<00:00:53.320> with<00:00:53.589> them<00:00:54.089> so<00:00:55.859> time<00:00:56.859> it's<00:00:57.640> going<00:00:57.879> to

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
happy with them so time it's going to

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.669 
happy with them so time it's going to
take<00:00:58.120> time<00:00:58.359> regardless<00:00:59.260> of<00:00:59.410> how<00:00:59.530> much

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
take time regardless of how much

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.970 
take time regardless of how much
maintenance<00:00:59.920> you<00:01:00.249> do<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.629> me<00:01:02.469> and<00:01:02.530> this<00:01:02.679> helps

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
maintenance you do but me and this helps

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.259 
maintenance you do but me and this helps
a<00:01:03.070> lot<00:01:03.219> because<00:01:03.519> if<00:01:03.699> I<00:01:03.820> didn't<00:01:04.059> do<00:01:04.120> any

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
a lot because if I didn't do any

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.819 
a lot because if I didn't do any
maintenance<00:01:04.420> I'm<00:01:04.870> sure<00:01:05.080> my<00:01:05.379> hair<00:01:05.560> would<00:01:05.710> not

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
maintenance I'm sure my hair would not

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.240 
maintenance I'm sure my hair would not
look<00:01:05.950> as<00:01:06.100> good<00:01:06.220> as<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.460> does<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:08.250> that's

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
look as good as it does so that's

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.249 
look as good as it does so that's
basically<00:01:09.490> it<00:01:10.799> do<00:01:11.799> maintenance<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.360> time<00:01:13.869> is

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
basically it do maintenance but time is

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.179 
basically it do maintenance but time is
ultimately<00:01:15.299> necessary<00:01:16.299> as<00:01:16.450> well<00:01:17.189> Illinois

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
ultimately necessary as well Illinois

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
it along at least um but like I said

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.140 
it along at least um but like I said
there<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.120> going<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.930> point<00:03:17.120> like<00:03:18.120> a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
there is going to be a point like a

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.680 
there is going to be a point like a
mound<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:19.020> hair<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.530> does<00:03:19.890> not<00:03:20.040> read<00:03:20.280> up<00:03:20.430> and

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
mound of hair that does not read up and

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.260 
mound of hair that does not read up and
just<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.930> can't<00:03:22.140> have<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.709> for<00:03:23.640> my<00:03:23.850> dread<00:03:24.090> out

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
just you can't have it for my dread out

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.760 
just you can't have it for my dread out
of<00:03:24.390> your<00:03:24.540> head<00:03:24.720> it's<00:03:25.080> just<00:03:25.290> what<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.470> doesn't

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
of your head it's just what it doesn't

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.320 
of your head it's just what it doesn't
work<00:03:25.860> that<00:03:25.890> way<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:29.070> clockwise<00:03:29.520> method<00:03:30.120> is

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
work that way so the clockwise method is

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.280 
work that way so the clockwise method is
the<00:03:31.230> most<00:03:31.650> widely<00:03:32.400> known<00:03:32.820> method<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.170> is

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
the most widely known method and this is

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.949 
the most widely known method and this is
what<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.560> do<00:03:34.709> just<00:03:35.459> take<00:03:35.520> your<00:03:35.760> dread<00:03:36.030> my

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
what you do just take your dread my

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.260 
what you do just take your dread my
dread<00:03:37.200> starts<00:03:37.560> about<00:03:37.800> right<00:03:38.640> here<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.239> you

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
dread starts about right here and you

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.920 
dread starts about right here and you
just<00:03:39.660> rub<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:39.959> in<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.440> circle<00:03:40.709> like<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.220> and

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
just rub it in a circle like this and

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.080 
just rub it in a circle like this and
what<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:42.959> think<00:03:43.320> is<00:03:43.470> going<00:03:43.709> on<00:03:43.860> as<00:03:44.550> you're<00:03:44.970> doing

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
what I think is going on as you're doing

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.630 
what I think is going on as you're doing
that<00:03:45.239> just<00:03:45.780> messes<00:03:46.170> about<00:03:46.470> with<00:03:47.130> like<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> loop

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
that just messes about with like a loop

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.970 
that just messes about with like a loop
of<00:03:47.760> hair<00:03:48.000> joins<00:03:48.870> with<00:03:49.080> another<00:03:49.350> loop<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.739> hair

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
of hair joins with another loop of hair

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.580 
of hair joins with another loop of hair
and<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.459> goes<00:03:50.610> through<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:51.239> then<00:03:52.020> like<00:03:52.320> see

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
and it goes through and then like see

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.810 
and it goes through and then like see
another<00:03:52.799> loop<00:03:53.070> of<00:03:53.160> hair<00:03:53.280> goes<00:03:53.459> through<00:03:53.640> there

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
another loop of hair goes through there

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.600 
another loop of hair goes through there
and<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.299> just<00:03:54.510> starts<00:03:54.840> nodding

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
and it just starts nodding

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.260 
and it just starts nodding
into<00:03:56.000> like<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.360> big<00:03:56.570> tangled<00:03:57.410> up<00:03:57.530> mess<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:58.040> hair

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
into like a big tangled up mess of hair

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.930 
into like a big tangled up mess of hair
so<00:03:59.500> basically<00:04:00.500> it's<00:04:00.590> just<00:04:00.620> friction<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.430> helps

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
so basically it's just friction it helps

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.390 
so basically it's just friction it helps
if<00:04:02.000> your<00:04:02.180> hair<00:04:02.300> is<00:04:02.330> really<00:04:02.570> clean<00:04:03.160> when<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.250> do

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
if your hair is really clean when you do

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.060 
if your hair is really clean when you do
this<00:04:04.550> I<00:04:04.760> would<00:04:05.660> don't<00:04:06.200> know<00:04:06.260> if<00:04:06.410> being<00:04:06.800> wet

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
this I would don't know if being wet

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.760 
this I would don't know if being wet
would<00:04:07.250> help<00:04:07.460> but<00:04:09.790> that's<00:04:10.790> what<00:04:10.940> I<00:04:10.970> do<00:04:11.090> I<00:04:11.770> don't

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
would help but that's what I do I don't

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.530 
would help but that's what I do I don't
do<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:12.980> often<00:04:14.200> but<00:04:15.489> that's<00:04:16.489> what<00:04:16.790> I<00:04:16.820> do<00:04:17.030> it's

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
do it often but that's what I do it's

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.880 
do it often but that's what I do it's
the<00:04:17.660> only<00:04:17.840> thing<00:04:17.989> I've<00:04:18.140> ever<00:04:18.170> done<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.680> try<00:04:18.829> to

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
the only thing I've ever done to try to

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.699 
the only thing I've ever done to try to
help<00:04:19.040> my<00:04:19.190> roots<00:04:19.430> long<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:20.630> then<00:04:20.780> generally

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
help my roots long and then generally

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.150 
help my roots long and then generally
there's<00:04:22.030> this<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.150> some<00:04:23.270> other<00:04:23.360> kind<00:04:23.780> of<00:04:24.160> this

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
there's this is some other kind of this

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.530 
there's this is some other kind of this
is<00:04:25.280> what<00:04:25.400> I<00:04:25.460> do<00:04:25.520> when<00:04:25.730> I<00:04:25.820> wash<00:04:26.000> my<00:04:26.240> hair<00:04:26.360> in<00:04:26.450> the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
is what I do when I wash my hair in the

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.230 
is what I do when I wash my hair in the
shower<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:27.020> stuff<00:04:27.340> but<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.400> just<00:04:28.640> take<00:04:28.790> like<00:04:28.970> my

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
shower and stuff but I just take like my

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.450 
shower and stuff but I just take like my
hand<00:04:29.450> put<00:04:29.660> it<00:04:29.690> on<00:04:29.870> my<00:04:30.020> head<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.410> then<00:04:31.190> do<00:04:31.340> the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
hand put it on my head and then do the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.030 
hand put it on my head and then do the
same<00:04:31.490> circle<00:04:32.419> motion<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:33.590> will<00:04:33.680> kind<00:04:33.830> of

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
same circle motion and it will kind of

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.190 
same circle motion and it will kind of
do<00:04:34.220> them<00:04:34.370> all<00:04:34.550> at<00:04:34.580> once<00:04:34.730> you<00:04:35.540> can<00:04:35.750> kind<00:04:35.930> of<00:04:36.050> see

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
do them all at once you can kind of see

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.950 
do them all at once you can kind of see
how<00:04:36.410> like<00:04:37.280> all<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.760> these<00:04:37.910> are<00:04:38.090> going<00:04:38.330> at<00:04:38.720> once

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
how like all of these are going at once

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.620 
how like all of these are going at once
right<00:04:39.680> now<00:04:39.940> that's<00:04:40.940> how<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.090> can<00:04:41.270> do<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.480> with

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
right now that's how you can do it with

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.830 
right now that's how you can do it with
a<00:04:41.900> larger<00:04:42.530> sections<00:04:42.950> over<00:04:43.190> here<00:04:43.430> but<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.510> just

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
a larger sections over here but I just

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.800 
a larger sections over here but I just
wrecked<00:04:45.020> mine<00:04:45.169> just<00:04:45.800> go<00:04:45.890> like<00:04:46.010> this<00:04:46.540> just<00:04:47.540> move

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
wrecked mine just go like this just move

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.200 
wrecked mine just go like this just move
your<00:04:47.840> hair<00:04:48.290> around<00:04:48.710> that's<00:04:49.190> basically<00:04:49.820> what

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
your hair around that's basically what

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.240 
your hair around that's basically what
it<00:04:50.240> is<00:04:50.330> it's<00:04:50.690> your<00:04:51.080> hair<00:04:51.260> moving<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.830> friction

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
it is it's your hair moving the friction

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.970 
it is it's your hair moving the friction
on<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.700> it<00:04:53.240> just<00:04:53.510> allows<00:04:53.780> more<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.740> loops

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
on it it just allows more of the loops

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.940 
on it it just allows more of the loops
to<00:04:55.160> open<00:04:55.550> like<00:04:56.090> as<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.480> pull<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:56.780> welage<00:04:57.770> it

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
to open like as you pull it welage it

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.620 
to open like as you pull it welage it
this<00:04:58.130> way<00:04:58.310> this<00:04:58.610> hair<00:04:58.850> is<00:04:58.880> tight<00:04:59.180> and<00:04:59.360> straight

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
this way this hair is tight and straight

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.540 
this way this hair is tight and straight
of<00:04:59.840> these<00:05:00.020> hairs<00:05:00.290> are<00:05:00.530> loose<00:05:00.770> when<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:01.400> push

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
of these hairs are loose when you push

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.550 
of these hairs are loose when you push
it<00:05:01.669> this<00:05:01.790> way<00:05:01.970> it's<00:05:02.120> got<00:05:02.240> lots<00:05:02.360> of<00:05:02.570> loops<00:05:02.810> and

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
it this way it's got lots of loops and

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.159 
it this way it's got lots of loops and
you<00:05:03.650> can<00:05:03.800> go<00:05:03.890> like<00:05:04.010> this<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:04.490> hopefully<00:05:05.330> lots

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
you can go like this and hopefully lots

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.630 
you can go like this and hopefully lots
of<00:05:06.380> things<00:05:06.530> will<00:05:06.680> start<00:05:06.860> looping<00:05:07.100> in<00:05:07.430> together

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
of things will start looping in together

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.960 
of things will start looping in together
and<00:05:08.090> forming<00:05:08.510> a<00:05:08.780> dread<00:05:09.560> so<00:05:10.160> that's<00:05:10.400> that's<00:05:10.700> my

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
and forming a dread so that's that's my

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.690 
and forming a dread so that's that's my
theory<00:05:11.360> behind<00:05:11.570> it<00:05:11.950> that's<00:05:12.950> just<00:05:13.310> what<00:05:13.669> you

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
theory behind it that's just what you

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.830 
theory behind it that's just what you
had<00:05:13.880> to<00:05:14.000> just<00:05:14.210> kind<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.360> move<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.660> roots

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
had to just kind of move the roots

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.650 
had to just kind of move the roots
around<00:05:14.990> so<00:05:15.470> just<00:05:15.880> like<00:05:16.880> that<00:05:19.419> get<00:05:20.419> them<00:05:20.540> all

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
around so just like that get them all

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.219 
around so just like that get them all
nice<00:05:20.979> that's<00:05:21.979> it<00:05:22.220> basically<00:05:22.700> I<00:05:23.300> find<00:05:23.780> when<00:05:24.169> I

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
nice that's it basically I find when I

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.340 
nice that's it basically I find when I
do<00:05:24.350> it<00:05:24.530> like<00:05:24.710> this<00:05:24.890> i<00:05:25.130> can<00:05:25.430> tell<00:05:25.729> that<00:05:26.000> is<00:05:26.350> that

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
do it like this i can tell that is that

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.920 
do it like this i can tell that is that
it's<00:05:27.530> got<00:05:27.680> a<00:05:28.210> little<00:05:29.210> bit<00:05:29.450> more<00:05:29.600> of<00:05:29.750> like<00:05:29.900> a

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
it's got a little bit more of like a

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.780 
it's got a little bit more of like a
thickness<00:05:30.260> to<00:05:30.620> it<00:05:30.650> that<00:05:30.919> has<00:05:31.010> kind<00:05:31.250> of<00:05:31.400> dreaded

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
thickness to it that has kind of dreaded

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.240 
thickness to it that has kind of dreaded
in<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:31.970> middle<00:05:32.260> that's<00:05:33.260> about<00:05:33.590> it<00:05:33.620> if<00:05:33.919> you

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
in the middle that's about it if you

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.370 
in the middle that's about it if you
really<00:05:34.460> wanted<00:05:34.820> to<00:05:34.880> as<00:05:35.120> well<00:05:35.150> I<00:05:35.720> guess<00:05:36.050> you

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
really wanted to as well I guess you

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.580 
really wanted to as well I guess you
could<00:05:36.410> use<00:05:36.740> to<00:05:36.979> crochet<00:05:37.400> hook<00:05:37.960> I<00:05:38.960> don't<00:05:39.410> really

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
could use to crochet hook I don't really

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.990 
could use to crochet hook I don't really
know<00:05:39.770> how<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:39.950> do<00:05:40.100> this<00:05:40.250> I<00:05:40.460> find<00:05:40.669> it<00:05:40.790> difficult

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
know how to do this I find it difficult

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.450 
know how to do this I find it difficult
but<00:05:41.780> a<00:05:41.960> blog<00:05:42.229> people<00:05:42.530> just<00:05:42.710> take<00:05:42.830> it<00:05:43.040> poking

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
but a blog people just take it poking

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.620 
but a blog people just take it poking
around<00:05:43.550> kind<00:05:44.000> of<00:05:44.030> and<00:05:44.240> move<00:05:44.419> it<00:05:44.540> around

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
around kind of and move it around

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.780 
around kind of and move it around
basically<00:05:45.620> doing<00:05:45.800> when<00:05:46.070> I<00:05:46.100> was<00:05:46.190> just<00:05:46.490> talking

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
basically doing when I was just talking

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.090 
basically doing when I was just talking
about<00:05:46.850> like<00:05:47.630> you<00:05:48.200> take<00:05:48.440> a<00:05:48.470> little<00:05:48.650> bit<00:05:48.830> of<00:05:48.890> hair

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
about like you take a little bit of hair

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.710 
about like you take a little bit of hair
and<00:05:49.220> move<00:05:49.430> it<00:05:49.550> over<00:05:49.640> another<00:05:49.970> piece<00:05:50.240> and<00:05:50.450> just

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
and move it over another piece and just

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.400 
and move it over another piece and just
keep<00:05:51.110> moving<00:05:51.290> around<00:05:51.590> until<00:05:52.130> it<00:05:52.220> gets<00:05:52.370> tangled

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
keep moving around until it gets tangled

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.570 
keep moving around until it gets tangled
it's<00:05:54.410> kind<00:05:54.650> of<00:05:54.710> like<00:05:54.919> if<00:05:55.130> you<00:05:55.220> play<00:05:55.400> video

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
it's kind of like if you play video

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.719 
it's kind of like if you play video
games<00:05:55.760> and<00:05:56.680> you've<00:05:57.680> got<00:05:57.830> a<00:05:57.890> lot<00:05:58.070> of<00:05:58.100> controller

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
games and you've got a lot of controller

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.150 
games and you've got a lot of controller
wires<00:05:59.090> if<00:05:59.960> you<00:06:00.140> really<00:06:00.320> organized<00:06:00.800> person

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
wires if you really organized person

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.400 
wires if you really organized person
this<00:06:01.460> doesn't<00:06:01.729> happen<00:06:01.850> to<00:06:02.150> you<00:06:02.240> but<00:06:02.510> if<00:06:03.290> you're

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
this doesn't happen to you but if you're

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.990 
this doesn't happen to you but if you're
like<00:06:03.620> you're<00:06:04.190> anything<00:06:04.370> like<00:06:04.580> me<00:06:04.640> and<00:06:04.880> my

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.089 
like you're anything like me and my
brothers<00:06:05.419> when<00:06:06.260> we're<00:06:06.380> done<00:06:06.500> playing<00:06:06.710> we<00:06:06.950> just

brothers when we're done playing we just

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:08.550 
brothers when we're done playing we just
dropped<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:07.490> controller<00:06:07.580> on<00:06:08.000> the<00:06:08.060> ground

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
dropped the controller on the ground

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.530 
dropped the controller on the ground

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
pick it up again and sooner or later

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.770 
pick it up again and sooner or later
there's<00:06:10.840> just<00:06:10.990> a<00:06:11.080> giant<00:06:11.470> mess<00:06:11.950> of<00:06:12.310> like<00:06:13.150> thick

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
there's just a giant mess of like thick

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.780 
there's just a giant mess of like thick
like<00:06:13.990> connecting<00:06:14.620> wires<00:06:15.280> and<00:06:15.520> you<00:06:15.580> don't<00:06:15.730> know

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
like connecting wires and you don't know

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.460 
like connecting wires and you don't know
how<00:06:15.940> it<00:06:16.090> happened<00:06:16.150> it's<00:06:16.870> just<00:06:17.110> because<00:06:17.260> it

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
how it happened it's just because it

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.940 
how it happened it's just because it
loops<00:06:17.680> got<00:06:17.950> attached<00:06:18.220> with<00:06:18.639> loops<00:06:18.910> and<00:06:19.950> catch

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
loops got attached with loops and catch

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.190 
loops got attached with loops and catch
my<00:06:21.130> drift<00:06:21.460> so<00:06:22.200> that's<00:06:23.200> how<00:06:23.350> I<00:06:23.860> would<00:06:24.250> do<00:06:24.400> it<00:06:25.200> in
