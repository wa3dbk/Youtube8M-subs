00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.080
 the world is becoming more defenseless 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.930
 in front of microbes and molds 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.510
 yakbi the human eye, they are able 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.510
 seriously reduce the number 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.359
 world population 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.909
 in any living 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:15.959
 according to plan 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.349
 in the research center since 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.339
 there are bacteria that 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.339
 harm human health 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.789
 accordingly there is a virus which 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.000
 killing these bacteria helps a person 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 you will recover that people died 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.800
 structure volume 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.100
 called bacteriophage 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.840
 in Greek 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.500
 bacteri eaters 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.570
 bacteriophage size not more than 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.570
 twenty nanometers 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.600
 to live and breed 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.080
 bacteria but because we want 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.120
 pathogenic bacteria but also a cell 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.070
 what period does fact find a cage 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.400
 host 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.300
 attached to it 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300
 peak squirts to its victims 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.870
 50 heads of sheep 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.870
 new bashkiria 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.030
 etc 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.520
 not completely destroyed 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.979
 populations such as microorganisms and 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.280
 once excreted from the host they 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.950
 suggest the site 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.990
 also he 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.030
 hyundai i40 marshes 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.260
 is she 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 there until the moment they 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.210
 animal or the first three people they are 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.070
 enters the body again 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.220
 if antibiotics are powerful weapons 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.430
 large caliber driving 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.040
 this week self-guided 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.270
 weapons 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.890
 nanotechnology invented by nature 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 long before the earth appeared 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.450
 antibiotic he never knew intensified 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.250
 operation 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.920
 defense 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 we will remind oao bacteriophages 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.580
 not established that 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.700
 he can tv worked out counted 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.490
 This is true 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.560
 fight of two 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.149
 first let's say itâ€™s as if 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:12.699
 then she worked for it 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.359
 shelf stability
