00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
terrific at that and that's the reason

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.130 
terrific at that and that's the reason
he<00:01:12.990> was<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> valuable<00:01:13.740> player<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:15.049> you<00:01:16.049> know

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
he was a valuable player on you know

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.840

teams<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.619> won<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.950> than<00:01:16.979> they<00:01:17.250> lost<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
teams that won more than they lost and

teams that won more than they lost and
big<00:01:18.540> winners<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.350> there's<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.560> reason<00:01:19.950> for

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
big winners and there's a reason for

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.539 
big winners and there's a reason for
that<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.630> look<00:01:22.470> at<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.890> look<00:01:23.400> at
