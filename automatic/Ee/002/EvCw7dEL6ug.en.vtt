00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
this once this comes together really

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.390

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
okay you can't get too much heat in this

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.749 
okay you can't get too much heat in this
because<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> whole<00:01:23.040> reason<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.670> making

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
because it's the whole reason for making

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.700 
because it's the whole reason for making
it<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.390> more<00:01:24.630> heat<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> more<00:01:25.049> beer<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.500> drink
