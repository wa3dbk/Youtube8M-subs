00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.230
 comfortable 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.360

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.090
 doing it well one of the smartphones 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.350
 most powerful in the market 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.710

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.110
 we have here the device on 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.210
 razer and 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.660
 here we see that it is where the 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.660
 smartphone 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.180

 the charger 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.799
 contains a usb and a minimum is seen 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.289
 its respective manual and a mile to 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.340
 that is a good child is a and already serves 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.239
 so you can simply help out 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.190
 the micro sd of the mobile phone and the 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.780
 sim card that by the way is a 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.060
 sim sim card and good 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.270
 to continue with the unboxing we are going to 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.640
 show a little the smartphone in aqsiq 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.550
 we have here our mobile device 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.430
 let's learn to proceed to 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.129
 learn it 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.560
 and we proceed to put our good cup 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:45.750
 already on the mobile device we see that 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:51.300
 It has pretty good interfaces 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.980

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.010
 amount of games on the device 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:04.840

 in front of his manjar version of a 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.050
 visitor of 13,000 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.340
 and it would be everything to go online 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.140
 I usually wanted 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.680
 that they knew that I already have a device 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.849
 new mobile and that I'm going to write now 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.209
 apps how to install videos 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.370
 applications from a device and 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.269
 well that would be all until the next 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.269
