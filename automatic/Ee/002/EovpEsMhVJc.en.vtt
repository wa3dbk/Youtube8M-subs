00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.539 
I survived that so picking pot well it
looks<00:03:56.670> like<00:03:56.870> took<00:03:57.870> about<00:03:58.049> 45<00:03:58.470> minutes<00:03:59.129> I've

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
looks like took about 45 minutes I've

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.960 
looks like took about 45 minutes I've
got<00:03:59.730> about

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
got about

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.970 
got about
fifteen<00:04:01.780> gallons<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.350> water<00:04:02.500> in<00:04:02.770> there<00:04:02.950> I

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
fifteen gallons of water in there I

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.880 
fifteen gallons of water in there I
guess<00:04:04.740> Strutt<00:04:05.740> come<00:04:06.070> to<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> boil<00:04:06.640> so<00:04:07.590> we<00:04:08.590> boil

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
guess Strutt come to a boil so we boil

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.280 
guess Strutt come to a boil so we boil
it<00:04:09.070> up<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.310> then<00:04:09.670> let<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.210> simmer<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.960> see<00:04:11.170> how

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
it up and then let it simmer and see how

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.910 
it up and then let it simmer and see how
long<00:04:11.470> this<00:04:11.710> takes<00:04:12.420> stick<00:04:13.420> around<00:04:13.800> I'm<00:04:14.800> going
