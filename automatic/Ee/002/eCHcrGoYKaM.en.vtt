00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:11.010
 so and now after the florentine the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.450
 crisp nutcracker that's in principle 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.300
 Actually, that's the only thing I have 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:22.080
 modified to this we need sugar 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.619
 butter cream and here I have one 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.660
 sweet syrup that is called nico zero da can 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:33.980
 but you also take honey and then 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.559
 Hazelnuts are also peeled almonds 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.500
 possible the hazelnut similar first 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.559
 be peeled short in hofen 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.420
 lightly roast and then peel 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.059
 remove and the beautiful raussuchen the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.170
 then you can change something else 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:00.750
 use and as usual sugar butter 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:08.420
 cream and then still thinks the courses 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:10.770
 syrup or even without boil for the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.680
 sweet syrup I would have best 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.000
 taken a spoon 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.080
 but I'm used to it 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.409
 been with the wet hands of the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.619
 the bucket rauszuholen but what the heck 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:30.750
 I would have happened already and like the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:33.119
 foal tina in sugar boil so far 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.240
 la big and then the nuts come 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.170
 Here I would have something more 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.720
 must be able to give this could do more 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.979
 had any sugar and also had space 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.659
 small ones again with four to five 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.880
 have to 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:54.360
 You can also almonds very well 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.229
 So take peeled almonds might 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.130
 something the almonds and 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:08.130
 then again in the oven at 150 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:13.310
 to bake slowly 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:19.610
 push while it is still hot 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:23.130
 that means hurry up and the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.790
 cookie cutter I always take that at 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:31.740
 dip in cold water or in water 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:36.330
 so that nothing works on cancer and speedy 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:39.120
 Finally, the sugar is fixed again 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.690
 and then as you can not see here 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.690
 more so right 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.510
 then everything comes again if it's 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.330
 would like to be pushed together in the oven 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:56.480
 a true beautiful golden yellow 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:59.940
 color then pushed together again 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:08.100
 make nice heaps now it's on 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:11.640
 push the end to and then from the sheet metal and 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:16.110
 let cool and as with the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:22.380
 Florentine temper the couverture 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:29.190
 that means 30 degrees no longer thin 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:31.050
 paint and then insert as I 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.840
 have done both together 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.190
 florentine and the nutcracker is 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.360
 now, of course, everything comes at once 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:45.870
 In addition, it is basically more 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.920
 or less the same must then must 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:54.170
 among other things for ent treatment 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.360
 Of course you can also have a cake glaze 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.140
 that is but 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:04.170
 not so true and the taste 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:08.790
 that's why you'd rather have a couverture or one 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:12.240
 good did bitter chocolate that's up 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.640
 any case who wants a lot better 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.960
 then the floor again with the brush 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.520
 rubbing gives a nice 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:25.810
 graduation 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:29.690
 and then looks very nice and 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:35.090
 then succeed again 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:38.750
 Have fun imitating and you know 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.240
 yes the thumb up and with a 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.080
 abo page always up to date, it 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.620
 there are still some things to come and that 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.630
 everything without annoying advertising in between 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.630
 that is promised 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.630
 bye
