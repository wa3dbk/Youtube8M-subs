00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:23.300
 one of the most beautiful messages of the Bible is 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.140
 the letter of Paul to the Corinthians who speaks 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.750
 of love 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.289
 if I had the gift of speaking in other 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.689
 languages without having unlearned 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.800
 and if you could speak in any language 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:41.390
 that is in the earth and even in the sky but not 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.149
 had love since my words would be 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.470
 like a good noise or the sound of 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.290
 teaching could have the tone of 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.960
 God's messages have all 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.920
 knowledge and understanding of all 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:05.210
 secrets and have so much faith to the point of 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:09.939
 the mountains and the south we had not 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.939
 My love would not be the date 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.829
 if I could give to the poor all that I have 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.440
 and even surrender my body to 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:26.930
 be burned but not have love 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:32.270
 This does not mean that there was anything 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:36.530
 ian amba is very patient points 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.120
 who is neither jealous nor proud nor 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.460
 vai 12 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:48.650
 who loves is not cruising or selfish 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:51.440
 one gets angry neither guards 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.280
 who loves is not happy when someone 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.650
 does a wrong thing but if the rule 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.650
 when someone does what's right 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.770
 who loves never gives up 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.770
 but beareth all things with faith hope and 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.770
 patience 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.970
 love is eternal 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.980
 there are spiritual messages but 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.989
 little has existed the gift of speaking in 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.720
 Foreign languages will soon be over. 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:36.080
 there is the knowledge but it will end 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.610
 also because our gifts of 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:44.049
 knowledge and our messages 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.049
 exist only in part 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:56.090
 but when it comes what is third 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:58.819
 the dis are already part will appear 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.690
 as a child my way to 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.430
 speak of feeling and thinking was 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.160
 boy 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.380
 now that I'm already a man 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:16.050
 I walked over these childish things 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:21.130
 What we now see is a common image 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:24.960
 imperfect the mirror and past 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:29.500
 But the day will come when we will see it. 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.060
 fully face to face 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:38.020
 all that would be now is obscure 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:41.680
 confused but then I will see everything with 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.890
 clarity as clearly as God is 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:51.340
 seeing the inside of my 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:57.850
 now three hearts remain. 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:04.410
 things faith hope and love 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.410
 but the greatest of these is love 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.900
 what has been said thank you
