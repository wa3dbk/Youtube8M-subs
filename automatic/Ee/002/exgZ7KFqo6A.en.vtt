Micro Machines says X concepts for 6
plus<00:00:15.470> and<00:00:16.470> it's<00:00:16.590> nano<00:00:16.859> speed<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.490> shows<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> fire

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
plus and it's nano speed it shows a fire

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.810 
plus and it's nano speed it shows a fire
truck<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.920> they're<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:20.100> basically<00:00:20.490> pulled

truck and they're just basically pulled
back<00:00:21.000> cars<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.930> that's<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.980> names<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.400> the

and here as you can see is a nano
utility<00:00:55.860> cars<00:00:56.820> they're<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.870> Micro

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
utility cars they're kind of like Micro

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.619 
utility cars they're kind of like Micro
Machines<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.859> mentioned<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.090> here's<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
Machines as I mentioned and here's the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.780 
Machines as I mentioned and here's the
fire<00:01:00.840> truck<00:01:02.930> right<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.309> is<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> front<00:01:05.700> of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
fire truck right there is the front of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.780 
fire truck right there is the front of
it<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.840> kind<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.140> looks<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.500> Pierce<00:01:07.950> fire

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
it it kind of looks like a Pierce fire

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.340 
it it kind of looks like a Pierce fire
truck<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.470> looks<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.310> back<00:01:11.460> in

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
truck so it looks like on the back in

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.560 
truck so it looks like on the back in
the<00:01:13.350> top<00:01:13.560> even<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.400> light<00:01:14.640> bars<00:01:14.880> are<00:01:15.090> painted

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:17.790 

that<00:02:08.770> one<00:02:09.770> that<00:02:09.920> one<00:02:09.980> just<00:02:10.280> jumped<00:02:16.000> with<00:02:17.000> that

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
that one that one just jumped with that

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.290 
that one that one just jumped with that
and<00:02:18.800> that's<00:02:19.010> pretty<00:02:19.280> much<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.610> that's<00:02:19.910> what

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
and that's pretty much it that's what

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.060 
and that's pretty much it that's what
they<00:02:20.480> do

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
they do

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.040 
they do
like<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.190> said<00:02:22.460> there<00:02:22.730> they're<00:02:23.210> like<00:02:23.360> mini

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
like I said there they're like mini

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.520 
like I said there they're like mini
pullback<00:02:24.680> cars<00:02:25.480> with<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.510> micro<00:02:26.900> machine<00:02:27.200> size

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
pullback cars with a micro machine size

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.920 
pullback cars with a micro machine size
to<00:02:27.860> them<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:29.000> think<00:02:29.060> they're<00:02:29.420> worth<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
to them and I think they're worth the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.660 
to them and I think they're worth the
money<00:02:32.020> but<00:02:33.020> if<00:02:33.200> it's<00:02:33.530> more<00:02:33.950> for<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.340> people

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
money but if it's more for the people

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.070 
money but if it's more for the people
that<00:02:34.850> kind<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.140> micro<00:02:36.470> sized<00:02:36.680> cars

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
that kind of like the micro sized cars

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.830 
that kind of like the micro sized cars
but<00:02:39.080> if<00:02:39.290> if<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.890> like<00:02:40.240> miniature<00:02:41.240> versions<00:02:41.690> of

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
but if if you like miniature versions of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.710 
but if if you like miniature versions of
cars<00:02:42.110> even<00:02:42.740> I<00:02:43.280> think<00:02:43.430> Hot<00:02:43.850> Wheels<00:02:44.090> or<00:02:44.300> diecast

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
cars even I think Hot Wheels or diecast

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.170 
cars even I think Hot Wheels or diecast
collectors<00:02:45.320> might<00:02:45.500> like<00:02:45.740> these<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.760> put<00:02:46.880> maybe

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
collectors might like these to put maybe

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.080 
collectors might like these to put maybe
in<00:02:47.450> their<00:02:47.830> H<00:02:48.830> o<00:02:49.070> scale<00:02:50.110> train<00:02:51.110> sets<00:02:51.550> maybe<00:02:52.550> to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
in their H o scale train sets maybe to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.200 
in their H o scale train sets maybe to
save<00:02:53.660> on<00:02:53.870> cost<00:02:54.170> because<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.770> chav<00:02:55.070> scale<00:02:55.400> size

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
save on cost because a chav scale size

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.920 
save on cost because a chav scale size
