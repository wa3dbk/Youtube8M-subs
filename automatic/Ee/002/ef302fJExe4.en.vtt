the cyan well it should be 24 hi like
you<00:01:09.180> know<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.869> count<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.200> that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
you know if you if you count all that

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.380 
you know if you if you count all that

together so 24 a high total but when you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.570 
together so 24 a high total but when you
start<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> white<00:01:12.810> wall<00:01:12.960> would<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.260> 16<00:01:13.650> hi<00:01:13.770> so

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
start the white wall would be 16 hi so

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.900 
layer and then go to the other side and
do<00:04:33.200> it<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:33.530> then<00:04:34.160> you're<00:04:34.280> just<00:04:34.310> gonna<00:04:34.460> connect

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
do it and then you're just gonna connect

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.370 
do it and then you're just gonna connect
in<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.180> back<00:04:35.390> so<00:04:35.750> it's<00:04:35.900> going<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.080> be<00:04:36.170> kind<00:04:36.290> of

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
in the back so it's going to be kind of

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.930 
in the back so it's going to be kind of
like<00:04:36.470> au<00:04:36.770> shape<00:04:36.800> if<00:04:37.220> you<00:04:37.370> if<00:04:37.700> you<00:04:37.820> guys

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
like au shape if you if you guys

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.130 
like au shape if you if you guys
understand<00:04:38.300> what<00:04:38.420> I<00:04:38.450> mean<00:04:38.480> I'm<00:04:38.720> sure<00:04:38.870> you<00:04:38.990> do

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
so right here BAM now take the yellow

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.870 
so right here BAM now take the yellow
wool<00:04:44.270> just<00:04:45.140> do<00:04:45.350> a<00:04:46.180> another<00:04:47.180> layer<00:04:47.600> real<00:04:48.140> quick

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
wool just do a another layer real quick

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.630 
wool just do a another layer real quick
so<00:04:50.410> probably<00:04:51.410> get<00:04:51.500> fast<00:04:51.830> forward<00:04:52.190> to<00:04:52.280> this<00:04:52.400> but

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
so probably get fast forward to this but

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.050 
so probably get fast forward to this but
out<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:53.900> then<00:04:54.320> just<00:04:54.470> take<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.950> sign<00:04:55.520> wall<00:04:55.820> and

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
out so then just take the sign wall and

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.700 
out so then just take the sign wall and
build<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.450> hire<00:04:56.660> again<00:04:56.810> just<00:04:57.200> continue<00:04:57.620> the

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
build to hire again just continue the

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.220 
build to hire again just continue the
outline<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:59.360> uh<00:04:59.540> that's<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:02.120> again<00:05:02.750> get

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
outline and uh that's that so again get

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.600 
outline and uh that's that so again get
fast<00:05:03.470> forwarded<00:05:03.950> but<00:05:04.100> you<00:05:04.160> guys<00:05:04.250> want<00:05:04.460> me<00:05:04.550> to
