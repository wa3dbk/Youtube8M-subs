00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 uefa has the punishment of atlÃ©tico madrid 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.310
 converted 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 no three races 300 km from 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.040
 stadium but 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.019
 wipe out thread there is a tendon orphan 100 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.030
 audience can actually do that 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.920
 nothing hey yes very very difficult we have 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.920
 when the slaves were pronounced 300 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.240
 km from madrid do have a letter 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.640
 written to the w of you say please note 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.109
 psv is also created there because we 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.820
 we are also a number of supporters 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.130
 already have a lot of preparations 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.510
 affected 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.300
 well I couldn't have done that anymore 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.830
 to do 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.079
 the ruling is that members are coming 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.450
 appealed and the ruling 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.190
 is now a competition without a home crowd 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.449
 We may not like us against the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.769
 again of saying yes but we live is 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.970
 then the know says where you should not go 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.180
 be with us 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.430
 because the msi pants just speak one 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.050
 punish and we have nothing and then 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.280
 and the only thing we can do and that 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.870
 we have done so contact is also with 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.250
 Athletes come to train as you are in 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.449
 appeal against the punishment 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.210
 The hearing heard from have it 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.430
 atletico madrid goes to greenhouse that's it 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.720
 chorus arbitration who sports so that is one 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.220
 real sports tribunal 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.660
 the but binding statement with a 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.129
 within the ruling that may day 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.470
 can make an appeal then will 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.330
 on very short-term event and then 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.100
 will athletico madrid also our interests 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.110
 also representing psv has there 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.940
 damage from by this stuff 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.440
 but what comes out we are here 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.539
 completely powerless and we are none 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.490
 party and that we say to the Uefa 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.560
 yes, but you are damaging our boys 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.320
 have not caused uefa 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.759
 so psv cannot go to the cash you have 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.759
 now some insight into how much 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.720
 supporters holes that already arguments 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.619
 plane tickets hotels have booked in 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.360
 Madrid 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.380
 approaching is a large number what the deck 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.819
 it ordered from us look at that 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.170
 characters we do not need to decrease 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.880
 we become when they can go in 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.110
 that seems clear to me 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.179
 there are some that come with the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.470
 supporters club but booked there 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.060
 there are very many who travel cheaply 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.590
 Have you booked on normal 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.539
 spoken, you can no longer travel 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.770
 Change and hotels booked 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.599
 we hotel so I think that is something 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.130
 is possible but I do not know we 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:53.929
 there are also an honor to all 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.800
 powerless and but I also think that one 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.599
 supporters will say 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.610
 maybe we will go to madrid and 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.250
 we look there, but as far as that is concerned 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.890
 the figuratively one 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.110
 a beautiful city and certainly if you have nothing 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.850
 looks back from the companies you belong to 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.390
 have paid then the chance is on that number 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.700
 three to go 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.140
 who best will probably be of moss to 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.180
 a champions league match without 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.610
 audience in such a big kill buy stadium 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.410
 doesn't seem like anything to us no we have 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.360
 that we have experienced in more often 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.350
 thought the netherlands against cyprus 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.010
 played once in the cold 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.930
 stage 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.640
 the kelt stage you that that as one 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.780
 pendant that one time maybe two 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.820
 has experienced 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.830
 it is very uncomfortable but we 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.060
 so the game must also be player 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.310
 does that influence a match yes 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.860
 anyway absolutely on the atmosphere and and on the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.000
 support especially with our live audience but 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.230
 even if things are going a bit less ours 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.570
 supporters always fall behind 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.739
 players remain standing so you go with 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.940
 well talked about supporters 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.680
 initially none 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.810
 Ajax supporters in Eindhoven are at 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.680
 psv ajax and april that is again 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.110
 reversed 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.670
 because yes it is quite the this she is there 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.470
 lighter control of the camera 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.000
 you twelve goes far 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.230
 and if you have that 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.220
 if you don't, you have to be very strong in you 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.390
 shoes are on 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.860
 I spoke against what he is preparing to appeal 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.330
 going to be the case well we have 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.150
 as adult people with the management of 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.920
 psv and ajax sat together and 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.810
 agreed that ishaq we are all going 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.550
 take measures to deal with such matters 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.890
 prevent means the 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.720
 half the number of people, so no 16100 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.610
 my heart under them will double number 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.230
 shields we take and what is very important 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.940
 is that for the future you could of 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.440
 closing with ajax if it's still 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.700
 happens once, but that does apply 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.520
 on both sides nothing is ever wrong 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.920
 happens for 5 years not know it is in 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.420
 ajax can now also figure out that swimmer de 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.840
 good supporters in quotation marks 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.960
 come along 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.640
 I hope that reaches out of the 1610 we 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.500
 we normally have that we have the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.970
 the best 800 and less so 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.470
 are taking but not with it 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.060
 the advantage is also that among the 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.310
 sports are very welcome in ajax 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.480
 so important with ajax 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.910
 And that is important as I already have 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.340
 previously told that our athletes who and 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.500
 especially the guys who are always there 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.500
 they stand in the team through thick and thin
