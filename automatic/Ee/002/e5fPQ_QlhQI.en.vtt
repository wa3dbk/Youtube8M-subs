well I mean you have a braid basically

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.620 
well I mean you have a braid basically
holding<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.170> in<00:02:15.290> place<00:02:17.230> then

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.110 

with<00:02:24.030> one<00:02:25.030> piece<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.690> synthetic<00:02:26.200> hair

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
with one piece of the synthetic hair

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.390 
with one piece of the synthetic hair
tightly<00:02:28.120> held<00:02:28.990> together<00:02:29.290> with<00:02:29.590> your<00:02:30.070> braids

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
tightly held together with your braids

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.190 
tightly held together with your braids
wrap<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.720> other<00:02:31.750> piece<00:02:32.410> around<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:34.020> piece<00:02:35.020> of

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
wrap the other piece around the piece of

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.720 
wrap the other piece around the piece of
brain<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.740> synthetic<00:02:36.220> hair<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.640> are

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
brain and synthetic hair that are

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.210 
brain and synthetic hair that are
together<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:40.630> just<00:02:40.870> kind<00:02:41.110> of<00:02:41.200> hides<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
together and this just kind of hides the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:03:04.570 
together and this just kind of hides the
braids<00:02:42.550> at<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.000> top

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.660 

and<00:03:05.330> I<00:03:05.720> like<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.290> more<00:03:06.440> natural<00:03:07.040> kind<00:03:07.520> of

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
and I like the more natural kind of

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.850 
and I like the more natural kind of
neglect<00:03:08.210> to<00:03:08.420> looking<00:03:08.780> dreads<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.590> are<00:03:09.710> just

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
neglect to looking dreads that are just

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.040 
neglect to looking dreads that are just
really<00:03:10.340> different<00:03:10.670> sizes<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.480> really<00:03:11.660> funky

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
really different sizes and really funky

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.310 
really different sizes and really funky
so<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:12.410> didn't<00:03:12.800> even<00:03:12.920> try<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.190> cover<00:03:13.760> my<00:03:14.320> braids

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
so I didn't even try to cover my braids

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.280 
so I didn't even try to cover my braids
perfectly<00:03:16.250> as<00:03:17.240> long<00:03:17.540> as<00:03:17.720> there<00:03:17.870> was<00:03:17.930> enough

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
perfectly as long as there was enough

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.270 
perfectly as long as there was enough
hair<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.560> kind<00:03:18.890> of<00:03:18.920> dread<00:03:19.370> into<00:03:20.920> my<00:03:21.920> braids

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
hair to kind of dread into my braids

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.540 
hair to kind of dread into my braids
into<00:03:22.730> my<00:03:22.850> real<00:03:23.090> hair<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:24.170> was<00:03:24.290> fine<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:24.890> if

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
into my real hair that was fine so if

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.580 
into my real hair that was fine so if
you<00:03:25.670> look<00:03:25.880> closely<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.420> can<00:03:26.450> see<00:03:26.660> some<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.380> my
