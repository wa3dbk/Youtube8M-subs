 Hello, dear subscribers and viewers of the channel BeyondGodlike.tv! 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.620
 We are at MCS, and now we will interview the Na`Vi commentator - ceh9. 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.120
 First of all, we would like to ask you what you think about the matches that have already been played today (May 23). 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.180
 I can say that the guys play well, naturally there are favorite teams, 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.560
 in this case, probably Vega and Piter, which are supposedly slightly higher, 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.480
 But not far, let's say, gone. Try hard, glad that 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.300
 There are, let's say, in fact, from nowhere such tournaments, 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.560
 And now the second season of the guys from the UCC Cup just spend at a super high level, 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.020
 Therefore, the following seasons should further develop the CIS-shny eSports 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:52.620
 Perhaps we will see Na`Vi, FlipSid3 and other teams, of course, at similar events. 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.620
 Therefore, everything is cool! 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.600
 Okay, what about the next part of today's tournament? Who can win, who is your favorite? 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.140
 The favorites, of course, probably for all viewers, is the Piter team, this is the top CIS team. 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.480
 CIS in the plan, I mean without FlipSid3, HR, that is, without such very, very titled, let's say, guys. 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.780
 The next one, of course, is Piter. 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.400
 But, you know, the fact is that anything can happen in the final. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.000
 The final is such a special event, when each team understands 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.680
 That she can win no matter what, you understand, so on the one hand, 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.140
 Piter are favorites, but on the other hand - if something goes wrong - they can fly away. 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.500
 And a few words about your future career? 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.360
 My future career is somehow developing, I come to comment on Lans, 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.200
 I will continue commentary activities, blogging, Yutuber: 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.460
 Everything connected with Counter Strike and other computer games, perhaps. 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.660
 Thank you very much! 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.160
 Since you were BeyondGodlike.tv, see you soon!
