00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:33.819 
know it's not like the best of things is
where<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:01:26.420> from<00:01:27.420> Jamaica<00:01:27.630> used<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.619> support<00:01:28.979> I

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.679 

think<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.130> whole<00:01:35.340> thing<00:01:36.000> because<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.360> started

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
think the whole thing because I started

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.969 
think the whole thing because I started
off<00:01:36.810> doing<00:01:36.990> roots<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:38.490> my<00:01:39.979> playing

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
off doing roots and that was my playing

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.780 
off doing roots and that was my playing
instruments<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.880> singing<00:01:43.220> reggae

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
instruments and singing reggae

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.980 
instruments and singing reggae
I<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.800> whole<00:01:48.010> music<00:01:48.610> blood<00:01:49.480> just<00:01:49.810> came

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
I think the whole music blood just came

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.080 
I think the whole music blood just came
from<00:01:50.140> like<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.890> just<00:01:50.920> been<00:01:51.400> being<00:01:51.700> so

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
from like that and just been being so

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.780 
from like that and just been being so
experienced<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.890> just<00:01:54.070> being<00:01:54.250> around<00:01:54.430> it

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
experienced and just being around it

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.410 
experienced and just being around it
from<00:01:54.970> young<00:01:59.160> as<00:02:00.160> I<00:02:00.370> said<00:02:00.550> albums<00:02:01.030> coming<00:02:01.240> from

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
from young as I said albums coming from

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.030 
from young as I said albums coming from
strong<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:01.990> think<00:02:02.230> that<00:02:02.350> before<00:02:02.500> we<00:02:02.740> never

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
strong and I think that before we never

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.190 
strong and I think that before we never
got<00:02:03.340> really<00:02:03.580> we<00:02:04.120> didn't<00:02:04.360> have<00:02:04.450> an<00:02:04.570> opportunity

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
got really we didn't have an opportunity

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.600 
got really we didn't have an opportunity
to<00:02:06.420> explain<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:08.200> passion<00:02:08.680> for<00:02:08.890> music<00:02:09.310> that's
