00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
bit about how this week came together

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.040 
bit about how this week came together
for<00:00:34.750> you<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.790> just<00:00:37.240> had<00:00:37.360> a<00:00:37.390> lot<00:00:37.570> to<00:00:37.600> look<00:00:37.810> forward

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
for you I just had a lot to look forward

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.980 
for you I just had a lot to look forward
to<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.680> felt<00:00:39.400> good<00:00:39.550> going<00:00:39.880> into<00:00:40.030> every<00:00:40.780> round

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990 
to and felt good going into every round

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.480 
to and felt good going into every round

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
and I think that's what it comes down to

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.640 
and I think that's what it comes down to
so<00:00:43.390> that's<00:00:43.630> the<00:00:43.750> final<00:00:43.900> statement<00:00:44.590> right

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650
