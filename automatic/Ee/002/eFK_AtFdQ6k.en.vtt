00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.840
 if you see the video today I'm going to 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.460
 tell three looks about how to combine a 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.809
 sequins fabric you have 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.730
 asked how many is it that is very 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.230
 difficult to combine if we want it to 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.030
 our day to day since it is a fabric 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.560
 it is only more so at night 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.360
 without further delay we leave as the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.070
 tricks and at the end of the video stayed 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.500
 because some tourist has been presented 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.660
 look 1 that I propose is to bring about 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.850
 black pants with sequins but 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.769
 Of course, it's very dark, so we're going 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.740
 to turn this time into a roll 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.480
 minimalist sport so to speak this 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.190
 Watering cut fairly straight and without 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.739
 no way gives you that touch 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.750
 milliman and you eat that touch cesc by 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.970
 look number 2 yes we can 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.159
 combine it for night for a girl or if 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.680
 it's more casual so we're going to put 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.989
 this bronze sequin crop top with 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.780
 some fit and free high waist and ones 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.909
 heels money and also we did not see 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.710
 we're not going to combine with a raincoat and 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.900
 you will say a canteen for the night that you 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.519
 can give that elegant touch and it's not 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.369
 like the rest of people so if 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.630
 you have a dinner this is perfect I have and 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:05.760
 I'm sorry today 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.350
 number 3 which is the one I like the most 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.030
 I believe for a day to day you are going to say 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.590
 how am I going to get to go and take a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.630
 coffee with my friends he was 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.790
 sequins as this is the best option 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.430
 You take an approach from schools like 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.930
 You see the trans never heal a 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.660
 I do not like light silver but if you 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.240
 you like it perfect and you get the green 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.830
 persimmon that is more military plus crap and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.290
 the pharynx is a little more 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.870
 gray dress 20 schools a jacket 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.729
 green here or more green than here and 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.800
 some black ankle boots if it does not good you 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.990
 put stockings and sign and if it's cold 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.170
 I put the routes of seen ras already you have 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.030
 your informal looks by formal is 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.220
 just give a different touch to 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.080
 your looks always and because I tell you 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.240
 all this brightness shine and because 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.680
 I want it to shine really we are the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.450
 cable or if so we need to talk 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.369
 of something or if I want this case I'm going 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.350
 to say in three seconds because you have 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.330
 what to use is the one that personally 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.710
 is the one I like the most so it's the one 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.420
 It gives you shine because I have hair 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.640
 but I do not like that the lacquer 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.590
 I said he but the teacher so I 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.910
 true that he used this here that by the way 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.360
 I got to another because there was no 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.420
 then simply the appointments and give 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.420
 A) Yes 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.010
 and if you see they do not remain anything caked 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.489
 it's as if nothing 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.379
 It smells spectacular and has an extract 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.060
 of cherry bark that is it smells and 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.730
 nothing more than if you want more information 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.379
 left down in the information box 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.730
 all this guy I hope for her 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.500
 because if you can not record me 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.989

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.780
