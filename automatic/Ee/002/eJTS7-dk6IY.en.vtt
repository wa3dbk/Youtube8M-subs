00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.429 
the orange and black now to make the top
fin<00:02:03.579> use<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:04.759> same<00:02:05.030> technique<00:02:05.539> as<00:02:05.780> we<00:02:05.990> did<00:02:06.170> for

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
fin use the same technique as we did for

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:18.140 
fin use the same technique as we did for
the<00:02:06.560> tail

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.059 

make<00:02:18.780> sure<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.170> wipe<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.680> needletool

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
make sure you wipe the needletool

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:26.869 
make sure you wipe the needletool
between<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.890> runs<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:24.000> royal<00:02:24.690> icing<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:26.580> way

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
between the runs in royal icing this way

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.270 
between the runs in royal icing this way
you<00:02:27.690> don't<00:02:27.900> get<00:02:28.019> any<00:02:28.080> orange<00:02:28.799> into<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> black

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
you don't get any orange into the black

00:02:31.280 --> 00:03:58.550 
you don't get any orange into the black
and<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:33.420> repeat<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.170> bottom<00:02:34.200> fin

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.430 

now<00:03:59.070> using<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.610> needle<00:03:59.760> tool<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.750> can<00:04:00.930> move<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
now using a needle tool you can move the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:12.059 
now using a needle tool you can move the
icing<00:04:01.950> into<00:04:02.460> the<00:04:02.580> hard-to-reach<00:04:03.350> areas

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.069 

now<00:04:12.640> here<00:04:12.879> I'm<00:04:13.000> scraping<00:04:13.599> a<00:04:13.659> little<00:04:13.870> bit<00:04:13.959> of

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
now here I'm scraping a little bit of

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.110 
now here I'm scraping a little bit of
the<00:04:14.319> blank<00:04:14.590> that<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:14.829> brushed<00:04:15.219> on<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.760> cookie

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
the blank that I brushed on the cookie

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.900 
the blank that I brushed on the cookie
just<00:04:16.389> so<00:04:16.600> it's<00:04:16.810> flushed<00:04:17.380> with<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.400> outline

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
just so it's flushed with the outline

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.100 
just so it's flushed with the outline
and<00:04:20.310> then<00:04:21.310> take<00:04:21.579> white<00:04:21.880> royal<00:04:22.090> icing<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.750> fill

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
and then take white royal icing and fill

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:37.530 
and then take white royal icing and fill
in<00:04:23.259> the<00:04:23.380> remaining<00:04:23.650> sections

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.260 

when<00:04:38.140> doing<00:04:38.380> cookies<00:04:38.800> using<00:04:39.160> black<00:04:39.700> outline

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
when doing cookies using black outline

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.680 
when doing cookies using black outline
it's<00:04:41.190> it's<00:04:42.190> a<00:04:42.250> good<00:04:42.400> idea<00:04:42.670> to<00:04:42.970> make<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.390> black

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
it's it's a good idea to make the black

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.450 
it's it's a good idea to make the black
outline<00:04:44.280> little<00:04:45.280> thicker<00:04:45.990> just<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.320> when<00:04:48.280> you

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
outline little thicker just so when you

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.540 
outline little thicker just so when you
iced<00:04:48.760> the<00:04:49.270> sections<00:04:49.870> it's<00:04:50.860> not<00:04:51.070> gonna<00:04:51.280> get

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
iced the sections it's not gonna get

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.580 
iced the sections it's not gonna get
flooded<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.120> you<00:04:52.210> can<00:04:52.420> still<00:04:52.720> see<00:04:52.750> it<00:04:53.230> in<00:04:53.410> your

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
flooded and you can still see it in your

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.060 
flooded and you can still see it in your
design<00:04:57.120> so<00:04:58.120> if<00:04:58.240> we<00:04:58.390> are<00:04:58.420> using<00:04:58.510> piping<00:04:59.440> tips<00:04:59.740> I

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
design so if we are using piping tips I

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.670 
design so if we are using piping tips I
would<00:05:00.640> recommend<00:05:01.300> that<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:01.540> use<00:05:01.690> piping<00:05:02.470> tip

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
would recommend that you use piping tip

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:18.780 
would recommend that you use piping tip
number<00:05:02.920> three<00:05:03.580> to<00:05:04.240> make<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.660> like<00:05:05.170> outlines

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.440 

and<00:05:19.000> that's<00:05:19.660> how<00:05:19.930> you<00:05:19.990> can<00:05:20.260> make<00:05:20.820> Nemo<00:05:21.820> fish

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
and that's how you can make Nemo fish

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.450 
and that's how you can make Nemo fish
