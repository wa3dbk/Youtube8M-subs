00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
on replacing an accelerator pedal sensor

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.000 
on replacing an accelerator pedal sensor
I<00:00:09.080> looked<00:00:10.080> everywhere<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.620> Internet's

took me forever to find it so I'm doing

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.080 
took me forever to find it so I'm doing
a<00:00:18.150> video<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:20.279> maybe<00:00:20.430> more<00:00:20.760> easily

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
a video so that it's maybe more easily

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.250 
a video so that it's maybe more easily
accessible<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.810> people<00:00:21.930> because<00:00:22.619> um

Impala<00:00:29.359> accelerator<00:00:30.359> pedal<00:00:30.750> Center<00:00:31.170> okay

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
Impala accelerator pedal Center okay

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.979 
Impala accelerator pedal Center okay
which<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.769> entire<00:00:32.130> pedal<00:00:32.520> assembly<00:00:32.989> now

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
which is the entire pedal assembly now

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.389 
which is the entire pedal assembly now
right<00:00:34.260> there<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:34.860> that's<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
sensor the very top part and there's the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.369 
sensor the very top part and there's the
whole<00:00:39.420> pedal<00:00:39.750> okay<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:41.250> want<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.579> charge<00:00:41.820> me

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
whole pedal okay they want to charge me

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.400 
whole pedal okay they want to charge me
um<00:00:44.120> $150<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.960> put<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:48.030> park<00:00:48.270> cost<00:00:48.480> $75

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
um $150 to put this in the park cost $75

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.690 
um $150 to put this in the park cost $75
cuz<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.829> buy<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.010> whole<00:00:50.219> thing<00:00:50.250> of

apparently a big problem on Chevy

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.530 
apparently a big problem on Chevy
impalas<00:01:46.700> they're<00:01:47.700> sensors<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.420> all

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
impalas they're sensors going out all

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.660 
impalas they're sensors going out all
the<00:01:48.570> time<00:01:48.659> also<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:50.070> doing<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.340> video<00:01:50.430> later

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the time also to be doing a video later

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.149 
the time also to be doing a video later
and<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.000> throttle<00:01:51.390> positioning<00:01:51.869> sensor<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and a throttle positioning sensor on the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.999 
and a throttle positioning sensor on the
throttle<00:01:53.490> body<00:01:53.689> so<00:01:54.689> because<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.619> happens<00:01:55.979> to

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
throttle body so because that happens to

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.800 
throttle body so because that happens to
be<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> what<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.729> wrong<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.119> mine<00:01:57.299> but

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
be with it what is wrong with mine but
