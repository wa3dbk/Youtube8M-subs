00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 and geeks to see where he gets so much 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.630
 time people to watch series of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.860
 television every day the number of series 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.330
 of television views per inhabitant 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.160
 increases non- stop and maybe as 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.160
 consequence this happened to you 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.390
 I've seen it until the last chapter that 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.400
 series is the best and the end of the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.310
 second season is brutal me 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.169
 I personally prefer the third series 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.169
 in general and the sumo 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.150
 has matured a lot apart plagued like that 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.620
 we feel when they start talking 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.360
 times from television with 1 folio 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.129
 unbridled if we have not seen 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.079
 who is who we do not have time to see 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.670
 but we have to feel integrated 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.890
 in society that's why I'm going to teach you 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.600
 the 7 golden rules to turn them into 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.600
 experts in series that you have not seen 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.090
 first basic rule the seasons do not 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.530
 let's go into details at the time of 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.940
 talk about a television series because 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.290
 it is assumed that we have seen it by 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.630
 we're going to talk about the 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.090
 Seasons 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.509
 and good the first three seasons of 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.189
 lost were pretty good the fourth 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.659
 I designed myself a little but in the 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:21.450
 fifth the truth is that I turned to 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.450
 hooking the sixth was a big disappointment 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.370
 rule number 2 the characters having 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.980
 already talked about the seasons we can 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.850
 talk about the characters the good the 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.160
 bad girl of good friend besides 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.060
 yes, the truth is that this series 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.010
 the good one was very very good people and the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.630
 bad the bad is pretty enough 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.690
 pretty bad 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.390
 the black very very black 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.710
 rule number 3 the chapters you're already 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.240
 integrated into the conversation but 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.250
 You want to take your cheating level more 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.860
 that's why I recommend you to use 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.390
 the trick of the fifth chapter never fails 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.550
 it does not get interesting until the fourth or 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.740
 fifth chapter after the truth is that 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.830
 I was quite hooked with all those 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.770
 things that happen 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.030
 rule number 4 do not go over ready 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.680
 we are in the middle of the conversation and 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.270
 we feel truly integrated 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.220
 why at this moment in which we 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.200
 we have come up we can not get the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.420
 overconfidence leg sometimes 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.150
 bad and the seventh season of our 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.790
 the truth is that 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.989
 it made me pretty fast but if not 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.409
 there is the seventh season 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.409
 what are you talking about 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.100
 good 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.860
 rule number 5 original version always 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.690
 of course we see all the series in 2 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.640
 original jon what we have to say is 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.770
 water as well as in English is much better 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.520
 where to stop in the dub are loaded 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.770
 all that moment a dramatic rule 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.810
 number 6 you have seen the series before 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.790
 no one 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.010
 Of course the version is better 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.349
 English from the office I did not start to see 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.720
 as soon as it came out it has been done very 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.880
 mainstream the same thing happens to singles 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.470
 that in its English version keeps a 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.349
 spirit that does not have the version 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.720
 American and 'guard pharmacy' comes 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.209
 of a remake of a series of Russian in the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.630
 80's but I do not remember what it's called 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.750
 I do not have very cool right now the Russian 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.430
 Rule number 7 to do if you're wrong 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.500
 even the best experts sometimes put 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.569
 the leg and are discovered in that case 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.989
 you have two options if the truth is that 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.790
 the protagonist very good yes and the bad 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.490
 the bad one is pretty pretty enough 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.200
 bad yes 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.990
 but what are you talking about if the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.620
 protagonist is bad person that 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.819
 we are talking about 'breaking bad' 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.750
 active of the team 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.370
 good 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.050
 and if you have definitely already 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.670
 unmasked and have discovered that no 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.170
 you're not just a serial expert but 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.940
 that he is a true ignorant of the 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.200
 series and that you do not like I recommend you 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.940
 that you enter in the protection program 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.920
 of witnesses changes the identity and 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.960
 leave your city transform yourself into 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.300
 the other person disappears from the face of 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.660
 the earth or failing closes the 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.430
 facebook a couple of weeks 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.990
 It is very important the acting work in 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.490
 series because these areas spy 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.830
 even more because people say it is not 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.200
 plot and here in this case it is vital is 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.300
 vital and it shows you notice it shows that there is 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.070
 a deep work on that 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.570
 buy a dvd and have many extras 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.330
 and then we are in many hours of 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.400
 extras you see and also the 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.080
 subtitle as you imagine if you have all 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.820
 the dubbing company to devote to 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.410
 the industry I mean to dedicate to 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.580
 double the extras because there would be no hours 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.910
 in the world neither in place nor in 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.910
 weather
