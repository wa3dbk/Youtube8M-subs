00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.950
 in the kitchen dotcom today I'm going to 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.410
 teach how to prepare a cake 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.269
 orange so nothing we're going to happen to the 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.210
 ingredients to prepare the sponge cake 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:21.340
 We are going to need 220 grams of flour 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.590
 250 grams of sugar 150 grams of 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.560
 butter a natural yogurt a 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.210
 packet of yeast 2 eggs and two 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.820
 oranges the nothing we are going to use 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.280
 whole with peel and all of which 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.960
 we have cut them and we have removed them from 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.790
 the same ones and then for what is the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.730
 coverage we will need 100 grams 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.890
 of sugar the game of two lemons and one 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.530
 whole orange won we will use 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.719
 both the peel and the juice so not 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.120
 let's move on to make the first post in 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.880
 a wide container we're just going to 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.629
 start throwing the ingredients for a 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.230
 side the flour on the other side the sugar 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.950
 the butter 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.950
 the yogurt 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.360
 the two eggs 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.090
 the two oranges well washed already 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.090
 chopped 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.350
 and the packet of yeast 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.329
 once we have all the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.920
 ingredients in the container 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.460
 you just have to beat them with the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.460
 help of the blender 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.729
 as it is a cake that does not carry milk 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.270
 it costs a little more than other 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.859
 times 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.590
 once we have everything right 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.539
 mixed let's move on to take the mold 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.729
 we are going to smear it well 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.590
 butter with a little flour and 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.299
 We already directly pass it to the oven as 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.270
 we have done other times with the help of 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.380
 a paper from a brush we put together well 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.700
 butter inside the mold 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.579
 once we have all the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.229
 butter spread by the mold 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.170
 we take half a teaspoon of flour and 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.759
 we distribute well 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.620
 once we have prepared the 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.959
 mold is the time to put the oven 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.120
 preheated to 180 degrees and now already 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.239
 we just put the mixture in the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.239
 mold 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.710
 Well, at this point , 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.410
 we just need to put it in the oven that 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.000
 it's already hot and leave it there 30 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.000
 180 degrees 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.140
 a person who has passed that average 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.300
 it is time to take the 180 degree 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.820
 biscuit from the oven 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.710
 We have here the good cake and 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.270
 I been sitting a while the cake itself 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.870
 than she simply because it's time to 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.870
 remove it 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.140
 Well, nothing here, you have the 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.390
 result so now we're going to 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.040
 let stand again and we will 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.069
 prepare the coverage we will need 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.099
 the juice an orange juice of two lemons 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.510
 the shell of an orange as you see with 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.730
 practically with nothing white or that of the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.280
 inner part of orange trying 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.269
 avoid the white parts and 100 grams 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.510
 so nothing sugar in a saucepan 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:24.690
 medium low fire we throw the juice of the 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.910
 two lemons the juice of the orange 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.410
 and sugar and orange peel 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.410
 and we mix it a little bit 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.750
 and nothing and we're just going to go 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.370
 removing it from time to time and 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.310
 we need it to have a texture like 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.020
 of candy then nothing to leave it anymore 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.320
 it's okay to take that texture we bring 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.090
 about 12 15 minutes cooking 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.090
 so nothing and when you turn off the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.570
 fire, it's worth the fact that the 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.290
 kind of syrup and now nothing simply 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.850
 we are going to project the spoon we are going 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.090
 to distribute on the surface of the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.090
 Biscuit 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.829
 well come on here you have already 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.110
 finished the orange sponge cake I hope that 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.940
 you encourage to try the recipe that you have 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.940
