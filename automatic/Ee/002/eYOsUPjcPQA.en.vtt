00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello I will him so this video 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.690
 entertaining right after my sister 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.670
 but I have to help with the move but I intend to 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.070
 Recently, the order made one at 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.360
 amazon.de and one at amazon.co.uk 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.960
 everything about used books 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.010
 that means both with order and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 I'll keep the two short for now 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.670
 Compare and times as short a 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.340
 Experience report how to do so 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.340
 the british amazon 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.930
 So what is the German amazon tackle as 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.600
 I ordered all the books 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.700
 about 20 to 60 cents cost 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.910
 have and then always comes three euros 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.890
 postage on it and the books were in 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.640
 good to new condition actually 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.070
 everything 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.809
 the first book was the second part of 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.190
 that together a book that i recently 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.199
 starts off and found very well 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.609
 Surprisingly, I find that one thing 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.289
 the difference is underrated 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.409
 Underrated books that exist in the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.530
 fantasy-genre this is currently 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.420
 taking the condition was very good 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.490
 I am absolutely satisfied though 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.479
 it was also shipped with mediums there 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.119
 I do not really have anything else 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.700
 what awaits the second part 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.799
 unfortunately I can not reckoning 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.390
 agree because there was very clear 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.939
 then, not quite as good condition 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.680
 it was as good as stated only me 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.369
 should have been suspicious and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.049
 You can see this here but this 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.700
 English paperbacks is always only 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.070
 plastic hit the list here 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.960
 pretty much from what I'm not so great 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.430
 I would have relaxed with the readers 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.060
 So that's what it's all about 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.009
 no problem 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.479
 but this above all that in 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.850
 the time of getting worse and that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.740
 I did not think so good then we have 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.439
 three more bound English books 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.530
 it is once the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.240
 second part of hush hush crescendo that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.310
 I have already read a book but I have 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.799
 it has not yet been on my shelf 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.829
 I think that was as good condition 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.500
 given and therefore it is there 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.510
 you really 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.810
 So nothing to say well meet needs 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.420
 actually quite good then we still have 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.340
 the inside of jane russell knows 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.100
 probably the german version 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.170
 this one was redone with me 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.730
 think that it is quite good 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.860
 what does not happen in the camera now 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.260
 It is pretty good that it is pretty good 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.600
 spotty is but that happened that 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.290
 He quickly won in white box 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.880
 I do not think that's so dramatic 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.740
 pity it's already I do not know if 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.330
 difference and now not like that 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.020
 really but here are everywhere 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.239
 small spots on it and last in 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.520
 german order the third part 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.040
 I still can not have his 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.070
 read and I have to say that 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.420
 Protective cover was very demolished me 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.150
 I already have that a bit 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.770
 but that's up here I know 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.890
 not if we are the one who sees that 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.420
 a little that it is so bent here 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.770
 In any case, it was pretty blatant 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.080
 I have it almost between two 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.300
 books have to flatten because it 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.340
 just stood there and well 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.489
 I do not know if that country 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.530
 transport happened or because 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.860
 In any case, it was totally bent 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.450
 and I think that is not necessarily the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.370
 that the condition is still good then that 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.769
 So here you have it clicked 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.830
 been what the english order 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.200
 I'm not sure how 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.590
 it has always been expensive 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.180
 a book wise is sure this is white 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.959
 and cap area 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.000
 that cost four euros 84 and that 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.600
 it is that as the English amazon 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.970
 you paid 45 postage and I believe that 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:53.050
 she was then somehow 20 30 penny 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.420
 the smaller english currency of 5 me 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.670
 find the state super was very good 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.160
 he is also very good and there 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.680
 You could not have got anything then 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.970
 I bought two new books that was for 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.250
 a temple is 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.470
 I think I also have about 4 eur 48 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.470
 or so he paid so much 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.020
 fund company fits in or something like that 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.660
 Here was new and was also welded 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.730
 and everything and absolutely great for the 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.100
 I find price if I am here now 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.150
 it would have bought a bit more expensive 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.520
 been 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.470
 I do not have midnight city like that now 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.360
 saved a lot but I have for it 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.940
 somehow new euro still what paid and 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.630
 I think you pay for it again at amazon.de 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.700
 somehow 13 to 50 or so and me 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.900
 find the four euros I saved there 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.640
 I'm fine, especially because it's me 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.160
 just as much effort in principle cost 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.380
 has what memory the audience bank 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.630
 stated the only single flaw is 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.730
 that little a canny thing you do 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.700
 man otherwise the book is in absolute 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.590
 perfect makeup if that were not 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.700
 I would also say like new and therefore 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.340
 is very good actually what I am 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.360
 would have taken for the book I'm 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.880
 not quite as safe as for you 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.360
 I paid for it, it was me 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.600
 around the 67 euro and is relatively new 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.590
 book that I say 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.240
 that's probably why it's one too 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.820
 a little more expensive than the others 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.760
 both of which I do but in total 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.360
 I can only say with pleasure 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.300
 again 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.760
 I was also in the train with the condition 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.530
 a lot with the English books 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.810
 more satisfied than the German must 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.410
 I really mean what is German 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.960
 Often foreign traders are, however 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.710
 yes the over Amazon has been sent 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:45.300
 are that you need him at 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.169
 Amazon.co.uk is a credit card 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.759
 so manchester 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.379
 my mother has one i could 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.749
 choose someone from whom I have the 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.430
 string that with the numbers too 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:56.499
 worked great I thought yes there comes 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.219
 Somehow it's texas or something 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:00.460
 really something on it 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:02.349
 but that was nothing I think 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.389
 I like to do something like that 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:09.300
 I think now I have a total of 42 euros 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:13.479
 or something paid for the new books 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.699
 and I think that's absolutely great 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:19.060
 because it's about five euros per book 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:21.189
 and all books are me 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.689
 So really like to have real 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:27.639
 wish books and not just like that 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:29.409
 I really say that on every it 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.999
 would make every case again 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.009
 So just look that your books 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:36.279
 that really only fits or something 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:37.779
 cost her or take her hand and then 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:40.990
 Company German price remains 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:43.930
 otherwise monday not so much so if 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:47.680
 you now need the book for 500 or 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.150
 so bring the new one over then 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.099
 You can also spend ten euros there 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.349
 the German so that on the German 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:55.419
 side and new fetch there comes the belief 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:59.430
 I better off that it was actually 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:02.439
 even I will now sometimes just 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:07.029
 by 10 resp 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:08.860
 Well shot it to help already 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:12.849
 mentioned that is also new shelves 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.830
 gives and the time part of the authority 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:17.620
 Watch the movie then maybe today 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.800
 check it out this evening I still remember it 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.800
 Not
