heels and he talks about that briefly

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.420 
heels and he talks about that briefly
but<00:03:27.030> my<00:03:28.030> orthotics<00:03:28.420> you're<00:03:28.959> able<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.530> add<00:03:29.769> as

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
but my orthotics you're able to add as

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.720 
but my orthotics you're able to add as
much<00:03:30.640> support<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.660> arch<00:03:31.930> as<00:03:32.379> you<00:03:32.650> need<00:03:33.069> so

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
much support to the arch as you need so

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.420 
much support to the arch as you need so
that<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:34.030> can<00:03:34.540> get<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.440> weight<00:03:35.680> off<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:36.340> the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
that's usually where they're sensitive

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.900 
that's usually where they're sensitive
because<00:03:41.290> people<00:03:41.650> just<00:03:41.950> walk<00:03:42.340> on<00:03:42.610> those

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
because people just walk on those

that's<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:19.960> big<00:05:20.320> mistake<00:05:20.620> by<00:05:21.310> humans<00:05:21.849> it's

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
that's a big mistake by humans it's

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.240 
that's a big mistake by humans it's
going<00:05:22.870> to<00:05:22.960> be<00:05:23.080> a<00:05:23.110> big<00:05:23.500> learning<00:05:24.099> experience

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
going to be a big learning experience

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:33.210 
going to be a big learning experience
for<00:05:25.150> them<00:05:26.099> so

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.730 

all<00:05:34.220> right<00:05:34.520> that's<00:05:35.240> likely<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.960> trouble<00:05:36.440> here

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
all right that's likely the trouble here

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
circumstances now you see the reason

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.270 
circumstances now you see the reason
that<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.250> doctors<00:05:52.760> don't<00:05:53.180> think<00:05:53.840> that<00:05:54.380> that

the human body can heal itself is

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.760 
the human body can heal itself is
because<00:05:57.920> it<00:05:58.610> generally<00:05:59.270> doesn't<00:05:59.870> get<00:06:00.230> the

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
because it generally doesn't get the

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.130 
because it generally doesn't get the
right<00:06:01.150> circumstances<00:06:02.150> to<00:06:02.390> do<00:06:02.570> that<00:06:02.780> because

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
right circumstances to do that because

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.710 
right circumstances to do that because
people<00:06:03.500> don't<00:06:03.770> know<00:06:03.890> how<00:06:04.040> to<00:06:04.640> heal<00:06:05.360> naturally

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
people don't know how to heal naturally

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.230 
people don't know how to heal naturally

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
because nobody teaches them that and so

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.330 
because nobody teaches them that and so
that's<00:06:11.720> you<00:06:12.170> know<00:06:12.310> that's<00:06:13.310> what<00:06:13.520> I<00:06:13.550> do<00:06:15.340> also
