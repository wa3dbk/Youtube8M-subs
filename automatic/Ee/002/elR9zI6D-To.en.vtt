00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:12.719
 Today's video I bring you more 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.429
 a step by step in this life taught me to 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.139
 make a pretty simple flower 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.850
 using crepe paper 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.369
 You'll like the result a lot 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.769
 It's very cute, I made this flower. 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.750
 ready to decorate it and last month 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.580
 in the end have some absences there in the blog 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.199
 also to see how you got 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.199
 Who do I really hope the son likes? 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.710
 so come on then 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.480
 the first thing we go for the materials to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.489
 people will need crepe paper in the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.489
 pink and green color 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.579
 we will also need scissors that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.250
 can be that of pruning or the scissors of 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.530
 cut with straight cut even that common 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.289
 and you choose 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.140
 we will also need elastic and it will be 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.260
 kid who finds in any 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.100
 stationery very cheap and our dear 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.100
 hot glue 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.189
 first let's cut the paper that goes 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.189
 be given the training of your 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.140
 there you average two to three fingers of 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.840
 more or less width and then it cuts or you 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.500
 cut with the straight scissors or hamper and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.540
 I'm going to show you how 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.729
 this is straight and has now also with 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.020
 scissors hindered the same the same 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.540
 width 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.490
 so you can do with both if you 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.250
 not sure he explained tata in dollar 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.430
 be did you can do with the with that other 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.880
 also that the effect is very similar 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.070
 in the country experiences are beginning 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.290
 unrolls this first 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.840
 paper to make it easier 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.930
 there you will have the following start 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.329
 doubles the first time knowing how to fold 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.860
 inside the tip to stay one 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.770
 perfect finish 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.530
 and then you will from there you will start 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.720
 to do as if it were a fan is the same 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.600
 miner 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.380
 inside the work outside and thus 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.780
 against 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.550
 the difference of the lec is that here you 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.810
 go make this move but you will 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.770
 coiling because we want her to 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.640
 It's closed so you're doing the 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:32.510
 zig zag do not fold once fold to 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.770
 in lip service and O will turning 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:41.120
 the flower on the paper to form the flower 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.680
 for winding is simple this is the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.680
 step and tocantins 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.730
 Ready, just follow this easy step. 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.500
 if you want to leave more closed only 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.330
 make this move 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.830
 I particularly like both 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.020
 how much she became more open when she 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.230
 Closer, no problem 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.570
 Then you only have to do this and you're done. 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.850
 almost ready for our flower 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.860
 now we go to the second part that is 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.000
 get the rubber band so first I go 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.200
 pass here 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.800
 the hot glue just gives a dot to 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.940
 close release but the finish is 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:42.440
 with the elastic so I get elastic and 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:46.280
 I'm going to tie this part 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.790
 so I 'm going to walk around and I'll go 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.660
 tie to make this bottom 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.269
 do not let go because you might even pass 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.640
 hot glue in all but the hot glue 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.489
 it will not hold the inside 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.500
 so the second will lose your 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.030
 work then're why is 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.959
 important to also leave out how 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:13.190
 It 's important to do this. 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:16.970
 that you can do with 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.979
 that line is with the line forget a 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.249
 Any line you can if you do not 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.469
 have elastic 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:26.530
 now let's cut the crepe paper in color 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:29.139
 green that cuts a piece that is 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.479
 people make the flower leaf that 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:38.199
 also the cover its finish 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:41.740
 for this it is only folding going folding in 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:44.319
 studio fold doubles yet again it goes 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.469
 stay fine so there you have it with 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:55.050
 scissors and makes a detail that will stay 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:55.050
 That's how it looks up now. 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:05.139
 stayed like this is not for finishing either 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.599
 Then when you open the finish 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.090
 all df 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.439
 so now with the help of 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.779
 hot glue 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:23.800
 We're going to cover that rubber band. 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:28.210
 Cute, just put some 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:34.629
 of glue at all length and there with the 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:38.469
 paper the paper with hot glue 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:42.250
 It is very easy to not only position and 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:45.310
 turning around making sure you're 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:55.000
 covering and there to listen back with the glue 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:58.719
 hot and it continues there until the turn 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:06.689
 then you cut the excess that the wire 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:06.689
 of hot glue comes with the quartet oura 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.839
 with the pair of scissors and then 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.839
 excess 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.409
 here is our flower 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:25.659
 see if you want you can put it too 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:28.659
 a barbecue stick 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:31.569
 in this part here you can put a toothpick 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.449
 barbecue when you're going to 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.319
 roll it in rome 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.999
 also because there you do the 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:41.580
 warmth fulfilled 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:45.020
 This sharing here how I go 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.839
 leave so I'll just cut to stay 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.580
 Quiet because I will not do with the 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:53.069
 stem because I want to put the put 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:07:03.360
 inside the chicken so I'll show 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:07:05.669
 I'll just put it in there for you. 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.930
 being embellished is an ornament on what I 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.599
 I made it here first 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:13.279
 I made two atelier that I go 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.279
 hang them ready
