think<00:00:07.230> it's<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.649> best<00:00:07.890> way<00:00:08.189> but<00:00:08.250> it's<00:00:08.670> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
think it's the best way but it's the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.600 
think it's the best way but it's the
only<00:00:09.030> way<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.269> could<00:00:09.420> come<00:00:09.719> up<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:10.290> really<00:00:11.130> and

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
only way I could come up with really and

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.919 
only way I could come up with really and
it<00:00:12.420> can<00:00:12.570> also<00:00:12.750> act<00:00:13.080> as<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.559> semi<00:00:14.429> gloss<00:00:14.730> glaze<00:00:15.540> or

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
it can also act as a semi gloss glaze or

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.779 
it can also act as a semi gloss glaze or
satin<00:00:16.500> glaze<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:18.050> yeah<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.500> hope<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.400> video

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
satin glaze so yeah I hope this video

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.230 
satin glaze so yeah I hope this video
helps<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.180> all<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:22.490> like<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.609> said<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:24.029> not

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
helps you all and like I said it's not

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.939 
helps you all and like I said it's not
the<00:00:24.570> best<00:00:24.779> way<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:26.180> it's<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.449> way<00:00:27.689> if<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.529> want

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the best way but it's a way if you want

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.840 
the best way but it's a way if you want
to<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.730> way<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:31.590> use<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.460> method

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
to do it that way and I use this method

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.370 
to do it that way and I use this method
because<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:34.070> use<00:00:35.070> air<00:00:35.640> dry<00:00:35.969> clay<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:37.079> Rita

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
because I use air dry clay for my Rita

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.840 
because I use air dry clay for my Rita
Camacho<00:00:38.340> keychain<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.680> churro<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.219> really

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
Camacho keychain so the churro is really

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.229 
Camacho keychain so the churro is really
long<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.570> thin<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.610> bendy<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.210> I

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
long and thin so it's really bendy so I

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.709 
long and thin so it's really bendy so I
need<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> find<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.930> way<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.110> make<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.890> more<00:00:47.719> stiff

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
need to find a way to make it more stiff

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.830 
need to find a way to make it more stiff
and<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.559> wire<00:00:49.980> doesn't<00:00:50.520> really<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.969> anything<00:00:51.210> so

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and a wire doesn't really do anything so

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.830 
and a wire doesn't really do anything so
this<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.800> how<00:00:52.920> i<00:00:52.949> hardened<00:00:53.670> my<00:00:53.699> clay<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.539> let's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
this is how i hardened my clay so let's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.790 
this is how i hardened my clay so let's
just<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.260> started

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
just get started

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.340 
just get started
so<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> little<00:00:56.550> disclaimer<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.050> I

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so a little disclaimer here is that I

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.819 
so a little disclaimer here is that I
use<00:00:58.859> dice<00:00:59.309> those<00:00:59.640> paper<00:01:00.000> clay<00:01:00.899> or<00:01:01.079> whatever

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
use dice those paper clay or whatever

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.539 
use dice those paper clay or whatever
it's<00:01:02.070> called<00:01:02.129> soft<00:01:02.699> clay<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.830> I'm<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.220> sure<00:01:05.280> if

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
it's called soft clay so I'm not sure if

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.250 
it's called soft clay so I'm not sure if
it<00:01:05.670> will<00:01:05.729> work<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.119> any<00:01:06.360> other<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.960> air<00:01:07.080> dry

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it will work on any other to air dry

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.219 
it will work on any other to air dry
clay<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.220> works<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.700> dye<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
clay but it works for dye so you want to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.370 
clay but it works for dye so you want to
take<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:10.530> finished<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.939> done<00:01:12.479> drawing<00:01:12.930> air

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
take your finished and done drawing air

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.990 
take your finished and done drawing air
dry<00:01:13.590> clay<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.780> I'm<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> pick<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.380> one

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
dry clay and I'm going to pick this one

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.580 
dry clay and I'm going to pick this one
so<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.390> one's<00:01:18.600> kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.020> bindi

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
so this one's kind of bindi

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.350 
so this one's kind of bindi
you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.790> want<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
you can see so what you want to do is

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.740 
you can see so what you want to do is
take<00:01:21.740> nail<00:01:22.740> glue<00:01:23.009> or<00:01:23.280> superglue<00:01:24.119> I'm<00:01:24.330> guessing

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
take nail glue or superglue I'm guessing

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.570 
take nail glue or superglue I'm guessing
stupidly<00:01:25.110> would<00:01:25.320> work<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.979> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> work<00:01:26.369> in

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
stupidly would work you want to work in

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850 
stupidly would work you want to work in
somewhere<00:01:26.970> more<00:01:27.330> ventilated<00:01:28.049> because<00:01:28.380> some

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
somewhere more ventilated because some

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
somewhere more ventilated because some
reaction<00:01:29.700> will<00:01:30.000> happen<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.720> first

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
reaction will happen to this so first

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.469 
reaction will happen to this so first
I'm<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.470> shave<00:01:35.250> my<00:01:35.460> churro<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:36.210> I

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
I'm going to shave my churro for I

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.940 
I'm going to shave my churro for I
actually<00:01:37.610> start<00:01:38.960> pouring<00:01:39.960> down<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.590> nail

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
actually start pouring down the nail

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.179 
actually start pouring down the nail
glue<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.409> my<00:01:43.829> churro<00:01:44.840> shaded<00:01:45.840> till

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
glue so here is my churro shaded till

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.819 
glue so here is my churro shaded till
where<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> actually<00:01:47.729> show<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.200> I'm<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
where I actually show it so I'm going to

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.069 
where I actually show it so I'm going to
take<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.220> nail<00:01:50.369> glue<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.720> watch

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
take the nail glue and you can watch

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.109 
take the nail glue and you can watch
what<00:01:52.409> happens<00:01:52.770> when<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> drop<00:01:53.250> it

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.990 

so<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:59.109> color<00:01:59.350> changes<00:01:59.950> definitely<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:00.939> you

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
so the color changes definitely so you

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.179 
so the color changes definitely so you
need<00:02:01.329> to<00:02:01.420> watch<00:02:01.539> out<00:02:01.780> for<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.109> if<00:02:02.950> we're

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
need to watch out for that if we're

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.950 
need to watch out for that if we're
going<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.399> use<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:04.000> method<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:06.960> definitely

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
going to use this method and definitely

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.499 
going to use this method and definitely
like<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.950> said<00:02:09.160> be<00:02:09.459> in<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.640> ventilated<00:02:09.910> area

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
like I said be in a ventilated area

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.259 
like I said be in a ventilated area
because<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:11.709> does<00:02:12.190> smell<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.879> you<00:02:12.970> can<00:02:13.090> see

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
because this does smell and you can see

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.949 
because this does smell and you can see
its<00:02:13.680> reaction<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:15.010> turns<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.150> little<00:02:16.420> bit<00:02:16.540> more

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
its reaction it turns a little bit more

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.449 
its reaction it turns a little bit more
yellow<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:18.489> that<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.970> shading<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:21.370> you

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
yellow so that is the shading so you

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.130 
yellow so that is the shading so you
could<00:02:21.610> see<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.970> when<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:22.360> gets<00:02:22.450> darker<00:02:22.930> and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
could see that when it gets darker and

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.539 
could see that when it gets darker and
smoke<00:02:24.010> does<00:02:24.489> come<00:02:24.910> out<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.860> that's<00:02:26.860> why<00:02:27.129> I<00:02:27.190> said

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
smoke does come out so that's why I said

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.190 
smoke does come out so that's why I said
you'd<00:02:27.700> be<00:02:27.819> in<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.030> ventilated<00:02:28.540> area<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:29.019> just

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
you'd be in a ventilated area it's just

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.460 
you'd be in a ventilated area it's just
specially<00:02:29.530> good<00:02:29.709> for<00:02:29.950> these<00:02:30.069> flimsy<00:02:30.400> sides

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
specially good for these flimsy sides

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.130 
specially good for these flimsy sides
you<00:02:32.470> could<00:02:32.620> still<00:02:33.489> see<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.790> smoke<00:02:34.150> coming<00:02:34.180> out

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.830 

so<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.230> use<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.709> as<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.280> glaze<00:02:39.610> sort<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.569> but

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
so I use this as a glaze sort of but

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.119 
so I use this as a glaze sort of but
then<00:02:40.989> I<00:02:41.079> put<00:02:41.110> another<00:02:41.500> glaze<00:02:41.860> on<00:02:42.010> top<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.400> it

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.020 

try<00:02:49.129> not<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.670> breathe<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.810> lot<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:52.030> stand

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
try not to breathe in a lot and stand

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.350 
try not to breathe in a lot and stand
next<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.329> a<00:02:53.420> fan<00:02:53.780> actually<00:02:54.439> because<00:02:54.909> it<00:02:55.909> really

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
next to a fan actually because it really

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.030 
next to a fan actually because it really
does<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.840> think<00:02:59.959> now<00:03:00.439> glue<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.860> an

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
does it is I think now glue is an

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.580 
does it is I think now glue is an
inhalant<00:03:01.579> so<00:03:02.000> I'm<00:03:02.750> pretty<00:03:02.989> sure<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.409> don't

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
inhalant so I'm pretty sure you don't

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.280 
inhalant so I'm pretty sure you don't
want<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.769> be<00:03:03.860> breathing<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.340> in<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:04.640> closely

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.679 

and<00:03:12.290> I'm<00:03:12.920> going<00:03:13.129> to<00:03:13.220> do<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.849> back<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.540> can

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
and I'm going to do the back so you can

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.119 
and I'm going to do the back so you can
see<00:03:14.900> what<00:03:15.049> it<00:03:15.140> looks<00:03:15.290> like<00:03:15.379> on<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.650> smooth

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
see what it looks like on a smooth

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:25.210 
see what it looks like on a smooth
surface

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.060 

this<00:03:26.220> does<00:03:26.520> dry<00:03:26.850> almost<00:03:27.270> instantly<00:03:28.040> but<00:03:29.040> I

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
this does dry almost instantly but I

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.190 
this does dry almost instantly but I
would<00:03:29.280> leave<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.610> alone<00:03:29.880> for<00:03:30.240> about<00:03:30.510> 2-3

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
would leave it alone for about 2-3

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.330 
would leave it alone for about 2-3
minutes<00:03:35.030> now<00:03:36.030> going<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.540> do<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:37.440> rest<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:38.040> it

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
minutes now going to do the rest of it

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.620 
minutes now going to do the rest of it
you<00:03:41.990> don't<00:03:42.990> need<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.530> get<00:03:43.740> every<00:03:44.370> single<00:03:44.730> bit

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
you don't need to get every single bit

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.250 
you don't need to get every single bit
of<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:46.110> right<00:03:46.410> now<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.920> dotting<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:48.390> points

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
of it right now just dotting the points

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.290 
of it right now just dotting the points
because<00:03:50.060> it's<00:03:51.060> not<00:03:51.240> gonna<00:03:51.420> need<00:03:51.630> that<00:03:51.690> much<00:03:52.110> I

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
because it's not gonna need that much I

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.660 
because it's not gonna need that much I
just<00:03:54.300> needed<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:55.020> get<00:03:55.740> every<00:03:56.070> single<00:03:56.190> bit<00:03:56.490> down

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
just needed to get every single bit down

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.880 
just needed to get every single bit down
here<00:03:56.910> because<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.720> shading<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.620> did<00:03:58.860> I

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
here because of the shading that I did I

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.120 
here because of the shading that I did I
needed<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.520> have<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.570> all<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.840> same<00:04:00.990> color<00:04:01.290> so

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
needed to have it all the same color so

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.130 
needed to have it all the same color so
this<00:04:02.520> definitely<00:04:02.880> helps<00:04:03.120> with<00:04:03.420> my<00:04:03.630> shading<00:04:04.020> as

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
this definitely helps with my shading as

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.230 
this definitely helps with my shading as
well<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.500> can<00:04:04.680> see<00:04:04.830> it<00:04:05.250> looks<00:04:05.760> more<00:04:06.000> realistic

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
well you can see it looks more realistic

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.370 
well you can see it looks more realistic
now<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:08.120> it<00:04:09.120> has<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.360> little<00:04:09.690> bit<00:04:09.960> of<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.140> shine

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
now and it has a little bit of a shine

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.970 
now and it has a little bit of a shine
to<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.920> it's<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.340> matte<00:04:11.970> or<00:04:12.590> semi-gloss<00:04:13.590> and

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
to it so it's a matte or semi-gloss and

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.610 
to it so it's a matte or semi-gloss and
little<00:04:14.820> liquid<00:04:15.150> in<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.660> middle<00:04:16.049> is<00:04:16.200> still<00:04:16.410> dry

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
little liquid in the middle is still dry

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.030 
little liquid in the middle is still dry
so<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.730> can<00:04:17.910> see<00:04:18.120> it's<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.660> lot<00:04:18.900> harder<00:04:19.260> it's

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
so you can see it's a lot harder it's

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.620 
so you can see it's a lot harder it's
more<00:04:20.310> stiff<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:22.970> it's<00:04:23.970> definitely<00:04:24.450> more

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
more stiff and it's definitely more

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.870 
more stiff and it's definitely more
stronger<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:25.290> that<00:04:25.320> was<00:04:25.680> how<00:04:25.980> i<00:04:26.010> hardened<00:04:26.850> my

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
stronger so that was how i hardened my

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.440 
stronger so that was how i hardened my
clay<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:29.040> think<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:29.700> could<00:04:29.820> use<00:04:29.880> superglue

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
clay and I think you could use superglue

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.290 
clay and I think you could use superglue
but<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.140> just<00:04:31.440> use<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:32.070> ugly<00:04:32.340> distance<00:04:32.730> all<00:04:33.240> I

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
but I just use the ugly distance all I

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.190 
but I just use the ugly distance all I
have<00:04:33.660> have<00:04:34.290> 20<00:04:34.770> neon<00:04:35.250> glow

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
have have 20 neon glow

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.640 
have have 20 neon glow
so<00:04:36.950> I<00:04:37.220> will<00:04:37.550> use<00:04:37.760> them<00:04:38.030> um<00:04:38.240> just<00:04:39.020> let<00:04:39.380> me<00:04:39.530> know

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
so I will use them um just let me know

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.170 
so I will use them um just let me know
your<00:04:39.830> thoughts<00:04:40.040> about<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.730> let<00:04:41.000> me<00:04:41.030> know

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
your thoughts about it and let me know

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.720 
your thoughts about it and let me know
if<00:04:41.660> you<00:04:41.960> have<00:04:42.170> any<00:04:42.650> methods<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.340> harden<00:04:43.700> your

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
if you have any methods to harden your

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.620 
if you have any methods to harden your
air<00:04:44.030> dry<00:04:44.210> clay<00:04:44.270> thanks<00:04:45.170> for<00:04:45.260> watching
