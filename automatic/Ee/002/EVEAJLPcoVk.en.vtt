upwards<00:00:03.470> and<00:00:04.470> go<00:00:04.680> you<00:00:04.740> know<00:00:04.980> up<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.279> down<00:00:05.339> yeah

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
upwards and go you know up and down yeah

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.030 
upwards and go you know up and down yeah
but<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.390> sounds<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.870> bit<00:00:07.049> like<00:00:07.109> an<00:00:07.470> exercise

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
but this sounds a bit like an exercise

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.370 
but this sounds a bit like an exercise
what<00:00:08.910> can<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.120> do<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.330> spice<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.870> up<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.260> little

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
what can we do to spice it up a little

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.950 
what can we do to spice it up a little
more<00:00:10.620> well<00:00:11.400> why<00:00:11.429> not<00:00:11.820> combine<00:00:12.300> with<00:00:12.809> our

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
more well why not combine with our

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.900 
more well why not combine with our
little<00:00:13.200> phrasing<00:00:13.889> pattern<00:00:14.370> which<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:14.730> just

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
little phrasing pattern which we just

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.120 
little phrasing pattern which we just
looked<00:00:15.179> at<00:00:15.330> or<00:00:15.599> bending<00:00:16.379> pattern<00:00:16.710> something

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
looked at or bending pattern something

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:29.050 
looked at or bending pattern something
like<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:23.180> starts<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.269> get<00:00:24.359> in

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.260 

or<00:00:29.960> something<00:00:30.289> like<00:00:30.380> that<00:00:30.460> and<00:00:31.870> so<00:00:34.270> really

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
or something like that and so really

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.020 
or something like that and so really
just<00:00:35.860> try<00:00:36.860> it<00:00:36.890> if<00:00:37.100> you<00:00:37.250> if<00:00:37.489> you<00:00:37.579> only<00:00:37.699> know<00:00:37.970> to

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
just try it if you if you only know to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.479 
just try it if you if you only know to
you<00:00:38.720> know<00:00:38.750> licks<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:39.350> concepts<00:00:40.010> then<00:00:40.370> you

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
you know licks and concepts then you

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.340 
you know licks and concepts then you
should<00:00:40.699> you<00:00:40.970> know<00:00:41.059> figure<00:00:41.570> out<00:00:41.720> all<00:00:41.930> the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
should you know figure out all the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.560 
should you know figure out all the
possible<00:00:43.220> combinations<00:00:43.400> of<00:00:44.059> those<00:00:44.300> two

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
possible combinations of those two

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.110 
possible combinations of those two
obviously<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:45.350> take<00:00:45.559> it<00:00:45.680> from<00:00:45.769> there<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.280> so

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
obviously and take it from there and so

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.740 
obviously and take it from there and so
why<00:00:47.930> not<00:00:48.140> combine<00:00:48.620> with<00:00:49.129> our<00:00:49.309> you<00:00:49.610> know

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
why not combine with our you know

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.860 
why not combine with our you know
horizontal<00:00:50.750> moving<00:00:51.140> here<00:00:51.320> we<00:00:52.010> have<00:00:52.220> them<00:00:52.870> we

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
horizontal moving here we have them we

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.869 
horizontal moving here we have them we
could<00:00:54.050> just<00:00:54.290> take<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:55.040> know<00:00:55.070> this<00:00:55.790> pattern

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
could just take you know this pattern

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:04.250 
could just take you know this pattern
and<00:00:58.879> move<00:00:59.540> it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.870 

as<00:01:05.260> a<00:01:05.560> you<00:01:05.710> know<00:01:05.830> shred<00:01:06.130> pattern<00:01:06.490> we<00:01:06.550> move<00:01:06.760> it

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
as a you know shred pattern we move it

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:26.209 
as a you know shred pattern we move it
around

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.950 

do<00:01:27.219> both<00:01:27.430> move<00:01:27.789> it<00:01:27.909> around<00:01:27.969> horizontally<00:01:28.810> and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
do both move it around horizontally and

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.160 
do both move it around horizontally and
do<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.469> up<00:01:29.799> and<00:01:30.100> down<00:01:30.189> vertically<00:01:30.850> so<00:01:31.299> it<00:01:31.539> gets

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
do it up and down vertically so it gets

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.529 
do it up and down vertically so it gets
something<00:01:32.409> because<00:01:32.860> like<00:01:33.219> that<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:37.060> why<00:01:37.360> not

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
something because like that or why not

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:50.660 
something because like that or why not
end<00:01:37.780> with<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.110> phrasing<00:01:38.649> a<00:01:38.920> little<00:01:39.579> bit

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:04.690 

you

okay so I hope you're with me now

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.800 
okay so I hope you're with me now
because<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.220> don't<00:02:08.910> want<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.720> know

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
because I don't want to do this you know

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.710 
because I don't want to do this you know
for<00:02:10.020> all<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> fifty<00:02:11.700> licks<00:02:11.880> we<00:02:12.510> went

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
for all of the fifty licks we went

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.570 
for all of the fifty licks we went
through<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.350> curious<00:02:13.709> coincidence<00:02:13.890> solo

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
through in the curious coincidence solo

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.910 
through in the curious coincidence solo
and<00:02:15.000> instead<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.840> want<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.410> once<00:02:16.770> again

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and instead I want you to once again

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.740 
and instead I want you to once again
understand<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.790> know<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> thought<00:02:18.239> process

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
understand you know the thought process

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.530 
understand you know the thought process
we're<00:02:19.110> just<00:02:19.319> taking<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.860> know<00:02:20.130> just<00:02:21.090> one<00:02:21.360> or

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
we're just taking you know just one or

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.559 
we're just taking you know just one or
two<00:02:21.569> little<00:02:22.459> tricks<00:02:23.459> or<00:02:23.730> licks<00:02:24.180> or<00:02:24.330> whatever

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
two little tricks or licks or whatever

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.870 
two little tricks or licks or whatever
you<00:02:24.630> call<00:02:24.900> them<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.890> we're<00:02:26.220> kind<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.760> doing

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
you call them and we're kind of doing

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.199 
you call them and we're kind of doing
variations<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.930> scale<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.590> now<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.209> chose

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
variations in the scale and now I chose

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.059 
variations in the scale and now I chose
the<00:02:30.360> pentatonic<00:02:30.750> scale<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.680> because<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
the pentatonic scale just because that

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.920 
the pentatonic scale just because that
happens<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.580> be<00:02:32.730> one<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.330> most<00:02:33.450> common

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
happens to be one of the most common

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.960 
happens to be one of the most common
scale<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> figure<00:02:35.010> most<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.430> most<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.850> you

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
scale so I figure most of most of you

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.210 
scale so I figure most of most of you
guys<00:02:36.030> know<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.569> but<00:02:37.140> I'm<00:02:37.290> quite<00:02:37.500> sure<00:02:37.590> lots<00:02:38.040> of

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
guys know it but I'm quite sure lots of

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.059 
guys know it but I'm quite sure lots of
you<00:02:38.430> don't<00:02:38.790> know<00:02:39.090> box<00:02:39.569> two<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.470> three<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.010> you

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
you don't know box two and three so you

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.620 
you don't know box two and three so you
should<00:02:41.280> definitely<00:02:41.310> learn<00:02:41.850> those<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.330> order

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
should definitely learn those in order

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.229 
should definitely learn those in order
to<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.230> know<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:44.069> horizontal<00:02:44.940> or<00:02:45.209> a

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
to you know get this horizontal or a

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.520 
to you know get this horizontal or a
thing<00:02:45.810> going<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:47.299> because<00:02:48.299> as<00:02:48.989> i<00:02:49.230> showed<00:02:49.500> you

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
thing going and because as i showed you

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.009 
thing going and because as i showed you
i<00:02:49.739> mean<00:02:49.980> it's<00:02:50.190> it's<00:02:50.549> really<00:02:50.790> can<00:02:51.150> really<00:02:51.420> if

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
i mean it's it's really can really if

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.960 
i mean it's it's really can really if
you<00:02:52.530> feel<00:02:52.739> you're<00:02:52.920> stuck<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:53.760> playing

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
you feel you're stuck and just playing

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.970 
you feel you're stuck and just playing
the<00:02:54.000> same<00:02:54.090> thing<00:02:54.510> over<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.840> over<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.410> can

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
the same thing over and over it can

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.830 
the same thing over and over it can
really<00:02:56.100> free<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.670> up<00:02:56.819> if<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.090> start<00:02:57.630> moving

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
really free you up if you start moving

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.620 
really free you up if you start moving
around<00:02:58.109> like<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:59.160> know<00:02:59.280> horizontally<00:02:59.940> so

is really you know trying to come up

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.890 
is really you know trying to come up
with<00:03:14.130> something<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.970> your<00:03:15.120> own<00:03:15.150> that's<00:03:15.480> really

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
with something of your own that's really

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.990 
with something of your own that's really
easy<00:03:16.049> or<00:03:16.380> just<00:03:16.650> find<00:03:17.130> something<00:03:17.400> else<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
easy or just find something else of the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.449 
easy or just find something else of the
internet<00:03:18.470> which<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.890> know<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.280> people

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
internet which you know just people

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.300 
internet which you know just people
maybe<00:03:20.910> something<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.510> just<00:03:22.970> one

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.449 

and<00:03:26.819> it's<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.050> let's<00:03:28.290> like<00:03:30.709> take<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.250> try

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
and it's so let's like take that and try

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.460 
and it's so let's like take that and try
to<00:03:32.520> come<00:03:32.670> up<00:03:32.730> with<00:03:32.849> a<00:03:33.000> variation<00:03:33.510> around<00:03:34.200> that

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
to come up with a variation around that

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:48.650 
to come up with a variation around that
so<00:03:34.770> maybe<00:03:35.220> something<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.180> can<00:03:48.360> get<00:03:48.450> really

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
so maybe something so it can get really

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.449 
so maybe something so it can get really
cool<00:03:48.989> with<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.349> if<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.650> just<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:50.069> know<00:03:50.130> stick
