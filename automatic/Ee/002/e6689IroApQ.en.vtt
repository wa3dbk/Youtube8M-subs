thing we're going to do here is just
quadrant<00:00:10.469> standard<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:11.010> speed<00:00:11.309> tests

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
quadrant standard and speed tests

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.189 
quadrant standard and speed tests
because<00:00:13.250> get<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.460> question<00:00:14.849> all<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.000> time

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199

in the background and we're going to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.229 
in the background and we're going to
begin<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.700> speed<00:00:38.969> test<00:00:40.700> ok<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.940> shouldn't

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
begin the speed test ok this shouldn't

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.430 
begin the speed test ok this shouldn't
take<00:00:42.420> too<00:00:42.930> long<00:00:44.180> these<00:00:45.180> are<00:00:45.390> both<00:00:45.570> metropcs

alright so I'm upload speeds on the LG

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.390 
alright so I'm upload speeds on the LG
spiros<00:01:19.229> 2862<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.549> we've<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:21.229> 1347<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.590> these

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
spiros 2862 and we've got 1347 on these

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.399 
spiros 2862 and we've got 1347 on these
dte<00:01:23.880> add<00:01:24.119> vid<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.750> um<00:01:25.049> ah<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:27.689> LG<00:01:27.840> spirit<00:01:28.290> is

dte add vid so um ah the LG spirit is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.210 
dte add vid so um ah the LG spirit is
significantly<00:01:29.280> faster<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:30.060> um<00:01:30.979> tests<00:01:31.979> aren't

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
significantly faster but um tests aren't

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.429 
significantly faster but um tests aren't
always<00:01:32.549> everything<00:01:33.210> depending<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.200> what's

all that um so the LG spear is in the
lead<00:02:05.159> right<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:05.659> but<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.750> already<00:02:07.079> has<00:02:07.380> begun

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
lead right now but it already has begun

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.119 
lead right now but it already has begun
the<00:02:07.920> test<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:09.690> ZTE<00:02:10.440> isn't<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.920> far

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
the test and the ZTE isn't that far

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:33.200 
the test and the ZTE isn't that far
behind

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.200 

so<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.080> ZTE<00:02:34.440> isn't<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.130> far<00:02:35.400> behind<00:02:35.580> but<00:02:35.940> um

we're gonna see the test results so I

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.010 
we're gonna see the test results so I
don't<00:03:44.730> know<00:03:44.790> if<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:44.940> can<00:03:45.060> see<00:03:45.210> down<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.570> CT<00:03:45.870> of

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
don't know if you can see down the CT of

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.050 
don't know if you can see down the CT of
it<00:03:46.200> because<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.830> brightness<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.550> pretty<00:03:47.850> high

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
it because the brightness is pretty high

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.450 
it because the brightness is pretty high
but<00:03:48.480> um<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.990> didn't<00:03:49.290> fall<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:49.740> short<00:03:49.770> behind
