Vita<00:00:03.330> video<00:00:03.720> this<00:00:04.290> video<00:00:04.529> we're<00:00:04.770> just<00:00:04.799> going

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
Vita video this video we're just going

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.559 
Vita video this video we're just going
to<00:00:05.069> test<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.370> speed<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.910> Wi-Fi<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.480> the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
to test the speed of the Wi-Fi and the

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.810 
to test the speed of the Wi-Fi and the
3G<00:00:07.020> just<00:00:07.589> using<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.950> simple<00:00:08.250> internet<00:00:08.610> browser

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
3G just using a simple internet browser

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.339 
3G just using a simple internet browser
speed<00:00:09.179> test<00:00:09.420> we're<00:00:09.570> just<00:00:09.690> gonna<00:00:09.780> see<00:00:09.990> how<00:00:10.019> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
speed test we're just gonna see how the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.709 
speed test we're just gonna see how the
3G<00:00:10.920> stacks<00:00:11.370> up<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> Wi-Fi<00:00:11.910> basically<00:00:12.540> so

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
3G stacks up to the Wi-Fi basically so

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.390 
3G stacks up to the Wi-Fi basically so
first<00:00:12.960> we're<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.410> conduct<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.889> test<00:00:13.920> on

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
first we're going to conduct the test on

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.580 
first we're going to conduct the test on
Wi-Fi<00:00:14.910> I'm<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> web<00:00:15.780> browser<00:00:15.929> speed<00:00:16.320> test

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
Wi-Fi I'm on a web browser speed test

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.320 
Wi-Fi I'm on a web browser speed test
here<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:17.100> doesn't<00:00:17.580> use<00:00:17.789> flash<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.300> Java

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
here that doesn't use flash or Java

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.029 
here that doesn't use flash or Java
that's<00:00:18.690> good<00:00:18.930> because<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.380> PlayStation<00:00:19.920> Vita

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
that's good because the PlayStation Vita

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.670 
that's good because the PlayStation Vita
of<00:00:20.250> course<00:00:20.490> does<00:00:21.090> not<00:00:21.119> support<00:00:21.750> flash<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
of course does not support flash in the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.870 
of course does not support flash in the
browser<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.250> we'll<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.460> go<00:00:23.550> ahead<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.760> click

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
browser so we'll just go ahead and click

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.720 
browser so we'll just go ahead and click
on<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> Go<00:00:24.180> button<00:00:24.390> here<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.900> start<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> test

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
on the Go button here to start the test

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.980 
on the Go button here to start the test
it<00:00:26.730> should<00:00:26.789> open<00:00:27.150> up<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> new<00:00:27.660> window<00:00:27.689> and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
it should open up in a new window and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.929 
it should open up in a new window and
remember<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.619> Wi-Fi<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.250> time<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.880> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
remember we are on Wi-Fi this time so it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.700 
remember we are on Wi-Fi this time so it
looks<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.330> test<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.810> now<00:00:31.050> running<00:00:33.710> ok

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
looks like the test is now running ok

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.010 
looks like the test is now running ok
and<00:00:34.860> now<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.070> looks<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.579> Wi-Fi<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.899> were

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and now it looks like on Wi-Fi we were

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.630 
and now it looks like on Wi-Fi we were
able<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.320> pull<00:00:37.620> five<00:00:38.129> point<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.610> eight

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
able to pull five point one eight

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.990 
able to pull five point one eight
megabits<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.420> second<00:00:39.809> down<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.320> that's<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.800> bad

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
megabits a second down so that's not bad

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
megabits a second down so that's not bad
pretty<00:00:42.000> good<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.390> v10<00:00:42.629> I've<00:00:42.780> downloaded

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
pretty good for the v10 I've downloaded

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.139 
pretty good for the v10 I've downloaded
a<00:00:43.320> couple<00:00:43.410> games<00:00:43.739> already<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.910> honest

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
a couple games already and to be honest

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.090 
a couple games already and to be honest
it's<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.570> works<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:46.110> fast<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.829> it's

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
it's it works really fast and it's it's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920 
it's it works really fast and it's it's
it<00:00:47.579> seems<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.059> work<00:00:48.239> faster<00:00:48.690> than<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it seems to work faster than the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
it seems to work faster than the
PlayStation<00:00:49.140> Network<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> PlayStation

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
PlayStation Network on the PlayStation

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
PlayStation Network on the PlayStation
so<00:00:50.760> that's<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.059> good<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:51.960> let's<00:00:52.199> turn

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
so that's really good so now let's turn

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.729 
so that's really good so now let's turn
around<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.770> run<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.010> same<00:00:53.250> test<00:00:53.660> over<00:00:54.660> 3G<00:00:55.379> so

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
around and run this same test over 3G so

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.930 
around and run this same test over 3G so
we'll<00:00:55.860> go<00:00:55.980> ahead<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> close<00:00:56.399> out<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.820> little

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
we'll go ahead and close out this little

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.630 
we'll go ahead and close out this little
window<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.800> let's<00:00:58.800> go<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.160> settings

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
window here let's go out to the settings

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.110 
window here let's go out to the settings
page<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:01.129> we're<00:01:02.129> gonna<00:01:02.219> turn<00:01:02.520> off<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.940> Wi-Fi

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
page and we're gonna turn off the Wi-Fi

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.440 
page and we're gonna turn off the Wi-Fi
and<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.830> should<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.280> connected<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> 3G<00:01:06.299> now

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and we should be connected to the 3G now

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.969 
and we should be connected to the 3G now
yet<00:01:06.659> looks<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.650> let's<00:01:07.770> go<00:01:07.920> ahead

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
yet looks like we are so let's go ahead

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.770 
yet looks like we are so let's go ahead
and<00:01:08.070> swipe<00:01:08.549> back<00:01:08.790> over<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> web<00:01:09.540> browser

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and swipe back over to the web browser

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.440 
and swipe back over to the web browser
you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:10.950> there<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.310> are<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.700> 3G<00:01:12.299> now

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
you can see up there we are on 3G now

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.899 
you can see up there we are on 3G now
instead<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.080> Wi-Fi<00:01:13.470> symbol<00:01:14.400> okay

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
instead of the little Wi-Fi symbol okay

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.700 
instead of the little Wi-Fi symbol okay
so<00:01:15.180> we're<00:01:15.420> back<00:01:15.509> at<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.780> same<00:01:15.960> webpage<00:01:16.200> let's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.530 
so we're back at that same webpage let's
conduct<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.189> test<00:01:17.430> one<00:01:17.759> more<00:01:17.939> time<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.420> we'll

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.250 
so really not bad we got 3.09 megabits a
second<00:01:36.170> down<00:01:36.460> that's<00:01:37.460> not<00:01:37.550> bad<00:01:37.790> at<00:01:37.940> all<00:01:38.260> myself

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.460 
second down that's not bad at all myself
I'm<00:01:39.800> not<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:39.979> huge<00:01:40.310> fan<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.580> 18t<00:01:41.270> but<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.229> gotta

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
I'm not a huge fan of 18t but I gotta

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.170 
I'm not a huge fan of 18t but I gotta
say<00:01:42.710> they<00:01:42.920> did<00:01:43.340> okay<00:01:43.610> on<00:01:43.760> this<00:01:43.909> I've

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
say they did okay on this I've

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.750 
say they did okay on this I've
downloaded<00:01:44.510> a<00:01:44.840> few<00:01:44.990> things<00:01:45.260> over<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.130> 3G<00:01:46.520> and

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
downloaded a few things over the 3G and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.160 
downloaded a few things over the 3G and
of<00:01:46.820> course<00:01:47.030> web<00:01:47.210> browsing<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.750> really<00:01:47.990> can't

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
of course web browsing you really can't

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.530 
of course web browsing you really can't
even<00:01:48.350> tell<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.500> difference<00:01:48.860> from<00:01:49.040> Wi-Fi

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
even tell a difference from Wi-Fi

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.420 
even tell a difference from Wi-Fi
obviously<00:01:50.540> if<00:01:50.900> you're<00:01:51.200> on<00:01:51.530> one<00:01:51.800> of<00:01:51.830> 18<00:01:52.220> T's

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
obviously if you're on one of 18 T's

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.920 
obviously if you're on one of 18 T's
actually<00:01:53.060> all<00:01:53.180> their<00:01:53.300> data<00:01:53.479> plans<00:01:53.750> are

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
actually all their data plans are

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.330 
actually all their data plans are
limited<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:54.770> don't<00:01:55.009> really<00:01:55.070> suggest

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
limited so I don't really suggest

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.850 
limited so I don't really suggest
downloading<00:01:55.700> games<00:01:56.240> from<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.690> 3G<00:01:57.140> but<00:01:57.740> if

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
downloading games from the 3G but if

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.840 
downloading games from the 3G but if
you're<00:01:58.009> stuck<00:01:58.369> in<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.520> middle<00:01:58.580> of<00:01:58.700> nowhere

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
you're stuck in the middle of nowhere

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.070 
you're stuck in the middle of nowhere
where<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.150> don't<00:01:59.270> have<00:01:59.390> Wi-Fi<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:00.020> you

happen to have a 3G signal I guess you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.050 
happen to have a 3G signal I guess you
could<00:02:02.990> go<00:02:03.080> ahead<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.229> do<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.560> myself<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:04.759> am
