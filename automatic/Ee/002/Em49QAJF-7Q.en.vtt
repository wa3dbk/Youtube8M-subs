so<00:01:20.180> I<00:01:20.390> talked<00:01:20.780> about<00:01:20.899> programming<00:01:21.649> being<00:01:21.829> a

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
so I talked about programming being a

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.310 
so I talked about programming being a

Legos<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.950> crayons<00:01:25.280> program<00:01:25.640> is<00:01:25.789> a<00:01:25.820> tool<00:01:26.090> to

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
Legos and crayons program is a tool to

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.270 
Legos and crayons program is a tool to
express<00:01:26.539> yourself<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:27.470> we<00:01:27.829> should<00:01:28.009> have<00:01:28.250> more

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280

kids<00:01:28.759> be<00:01:29.060> excited<00:01:29.509> about<00:01:29.720> it

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
kids be excited about it

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.050 
kids be excited about it
we<00:01:30.320> need<00:01:30.439> their<00:01:30.679> privilege<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:31.340> their<00:01:31.789> right

we need their privilege and their right
to<00:01:32.090> learn<00:01:32.390> about<00:01:32.600> computers<00:01:32.929> and<00:01:33.259> on<00:01:33.500> how<00:01:33.649> they

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
to learn about computers and on how they

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:48.060 
to learn about computers and on how they
work<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.250> make<00:01:34.520> magical<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.210> exciting

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.770 

well<00:01:49.070> I<00:01:49.100> wanted<00:01:49.400> to<00:01:49.460> show<00:01:49.730> what<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:50.600> was<00:01:50.690> like

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
well I wanted to show what it was like

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.960 
well I wanted to show what it was like
to<00:01:50.960> write<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.530> refactor<00:01:51.950> Ruby<00:01:52.160> code<00:01:52.340> live<00:01:52.610> I

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
to write and refactor Ruby code live I

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.970 
to write and refactor Ruby code live I
think<00:01:53.750> it's<00:01:53.870> actually<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.380> really<00:01:54.560> great<00:01:54.740> way

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
think it's actually a really great way

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.730 
think it's actually a really great way
to<00:01:55.480> convey<00:01:56.480> a<00:01:56.510> message<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.470> has<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.590> lot<00:01:57.710> of

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
to convey a message that has a lot of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.190 
to convey a message that has a lot of
context<00:01:58.250> they<00:01:58.910> can<00:01:59.030> see<00:01:59.150> your<00:01:59.270> work<00:01:59.450> flow<00:01:59.600> they

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
context they can see your work flow they

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.510 
context they can see your work flow they
can<00:02:00.350> see<00:02:00.470> how<00:02:00.620> I<00:02:00.650> work<00:02:00.860> with<00:02:00.980> them<00:02:01.190> higher<00:02:01.490> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
can see how I work with them higher I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.670 
can see how I work with them higher I
write<00:02:01.700> tests<00:02:02.030> I<00:02:02.120> run<00:02:02.330> things<00:02:02.510> I<00:02:02.870> love<00:02:03.530> that

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
write tests I run things I love that

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.130 
write tests I run things I love that
they're<00:02:03.770> sort<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.160> like<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.310> very<00:02:04.550> rich

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
they're sort of like a very rich

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.390 
they're sort of like a very rich
information<00:02:06.140> stream<00:02:06.620> coming<00:02:06.830> out<00:02:06.950> from<00:02:07.220> lab

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
information stream coming out from lab

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.980 
information stream coming out from lab
coding<00:02:07.730> and<00:02:08.210> that's<00:02:08.330> really<00:02:08.450> my<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:08.780> my

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
coding and that's really my like my

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.820 
coding and that's really my like my
biggest<00:02:09.200> thing<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.680> actually<00:02:09.800> engagements

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.190 

we're<00:02:16.400> Unicode<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.910> really<00:02:17.120> hard<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.720> when

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
we're Unicode is really hard and when

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.510 
we're Unicode is really hard and when
you're<00:02:18.350> coding<00:02:18.620> it's<00:02:19.010> just<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
you're coding it's just you in the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.100 
you're coding it's just you in the
computer<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.420> when<00:02:20.600> something<00:02:20.750> goes<00:02:20.930> wrong

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
computer so when something goes wrong

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.600 
computer so when something goes wrong
who<00:02:21.350> do<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.470> blame<00:02:21.620> right<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.190> kind<00:02:22.460> of

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
who do you blame right you kind of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.160 
who do you blame right you kind of
turned<00:02:22.940> against<00:02:23.390> yourself<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.810> lot<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.050> ways

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
turned against yourself a lot of ways

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.750 
turned against yourself a lot of ways
you<00:02:24.350> kind<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.590> internalize<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.310> frustration

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
you kind of internalize that frustration

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.090 
you kind of internalize that frustration
and<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.570> when<00:02:26.960> you<00:02:27.110> can<00:02:27.290> spread<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.770> with

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
and so when you can spread that with

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.560 
and so when you can spread that with
community<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.580> work<00:02:28.880> together

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
community and work together

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.000 
community and work together
it<00:02:29.810> just<00:02:30.020> becomes<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.350> much<00:02:30.590> much<00:02:30.830> more

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
it just becomes a much much more

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.070 
it just becomes a much much more
enjoyable<00:02:31.370> process<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:32.690> when<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:32.930> have

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
enjoyable process and so when you have

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.300 
enjoyable process and so when you have
these<00:02:33.230> small<00:02:33.470> groups<00:02:33.710> you<00:02:33.860> make<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.190> lot

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
these small groups you make it a lot

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.130 
these small groups you make it a lot
easier<00:02:34.670> for<00:02:34.730> people<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:35.570> basically<00:02:35.900> give

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
easier for people you you basically give

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.960 
easier for people you you basically give
them<00:02:36.290> implicit<00:02:36.650> permission<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.820> be

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
them implicit permission to be

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.670 
them implicit permission to be
themselves<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.870> have<00:02:39.020> opinions<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.620> to

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
themselves and to have opinions and to

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.210 
themselves and to have opinions and to
really<00:02:39.890> engage

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.120 

I<00:02:46.250> love<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.880> range<00:02:47.090> from<00:02:47.600> Linda's<00:02:48.560> talk<00:02:48.800> and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
the reasons that happens and I've

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.820 
the reasons that happens and I've
enjoyed<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.260> there's<00:03:00.410> lots<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.650> things

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
enjoyed that so there's lots of things

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.900 
enjoyed that so there's lots of things

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
we look at the code I'd like to take a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.839 
we look at the code I'd like to take a
moment<00:03:06.740> to<00:03:07.460> talk<00:03:07.640> about<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.090> tests

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
I did today was about the main idea that

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.470 
I did today was about the main idea that
you<00:03:23.990> can<00:03:24.170> use<00:03:24.380> game<00:03:24.920> theory<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.970> inform

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
you can use game theory to inform

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:34.060 
you can use game theory to inform

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
talk which I just had such a nice lovely

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:47.520 
talk which I just had such a nice lovely
kind<00:03:38.210> of<00:03:38.300> simple<00:03:38.630> story<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.550> yeah

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.660 

programmers<00:03:48.530> we<00:03:48.650> tend<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:48.950> just<00:03:49.250> find<00:03:49.520> it

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
programmers we tend to just find it

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.760 
programmers we tend to just find it
right<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.600> first<00:03:50.780> thing<00:03:50.930> we<00:03:51.170> think<00:03:51.350> of<00:03:51.560> and

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
right the first thing we think of and

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.410 
right the first thing we think of and
that's<00:03:51.830> not<00:03:52.010> necessarily<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.760> same<00:03:52.940> as<00:03:53.000> the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
that's not necessarily the same as the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.150 
that's not necessarily the same as the
the<00:03:53.450> best<00:03:53.840> thing<00:03:54.110> for<00:03:54.140> any<00:03:54.380> given<00:03:54.680> situation

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
the best thing for any given situation

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.710 
the best thing for any given situation
and<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:55.610> why<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:55.790> wanted<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.090> talk<00:03:56.240> about<00:03:56.270> today

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
and so why I wanted to talk about today

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.980 
and so why I wanted to talk about today
was<00:03:57.760> techniques<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.060> can<00:03:59.240> use<00:03:59.300> to<00:03:59.690> try

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
was techniques that you can use to try

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.500 
was techniques that you can use to try
and<00:04:00.020> kind<00:04:00.410> of<00:04:00.530> avoid<00:04:00.860> getting<00:04:01.130> bogged<00:04:02.000> down<00:04:02.120> in

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
and kind of avoid getting bogged down in

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.960 
and kind of avoid getting bogged down in
all<00:04:02.630> those<00:04:02.840> tiny<00:04:03.110> details<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.890> try<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.310> build

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
all those tiny details and try and build

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.610 
all those tiny details and try and build
systems<00:04:05.420> that<00:04:05.870> are<00:04:05.960> a<00:04:05.990> little<00:04:06.170> bit<00:04:06.410> more

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
systems that are a little bit more

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.670 
systems that are a little bit more
elegant<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.490> have<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.730> little<00:04:07.940> bit<00:04:08.150> more<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:09.560> a

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
elegant and have a little bit more of a

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.050 
elegant and have a little bit more of a
structure<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:10.160> represents<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.820> structure

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
structure that represents the structure

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.160 
structure that represents the structure
of<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.270> problem<00:04:11.540> they're<00:04:11.660> trying<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.960> solve

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
of the problem they're trying to solve

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.410 
of the problem they're trying to solve
rather<00:04:12.590> than<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.460> thing<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:13.940> were<00:04:14.060> thinking

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
rather than the thing you were thinking

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.000 
rather than the thing you were thinking
at<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.630> time<00:04:14.660> when<00:04:15.020> you<00:04:15.110> wrote<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.410> code
