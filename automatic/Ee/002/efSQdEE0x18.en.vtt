maybe<00:00:15.930> even<00:00:16.049> number<00:00:16.560> three<00:00:16.890> wire<00:00:17.269> but<00:00:18.269> I

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
maybe even number three wire but I

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.660 
maybe even number three wire but I
couldn't<00:00:19.170> see<00:00:19.349> it<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.039> was<00:00:20.130> too<00:00:20.310> small<00:00:20.430> in

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
couldn't see it and it was too small in

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.300 
couldn't see it and it was too small in
the<00:00:20.760> video<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.390> get<00:00:22.080> rid<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.530> and<00:00:22.890> we'll

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the video so get rid of that and we'll

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.330 
the video so get rid of that and we'll
replace<00:00:23.840> this<00:00:24.840> with<00:00:25.170> big<00:00:25.410> things<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.190> you<00:00:26.250> can

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
replace this with big things so you can

actually see it on the video okay
instead<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.760> little<00:00:30.830> swivel<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.949> little<00:00:32.460> tiny

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
instead of a little swivel a little tiny

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.360 
instead of a little swivel a little tiny
SPRO<00:00:33.030> swivel<00:00:33.510> which<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:33.960> use<00:00:34.190> I'm<00:00:35.190> gonna

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
SPRO swivel which I would use I'm gonna

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.569 
SPRO swivel which I would use I'm gonna
do<00:00:35.519> with<00:00:35.670> these<00:00:35.819> big<00:00:36.059> things<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.569> that<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.839> can

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
do with these big things so that you can

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.549 
do with these big things so that you can
see<00:00:38.579> exactly<00:00:38.819> what's<00:00:40.399> what's<00:00:42.379> what's<00:00:43.379> being

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
see exactly what's what's what's being

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.239 
see exactly what's what's what's being
done<00:00:46.039> okay

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
done okay

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:52.069 
done okay
first<00:00:48.179> is<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.940> need<00:00:50.969> basically<00:00:51.839> what<00:00:51.960> you're

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
first is you need basically what you're

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.149 
first is you need basically what you're
going<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.229> start<00:00:52.319> you<00:00:52.589> can<00:00:52.739> end<00:00:52.859> up<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
going to start you can end up with a

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.509 
going to start you can end up with a
swivel<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.089> end<00:00:54.299> of<00:00:54.389> a<00:00:54.479> piece<00:00:54.659> of<00:00:54.690> wire<00:00:54.959> and

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
swivel on one end of a piece of wire and

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.279 
swivel on one end of a piece of wire and
then<00:00:56.519> this<00:00:57.030> hook<00:00:57.299> on<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> other<00:00:57.870> end<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
then this hook on the other end of the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.500 
then this hook on the other end of the
piece<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.620> wire<00:00:58.709> and<00:00:59.100> then<00:00:59.879> another<00:01:00.149> piece<00:01:00.449> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
piece of wire and then another piece of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.660 
piece of wire and then another piece of
wire<00:01:00.780> that's<00:01:00.839> going<00:01:01.229> to<00:01:01.379> connect<00:01:01.769> this<00:01:02.039> hook

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
wire that's going to connect this hook

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.090 
wire that's going to connect this hook
to<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.569> treble<00:01:03.929> hook<00:01:03.959> and<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.799> end<00:01:04.920> up

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to the treble hook and what you end up

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.700 
to the treble hook and what you end up
with<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.580> something<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.000> looks<00:01:06.710> something

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
with is something that looks something

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.300 
with is something that looks something
that<00:01:07.950> looks<00:01:08.100> Hort<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.550> this<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> what

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that looks Hort of like this so what

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.980 
that looks Hort of like this so what
we're<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.700> first<00:01:11.910> is<00:01:12.240> put<00:01:12.300> a<00:01:12.780> wire

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
we're going to do first is put a wire

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.900 
we're going to do first is put a wire
twist<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.720> piece<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.080> wire<00:01:16.260> here<00:01:17.570> and

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
twist in in this piece of wire here and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.260 
twist in in this piece of wire here and
it's<00:01:20.910> just<00:01:21.260> bended<00:01:22.260> over<00:01:22.670> don't<00:01:23.670> kink<00:01:23.940> it<00:01:24.120> but

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it's just bended over don't kink it but

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.970 
it's just bended over don't kink it but
bend<00:01:24.480> it<00:01:24.600> over<00:01:25.370> as<00:01:26.370> much<00:01:26.610> as<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.970> want<00:01:27.240> okay

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
bend it over as much as you want okay

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.560 
bend it over as much as you want okay
then<00:01:28.980> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.220> use<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> swivel<00:01:29.760> kind<00:01:30.120> of<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
then you can use a swivel kind of it and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.180 
then you can use a swivel kind of it and
hold<00:01:30.750> everything<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.230> a<00:01:31.320> ninety<00:01:31.800> degree<00:01:31.980> angle

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
hold everything in a ninety degree angle

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.740 
hold everything in a ninety degree angle
so<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.480> when<00:01:33.660> you<00:01:33.780> twist<00:01:35.240> they're<00:01:36.240> twisting

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
so that when you twist they're twisting

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.200 
so that when you twist they're twisting
around<00:01:36.870> each<00:01:37.680> other<00:01:38.690> not<00:01:40.520> one<00:01:41.520> around<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
around each other not one around the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:51.389 
around each other not one around the
other<00:01:45.650> that<00:01:46.650> makes<00:01:46.920> sense

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.569 

okay<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:53.210> don't<00:01:53.329> have<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.539> do<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.659> lot<00:01:54.579> then

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
okay and you don't have to do a lot then

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.389 
okay and you don't have to do a lot then
you're<00:01:56.509> going<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:56.869> turn<00:01:57.289> and<00:01:59.770> this<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:00.950> super

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
you're going to turn and this is super

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.580 
you're going to turn and this is super
heavy<00:02:01.520> wire<00:02:01.819> you<00:02:02.060> can<00:02:02.179> do<00:02:02.359> it<00:02:02.509> with<00:02:03.140> your<00:02:03.259> hands

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
heavy wire you can do it with your hands

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.870 
heavy wire you can do it with your hands
although<00:02:03.799> I<00:02:03.829> have<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.130> little<00:02:04.399> tool<00:02:04.609> if<00:02:04.789> you're

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
although I have a little tool if you're

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.190 
although I have a little tool if you're
going<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.090> be<00:02:05.149> doing<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.420> lot<00:02:05.539> of<00:02:05.750> them<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.049> then

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
going to be doing a lot of them and then

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.589 
going to be doing a lot of them and then
you<00:02:06.319> start<00:02:06.590> your<00:02:06.710> barrel<00:02:07.009> wraps<00:02:08.979> okay<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.819> you

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
you start your barrel wraps okay and you

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.619 
you start your barrel wraps okay and you
really<00:02:11.870> don't<00:02:12.019> have<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.260> do<00:02:12.379> a<00:02:12.410> lot<00:02:13.269> the<00:02:14.269> theory

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
really don't have to do a lot the theory

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.750 
really don't have to do a lot the theory
being<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:14.989> if<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.379> do<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:16.129> heats<00:02:16.400> up<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
being that if you do it it heats up the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.309 
being that if you do it it heats up the
wire<00:02:16.970> that's<00:02:17.299> going<00:02:17.450> down<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.900> middle<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.260> the

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
wire that's going down the middle of the

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.380 
wire that's going down the middle of the
barrel<00:02:18.590> wrap<00:02:18.799> and<00:02:19.099> weakens<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.209> that's

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
barrel wrap and weakens it and that's

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.410 
barrel wrap and weakens it and that's
not<00:02:20.540> what<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.780> want<00:02:21.310> okay<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:23.000> got<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.239> nice

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
not what you want okay so you got a nice

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.910 
not what you want okay so you got a nice
three<00:02:23.750> barrels<00:02:24.190> okay<00:02:25.220> then<00:02:25.910> bend<00:02:26.299> it<00:02:26.450> over

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
three barrels okay then bend it over

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.420 
three barrels okay then bend it over
like<00:02:27.920> this

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
like this

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.520 
like this
and<00:02:28.849> then<00:02:29.209> just<00:02:29.420> give<00:02:29.599> it<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.810> little<00:02:29.989> work<00:02:30.260> back

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
and then just give it a little work back

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.039 
and then just give it a little work back
and<00:02:30.709> forth<00:02:30.819> it<00:02:31.819> only<00:02:31.970> takes<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.360> second<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.959> it

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
and forth it only takes a second and it

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.229 
and forth it only takes a second and it
breaks<00:02:33.260> off<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.400> have<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.549> nice<00:02:34.760> smooth

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
breaks off and you have a nice smooth

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.180 
breaks off and you have a nice smooth
Junction

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.630 

okay<00:02:41.650> then<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.710> see<00:02:42.920> how<00:02:43.070> it's<00:02:43.250> wrapped

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
okay then you see how it's wrapped

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.150 
okay then you see how it's wrapped
around<00:02:43.760> each<00:02:44.330> other<00:02:45.170> then<00:02:45.650> go<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.040> other

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
around each other then go to the other

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.990 
around each other then go to the other
end<00:02:46.450> with<00:02:47.450> your<00:02:47.600> hook<00:02:49.360> okay<00:02:50.360> again<00:02:51.700> get<00:02:52.700> enough

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
end with your hook okay again get enough

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.980 
end with your hook okay again get enough
tag<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.660> make<00:02:53.930> your<00:02:54.080> loop<00:02:56.770> okay<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.720> then

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
tag and make your loop okay and then

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.670 
tag and make your loop okay and then
twist<00:03:00.320> them<00:03:00.530> around<00:03:00.650> each<00:03:01.010> other<00:03:02.410> big<00:03:03.410> wine

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
twist them around each other big wine

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:14.830 
twist them around each other big wine
keep<00:03:04.070> it<00:03:04.220> in<00:03:04.340> frame<00:03:10.930> but<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.110> is<00:03:13.780> kind<00:03:14.780> of

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
keep it in frame but this is kind of

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:24.070 
keep it in frame but this is kind of
getting<00:03:15.050> off<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.470> side<00:03:15.740> there<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:23.080> you

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
getting off to the side there and you

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.250 
getting off to the side there and you
see<00:03:24.260> how<00:03:24.410> it's<00:03:24.590> it's<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.550> spiral<00:03:25.910> around<00:03:26.420> both

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
see how it's it's a spiral around both

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.080 
see how it's it's a spiral around both
of<00:03:27.500> them<00:03:27.650> like<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.370> helix<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:29.030> guess<00:03:30.130> they<00:03:31.130> turn

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
of them like a helix I guess they turn

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.060 
of them like a helix I guess they turn
it<00:03:32.270> sideways<00:03:32.920> then<00:03:33.920> do<00:03:34.070> your<00:03:34.190> barrels

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
it sideways then do your barrels

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:46.750 
it sideways then do your barrels
one<00:03:38.080> two<00:03:40.900> three<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.940> then<00:03:45.430> even<00:03:46.430> with<00:03:46.640> this

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
one two three and then even with this

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.430 
one two three and then even with this
little<00:03:47.090> nub<00:03:47.300> that<00:03:47.510> I've<00:03:47.660> created<00:03:47.870> here<00:03:48.170> which

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
little nub that I've created here which

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.390 
little nub that I've created here which
is<00:03:48.590> not<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:48.920> ideal<00:03:49.280> way<00:03:50.800> doesn't<00:03:51.800> take<00:03:52.160> much

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
is not the ideal way doesn't take much

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.710 
is not the ideal way doesn't take much
to<00:03:52.670> break<00:03:52.880> it<00:03:53.060> off<00:03:58.330> so<00:03:59.330> that's<00:03:59.510> not<00:03:59.600> the

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
to break it off so that's not the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.500 
to break it off so that's not the
prettiest<00:04:00.080> one<00:04:00.200> but<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:00.440> get<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.680> idea<00:04:01.510> so

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
prettiest one but you get the idea so

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.380 
prettiest one but you get the idea so
now<00:04:04.959> you<00:04:05.959> want<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.290> create<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.910> stinger<00:04:08.240> hook

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
now you want to create the stinger hook

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.940 
now you want to create the stinger hook
so<00:04:09.200> you're<00:04:10.130> gonna<00:04:10.250> go<00:04:10.459> through<00:04:10.820> here<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:15.170> you

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
so you're gonna go through here and you

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.920 
so you're gonna go through here and you
have<00:04:16.340> your<00:04:16.370> choice<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:16.910> can<00:04:17.030> go<00:04:17.239> just<00:04:17.750> through

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
have your choice you can go just through

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.720 
have your choice you can go just through
the<00:04:18.109> eye<00:04:18.140> of<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:19.280> hook<00:04:20.049> okay<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:22.100> not<00:04:22.370> this

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
the eye of the hook okay and not this

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.810 
the eye of the hook okay and not this
wire<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.480> which<00:04:24.470> case<00:04:24.740> when<00:04:25.190> it's<00:04:25.340> pulling

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
wire in which case when it's pulling

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.030 
wire in which case when it's pulling
this<00:04:26.120> hook<00:04:26.330> will<00:04:26.480> be<00:04:26.600> rigid<00:04:27.020> which<00:04:27.560> may<00:04:27.740> not<00:04:27.919> be

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
this hook will be rigid which may not be

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.659 
this hook will be rigid which may not be
what<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.310> want<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.450> can<00:04:29.570> also<00:04:29.870> go<00:04:30.200> through

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
what you want so you can also go through

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.480 
what you want so you can also go through
this<00:04:31.669> go<00:04:32.300> through<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.169> loop<00:04:33.410> here<00:04:34.780> okay

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
this go through just the loop here okay

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.120 
this go through just the loop here okay
of<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.450> created<00:04:38.900> in<00:04:39.050> before<00:04:39.560> and

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
of the that you created in before and

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.840 
of the that you created in before and
now<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.430> hook<00:04:40.700> is<00:04:40.910> a<00:04:40.940> little<00:04:41.240> freer<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:46.580> can

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
now the hook is a little freer you can

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.200 
now the hook is a little freer you can
start<00:04:47.090> twisting<00:04:47.540> again<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:49.070> this<00:04:49.880> really

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
start twisting again and this really

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.360 
start twisting again and this really
isn't<00:04:50.390> that<00:04:50.539> hard<00:04:50.660> when<00:04:51.530> you're<00:04:51.710> using<00:04:51.950> you

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
isn't that hard when you're using you

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.370 
isn't that hard when you're using you
know<00:04:52.490> forty<00:04:52.970> pound<00:04:53.210> wire<00:04:53.450> as<00:04:53.720> opposed<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.200> one

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
know forty pound wire as opposed to one

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.290 
know forty pound wire as opposed to one
hundred<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:54.710> thirteen<00:04:55.100> pound<00:04:58.150> should<00:04:59.150> get

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
hundred and thirteen pound should get

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:10.260 
hundred and thirteen pound should get
the<00:04:59.419> idea<00:04:59.870> here<00:05:02.620> again<00:05:03.700> barrel<00:05:04.700> wraps<00:05:06.190> one<00:05:08.169> two

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
the idea here again barrel wraps one two

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:18.840 
the idea here again barrel wraps one two
three<00:05:15.010> you<00:05:16.010> get<00:05:16.130> your<00:05:16.340> little<00:05:16.460> tag<00:05:16.729> end<00:05:17.030> here
