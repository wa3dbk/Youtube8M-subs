00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.490
 Welcome dear audience to 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.560
 a new edition of 5 4 tv with a 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.660
 cup issue because I'm allowed here 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.400
 Welcome from Koblenz 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.880
 there had to be harmony in the 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.070
 quarterfinal against tus koblenz 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.710
 compete yes and at this point that 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.590
 You have to mention that because won 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.480
 Eintracht happy 5 to 6 in the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.910
 penalty shootout of the elfmeter killer the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.110
 was called andreas lengsfeld and his 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.390
 of course we also 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.920
 comments from jens jaw and steven 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.600
 crowners are now available with the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.010
 highlights from this lot 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.840
 506 wins the harmony in 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.250
 penalty shootout in the quarterfinals of the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.829
 bitburger rheinlandpokals went the tus 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.660
 it would not have been shorter from Coblenz 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.539
 allowed and if you look at the blood pressure 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.440
 the viewer then viewed 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.489
 she probably does not care too much 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.050
 may take longer 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.550
 but they were a fanatics 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.560
 certainly very nice 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.490
 was feverish and sweaty with 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.270
 jansky was with me now 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.210
 microphone 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.750
 Mr. pine that was pretty close 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.270
 or the result says it all 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.259
 120 minutes penalty shooting I think 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.490
 The game was so close in the end 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.619
 we were the happier we have to be like that 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.790
 say because the game was open and that 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.979
 would have to go in another direction 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.079
 But in such a game there are 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.520
 now in winners and we have then 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.130
 five outstanding penalty shoots 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.780
 very cool turned then one must also 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.810
 Yes , they deserve to say theirs 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.490
 team in the first half, a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.290
 a bit surprised probably 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.869
 offensive Koblenzern was first 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.579
 a bit yes, let's say in the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.380
 defensive pressed and then the second 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.930
 halfway it was exactly the other way what 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.770
 Did you do that in the pause tea? 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.210
 At first we were not surprised 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.890
 We were just over the first one 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.979
 bad we were well prepared 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.210
 the game but we had 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.289
 inexplicably ours 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.759
 to build up the game 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.140
 to push our game through I know 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.970
 not why maybe one 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.610
 bit pressure because of the crucial 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.539
 game you have to get ahead but the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.610
 second half I have the team 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.569
 just not at half-time while not loud 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.970
 not at all i have the team 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.440
 Simply said that is not so 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.850
 does not wrap so play football 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.890
 what you organize here in the square 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.810
 in a quiet tone because of me 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.340
 I know they can do it better and we can 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.390
 then have courageous forward 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.799
 played we still have 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.480
 mistakes were also made that luck 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.459
 we do not have to get the 2 0 one 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.140
 say but then it's more like me 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.569
 Imagine me and the team has 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.549
 then the heart is taken in both hands 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.560
 and has played courageously we still have 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.310
 chances and is accordingly 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.530
 I'm glad too 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.690
 Okay, let's jump to the scene 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.130
 1 1 by steven kröner how many boulders 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.329
 they have fallen from the heart 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.220
 they thought so now pack this 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.900
 yes, I was even convinced that we 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.570
 after the 1 1 maybe even in the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.820
 regular game time still win it was 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.819
 of course so he already has one 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.769
 relief what he as a coach too 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.400
 and stone falls from my heart but I say 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.900
 well played before this situation 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.590
 we have played well before that 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.590
 you can also say that 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.450
 and in the end it was after that 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.090
 1 1 year again open the reeco group 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.319
 We said two and three chances 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.310
 the extension as well and 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.680
 Accordingly, I am simple 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.970
 happy about the victory 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.060
 congratulations to again and 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.290
 final question would be close now 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.019
 two and a half weeks time with the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.120
 working team, it is now so 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.650
 a little bit the squirrel tactics one 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.910
 one step after the other 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.470
 This is now the entry to others 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.280
 slowly in the direction you 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.670
 want to move 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.860
 no, no, no, because the harmony 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.840
 want to move in the direction plays like that 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.299
 not in the first half and play 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.069
 also not after 11 it was after 1 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.230
 1 was not a football for me 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.620
 have for wallis in the ball is down and 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.690
 here 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.280
 There were opportunities on both sides and there 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.319
 you just have to work more compact 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.450
 compactness not defensive compactness 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.920
 and is called a team together 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.019
 We have an open visor 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.640
 played forward but also after 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.170
 in the back and that's how I imagine it 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.459
 not because it could have 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.260
 to go in the other direction 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.849
 I'm absolutely giving you too many 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.900
 thanks for this analysis, have fun now 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.040
 still with the team i hope so 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.849
 at least one cake left 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.530
 and a cup of coffee have 54 tv 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.239
 I welcome microphone now and Andreas 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.209
 lengsfeld the eleven-meter killer 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.979
 so the fans also chanted as 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.510
 penalty shooting went with which 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.829
 Feelings and emotions are you first 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.260
 gone in with the word is yes 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:27.000
 you can not throw away much dirt 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.810
 lose and i think i know that 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.880
 from time to time they are mine if we 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.180
 I had to stop all five of them 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.800
 and thank god okay 56 it was 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.910
 The concord would have been pretty close 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.039
 maybe even before 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.840
 Lastly, there was one 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.500
 I always say clear 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.910
 about koblenz 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.740
 so invented harder to capture 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.479
 in the game 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.599
 yes you are not our best game though 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.550
 a second half from 60 to 80 times 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.750
 we are doing really well in the market 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.250
 a few more chances and then in 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.380
 the first half of extra time must 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.639
 to actually do it and then 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.620
 So had the sufficient opportunities three 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.690
 four hundred percent well but yes 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.460
 my best elfmeterschießen 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.030
 So today the case has to Complain 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.440
 not me now 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.940
 I think that man has her 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.470
 rightly noticed once was there 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.849
 it's even almost by hand 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.500
 or was it with the other and anyway 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.220
 everyone still about you and the trouble 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.570
 compared with the joy as 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.200
 kept as what was bigger what has 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.990
 held out okay okay I think so yes 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.860
 like to party a bit now 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.480
 I do not think so we go 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.700
 Of course we are really happy, but me 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.840
 believe it because all'm totally broken 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.340
 broken and I was only in the gate 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.650
 So frankly, I do not know how the 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.670
 guys then goes destined worse 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.920
 We will definitely enjoy it though 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.240
 big celebration faith will not be okay 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.290
 then celebrates nicely with a piece of cake 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.070
 and a cup of coffee 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.240
 thanks andreas on my side may 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.910
 I now greet you in green 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.400
 human being green that the thing there for 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.430
 1 1 in just over 20 meters 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.590
 what a shot after that was clear 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.270
 we are still packing the thing here or yes 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.070
 At the end , not much to say at the end 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.360
 because I try it often and goes to 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.330
 third floor and who comes to the gate 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.250
 pure again but yes I think it was 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.690
 cool because we were pushing and have 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.250
 the game made easy then is 112 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.419
 not really salvation and we leave 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.830
 The game is very short chronological 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.700
 I think I have to go through the first half 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.800
 not much to say 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.450
 the harmony relatively behave many 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.230
 error when playing 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.790
 many were stumbled upon ballot 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.110
 that was a bit nervous or was 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.090
 that the respect of the tus because you 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.470
 here last 0 21 lost or was 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.450
 that just because of the pressure in the cup 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.490
 or am I just completely nonsense 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.340
 maybe a mixture of everything 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.340
 yes, it is so much about the club 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.630
 we also know and defend that 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.530
 This time because the stand behind good 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.540
 and he knew that is definitely 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.479
 a game is over 50 is on the edge 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:52.330
 and if you play a risk pass 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.560
 like the first ins tor and anja it was 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.030
 difficult of us have gotten started 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.630
 I eat very well and then good 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.919
 found a game 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.169
 I would be interested in that 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.430
 Half time what has the coach to you 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.110
 because you are after that 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.580
 race came back and the game was over 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.620
 all at once firmly in her hand and 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.990
 that can take up to 120 minutes 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.699
 Or says the consequences of the cabin 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.650
 Two applications were supposed to continue 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:12.880
 play and is much braver and play 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.830
 What we can do because we can soccer 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.030
 play and then we have guys 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.320
 each other again pushed us 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.940
 but today we also saw that in 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.190
 a 10 of that is why he is raised 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.419
 So conclusion of the team spirit has 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.010
 won today 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.330
 In any case because it was one 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.030
 fighting game and there it is only the 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.590
 team effort and therefore was 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.120
 we are glad that this is so good 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.229
 held together and in others 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.630
 playing before maybe did not have that way 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:36.040
 luck, too, why today's opportunities 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.000
 not clean but in the end 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.000
 passed 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.650
 Yes
