00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.040
 and had downloaded the naruto game 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.050
 shippuden ninja storm 3 and then I had 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.600
 realized that he did not recognize me the 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.750
 joystick in this case I had it connected 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.410
 to the pc then I searched a bit and 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.490
 I found a solution and good in this 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.640
 I have already configured you 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.460
 and well I'm going to show you how I've done 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.580
 first of all I downloaded a 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.580
 archive 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.500
 and mediafire that I'll be leaving in the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.020
 link of the description of the video 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.440
 and good after downloading the file 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.440
 we are distracted 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.489
 and good 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.809
 Here we can try 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.520
 our joystick 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:03.380
 in this case, I have already tried 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.380
 and it works perfectly not 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.770
 Y 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:19.289
 then now let's copy all 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.289
 these field files 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.090
 to the folder where I made the game 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.210
 we copy if it tells us that we should 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.210
 replace it only we see that yes 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.780
 and ready 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.850
 I already have it ready so I do not 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.400
 it goes because without any problem only 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.400
 the last thing that would be left to do would be 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.850
 this has to be activated 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.039
 this
