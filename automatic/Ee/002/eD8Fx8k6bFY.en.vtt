00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello friends, how are you here? 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.480
 I bring a new video on this occasion 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.480
 I come to explain 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.570
 the recipe to make a hail of 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.900
 lemon this is the Guatemalan style 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.000
 so what we need is a glass 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.619
 of the group 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.170
 with diego already properly crushed 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.020
 cited can not be the blender the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.029
 machine or they can put a 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.840
 bag so on the ground a 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.560
 hard surface lemon two lemons 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.430
 chicken soup 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.640
 nugget 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.640
 or pepitoria and salt then 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.470
 then we cut the lemon 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.870
 - our 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.960
 we start with lemon 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.880
 Since it's a pretty small glass, I'm going to 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.680
 Apply only one lemon if it is a glass 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.800
 little bigger because they can do it with 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.120
 the lemons or depending on what acid 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.120
 that you want your hail 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.220
 we leave the game 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.780
 and then with a teaspoon 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.729
 let's grab a bit of pepitoria 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.870
 there is also salt to taste vitoria 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.610
 but let's grab jumps also to 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.690
 taste 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.690
 and a little salt 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.990
 and we're going to take some consomme of 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.990
 chicken 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.290
 this is going 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.759
 a peculiar flavor now you can 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.759
 add another 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.940
 then to finish another little 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.890
 of lemon juice so that it melts 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.440
 all right 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.580
 all the ingredients then 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.580
 it would be this way 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.569
 a little more iron 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.569
 the bass also 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.630
 then we go another 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.890
 if we go back to throw 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.890
 more your model 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.920
 and well let's take a spoon 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.650
 and we will serve our hailed 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.640
 then they can make several organized 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.530
 and it's pretty cheap 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.680
 As I say, it 's a small glass 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.250
 apply only one lemon if it is a glass 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.260
 a little bigger apply lemons 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.880
 shortly measure or taste 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.070
 and the consumption of power now if you 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.750
 they want a totally organize 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.530
 different can you throw a little v8 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.050
 makes the tomato juice and a little 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.650
 best chili and chili powder 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.420
 So, well, these are a way that 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.630
 came the lemon slush I hope that 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.200
 I like them and they like it will be up to 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.320
 next 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.320
 bye
