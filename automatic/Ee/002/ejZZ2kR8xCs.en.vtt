00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.490
 jj in this tutorial I'm going to teach you 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.860
 how to use the new official web version 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.139
 of whatsapp that you can use so much 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.470
 in the winery dores web as in tablets 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.449
 first, as you will see in the messages, 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.400
 they receive here perfectly and it puts you 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.199
 until he's writing good I'm going to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.850
 show you how to start using it 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.220
 right from the start 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.080
 before starting I will tell you that this 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.540
 it's good for all devices 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.750
 with android since ios the system 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.330
 operative of apple and symbian do not have 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.790
 the option still to connect by the 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:44.030
 moment have it android windows phone 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.949
 blackberry blackberry 10 and nokia s60 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.110
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.820
 open whatsapp to find out if we have the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.449
 correct version or we will have to 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.460
 update for it we will open whatsapp 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.670
 we will give the options button and 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.930
 we will press in settings now we will press 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.940
 help and about on this page as 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.310
 you can see we see the version that we have 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.860
 of whatsapp in my case is the 2 point 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.259
 11,498 is worth if we have that version or 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.259
 we can use a superior one if 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.810
 we will not have to do the following 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.080
 steps we'll have to go to google play and 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.690
 in google play we will write whatsapp 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.090
 we will click on whatsapp messenger 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.490
 as you see we have installed that is the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.229
 original and now on the button that I 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.420
 I have to open, it will put you to 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.850
 update simply you will have to 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.800
 give update and you will have the new 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.659
 version of whatsapp is now worth 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.940
 we will simply reopen whatsapp 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.490
 and in the case that we have the version 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.590
 correct and everything is fine if we give 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.600
 options we will see this option that 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.920
 put whatsapp web 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.350
 that's what he wants to say is that already 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.030
 we can use the web version in case 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.060
 that we get what you will have to 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.799
 do is uninstall the application and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.869
 reinstalling it does not give any 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.299
 problem or nothing happens the only thing that 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.790
 sometimes it does not take the update well and 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.250
 you just have to uninstall and 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.650
 reinstalling it is now worth what 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.720
 we have to do is go to the web browser 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.850
 and we will write this address that they 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.080
 leave in the description of the video that is 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:24.440
 web dot whatsapp dotcom here we 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.380
 this qr code will appear and now 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.290
 we will press the whatsapp web version that 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.140
 we have and this code will appear or 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.480
 is this code scanner qr what 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.230
 we will approach the screen pointing to the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.440
 qr device and as you will see we are already 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.840
 connected I tell you that the phone 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.130
 always have to have either data or 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.290
 ok wifi for this application 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.540
 it works in case you lose the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.790
 connection the page will tell you that you can not 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.530
 find the device is worth it here 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.260
 we already have the whatsapp 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.200
 and if someone writes us for example we 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.020
 it will arrive like this and a world will appear 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.120
 here and up here if we enter also 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.620
 look for example and someone is 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.350
 writing it appears to us that it is 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.560
 writing here and here and now we 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.170
 sends and it also appears you haha 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.290
 I will comment that this option is 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.170
 we activate here we give to understood already 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.430
 allow if we are for example 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.420
 in another place on the web 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.790
 and they send us something like you can see us 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.650
 a notification will come down here and 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.629
 we can click on it to access 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.400
 to the conversation is worth something that I have 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.769
 found me is that for example from 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.379
 here you can not erase messages or 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.200
 see the connection time in the groups of 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.239
 when they have seen that message and neither 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.150
 you can right click to delete 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.129
 the conversation or do whatever it is without 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.280
 However, if we go to our device 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.919
 mobile and we delete a message for example 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.010
 let's erase or the daughter when she 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:02.590
 update already in the web version 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.980
 messages will be erased even 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.319
 if from the web version or if from 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.049
 the web version we send an image that 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.150
 would be from here agreeing that 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.410
 we will access our device or 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.510

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.820
