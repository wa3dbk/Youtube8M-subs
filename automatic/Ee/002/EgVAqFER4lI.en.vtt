00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.260
 you arrive in the park of the castle motte-tilly 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.510
 this is not a dream but the work of a Slovenian artist pistard his star ac 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.789
 in each sector welcome to the internat 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.829
 which is both in white horses mode 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:20.089
 his sculptures measuring between 50 and 1 meter 70 is a real size 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.439
 they are made of a kind of paper used for the parachute cloth and 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.149
 achieved through ancestral Asian technique the origami to 1 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.280
 the mistake facing the net in the last I'm fascinated by lorient half I 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.370
 has been working on it for 25 years and my dream has always been to do some 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.480
 big thing with this technique 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.660
 but this time I had the opportunity I thought ok let's go after 25 years 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.000
 he was in deficit this planet 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.930
 nbc things to grab voices ol it's the result it's very 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.630
 interesting to work on because lorient to nice of geometry and 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.330
 for me it was fascinating because I had to work on sculpture at 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.460
 inside the material 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.370
 indeed the principle of origami is since yesterday a sheet to give it 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.310
 a recognizable shape 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.090
 each of these horses are made of two pieces of four square meters 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.060
 of paper except the unicorn was equal 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.530
 the tender will be at the bottom of sexy panties put in pegase is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.189
 also made in a canvas of a single barrel of 6 square meters 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.909
 it's a bit of a complex form because of her and 7 it's quite difficult to 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.430
 find a way to install it without a structure but they have succeeded and 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.299
 it's really well fixed I think it's not going to fly very far 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.440
 the artist save the skin thin and his technique amar but on stage 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.040
 he then created and exhibited his sculptures a first time in his 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.070
 native country 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.610
 before bringing them back to France by truck simply the customers 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.130
 these nine horses on the second part of a trilogy 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.960
 in which he stores on starz illustrates relationships between men 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.630
 and nature 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.680
 George Clooney 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.200
 this report can even internally 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.960
 this is the story of the man and the animal I chose the white days 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.270
 because they are beautiful 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.970
 and gloves and I chose the horse because he was always close to 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.410
 the man symbolically they have a strong connection with the spiritual life of 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.410
 the man 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.769
 the third part of this trilogy will be m 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.929
 faurÃ© composed of 25 trees 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:27.439
 she will embody the man and the nature in perfect symbiosis the creator I hope 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.509
 that she will be exposed in France
