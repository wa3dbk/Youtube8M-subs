00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.320 

I<00:02:09.720> thought<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.680> game<00:02:10.830> ran<00:02:11.190> about<00:02:11.670> as<00:02:12.060> well<00:02:12.300> as

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
I thought the game ran about as well as

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.650 
I thought the game ran about as well as
we<00:02:12.690> could<00:02:12.870> ask<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.350> thought<00:02:13.560> we<00:02:13.970> had<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> passion

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
we could ask I thought we had a passion

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.410 
we could ask I thought we had a passion
to<00:02:15.690> guard<00:02:16.020> early<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.740> game<00:02:17.030> set<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.180> tone

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
to guard early in the game set the tone

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.940 
to guard early in the game set the tone
with<00:02:18.450> our<00:02:18.780> defense<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.380> don't<00:02:19.530> think<00:02:19.680> they<00:02:19.770> made

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
with our defense I don't think they made

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.510 
with our defense I don't think they made
23<00:02:20.340> points<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:20.970> first<00:02:21.210> five<00:02:21.420> minutes<00:02:21.690> and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
23 points in the first five minutes and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.740 
23 points in the first five minutes and
coupling<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.580> with<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:24.120> couple<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.570> bombs

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
coupling that with a couple of bombs

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.650 
coupling that with a couple of bombs
which<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.410> always<00:02:25.920> can<00:02:26.130> use<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.210> great<00:02:27.480> way

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
which we always can use it's a great way

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.220 
which we always can use it's a great way
to<00:02:27.720> start<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.230> game<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.740> opens<00:02:29.070> things<00:02:29.340> up<00:02:29.670> so

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
to start a game it opens things up so

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.230 
to start a game it opens things up so
from<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.260> aspect<00:02:31.650> i<00:02:32.490> thought<00:02:32.700> we<00:02:32.880> sort<00:02:33.150> of

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
from that aspect i thought we sort of

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.020 
from that aspect i thought we sort of
had<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> six<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.230> 10-point<00:02:35.040> lead<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.760> long

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
had a six the 10-point lead for a long

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.260 
had a six the 10-point lead for a long
time<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.450> i<00:02:37.370> think<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.490> had<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.670> wearing<00:02:39.060> down

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
time and i think that had a wearing down

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.120 
time and i think that had a wearing down
process<00:02:39.720> may<00:02:40.140> be<00:02:40.200> mentally<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:40.920> this

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
process may be mentally on this

00:02:41.130 --> 00:03:21.870 
process may be mentally on this
particular<00:02:41.460> team
