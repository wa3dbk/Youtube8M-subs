00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
subframe bolts I'm going to take the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.440 
subframe bolts I'm going to take the
tank<00:00:44.489> off<00:00:44.640> we'll<00:00:44.789> leave<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> shards<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.360> the

tank we'll take a seat and tank off and
get<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.670> point<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.510> want<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> pull

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
get to that point so you want to pull

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.900

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
this air clip this sensor you pull this

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.939 
this air clip this sensor you pull this
wire<00:00:51.120> off<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:52.350> want<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.680> before<00:00:52.770> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
wire off you want to do that before you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.500 
wire off you want to do that before you
start<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> subframe<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.149> lot<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.420> guys

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
start on the subframe a lot of guys

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.729 
start on the subframe a lot of guys
forget<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> pull<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
forget to do that if you pull the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.170 
forget to do that if you pull the
subframe<00:00:55.980> off<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.579> you'll<00:00:56.789> damage

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
subframe off with that on you'll damage

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.410 
subframe off with that on you'll damage
the<00:00:57.360> wires<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.020> kind<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.770> mess<00:00:59.329> okay<00:01:00.329> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the wires and kind of a mess okay so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.900 
the wires and kind of a mess okay so
we're<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.690> start<00:01:00.870> by<00:01:00.989> removing<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.530> CDI

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
we're going to start by removing the CDI

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
we're going to start by removing the CDI
box<00:01:02.910> mount<00:01:03.210> makes<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> little<00:01:04.320> easier<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
box mount makes it a little easier to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.210 
box mount makes it a little easier to
slide<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.949> off<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:07.320> stock<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.710> has<00:01:07.740> allen<00:01:08.130> head

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
slide it off the stock it has allen head

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
slide it off the stock it has allen head
bolts<00:01:08.549> we've<00:01:09.090> replaced<00:01:09.390> those<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.720> eight

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
bolts we've replaced those with eight

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.750 
bolts we've replaced those with eight
millimeter<00:01:10.350> head<00:01:10.470> bolts<00:01:10.740> makes<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> lot

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
millimeter head bolts makes it a lot

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.090 
millimeter head bolts makes it a lot
easier<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.180> work<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.770> pull<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.040> off

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
easier to work on so you pull that off

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.560 
easier to work on so you pull that off
and<00:01:14.430> then<00:01:14.580> right<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.939> we're<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and then right here as we're here you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.929 
and then right here as we're here you
can<00:01:15.689> also<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:16.020> we've<00:01:16.170> already<00:01:16.320> blocked<00:01:16.680> off

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
can also see we've already blocked off

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.300 
can also see we've already blocked off
the<00:01:18.170> overflow<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> oil<00:01:19.650> ever<00:01:19.860> overflow

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the overflow for the oil ever overflow

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.609 
the overflow for the oil ever overflow
so<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> motor<00:01:21.240> tasin<00:01:21.630> area<00:01:21.810> air<00:01:22.290> force

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
so the motor tasin area air force

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.920 
so the motor tasin area air force
doesn't<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.220> an<00:01:23.580> inlet<00:01:24.180> for<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.750> you'll

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
doesn't have an inlet for this so you'll

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.390 
doesn't have an inlet for this so you'll
need<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.380> some<00:01:25.619> type<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.799> system<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
need to get some type of system I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.460 
need to get some type of system I
already<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> hose<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.390> coming<00:01:28.290> off

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
already have the hose on here coming off

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.440 
already have the hose on here coming off
the<00:01:28.619> valve<00:01:28.770> cover<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.640> wraps<00:01:29.850> around<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450

new boot doesn't doesn't even have an
outlet<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.189> even<00:01:47.369> do<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.939> you'll<00:01:48.600> need<00:01:48.720> to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
outlet to even do that so you'll need to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.120 
outlet to even do that so you'll need to
do<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.990> also<00:01:49.409> we're<00:01:49.649> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> skip<00:01:49.979> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
do that also we're going to skip that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.710 
do that also we're going to skip that
step<00:01:50.280> since<00:01:50.579> we<00:01:50.729> already<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.299> already

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
step since we already have it already

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.060 
step since we already have it already
have<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.049> done<00:01:52.200> okay<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.770> we're<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
have it done okay so we're going to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.310 
have it done okay so we're going to
start<00:01:53.220> by<00:01:53.369> taking<00:01:53.610> off<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> shock<00:01:54.240> oh<00:01:54.540> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
start by taking off the shock oh you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.810 
start by taking off the shock oh you
don't<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> take<00:01:56.070> off<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.369> shock<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.729> do

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
don't have to take off the shock to do

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.550 
don't have to take off the shock to do
this<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.420> find<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.750> way<00:01:57.960> easier<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
this I just find it's way easier and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.950 
this I just find it's way easier and
quicker<00:01:58.649> than<00:01:58.829> fighting<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.780> I'm<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.930> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
quicker than fighting it so I'm going to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.230 
quicker than fighting it so I'm going to
pick<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> rear<00:02:02.219> he's<00:02:02.399> pull<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> top

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
pick up on the rear he's pull the top

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.300 
pick up on the rear he's pull the top
you<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.479> take<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> shock<00:02:03.899> top<00:02:04.229> shock<00:02:04.530> top

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you have to take the shock top shock top

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.359 
you have to take the shock top shock top
shock<00:02:05.759> mount<00:02:05.969> off<00:02:06.119> first<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.950> top<00:02:08.160> shock

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
shock mount off first it's a top shock

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.770 
shock mount off first it's a top shock
mounts<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.700> now<00:02:08.849> we<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.090> take<00:02:09.239> out<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.539> bottom

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
mounts up now we can take out the bottom

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.009 
mounts up now we can take out the bottom
one

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.699 

so<00:02:17.019> at<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:17.230> point<00:02:18.870> we<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:20.049> we<00:02:20.230> can<00:02:20.379> pull<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
so at this point we can we can pull the

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.220 
so at this point we can we can pull the
shock<00:02:20.950> out<00:02:21.159> cause<00:02:21.940> I'll<00:02:22.090> hold<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.360> over<00:02:22.629> so

here's<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.430> stock<00:03:15.640> air<00:03:15.819> boot<00:03:16.000> as<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.240> can<00:03:16.390> see

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
here's the stock air boot as you can see

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.000 
here's the stock air boot as you can see
the<00:03:16.690> stock<00:03:16.900> Honda<00:03:17.260> already<00:03:17.530> has<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.740> velocity

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
the stock Honda already has a velocity

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.590 
the stock Honda already has a velocity
stack<00:03:18.490> some<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.880> bikes<00:03:19.000> don't<00:03:19.209> have<00:03:19.420> this

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
stack some of the bikes don't have this

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.910 
stack some of the bikes don't have this
and<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.050> makes<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.260> bigger<00:03:20.440> difference<00:03:20.650> in

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
and it makes a bigger difference in

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.350 
and it makes a bigger difference in
those<00:03:20.980> bikes<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:21.790> one's<00:03:22.030> about<00:03:22.150> the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
those bikes this one's about the

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.540 
those bikes this one's about the
equivalent<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.720> stock<00:03:22.989> here<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:24.130> short<00:03:24.430> one

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
equivalent of stock here the short one

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.190 
equivalent of stock here the short one
it's<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.790> one<00:03:24.880> we're<00:03:25.000> going<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.180> run<00:03:25.360> actually

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
it's the one we're going to run actually

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.510 
it's the one we're going to run actually
goes<00:03:26.319> like<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:26.800> we're<00:03:27.220> going<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.400> put

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
goes like that so we're going to put

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.120 
goes like that so we're going to put
that<00:03:27.670> into<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.360> air<00:03:28.630> force<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.170> that's<00:03:30.010> what

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
that into the air force and that's what

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:39.190 
that into the air force and that's what
we'll<00:03:30.220> be<00:03:30.250> using

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.300 

you

boot right back on and at this point

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.650 
boot right back on and at this point
it's<00:03:56.650> really<00:03:56.770> an<00:03:56.980> easy<00:03:57.100> process<00:03:57.480> it's<00:03:58.480> just

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
it's really an easy process it's just

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.240 
it's really an easy process it's just
getting<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.990> you<00:03:59.290> know<00:03:59.380> air<00:03:59.530> box<00:03:59.740> often<00:04:00.160> on

getting the you know air box often on

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.400 
getting the you know air box often on
the<00:04:00.340> bike<00:04:00.490> that<00:04:00.670> takes<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:01.030> lot<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.150> time<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.660> so

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
the bike that takes a lot of time and so

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.170 
the bike that takes a lot of time and so
if<00:04:02.710> you're<00:04:02.860> an<00:04:02.980> average<00:04:03.280> strength<00:04:03.820> or<00:04:03.970> so<00:04:04.120> you

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
if you're an average strength or so you

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.560 
if you're an average strength or so you
can<00:04:04.390> pop<00:04:04.540> this<00:04:04.690> thing<00:04:04.870> right<00:04:05.050> on<00:04:06.480> there's<00:04:07.480> a

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
can pop this thing right on there's a

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.660 
can pop this thing right on there's a
mark<00:04:07.840> right<00:04:08.050> here<00:04:08.110> when<00:04:09.100> it<00:04:09.130> line<00:04:09.400> up<00:04:09.430> those

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
mark right here when it line up those

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.270 
mark right here when it line up those
two<00:04:09.730> marks<00:04:10.240> on<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.440> boot<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.860> then<00:04:12.130> on

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
two marks on the the boot and then on

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.770 
two marks on the the boot and then on
the<00:04:12.370> stock<00:04:12.610> air<00:04:12.820> box<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.300> so<00:04:13.390> we<00:04:13.480> know<00:04:13.600> we're

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
the stock air box and so we know we're

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.780 
the stock air box and so we know we're
straight<00:04:14.080> and<00:04:15.070> then<00:04:15.160> we<00:04:15.250> can<00:04:15.370> tighten<00:04:15.640> it<00:04:15.700> back

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
straight and then we can tighten it back

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:27.740 
straight and then we can tighten it back
up

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.750 

so<00:04:28.260> we<00:04:28.320> put<00:04:28.530> on<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.770> other<00:04:28.920> clamp<00:04:29.250> for<00:04:29.640> the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
so we put on the other clamp for the

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.940 
so we put on the other clamp for the
back<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.450> throttle<00:04:30.630> body<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.080> as<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.860> can

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
back the throttle body and as you can

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.150 
back the throttle body and as you can
see<00:04:32.010> right<00:04:32.340> here<00:04:32.460> there's<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.700> little<00:04:32.850> rubber

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
see right here there's a little rubber

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.140 
see right here there's a little rubber
indention<00:04:35.160> that<00:04:35.250> needs<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.490> go<00:04:35.580> in<00:04:35.760> that<00:04:35.940> in

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
indention that needs to go in that in

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.930 
indention that needs to go in that in
that<00:04:36.210> hole<00:04:37.080> on<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.680> clamp<00:04:37.920> so<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.670> got<00:04:38.790> that

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
that hole on the clamp so you got that

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.850 
that hole on the clamp so you got that
in<00:04:39.120> there<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.780> are<00:04:39.900> ready<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.200> reinstall<00:04:40.470> this

easy so we use just a hair bit of a

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.740 
easy so we use just a hair bit of a
chain<00:05:00.960> lube<00:05:01.760> learn<00:05:02.760> this<00:05:02.940> from<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.210> guy<00:05:03.690> at

chain lube learn this from a guy at
injection<00:05:04.260> earring<00:05:04.470> little<00:05:05.400> tip<00:05:05.580> not<00:05:06.240> very

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
injection earring little tip not very

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.360 
injection earring little tip not very
much<00:05:06.660> just<00:05:06.810> a<00:05:06.930> little<00:05:06.960> bit<00:05:07.350> because<00:05:07.800> it<00:05:08.070> stays

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
much just a little bit because it stays

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.350 
much just a little bit because it stays
wet<00:05:08.910> for<00:05:08.940> a<00:05:09.210> bit<00:05:09.390> and<00:05:10.100> dries<00:05:11.100> up<00:05:11.310> tacky<00:05:11.670> but

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
wet for a bit and dries up tacky but

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.380 
wet for a bit and dries up tacky but
that<00:05:12.510> helps<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:12.870> slide<00:05:13.110> right<00:05:13.140> on<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:15.090> one<00:05:15.270> guy

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
that helps it slide right on and one guy

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.520 
that helps it slide right on and one guy
can<00:05:15.570> usually<00:05:16.220> get<00:05:17.220> it<00:05:17.310> on<00:05:17.430> it's<00:05:17.970> on<00:05:18.169> and<00:05:19.169> so

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
can usually get it on it's on and so

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.750 
can usually get it on it's on and so
it's<00:05:19.680> boots<00:05:19.830> on<00:05:21.080> tighten<00:05:22.080> it<00:05:22.169> up<00:05:22.230> so<00:05:22.700> you<00:05:23.700> get

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
it's boots on tighten it up so you get

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.610 
it's boots on tighten it up so you get
the<00:05:23.850> boot<00:05:24.000> all<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.360> way<00:05:24.419> tight<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:24.990> that<00:05:25.440> way

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
the boot all the way tight and that way

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.020 
the boot all the way tight and that way
they<00:05:26.190> can<00:05:26.220> then<00:05:26.700> install<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.150> shock<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.880> by

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
they can then install the shock so by

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.340 
they can then install the shock so by
taking<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.330> shock<00:05:30.540> off<00:05:30.720> it<00:05:30.870> just<00:05:30.900> saves<00:05:31.169> a<00:05:31.260> lot

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
taking the shock off it just saves a lot

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.530 
taking the shock off it just saves a lot
of<00:05:31.500> hassle<00:05:31.860> so<00:05:32.370> now<00:05:32.490> we<00:05:32.550> can<00:05:32.820> move<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.210> we<00:05:33.419> can

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
of hassle so now we can move the we can

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.420 
of hassle so now we can move the we can
pivot<00:05:33.690> this<00:05:33.810> around<00:05:34.230> while<00:05:34.919> we<00:05:35.010> install<00:05:35.310> the

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
pivot this around while we install the

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.150 
pivot this around while we install the
shock<00:05:35.610> back<00:05:35.970> in<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.210> bike<00:05:36.360> so<00:05:36.930> now<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.160> install

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
shock back in the bike so now to install

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.670 
shock back in the bike so now to install
the<00:05:38.280> shock<00:05:38.460> just<00:05:38.790> kind<00:05:39.570> of<00:05:39.630> lightly<00:05:39.870> pull<00:05:40.590> the
