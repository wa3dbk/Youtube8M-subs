00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
order to create these I don't know if

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.819 
order to create these I don't know if
they're<00:00:48.000> modded<00:00:48.390> glitched<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.170> don't

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
they're modded glitched or I don't
