out<00:02:42.210> there<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> little<00:02:42.780> bit<00:02:43.020> different<00:02:43.530> than

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
out there a little bit different than

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
they were in previous versions but

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.360 
they were in previous versions but
basically<00:02:46.020> what<00:02:46.230> they<00:02:46.350> are<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.620> color<00:02:46.950> coding

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
want to see all your filename extensions

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.610 
want to see all your filename extensions
to<00:03:49.329> be<00:03:49.449> honest<00:03:49.780> with<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.109> haven't<00:03:50.469> used

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
to be honest with you I haven't used

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.619 
to be honest with you I haven't used
that<00:03:50.739> in<00:03:51.069> years<00:03:51.400> but<00:03:52.000> if<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.180> want<00:03:52.359> to<00:03:52.419> see<00:03:52.510> the

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
that in years but if you want to see the

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.740 
that in years but if you want to see the
extensions<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.469> can<00:03:54.000> show<00:03:55.000> warning<00:03:55.419> before

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
extensions you can show warning before

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.629 
extensions you can show warning before
changing<00:03:56.230> an<00:03:56.319> extension<00:03:56.889> I<00:03:57.069> do<00:03:57.129> leave<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.609> on

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
changing an extension I do leave that on

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.610 
changing an extension I do leave that on
so<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.359> have<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.599> file<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.290> think<00:03:59.560> needs

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
so you have a file that you think needs

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.860 
so you have a file that you think needs
to<00:03:59.980> have<00:04:00.189> an<00:04:00.280> extension<00:04:00.819> change<00:04:01.209> down<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.689> so

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
to have an extension change down it so

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.569 
to have an extension change down it so
it<00:04:01.930> can<00:04:02.049> be<00:04:02.169> read<00:04:02.409> correctly<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:03.129> will<00:04:03.250> warn

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
it can be read correctly it will warn

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.399 
it can be read correctly it will warn
you<00:04:03.699> before<00:04:04.419> it<00:04:04.509> allows<00:04:04.689> you<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:04.959> do<00:04:05.109> it<00:04:05.229> so<00:04:05.379> you

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
you before it allows you to do it so you

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:06.899 
you before it allows you to do it so you
sure<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:05.739> want<00:04:05.979> to<00:04:06.040> do<00:04:06.159> that<00:04:06.189> and<00:04:06.519> that's

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
sure you want to do that and that's

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.520 
sure you want to do that and that's
probably<00:04:07.150> not<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.599> bad<00:04:07.689> thing<00:04:08.019> to<00:04:08.079> leave<00:04:08.349> on

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
probably not a bad thing to leave on

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.830 
probably not a bad thing to leave on
show<00:04:09.250> warning<00:04:09.699> before<00:04:10.030> emptying<00:04:10.359> the<00:04:10.659> trash

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
show warning before emptying the trash

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.259 
show warning before emptying the trash
so<00:04:11.319> if<00:04:12.009> you<00:04:12.099> try<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.310> empty<00:04:12.609> trash<00:04:12.909> it's<00:04:13.120> going

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
so if you try to empty trash it's going

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.179 
so if you try to empty trash it's going
to<00:04:13.329> say<00:04:13.479> are<00:04:13.599> you<00:04:13.750> sure<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:14.319> do<00:04:14.859> like<00:04:15.129> that

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
to say are you sure I do like that

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.159 
to say are you sure I do like that
option<00:04:15.519> because<00:04:16.060> I<00:04:16.090> have<00:04:16.299> accidentally<00:04:16.959> once

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
option because I have accidentally once

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.560 
option because I have accidentally once
or<00:04:17.320> twice<00:04:17.440> hit<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.099> trash<00:04:18.370> icon<00:04:18.639> without

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.479 
or twice hit the trash icon without
thinking<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.169> it<00:04:20.349> does<00:04:20.530> warn<00:04:20.829> me<00:04:21.039> so<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.250> know<00:04:21.370> I

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
thinking and it does warn me so I know I

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.120 
empty but if you hold the option key
down<00:04:25.449> and<00:04:25.780> it's<00:04:26.229> also<00:04:26.409> called<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.800> alt<00:04:26.979> key

do that empty trash securely actually

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.310 
do that empty trash securely actually
gives<00:04:42.520> you<00:04:42.669> an<00:04:42.820> option<00:04:43.000> to<00:04:43.270> empty<00:04:43.750> trash<00:04:44.050> where

gives you an option to empty trash where

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.620 
gives you an option to empty trash where
it<00:04:44.349> destroys<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.310> evidence<00:04:45.340> if<00:04:45.909> you<00:04:45.940> will<00:04:46.090> now

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
it destroys the evidence if you will now

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.360

I'm<00:04:46.690> not<00:04:46.750> James<00:04:47.139> Bond<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:48.039> I<00:04:48.070> don't<00:04:48.250> usually

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
I'm not James Bond so I don't usually

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.279 
I'm not James Bond so I don't usually
have<00:04:48.699> too<00:04:48.940> many<00:04:49.060> things<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:49.900> would<00:04:50.139> be

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
have too many things that I would be

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.010 
have too many things that I would be
afraid<00:04:50.500> somebody<00:04:50.949> would<00:04:51.070> come<00:04:51.280> back<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.699> get

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
afraid somebody would come back and get

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.540 
afraid somebody would come back and get
so<00:04:53.020> if<00:04:53.320> you<00:04:53.530> want<00:04:53.770> to<00:04:53.889> do<00:04:54.009> it<00:04:54.159> that<00:04:54.340> way<00:04:54.490> you

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
so if you want to do it that way you

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.790 
so if you want to do it that way you
turn<00:04:54.880> that<00:04:55.030> on<00:04:55.090> but<00:04:55.419> that<00:04:55.449> means<00:04:55.780> every<00:04:56.289> single

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
turn that on but that means every single

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.550 
turn that on but that means every single
time<00:04:57.130> you<00:04:57.159> empty<00:04:57.820> your<00:04:57.849> trash<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:58.750> will<00:04:59.440> go

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
time you empty your trash it will go

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.680 
time you empty your trash it will go
through<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.770> secure<00:05:00.310> empty<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:01.300> can<00:05:01.449> take

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
through a secure empty and that can take

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.779 
through a secure empty and that can take
well<00:05:02.050> it<00:05:02.169> can<00:05:02.289> take<00:05:02.440> minutes<00:05:02.800> if<00:05:02.979> not<00:05:03.009> hours<00:05:03.520> if

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
well it can take minutes if not hours if
