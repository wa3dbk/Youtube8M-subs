range and pray mage and you wouldn't be
able<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.399> hit<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.350> but<00:01:52.350> now<00:01:52.500> they<00:01:52.799> have

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
able to get hit and but now they have

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.230 
able to get hit and but now they have
like<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.159> blue<00:01:53.460> orb<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.820> spins<00:01:54.090> around

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
like this blue orb that spins around

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.840 
like this blue orb that spins around
them<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.750> very<00:01:57.750> tricky<00:01:58.140> because

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
them and that is a very tricky because

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.010 
them and that is a very tricky because
if<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.000> hit<00:02:00.180> them<00:02:00.270> while<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> Blue<00:02:00.750> Orb<00:02:00.930> is

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
if you hit them while the Blue Orb is

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
if you hit them while the Blue Orb is
spinning<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.219> they<00:02:02.520> don't<00:02:02.700> take

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
spinning then it just they don't take

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.490 
spinning then it just they don't take
any<00:02:03.060> damage<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.840> take<00:02:04.049> everything<00:02:04.469> that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
any damage and you take everything that

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.139 
any damage and you take everything that
you<00:02:04.680> would<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:04.920> hit<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.130> them<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.030> you

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
you would have hit on them so if you

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.700 
you would have hit on them so if you
were<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.360> hit<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.630> 250<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.560> blue

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
were going to hit like 250 with a blue

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.580 
were going to hit like 250 with a blue
orb<00:02:07.890> sir<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.640> then<00:02:08.789> take<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.000> 250<00:02:09.690> yourself<00:02:09.989> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
orb sir you then take a 250 yourself and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.980 
orb sir you then take a 250 yourself and
you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.640> see<00:02:11.760> you'll<00:02:11.879> be<00:02:11.970> able<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.150> say

am<00:02:54.870> without<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:55.800> cannon<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.790> overall<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.180> do

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
am without a cannon so overall you do

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.890

you<00:02:58.440> do<00:02:58.650> make<00:02:59.070> money<00:02:59.610> faster<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:00.630> a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
you do make money faster but it's just a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.920 
you do make money faster but it's just a
hell<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.830> lot<00:03:01.920> more<00:03:01.950> confusing<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:03.660> it's

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
hell of a lot more confusing and it's

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.330 
hell of a lot more confusing and it's
already<00:03:04.140> confusing<00:03:04.500> as<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.770> because

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
already confusing as it is because

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.700 
already confusing as it is because
you've<00:03:05.460> got<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.900> because<00:03:06.900> frost<00:03:07.140> drags<00:03:07.410> and

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
you've got to because frost drags and

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.980 
you've got to because frost drags and
use<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.520> well<00:03:08.940> they<00:03:09.030> use<00:03:09.180> all<00:03:09.360> types<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.690> attack

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
use to well they use all types of attack

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.270 
use to well they use all types of attack
but<00:03:10.200> if<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.350> just<00:03:10.560> stand<00:03:10.680> back<00:03:10.890> they<00:03:11.100> don't

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
but if you just stand back they don't

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.460 
but if you just stand back they don't
use<00:03:11.400> melee<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:12.660> you've<00:03:12.780> got<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.960> blue<00:03:13.140> up<00:03:13.320> to

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
use melee so you've got the blue up to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.140 
use melee so you've got the blue up to
look<00:03:13.590> after<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.160> like<00:03:14.340> watch<00:03:14.520> out<00:03:14.700> for<00:03:14.970> and

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
look after and like watch out for and

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.610 
look after and like watch out for and
then<00:03:15.720> you've<00:03:15.840> got<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.990> see<00:03:16.200> what<00:03:16.320> their<00:03:16.440> first

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
then you've got to see what their first

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.560 
then you've got to see what their first
attack<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.400> then<00:03:17.520> protect<00:03:18.090> against<00:03:18.450> it

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
attack is and then protect against it

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.390 
attack is and then protect against it
and<00:03:18.800> because<00:03:19.800> that's<00:03:19.950> what<00:03:20.070> they<00:03:20.130> use<00:03:20.280> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
and because that's what they use the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.390 
and because that's what they use the
whole<00:03:20.520> way<00:03:20.610> through<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.850> fight<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:22.130> be<00:03:23.130> I've

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
whole way through the fight and be I've

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.040 
whole way through the fight and be I've
like<00:03:23.580> cut<00:03:24.090> out<00:03:24.210> most<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.660> parts<00:03:24.990> and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
like cut out most of the parts and

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.210 
like cut out most of the parts and
obviously<00:03:25.320> sped<00:03:25.530> up<00:03:25.680> because<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.040> don't<00:03:26.190> want

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
obviously sped up because you don't want

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.160
