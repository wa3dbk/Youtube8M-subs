00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.080 
that state championship so yeah I host
think<00:03:34.240> we<00:03:34.390> worked<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:35.020> hard<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.700> they<00:03:36.700> wanted

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
think we worked so hard and they wanted

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.460 
think we worked so hard and they wanted
it<00:03:37.240> last<00:03:37.540> year<00:03:37.750> obviously<00:03:37.900> was<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.230> great

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
it last year obviously was a great

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.680 
it last year obviously was a great
season<00:03:38.680> two<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.220> think<00:03:39.460> it's<00:03:40.150> different

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
season two and I think it's different

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.060 
season two and I think it's different
this<00:03:40.810> year<00:03:40.870> because<00:03:41.140> we<00:03:41.410> were<00:03:41.590> unknown<00:03:41.920> like

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
this year because we were unknown like

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.520 
this year because we were unknown like
that<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.430> we<00:03:42.820> came<00:03:43.030> into<00:03:43.240> this<00:03:43.450> season<00:03:43.660> having

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
that and we came into this season having

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.380 
that and we came into this season having
a<00:03:44.590> mindset<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:45.040> prove<00:03:45.250> people<00:03:45.400> wrong<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.120> we

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
a mindset to prove people wrong and we

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.000 
a mindset to prove people wrong and we
worked<00:03:46.630> hard<00:03:46.900> every<00:03:47.110> single<00:03:47.290> day<00:03:47.620> and

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
worked hard every single day and

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.400 
worked hard every single day and
practice<00:03:48.430> getting<00:03:48.730> as<00:03:48.940> many<00:03:49.660> extra<00:03:50.080> reps<00:03:50.260> as

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
practice getting as many extra reps as

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.110 
practice getting as many extra reps as
we<00:03:50.530> can<00:03:50.740> and<00:03:50.950> they<00:03:51.400> paid<00:03:51.610> off<00:03:51.790> tonight<00:03:52.090> and

Hannah was getting us the balls and we

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.610 
Hannah was getting us the balls and we
just<00:04:06.310> swung<00:04:07.030> away<00:04:07.180> he's<00:04:07.990> like<00:04:08.200> what<00:04:08.350> was<00:04:08.470> our

just swung away he's like what was our

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.930 
just swung away he's like what was our
mentality<00:04:08.920> was<00:04:09.220> because<00:04:09.460> this<00:04:09.580> is<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.760> last

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
mentality was because this is the last

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.270 
mentality was because this is the last
game<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.360> we're<00:04:10.450> gonna<00:04:10.510> spank<00:04:10.810> she's<00:04:11.710> stepped

and on top of that everybody's bought

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.680 
and on top of that everybody's bought
into<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.490> system<00:04:48.880> that<00:04:49.030> we're<00:04:49.419> going<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.630> be

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
into the system that we're going to be

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.330 
into the system that we're going to be
the<00:04:50.110> best<00:04:50.290> defensive<00:04:50.770> team<00:04:50.890> in<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.070> state<00:04:51.280> and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
the best defensive team in the state and

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.159 
the best defensive team in the state and
I<00:04:51.490> think<00:04:51.669> we<00:04:51.730> proved<00:04:51.970> it<00:04:52.060> we<00:04:52.510> have<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.690> funny<00:04:53.020> one

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
I think we proved it we have a funny one

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.250 
I think we proved it we have a funny one
then<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:53.350> think<00:04:53.680> we<00:04:54.190> wanted<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.550> go<00:04:54.730> down

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
then I think we wanted to go down

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.620 
then I think we wanted to go down
we<00:04:55.620> weren't<00:04:55.770> gonna<00:04:55.950> let<00:04:56.040> we<00:04:56.910> were<00:04:57.030> not<00:04:57.330> going

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
we weren't gonna let we were not going

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.050 
we weren't gonna let we were not going
