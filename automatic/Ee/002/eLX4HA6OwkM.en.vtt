00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.520 
almost don't even need a detector at
this<00:01:32.460> point<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.030> start<00:01:33.479> moving<00:01:33.810> some<00:01:33.990> more<00:01:34.200> dirt

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530

of glass war nails a square nail comes

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.580 
of glass war nails a square nail comes
out<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.259> there

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
think this is actually the midden oh I I

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
think this is actually the midden oh I I
have<00:01:53.280> no<00:01:53.310> doubt<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.090> exactly<00:01:54.750> where
