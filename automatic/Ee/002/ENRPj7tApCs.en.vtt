some you know some real side missions
and<00:02:45.859> something<00:02:46.859> else<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.220> thought<00:02:47.489> would<00:02:47.609> be<00:02:47.639> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
and something else I thought would be a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.809 
and something else I thought would be a
good<00:02:47.970> idea<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:48.450> care<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.959> creation<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:50.040> if

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
good idea for care of the creation is if

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.819 
good idea for care of the creation is if
you<00:02:50.970> could<00:02:51.180> be<00:02:51.359> you<00:02:51.599> know<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:52.019> this<00:02:52.409> mode

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
you could be you know on this mode

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.740 
you could be you know on this mode
that's<00:02:53.700> why<00:02:53.879> I<00:02:53.939> think<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.269> should<00:02:54.450> be<00:02:54.480> called

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
that's why I think it should be called

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.289 
that's why I think it should be called
hero<00:02:55.019> most<00:02:55.290> recall<00:02:55.709> something<00:02:56.010> else<00:02:56.370> you

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
really you know he's really margin boys

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.789 
really you know he's really margin boys
just<00:03:53.009> one<00:03:53.340> being<00:03:53.699> but<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.720> know<00:03:54.870> if<00:03:55.169> they<00:03:55.349> want

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
just one being but you know if they want

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.619 
just one being but you know if they want
to<00:03:55.919> know<00:03:56.040> date<00:03:56.639> they<00:03:56.669> could<00:03:57.120> throw<00:03:57.269> him<00:03:57.479> in

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
to know date they could throw him in

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:58.909 
to know date they could throw him in
there<00:03:57.750> but<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:57.989> think<00:03:58.259> the<00:03:58.349> three<00:03:58.590> essential

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
there but I think the three essential

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.679 
there but I think the three essential
ones<00:03:59.400> that<00:03:59.579> should<00:03:59.759> have<00:04:00.090> its<00:04:00.750> saying

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:02.689 
ones that should have its saying

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.289 
ones that should have its saying
namekian<00:04:03.689> and<00:04:03.959> Android<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.919> all<00:04:05.159> in<00:04:05.549> human<00:04:06.060> too

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
namekian and Android it all in human too

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.599 
namekian and Android it all in human too
then<00:04:07.229> they<00:04:07.470> want<00:04:07.709> they<00:04:07.829> can<00:04:07.949> add<00:04:08.159> the<00:04:08.370> mall

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
then they want they can add the mall

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.899 
then they want they can add the mall
margin<00:04:09.150> group<00:04:09.389> I<00:04:10.310> think<00:04:11.310> though<00:04:11.489> should<00:04:11.790> be

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
margin group I think though should be

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.420 
margin group I think though should be
the<00:04:12.030> ones<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.479> haven't<00:04:12.750> yet<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.799> turn<00:04:14.129> more

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
the ones that haven't yet a turn more

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.670 
the ones that haven't yet a turn more
than<00:04:14.639> just<00:04:14.849> super<00:04:15.209> Sam<00:04:15.449> one<00:04:15.870> with<00:04:16.139> about<00:04:16.320> two

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
than just super Sam one with about two

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.550 
than just super Sam one with about two
and<00:04:16.979> three<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.810> also

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
and three and also

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.520 
and three and also
the<00:04:20.130> namekian<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:20.970> know<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.989> know<00:04:22.139> as<00:04:22.350> they

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
the namekian you know you know as they

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.080 
the namekian you know you know as they
get<00:04:22.680> stronger<00:04:23.040> they<00:04:23.520> they<00:04:23.700> should<00:04:23.880> be<00:04:23.970> at<00:04:24.060> a

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
get stronger they they should be at a

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.909 
get stronger they they should be at a
fuse<00:04:24.510> with<00:04:24.720> other<00:04:24.900> than<00:04:25.050> American<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.740> get

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
fuse with other than American to get

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.790 
fuse with other than American to get
stronger<00:04:26.370> an<00:04:27.210> Android<00:04:27.840> if<00:04:28.020> it's<00:04:28.169> angela's

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
stronger an Android if it's angela's

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.230 
stronger an Android if it's angela's
they'll<00:04:28.980> draw<00:04:29.310> power<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.910> could<00:04:30.060> keep

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
they'll draw power it could keep

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.830 
they'll draw power it could keep
resolving<00:04:30.870> power<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.500> get<00:04:31.680> stronger<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.840> boo

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
resolving power to get stronger and boo

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.570 
resolving power to get stronger and boo
you<00:04:34.080> know<00:04:34.139> he's<00:04:34.350> just<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.680> draw<00:04:34.980> people<00:04:35.010> and

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
you know he's just to draw people and

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.120 
you know he's just to draw people and
get<00:04:35.730> strong<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.090> stuff<00:04:36.600> anyway<00:04:37.560> this<00:04:37.740> is<00:04:37.919> what

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
get strong and stuff anyway this is what

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.129 
get strong and stuff anyway this is what
I<00:04:38.160> think<00:04:38.639> that<00:04:39.240> character<00:04:39.690> creation<00:04:40.110> should

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
I think that character creation should

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.740 
I think that character creation should
be<00:04:40.500> like<00:04:40.740> child<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.790> have<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.090> bunch<00:04:42.389> of<00:04:42.510> side

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
be like child you have a bunch of side

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.770 
be like child you have a bunch of side
missions<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:43.889> main<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.610> main<00:04:44.639> story<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.419> hero

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
missions the main the main story of hero

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.659 
missions the main the main story of hero
mode<00:04:45.990> should<00:04:46.200> also<00:04:46.440> be<00:04:46.740> longer<00:04:47.190> too<00:04:49.430> yeah<00:04:50.430> and

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
mode should also be longer too yeah and

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.760 
mode should also be longer too yeah and
there<00:04:50.820> should<00:04:50.970> be<00:04:51.090> more<00:04:51.330> races<00:04:51.990> those<00:04:52.380> those

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
there should be more races those those

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.409 
there should be more races those those
are<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:53.070> three<00:04:53.310> essential<00:04:53.550> things<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.150> think

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
are the three essential things I think

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.730 
are the three essential things I think
they<00:04:54.570> should<00:04:54.780> improve<00:04:55.139> and<00:04:55.410> they<00:04:55.470> would<00:04:55.620> have

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
they should improve and they would have

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.360 
they should improve and they would have
a<00:04:55.770> much<00:04:56.100> better<00:04:56.900> much<00:04:57.900> better<00:04:57.960> kept<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:59.160> have

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
a much better much better kept you have

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.980 
a much better much better kept you have
a<00:04:59.400> much<00:04:59.760> better<00:05:00.030> character<00:05:00.540> creation

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
a much better character creation

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.990 
a much better character creation
experience<00:05:01.590> if<00:05:01.710> they<00:05:01.860> added<00:05:02.250> those<00:05:02.400> tanks

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
experience if they added those tanks

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.300 
experience if they added those tanks
anyways<00:05:03.210> that's<00:05:03.930> just<00:05:04.139> my<00:05:04.380> thoughts<00:05:04.740> they

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
anyways that's just my thoughts they

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.890 
anyways that's just my thoughts they
