00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hi, I'm very welcome to continue 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.000
 everyone today we're going to make a coconut plan 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.309
 and to do it we're going to need the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.540
 following ingredients 500 milliliters or 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.619
 2 cups of milk if possible whole 4 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.320
 eggs 140 grams or 5 eighths of a cup 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.420
 sugar and 50 grams with half a cup of 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.869
 striped egg for candy we can 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.269
 use that is sold already done or do it with 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.460
 100 grams or half a cup of sugar 3 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.289
 tablespoons of water and a splash of juice 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 of lemon to make our plans 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.610
 let's use this type of flan heras 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.320
 that as you can see there are normal and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.270
 single use but you can also use 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520
 to do in a big flanera like this 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.170
 first let's make the candy well 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.539
 that we put the 100 grams of sugar in 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.079
 a frying pan we add the trickle of 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.270
 lemon juice and 3 tablespoons of water 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.950
 I'm going to put my brand plate on medium heat 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.750
 no need to move it we see how it 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.030
 is doing little by little and is acquiring 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.950
 a thin color once you have 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.510
 this color of the breath we turn the town 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.030
 we remove and we are going to put a 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.470
 spoonful in each mold and if you want 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.960
 you can move it a little so that it 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.760
 fill the edges and once the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.800
 molds are ready we continue with the 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.530
 recipes I'm going to put to preheat the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.420
 175 degree large oven and now 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.490
 we put the eggs in a container and 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.490
 let's move on to beat them lightly 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.970
 let's go adding the little sugar to 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.970
 little and beating lightly 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.170
 and we will do the same with milk 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.380
 and now let's move on to pour the mixture 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.840
 Once cast as I will be adding 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.350
 little by little the coconut while we beat 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.350
 slightly 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.640
 and we now fill the molds 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.100
 and we're going to move them into the 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.870
 I put the oven on a baking 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.970
 make them in a water bath, but also 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.520
 can do in a pot and now I'm going to 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.060
 add hot water to half of 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.060
 baking tin 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.509
 as we see the molds are already covered 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.250
 of water up to the middle so what 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.860
 we leave with heat with the river below 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.930
 at 175 degrees 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.850
 in my case 40 minutes have passed and the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.530
 dogs are already ready so we're going to 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.050
 take out the tray from the oven with a lot 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.250
 carefully and carefully we will go taking 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.250
 those out of the tray 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.330
 and once outside we're going to let it 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.890
 cool to room temperature once 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.690
 that are at room temperature 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.270
 we put a film and we are going to keep it in 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.920
 the refrigerator a minimum of 4 hours already 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.430
 it's been four hours so we're going to 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.430
 take them out 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.990
 now let's move on to demold it with 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.990
 help of a knife 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.130
 we turn it over on a plate and you're done 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.840
 look how it looks is beautiful and look 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.030
 how I tremble kids eat this 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.220
 I already liked if you liked to portray 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.350

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.940

 you have them to another 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.030
 description and now I'm going to try the flan 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.420
 have started because I never 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.420
 tried 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.959
 Coconut flan and egg what a rich sir in 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.959
