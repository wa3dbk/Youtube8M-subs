00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.759
 perfect substitute of open up in katy 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.920

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.210
 I always asked in the next 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.820

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.190
 simple just like they operated katy 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.970
 we can look for anything, let's say 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.970
 There are files 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.280

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.700
