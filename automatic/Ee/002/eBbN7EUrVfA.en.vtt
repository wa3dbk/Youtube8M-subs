any drastic changes in temperature

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.200

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.789 
around and I also decided to put in a
KitKat<00:02:42.910> because<00:02:43.840> my<00:02:43.989> friend<00:02:44.260> really<00:02:44.440> likes

that somewhere and we're done

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.449 
that somewhere and we're done

idea<00:02:54.850> because<00:02:55.359> I'm<00:02:55.569> pretty<00:02:55.720> sure<00:02:55.870> that

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
idea because I'm pretty sure that

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.050 
idea because I'm pretty sure that
anybody<00:02:56.829> would<00:02:57.040> love<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.340> receive<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:57.819> gift

and<00:02:58.359> it's<00:02:58.720> also<00:02:58.900> very<00:02:59.049> inexpensive<00:02:59.590> I'm

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
and it's also very inexpensive I'm

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.550 
and it's also very inexpensive I'm
pretty<00:03:00.370> sure<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.670> mine<00:03:00.880> was<00:03:01.090> under<00:03:01.329> $25<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.380> I

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
pretty sure that mine was under $25 so I

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.220 
pretty sure that mine was under $25 so I
think<00:03:02.799> that's<00:03:03.040> very<00:03:03.340> reasonable<00:03:03.639> and<00:03:04.239> I'd

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
think that's very reasonable and I'd

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.840 
think that's very reasonable and I'd
also<00:03:05.470> like<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.769> point<00:03:05.889> out<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.220> I<00:03:06.430> do<00:03:06.489> know

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
also like to point out that I do know

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.940 
also like to point out that I do know

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
that bethany mota did this idea in one

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.069 
that bethany mota did this idea in one
of<00:03:09.069> her<00:03:09.220> recent<00:03:09.430> videos<00:03:09.910> but<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.480> tried<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.930> make

mine a little bit different because I

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.190

I'm<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:39.450> trimming<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.840> cake<00:03:40.080> because<00:03:40.470> the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
I'm just trimming the cake because the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.650 
I'm just trimming the cake because the
center<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.370> cake<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:41.850> definitely<00:03:42.450> more

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
center of the cake is definitely more

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.690 
center of the cake is definitely more
easy<00:03:42.990> to<00:03:43.170> fit<00:03:43.440> inside<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.770> jar<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.490> looks

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
easy to fit inside the jar and it looks

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.700 
easy to fit inside the jar and it looks
a<00:03:44.850> lot<00:03:45.000> nicer<00:03:45.210> since<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.870> doesn't<00:03:46.020> slant<00:03:46.470> and

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
a lot nicer since it doesn't slant and

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.860 
a lot nicer since it doesn't slant and
so<00:03:47.160> I'm<00:03:47.280> just<00:03:47.490> removing<00:03:47.730> those<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.450> setting

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
so I'm just removing those and setting

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.310 
so I'm just removing those and setting
inside<00:03:52.700> now<00:03:53.700> I'm<00:03:53.730> placing<00:03:54.120> my<00:03:54.390> jar<00:03:54.660> on<00:03:54.900> top<00:03:55.200> of

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
inside now I'm placing my jar on top of

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.770 
inside now I'm placing my jar on top of
the<00:03:55.380> cake<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.800> see<00:03:56.010> where<00:03:56.730> about<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.180> should<00:03:57.540> cut

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
the cake to see where about I should cut

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.810 
the cake to see where about I should cut
so<00:03:58.350> that<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.770> piece<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.100> cake<00:03:59.280> fits<00:03:59.580> nicely

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
so that the piece of cake fits nicely

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.510 
so that the piece of cake fits nicely
inside<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.420> jar<00:04:00.710> now<00:04:01.710> I'm<00:04:01.980> cutting<00:04:02.370> that

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
inside the jar now I'm cutting that

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.340 
inside the jar now I'm cutting that
section<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.120> cake<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.540> half<00:04:03.570> so<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:04.140> the

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
section of the cake in half so that the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.960 
section of the cake in half so that the
cake<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.830> jar<00:04:05.010> can<00:04:05.220> have<00:04:05.400> more<00:04:05.700> layers

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
cake and the jar can have more layers

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.030 
cake and the jar can have more layers
and<00:04:06.270> I'm<00:04:06.780> trimming<00:04:07.170> them<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.800> fits

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
and I'm trimming them so that it fits

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.440 
and I'm trimming them so that it fits
