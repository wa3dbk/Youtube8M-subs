are the prerequisites for this trick one
might<00:00:15.570> think<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> pop<00:00:16.170> shuvit<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
might think that the pop shuvit and the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.349 
might think that the pop shuvit and the
360<00:00:17.400> pop<00:00:17.580> shuvit<00:00:17.820> should<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.180> list

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
360 pop shuvit should be on the list

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.650 
360 pop shuvit should be on the list
well<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.410> kind<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.189> agree<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.180> honest<00:00:21.480> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
well I kind of agree just to be honest I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.929 
well I kind of agree just to be honest I
don't<00:00:21.869> know<00:00:22.080> how<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> 360<00:00:22.949> pop<00:00:23.100> shuvit<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.850> I'm

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
don't know how to 360 pop shuvit and I'm

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.790 
don't know how to 360 pop shuvit and I'm
pretty<00:00:24.210> sure<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.600> land<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.930> 540<00:00:25.410> pop<00:00:25.560> shuvit

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
pretty sure I can land a 540 pop shuvit

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.980 
pretty sure I can land a 540 pop shuvit
better<00:00:26.160> than<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> simple<00:00:26.699> pop<00:00:26.880> shuvit<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.869> I'm

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
better than a simple pop shuvit but I'm

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.620 
better than a simple pop shuvit but I'm
 weird<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.070> yeah<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.210> pop<00:00:30.390> shuvit

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
 weird so yeah the pop shuvit

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.089 
 weird so yeah the pop shuvit
helps<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:30.960> understand<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.289> motion<00:00:31.500> this

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
helps you understand the motion this

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.709 
helps you understand the motion this
idea<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> back<00:00:32.940> foot<00:00:33.210> makes<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> board

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
idea that the back foot makes the board

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.270 
idea that the back foot makes the board
rotate<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> front<00:00:34.770> foot<00:00:34.920> keeps<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
rotate and the front foot keeps the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.979 
rotate and the front foot keeps the
board<00:00:35.430> stable<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.059> under<00:00:36.360> your<00:00:36.540> featuring

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
board stable and under your featuring

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.290 
board stable and under your featuring
the<00:00:37.079> rotation<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.190> 540<00:00:38.640> pop<00:00:38.790> shuvit<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the rotation the 540 pop shuvit is

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.180 
the rotation the 540 pop shuvit is
basically<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> same<00:00:40.140> idea<00:00:40.469> but<00:00:40.770> with<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
basically the same idea but with a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.950 
basically the same idea but with a
different<00:00:41.579> foot<00:00:41.760> placement<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.840> will

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
different foot placement which you will

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.630 
different foot placement which you will
need<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.350> order<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.800> throw<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> board<00:00:44.250> harder

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
need in order to throw the board harder

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.700 
need in order to throw the board harder
for<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.059> fast<00:00:45.270> rotation<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.469> may<00:00:46.590> have

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
for a fast rotation as you may have

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
for a fast rotation as you may have
guessed<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.280> hard<00:00:47.489> part<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.879> keeping<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
guessed the hard part is keeping it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.310 
guessed the hard part is keeping it
under<00:00:48.450> control<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.989> steps<00:00:55.050> I'm

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
under control so here are the steps I'm

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.869 
under control so here are the steps I'm
gonna<00:00:55.440> walk<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.770> guys<00:00:55.890> through<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.640> foot

me<00:01:05.070> first<00:01:05.250> show<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> flip<00:01:05.820> placement<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
me first show you the flip placement I

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.840 
me first show you the flip placement I
put<00:01:07.110> my<00:01:07.229> back<00:01:07.409> foot<00:01:07.619> similar<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> 360<00:01:08.549> flip

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
put my back foot similar to the 360 flip

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
put my back foot similar to the 360 flip
but<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:09.960> able<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.229> scoop<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.619> more<00:01:10.830> for<00:01:11.130> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
but to be able to scoop it more for that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.130 
but to be able to scoop it more for that
extra<00:01:11.490> rotation<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:12.180> put<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.659> foot<00:01:12.810> more<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
extra rotation I put my foot more in the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.020 
extra rotation I put my foot more in the
concave<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.130> twist<00:01:14.369> my<00:01:14.490> ankle<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.820> little

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
concave and I twist my ankle a little

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
concave and I twist my ankle a little
bit<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.900> throw<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.140> harder<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.040> front

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
bit so I can throw it harder the front

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
bit so I can throw it harder the front
foot<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.580> free<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> decide<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> closer<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
foot is free to decide but the closer to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
foot is free to decide but the closer to
the<00:01:19.409> other<00:01:19.560> foot<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.040> faster<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> boarder

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the other foot the faster the boarder

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.219 
the other foot the faster the boarder
will<00:01:20.880> rotate<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> less<00:01:21.720> control<00:01:21.869> you'll

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
will rotate and the less control you'll

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.440 
will rotate and the less control you'll
have<00:01:22.350> over<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.430> mine<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.360> the

have over it I put mine here with the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.940 
have over it I put mine here with the
toes<00:01:24.659> facing<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> front<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> board

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
toes facing the front of the board

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.649 
toes facing the front of the board
because<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.610> my<00:01:26.729> shoulders<00:01:27.150> turned<00:01:27.509> in

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
because I have my shoulders turned in

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.090 
because I have my shoulders turned in
order<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.110> looking<00:01:28.439> at<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> nose<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
