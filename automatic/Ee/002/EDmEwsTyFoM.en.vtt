as<00:00:23.450> you<00:00:23.660> can<00:00:23.810> see<00:00:23.960> by<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.200> Suns<00:00:24.440> below<00:00:24.880> so

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
as you can see by the Suns below so

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.270 
as you can see by the Suns below so
before<00:00:26.270> yeah<00:00:27.050> might<00:00:27.440> as<00:00:27.530> well<00:00:27.620> get<00:00:27.770> into<00:00:27.920> it<00:00:28.100> so

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
before yeah might as well get into it so

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.620 
before yeah might as well get into it so
I'm<00:00:28.490> gonna<00:00:28.610> start<00:00:28.940> off<00:00:29.060> with<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:29.300> taming

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
I'm gonna start off with the taming

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.930 
I'm gonna start off with the taming
process<00:00:30.050> first<00:00:30.320> now<00:00:31.100> it<00:00:31.280> might<00:00:31.400> not<00:00:31.580> be<00:00:31.760> your

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
process first now it might not be your

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.150 
process first now it might not be your
every<00:00:32.270> average<00:00:32.509> taming<00:00:33.199> like<00:00:33.559> as<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:34.010> would

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
every average taming like as you would

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.979 
every average taming like as you would
think<00:00:34.370> if<00:00:34.760> you<00:00:34.969> played<00:00:35.239> like<00:00:35.449> most<00:00:35.749> creatures

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
think if you played like most creatures

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.779 
think if you played like most creatures
mud<00:00:36.350> or<00:00:36.469> something<00:00:36.559> before<00:00:36.859> like<00:00:37.550> in<00:00:37.579> that

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
mud or something before like in that

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:39.549 
mud or something before like in that
game<00:00:37.999> what<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:38.300> do<00:00:38.420> is<00:00:38.539> right-click<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.320> name

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
game what you do is right-click you name

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:40.989 
game what you do is right-click you name
him<00:00:39.769> and<00:00:40.070> then<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:40.249> can<00:00:40.399> carry<00:00:40.550> him<00:00:40.789> on<00:00:40.850> your

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:40.999 
him and then you can carry him on your

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.489 
him and then you can carry him on your
head<00:00:41.089> if<00:00:41.210> you're<00:00:41.300> right-clicking<00:00:41.719> again<00:00:41.839> this

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:42.499 
head if you're right-clicking again this

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:44.139 
head if you're right-clicking again this
game<00:00:42.739> it's<00:00:42.920> rather<00:00:43.249> different<00:00:43.519> so<00:00:43.879> what<00:00:43.999> you

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
game it's rather different so what you

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.119 
game it's rather different so what you
can<00:00:44.390> do<00:00:44.600> is<00:00:44.839> you<00:00:45.019> can<00:00:45.140> use<00:00:45.199> a<00:00:45.350> golden<00:00:45.679> carrot<00:00:46.010> a

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
can do is you can use a golden carrot a

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.079 
can do is you can use a golden carrot a
carrot<00:00:46.370> or<00:00:46.730> dandelion<00:00:47.420> or<00:00:48.309> then<00:00:49.309> yeah<00:00:49.909> there

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
carrot or dandelion or then yeah there

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:50.439 
carrot or dandelion or then yeah there
you<00:00:50.149> go

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
you go

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.590 
you go
has<00:00:50.690> love<00:00:50.960> hearts<00:00:51.199> around<00:00:51.289> him<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.039> basically

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
has love hearts around him so basically

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.090 
has love hearts around him so basically
what<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:53.690> do<00:00:53.839> is<00:00:53.870> he<00:00:54.079> just<00:00:54.260> renamed<00:00:54.739> him<00:00:54.890> so

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
what you do is he just renamed him so

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.529 
what you do is he just renamed him so
now<00:00:55.219> his<00:00:55.429> name<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:55.640> Sam<00:00:55.999> and<00:00:56.179> then<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:56.390> could

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
now his name is Sam and then you could

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:57.610 
now his name is Sam and then you could
just<00:00:56.659> carry<00:00:56.780> him<00:00:56.960> wherever<00:00:57.289> you<00:00:57.350> want<00:00:57.530> with

rabbit<00:01:02.809> in<00:01:02.960> Mike<00:01:03.109> in<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:03.409> game<00:01:03.679> so<00:01:04.250> all<00:01:04.430> that

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
rabbit in Mike in this game so all that

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.190 
rabbit in Mike in this game so all that
will<00:01:04.909> do<00:01:05.119> is<00:01:05.149> just<00:01:05.449> make<00:01:05.630> them<00:01:05.780> hop<00:01:05.930> around

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
will do is just make them hop around

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.600 
will do is just make them hop around
basically<00:01:06.710> all<00:01:06.829> they<00:01:06.950> will<00:01:07.070> do<00:01:07.189> is<00:01:07.310> hop<00:01:07.460> around

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
basically all they will do is hop around

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.760 
basically all they will do is hop around
is<00:01:07.820> gonna<00:01:08.000> release<00:01:08.240> him<00:01:08.540> all<00:01:09.140> they<00:01:09.290> do<00:01:09.409> is<00:01:09.560> hop

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
is gonna release him all they do is hop

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.080 
is gonna release him all they do is hop
around<00:01:10.009> they're<00:01:10.250> just<00:01:10.399> hostile<00:01:10.670> creatures

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
around they're just hostile creatures

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.550 
around they're just hostile creatures
and<00:01:11.270> they<00:01:11.329> don't<00:01:11.540> really<00:01:11.630> do<00:01:11.840> anything<00:01:11.869> so

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
and they don't really do anything so

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.950 
and they don't really do anything so
that's<00:01:13.070> not<00:01:13.250> really<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.579> important<00:01:13.969> part<00:01:14.000> but

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
that's not really the important part but

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.450 
that's not really the important part but
then<00:01:15.079> again<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.530> breed<00:01:15.770> rabbits<00:01:16.009> it's

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
then again to breed rabbits it's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.399 
then again to breed rabbits it's
basically<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.270> same<00:01:17.479> thing<00:01:17.539> so<00:01:18.049> you<00:01:18.110> can

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
basically the same thing so you can

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.810 
basically the same thing so you can
there<00:01:18.680> are<00:01:18.710> multiple<00:01:19.189> ways<00:01:19.280> where<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.520> do<00:01:19.670> is

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
there are multiple ways where you do is

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.389 
there are multiple ways where you do is
either<00:01:20.299> dandelion<00:01:20.930> carrot<00:01:21.439> or<00:01:21.619> golden<00:01:22.130> carrot

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
either dandelion carrot or golden carrot

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.429 
either dandelion carrot or golden carrot
so<00:01:22.880> just<00:01:23.229> two<00:01:24.229> of<00:01:24.259> them<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.799> they<00:01:25.070> will<00:01:25.280> breed

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
so just two of them and they will breed

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.840 
so just two of them and they will breed
they<00:01:27.439> will<00:01:27.619> get<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.130> get<00:01:28.430> a<00:01:28.490> little<00:01:28.729> baby

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
they will get and you get a little baby

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.090 
they will get and you get a little baby
rabbit<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:29.450> same<00:01:29.689> thing<00:01:29.719> goes<00:01:30.170> there's<00:01:30.649> no<00:01:30.829> old

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100
