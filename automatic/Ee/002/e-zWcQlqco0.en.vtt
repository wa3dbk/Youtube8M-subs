hopping<00:01:57.829> from<00:01:58.429> here<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:59.270> there<00:01:59.539> or<00:02:00.729> here<00:02:01.729> today

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
hopping from here to there or here today

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.559 
hopping from here to there or here today
and<00:02:02.829> continuing<00:02:03.829> again<00:02:06.189> but<00:02:07.270> they<00:02:08.270> had<00:02:08.539> a

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
and continuing again but they had a

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.140 
and continuing again but they had a
problem<00:02:09.369> counting<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.550> squares

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
problem counting the squares

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.510 
problem counting the squares
every<00:02:11.720> time<00:02:12.020> they<00:02:12.260> hopped

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
every time they hopped

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.410 
every time they hopped
so<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:15.370> man<00:02:16.370> came<00:02:16.730> up<00:02:16.760> with<00:02:17.270> an<00:02:17.450> idea<00:02:19.180> what<00:02:20.180> did

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
so a man came up with an idea what did

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.910 
so a man came up with an idea what did
he<00:02:20.540> do<00:02:21.910> he<00:02:22.910> started<00:02:23.600> putting<00:02:23.840> numbers<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:24.770> all

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
he do he started putting numbers on all

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.390 
he do he started putting numbers on all
the<00:02:25.340> squares<00:02:25.790> look<00:02:26.770> he<00:02:27.770> put<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:29.210> numbers<00:02:29.750> 1<00:02:30.710> 2

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
the squares look he put the numbers 1 2

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:43.870 
the squares look he put the numbers 1 2
3<00:02:32.060> 4<00:02:32.900> 5<00:02:33.590> 6<00:02:34.280> 7<00:02:35.120> 8<00:02:35.300> 9<00:02:36.290> 10<00:02:37.070> 11<00:02:37.580> 12<00:02:39.100> on<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.400> squares<00:02:42.880> so

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 on the squares so

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.920 
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 on the squares so
it<00:02:44.720> became<00:02:45.440> easy<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.550> count<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.510> number<00:02:47.900> of

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
it became easy to count the number of

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.710 
it became easy to count the number of
squares<00:02:48.500> hopped<00:02:49.100> see<00:02:50.380> first<00:02:51.380> time<00:02:52.240> Khushi<00:02:53.240> hop

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
squares hopped see first time Khushi hop

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.510

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
could no see the first time m1 was ahead

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.480 
could no see the first time m1 was ahead
of<00:03:22.550> Khushi<00:03:23.240> by<00:03:23.630> just<00:03:24.470> one<00:03:25.010> square<00:03:27.130> next<00:03:28.130> time

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
of Khushi by just one square next time

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.850 
of Khushi by just one square next time
it<00:03:28.880> was<00:03:29.480> Khushi<00:03:30.070> was<00:03:31.070> ahead<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.850> amun<00:03:32.480> by<00:03:33.020> two

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
it was Khushi was ahead of amun by two

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.790 
it was Khushi was ahead of amun by two
squares<00:03:36.070> so<00:03:37.960> what<00:03:38.960> is<00:03:39.200> this

Aman<00:03:40.760> was<00:03:40.790> trying<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.630> do<00:03:41.810> what<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> number

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
Aman was trying to do what is a number

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.120 
Aman was trying to do what is a number
line<00:03:43.490> that<00:03:43.880> is<00:03:44.890> numbers<00:03:46.240> returned<00:03:47.240> on<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.480> line

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
line that is numbers returned on a line

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.740 
line that is numbers returned on a line
let's<00:03:49.130> try<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.610> make<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.090> number<00:03:50.510> line

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
let's try to make a number line

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.960 
let's try to make a number line
ourselves<00:03:52.420> see<00:03:53.500> first<00:03:54.500> we<00:03:54.830> draw<00:03:55.160> a<00:03:55.190> line<00:03:55.550> and

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
ourselves see first we draw a line and

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.290 
ourselves see first we draw a line and
start<00:03:56.960> putting<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.740> numbers<00:03:58.270> starting<00:03:59.270> from

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
start putting the numbers starting from

and<00:04:24.759> so<00:04:25.689> on<00:04:25.990> our<00:04:26.289> number<00:04:27.129> line<00:04:27.159> can<00:04:27.419> extend<00:04:28.419> to

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
and so on our number line can extend to

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.320 
and so on our number line can extend to
any<00:04:29.710> number<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:31.810> let's<00:04:32.770> try<00:04:33.129> to<00:04:33.189> see<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.849> use

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
any number so let's try to see the use

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.330 
any number so let's try to see the use
of<00:04:34.659> number<00:04:35.289> line<00:04:37.080> this<00:04:38.080> is<00:04:38.349> number<00:04:39.060> three<00:04:40.060> now

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
of number line this is number three now

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.439 
of number line this is number three now
what<00:04:42.340> comes<00:04:43.080> after<00:04:44.080> three<00:04:44.349> how<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.400> find<00:04:46.030> it<00:04:46.270> on

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
what comes after three how to find it on

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.899 
what comes after three how to find it on
the<00:04:46.629> number<00:04:46.840> line<00:04:47.729> let's<00:04:48.729> look<00:04:49.150> forward<00:04:50.139> or

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
the number line let's look forward or

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:57.110 
the number line let's look forward or
what<00:04:51.909> number<00:04:52.569> comes<00:04:53.409> next<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:55.379> three<00:04:56.379> on<00:04:56.740> the

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
what number comes next to three on the

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.740 
what number comes next to three on the
right<00:04:58.120> side<00:04:58.599> it<00:04:59.250> is<00:05:00.250> four<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:01.990> we<00:05:02.860> say<00:05:03.360> number<00:05:04.360> 4

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
right side it is four so we say number 4

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:12.770 
right side it is four so we say number 4
comes<00:05:05.259> after<00:05:06.330> 3<00:05:08.099> see<00:05:09.099> here<00:05:09.400> 4<00:05:10.360> comes<00:05:10.810> after<00:05:11.139> 3

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
comes after 3 see here 4 comes after 3

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:20.040 
comes after 3 see here 4 comes after 3
understood<00:05:16.259> now<00:05:17.259> we<00:05:17.830> will<00:05:18.069> find<00:05:18.599> what<00:05:19.599> comes

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
understood now we will find what comes

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.459 
understood now we will find what comes
before<00:05:20.889> a<00:05:21.219> number<00:05:21.580> say<00:05:22.360> this<00:05:23.199> is<00:05:23.529> number<00:05:23.889> 5

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
before a number say this is number 5

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:30.240 
before a number say this is number 5
what<00:05:26.469> comes<00:05:26.919> before<00:05:27.699> 5<00:05:28.330> we<00:05:29.259> will<00:05:29.469> look<00:05:29.740> at<00:05:29.949> the

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
what comes before 5 we will look at the

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.029 
what comes before 5 we will look at the
number<00:05:30.759> which<00:05:31.569> comes<00:05:31.960> just<00:05:32.590> ahead<00:05:33.430> of<00:05:33.460> 5<00:05:34.029> or

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
number which comes just ahead of 5 or

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.990 
number which comes just ahead of 5 or
towards<00:05:36.039> the<00:05:36.430> left<00:05:37.060> of<00:05:37.389> 5<00:05:37.810> and<00:05:38.759> what<00:05:39.759> do<00:05:39.940> we

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
towards the left of 5 and what do we

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.879 
towards the left of 5 and what do we
find<00:05:40.529> this<00:05:41.529> is<00:05:41.889> number<00:05:42.370> 4<00:05:43.259> so<00:05:44.969> number<00:05:45.969> 4<00:05:46.330> comes

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
find this is number 4 so number 4 comes

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:52.740 
find this is number 4 so number 4 comes
before<00:05:47.889> 5<00:05:49.500> understood<00:05:50.580> let's<00:05:51.580> try<00:05:52.000> another

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
before 5 understood let's try another

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.689 
before 5 understood let's try another
number<00:05:53.250> what<00:05:54.250> comes<00:05:54.639> before<00:05:54.969> 10<00:05:55.800> again<00:05:56.800> we

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
number what comes before 10 again we

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:04.129 
number what comes before 10 again we
will<00:05:57.879> look<00:05:59.339> backwards<00:06:00.339> or<00:06:00.870> what<00:06:01.870> comes<00:06:02.759> to<00:06:03.759> the

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
will look backwards or what comes to the

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:12.300 
will look backwards or what comes to the
left<00:06:05.139> of<00:06:05.529> 10<00:06:06.129> and<00:06:06.490> this<00:06:07.449> is<00:06:07.800> number<00:06:08.800> 9<00:06:10.440> so<00:06:11.440> we

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
left of 10 and this is number 9 so we

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:20.010 
left of 10 and this is number 9 so we
can<00:06:12.580> say<00:06:13.139> number<00:06:14.139> 9<00:06:14.710> comes<00:06:15.190> before<00:06:15.900> 10<00:06:17.370> ok<00:06:19.020> what

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
can say number 9 comes before 10 ok what

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.570 
can say number 9 comes before 10 ok what
else<00:06:20.050> we<00:06:20.589> can<00:06:20.830> find<00:06:21.089> we<00:06:22.089> can<00:06:22.300> also<00:06:22.599> find<00:06:23.169> what

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
else we can find we can also find what

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.260 
else we can find we can also find what
comes<00:06:24.580> in<00:06:24.940> between<00:06:25.479> the<00:06:25.990> two<00:06:26.589> numbers<00:06:27.270> let's

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
comes in between the two numbers let's

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.829 
comes in between the two numbers let's
say<00:06:28.479> we<00:06:29.379> want<00:06:29.680> to<00:06:29.770> find<00:06:30.250> what<00:06:31.120> comes<00:06:31.569> in

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:31.839 
say we want to find what comes in

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:37.260 
say we want to find what comes in
between<00:06:32.789> 2<00:06:33.789> &amp;<00:06:35.399> 4

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
between 2 &amp; 4

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.650 
between 2 &amp; 4
so<00:06:37.599> we<00:06:37.870> will<00:06:38.080> look<00:06:38.319> the<00:06:39.099> in<00:06:39.370> between<00:06:40.150> number

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
so we will look the in between number

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.170 
so we will look the in between number
this<00:06:41.470> is<00:06:41.830> number<00:06:42.340> three<00:06:43.210> so<00:06:44.050> we<00:06:44.289> can<00:06:44.620> say

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
this is number three so we can say

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.070 
this is number three so we can say
between<00:06:46.180> two<00:06:46.750> and<00:06:47.220> four<00:06:48.220> comes<00:06:49.150> the<00:06:49.539> number

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
between two and four comes the number

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.740 
between two and four comes the number
three<00:06:51.840> okay<00:06:52.840> see<00:06:53.590> here<00:06:53.860> three<00:06:54.520> is<00:06:54.759> in<00:06:55.150> between

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
three okay see here three is in between

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.740 
three okay see here three is in between
two<00:06:56.410> and<00:06:56.910> four<00:06:59.039> next<00:07:00.039> let<00:07:00.880> us<00:07:00.910> try<00:07:01.210> to<00:07:01.240> find

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
two and four next let us try to find

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:08.279 
two and four next let us try to find
what<00:07:02.560> comes<00:07:02.949> between<00:07:03.479> ten<00:07:04.479> and<00:07:05.490> twelve<00:07:07.289> well

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:08.289
