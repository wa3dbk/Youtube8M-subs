windows the fact that we're in a park is
a<00:00:49.260> very<00:00:49.379> symbolic<00:00:50.190> thing<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.270> Salaskar<00:00:51.750> known

a very symbolic thing for Salaskar known
because<00:00:52.770> nature<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.399> them<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.879> really<00:00:54.239> at<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
because nature for them is really at the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.040 
because nature for them is really at the
heart<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:55.020> what<00:00:55.230> drives<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.829> informs<00:00:56.280> them

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050

heart of what drives and informs them
there<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.260> an<00:00:58.710> element<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.550> their<00:00:59.760> work<00:01:00.000> that

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
there is an element to their work that

there is an element to their work that
is<00:01:00.780> very<00:01:01.350> much<00:01:01.590> predicated<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.910> idea<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
is very much predicated on this idea of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.260 
is very much predicated on this idea of
almost<00:01:04.290> poor<00:01:04.619> materials<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.489> don't<00:01:05.820> mean<00:01:05.939> arty

power quite in the way of the that the
artistic<00:01:09.150> movement<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.640> things

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
artistic movement but it is about things

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.850 
artistic movement but it is about things
which<00:01:12.240> are<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.750> found<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:14.250> accidents<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.119> found

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
which are as found so accidents as found

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.760 
which are as found so accidents as found
materials<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:17.100> found<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.960> less<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.590> do

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
materials as found that it's less to do

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.990 
materials as found that it's less to do
with<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.100> kind<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:21.290> extreme<00:01:22.759> refinement<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
with the kind of extreme refinement of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.640 
with the kind of extreme refinement of
the<00:01:24.869> process

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the process

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.679 
the process
although<00:01:26.159> refined<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.850> most<00:01:27.060> certainly<00:01:27.150> is

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
although refined it's most certainly is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.770 
although refined it's most certainly is
it's<00:01:28.500> more<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.790> sense<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.270> things

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it's more to do with the sense of things

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
it's more to do with the sense of things
developing<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.950> along<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
developing as they go along and the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.890 
developing as they go along and the
organic<00:01:33.360> nature<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:34.049> their<00:01:34.950> structure<00:01:35.869> what<00:01:36.869> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
organic nature of their structure what I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.840 
organic nature of their structure what I
hope<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.799> summer<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> be

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
will make their colors shine even more

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.230

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.510 
challenges really come in a sort of
hermetically<00:02:03.570> sealed<00:02:03.899> final<00:02:04.619> burst<00:02:05.009> of

hermetically sealed final burst of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.600 
hermetically sealed final burst of
energy<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.840> these<00:02:07.200> last<00:02:07.530> few<00:02:07.799> days<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.399> that's

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
energy in these last few days and that's

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.119 
energy in these last few days and that's
the<00:02:08.879> position<00:02:09.030> we're<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.509> now<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.259> nothing

the position we're in now and nothing
can<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.340> more<00:02:11.700> excited

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
can be more excited

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.369 
can be more excited
