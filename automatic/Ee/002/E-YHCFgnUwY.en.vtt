00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.269
 Hello everyone, we came back today in 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.150
 Our vegetable garden in Milan to perform the 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.970
 sowing beans in our case 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.919
 we will work on three rows with broad beans 3 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.439
 brother 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.269
 specifically the first test will be 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.840
 cultivated with faber strawberries 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.539
 the second with broad beans salad and onions e 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.059
 the third these same three species therefore 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.660
 broad beans and salads plus sage and 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.440
 cabbage to help us during the work of 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.170
 sow the planter and or another 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.110
 foresight that can be adopted for 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.960
 speed up for seed germination 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.229
 of broad bean is to put them to soak 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.960
 at least one day before the water in 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:56.420
 so that we can in several of 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.360
 water and consequently germinate a lot 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.890
 first when we will put them down 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.949
 then proceed with real sowing e 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.030
 own is appropriate with the beans in 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.290
 this period 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.830
 at the end of September the beginning of 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.840
 October proceed with direct sowing 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.399
 to plant the seedlings to do it 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.170
 we bring to light the surface of the 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.329
 soil that in our case is covered one 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.609
 mulch layer and with the help of the 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.770
 transplanted king we dig a small hole 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:24.320
 about 45 centimeters 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.890
 where we are going to plant two or 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.890
 three seeds 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.770
 afterwards 36 me will go 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.409
 obviously covered with a layer of 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.600
 land on which we can also 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.369
 reposition the mulch layer 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.039
 maybe leaving the slightly more 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.590
 light where we sowed the 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.420
 and planting distance of 50 cm 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.159
 on the line 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.369
 we are working at the center of the test 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.700
 cultivated so as to leave the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.299
 Strawberry seedlings equidistant from 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.869
 faba bean plants and exploiting in this 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.409
 so the potential all the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.269
 leguminous plants such as beans are to fix 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.370
 thanks to the symbiosis that occurs a 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.489
 radical level with nitrogen bacteria 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.590
 fixers for atmospheric nitrogen going 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:24.299
 therefore to substantially fertilize in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:26.430
 natural way the terrain also up 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.099
 this our second row we are 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.110
 working with a seeding distance of 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.390
 50 centimeters on the broad bean daughter 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.549
 sowing 23 do for each hole 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.739
 covering with a layer of soil 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.540
 let's remember the mouth and about deep 45 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.920
 cm also covering with the layer of 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.660
 mature band on the sides we are working 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.260
 using a consociation with 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.260
 lettuce 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.040
 is 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.230
 for each lettuce plant and the ati 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.230
 we will have an onion plant 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:11.200
 which must always be sown with the apex of 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.560
 upward bulb is in place 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.940
 once the sowing work is completed 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.280
 beans in our case done at 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.780
 center of the tests and also finished i 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.320
 transplants and species we decided to 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.090
 with social, there is nothing left to do but 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.290
 make sure it germinates in the 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.850
 early stages of growth is not lacking 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.650
 absolutely the water then with some 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.440
 irrigation in the event of absence 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.840
 rain or particularly dry land 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.610
 then we will see how to deal with the beans 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.610
 during their development
