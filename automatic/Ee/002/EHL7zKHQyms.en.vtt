 let's make some little flowers that are a 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.360
 little honey we are going to fill them and not 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.190
 We're going to put them on a bit of 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:55.680
 fried sweet potato that we have brought that luisa 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.680

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:08.320
 What I'm going to do is suffer a little 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:11.409
 of onion can already be can be 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.780
 a little rough , nothing happens that idea 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.090
 also the leaves of the past the epazote 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.950
 that we are going to occupy for our our 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.840
 filling of luck according to the flame of 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.100
 cottage cheese with which we are going to fill 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.380
 our pumpkin solis is ready 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:33.090
 our our first dish that we're going to 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:36.090
 prepare olive oil oil and 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 onion 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:50.060
 in the points you can not say it is 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.060
 that they are without salt 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.590
 and let's do it with another type of cheese 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.320
 you can or can not use cuts you can 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.479
 use jj you can use fresh cheese 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.550
 even if you want to detect 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.410
 suffered for 3 to 5 minutes 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.000
 more or less the idea is to train 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.010
 of garlic the onion the oil of 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.440
 sixdedos wants to be also the return 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.410
 they lived a little bit of honey like a 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.410
 teaspoon between 1 and 2 tablespoons 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.989
 the epazote then first a little bit of 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.989
 salt salt salt to taste 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:44.750
 the final day at the end as it gives 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.840
 account you put the epazote and pay at 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.840
 final 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:06.940
 the very clear clear that this 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.829
 good a terrific editor the one that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.650
 to tie the epazote gives a lot 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:24.060
 life that is very rich then what 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.060
 let's put in a container 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.060
 project to cool it but what 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.860
 let's cool that you share a 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.880
 little bit will be 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:44.170
 and we will need our for 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:47.290
 the toasted pumpkin seeds 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.960
 chopped if the flowers are going to be a success 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.380
 to ride on the written sweet potatoes that 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.800
 I told you great and we have some 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.970
 fried sweet potatoes 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.550
 can see crispy texture 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.950
 very good 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.870
 and then let's see how our 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.120
 pumpkin flower stuffed with cottage cheese 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.220
 we open it with perfect care 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.459
 you grab one half of the spoon 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.890
 so we are going to rule it on an empty stomach later 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.630
 you make your life and we wrap it 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.180
 you wrap very carefully we put here 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.050
 this charade that surrounds him and what 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.510
 we wrap perfectly and I use it 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:35.350
 perfect musicians 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:37.670
 so here we are appealing we are going to 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.930
 our first dish our entry 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:49.760
 remember that they are pumpkin flowers 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:52.900
 first that is the fried sweet potato and the 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.900
 walnut oil 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.270
 let's make a sauce of peace or you 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.600
 We respond as olive oil which is one 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.090
 little reasons 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.990
 more or less of olive oil as a 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.600
 small cup 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.600
 olive oil as wormseed 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.520
 the 100 grams 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.500
 As it has already left our sauce 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.930
 steps and a step oil here we have 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:31.380
 Pumpkin seeds 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:31.380
 let's also put it on flowers 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:45.240
 because they are a little 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.220
 but up 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.580
 He has sung the question 50 organs the 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.580
 flipped 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:09.039
 it has to be a high fire because if not 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:11.590
 we will have to leave and I do not want 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.199
 I was that the key pumpkin semen was me 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.750
 happens to cook well that is slightly 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:19.960
 quote we are ideas of the color that 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.849
 knowing each other skipped the color and 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.619
 It has a very rich smell 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.220
 here we have our flowers 

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:28.380
 pumpkin 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.890
 and meanwhile we are also 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:35.150
 putting a layer of what is the sweet potato 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.150
 on the plate 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.350
 and above 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.940
 about this perfect 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:07.120
 perfect good they are already mounted on 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:14.680
 our table the sweet potato yucca minita 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:17.099
 fried and we're going to put some 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.099
 lines 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:43.090
 and if we do not have in the market 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:45.370
 what it is and that we can replace it with 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.190
 something like that you can put a little bit of 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:55.630
 small squares of red chili tomato 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:58.180
 pepper of the dish that will serve 

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:01.800
 as a first course not to open mouth 

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.800
 scored no longer worth
