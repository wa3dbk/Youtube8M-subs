 Hello everyone, Nikolay, this is the 11th edition 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.010
 my project history of the world of 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.410
 warcraft and in this issue will be about 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.230
 such locations as badlands well 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.980
 well let's start a bad land 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.779
 is one of the Kozmo regions given 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.600
 bordering the smoldering gorge in the west and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.269
 lacma given in the north is terrible 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.939
 barren and arid land full 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.740
 red sand stones and burning heat 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.320
 which can only survive quite 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.809
 resistant creatures such as coyote and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.140
 or jaguar and only grow in the sand 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.270
 cactus and spines far eastern 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.700
 the region is populated by offspring 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.820
 black swarms of dragons while on 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.800
 the northwest fortified arches of the horde also 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 badlands meet small 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.050
 settlements about the count of the clan rotten belly on 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.329
 north of the region 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.789
 are located the ancient ruins serving 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.850
 never dwelling times and earthen 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.359
 ancestors of dwarves and gnomes and the city of ulman 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.000
 captured me teeth metro scheme 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.540
 I drink Ulman year in search 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.549
 archaeological finds 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.220
 settled dwarves from the dark clan 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.740
 iron once upon a time 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.860
 these lands were blooming 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.869
 the green valley is rich and fertile but 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.420
 evil magic has perverted this valley 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.159
 turning it into a barren desert 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.140
 wasteland 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.450
 over the red sand barren lands in 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.939
 searching for another booty wander gangs 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.130
 ogres while the sky soar black 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.960
 dragons 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.570
 add to all this clan dwarves 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.159
 dark iron totals and you will understand 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.049
 why were these lands called 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.299
 barren history of barren land 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.290
 about three hundred years ago during wars 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.899
 three hammers 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.180
 Dark Iron Dwarf Calls 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.010
 yourself to the aid of the great fire lord 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.440
 Ragnaros Elementals 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.300
 return of the fiery lord of the exiled 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.430
 a million years ago by the titans 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.530
 caused an explosion of tremendous power 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.960
 turned this once flourishing 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.410
 fertile land in red scorched 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.390
 the desert until recently barren 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.240
 lands were of no interest to either 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.100
 but recently dwarves of steelforge 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.910
 discovered here the ancient ruins of the city 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.580
 ulma on in its depths they found the first 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.590
 mention of its origin from 1 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.740
 or millers created by titans 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.330
 unfortunately dwarf excavations have released 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.400
 to the light 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.390
 unsuccessful experiments titans touched 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.580
 captured ulman to the same legacy 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.160
 titans became interested enslaved 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.340
 Ragnaros clan of dark iron and now 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.960
 badlands have become one of the centers 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.209
 confrontation eternal enemies dwarves 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.100
 steel horn dark iron dwarves and 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.800
 black dragons not floriana 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.220
 now let's take a look 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.510
 badlands geography 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.870
 badlands represents 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.880
 level to the debris-enhanced mountains 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.020
 in the north will not be allowed to penetrate here 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.850
 cold and humid air syllable madana 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.519
 canyon and surrounding this land 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.760
 swarming with various predators and hostile 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.370
 creatures only the most hardy and 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.540
 unpretentious ones are able to survive in 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.330
 similar conditions 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.180
 among the rocks you can meet 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.580
 elementals the least of which win 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.610
 simple enough but from a collision with 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.709
 big better refrain from doing so 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.709
 badlands history came up to 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.730
