it's not really heavy either if you use

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.150 
it's not really heavy either if you use
a<00:04:09.250> little<00:04:09.430> bit<00:04:10.560> even<00:04:11.560> with<00:04:11.710> some<00:04:11.860> people<00:04:12.040> that

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
a little bit even with some people that

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.430 
a little bit even with some people that
has<00:04:12.400> fine<00:04:12.730> hair<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:13.240> think<00:04:13.480> if<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:13.930> use<00:04:14.080> just<00:04:14.320> a

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
has fine hair I think if you use just a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.810 
has fine hair I think if you use just a
little<00:04:14.470> bit<00:04:14.830> I<00:04:15.010> don't<00:04:15.100> think<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.490> would<00:04:15.640> be<00:04:15.790> a

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
little bit I don't think it would be a

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.640 
little bit I don't think it would be a
little<00:04:16.060> bit<00:04:16.209> too<00:04:16.330> old<00:04:16.360> you<00:04:16.840> know<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.020> a<00:04:17.440> kid
