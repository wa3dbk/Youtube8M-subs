on this charles krauthammer on the
inaugural<00:00:06.060> address<00:00:06.420> charles<00:00:07.049> i<00:00:07.259> thought<00:00:08.069> it

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
inaugural address charles i thought it

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.209 
inaugural address charles i thought it
was<00:00:08.370> an<00:00:08.490> amazing<00:00:08.790> speech<00:00:09.889> historically<00:00:10.889> very

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
was an amazing speech historically very

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.520 
was an amazing speech historically very
important<00:00:11.790> not<00:00:11.820> memorable<00:00:12.540> there's<00:00:13.290> not<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
important not memorable there's not a

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.099 
important not memorable there's not a
line<00:00:13.830> here<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.370> will<00:00:14.490> ever<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.849> repeated<00:00:15.240> but

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
line here that will ever be repeated but

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.200 
line here that will ever be repeated but
I<00:00:16.139> think<00:00:16.260> very<00:00:16.680> important<00:00:17.369> historically

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
I think very important historically

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.050 
I think very important historically
because<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.289> was<00:00:19.529> really<00:00:19.770> Obama<00:00:20.340> unbound

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
because this was really Obama unbound

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.810 
because this was really Obama unbound
and<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.560> what's<00:00:22.769> most<00:00:22.980> interesting<00:00:23.279> is

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
and I think what's most interesting is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.750 
and I think what's most interesting is
that<00:00:23.880> Obama<00:00:24.859> basically<00:00:25.859> he's<00:00:25.980> declaring<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
that Obama basically he's declaring the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.490 
that Obama basically he's declaring the
end<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:27.180> Reagan<00:00:27.570> isn't<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:28.019> his<00:00:28.199> speech

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
end of Reagan isn't in his speech

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.269 
end of Reagan isn't in his speech
remember<00:00:29.460> he<00:00:29.640> once<00:00:29.849> said<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.800> Ronald<00:00:31.800> Reagan

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
remember he once said that Ronald Reagan

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.060 
remember he once said that Ronald Reagan
was<00:00:32.489> historically<00:00:33.149> consequential<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.920> way

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
was historically consequential in a way

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.049 
was historically consequential in a way
that<00:00:35.309> Bill<00:00:36.120> Clinton<00:00:36.149> was<00:00:36.840> not<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.640> what<00:00:38.640> Obama

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
that Bill Clinton was not and what Obama

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.569 
that Bill Clinton was not and what Obama
meant<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.809> Obama<00:00:40.290> had<00:00:40.590> changed<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
meant is that Obama had changed the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.650 
meant is that Obama had changed the
ideological<00:00:42.239> course<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> country<00:00:43.710> in

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
ideological course of the country in

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.750 
ideological course of the country in
1981<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:46.020> his<00:00:46.170> inaugural<00:00:46.320> address<00:00:46.829> within<00:00:47.370> two

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
minutes Reagan had declared the

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.939

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
government is not the solution

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.500 
government is not the solution
government<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> problem<00:00:53.510> today's
