and right now we're the voices we've

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.740 
and right now we're the voices we've
tuned<00:01:05.549> them<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:06.110> unison<00:01:07.110> mode<00:01:07.260> but

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.250 

that's<00:01:11.650> fun<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.790> then<00:01:13.180> also<00:01:13.540> in<00:01:13.750> unison<00:01:14.050> mode

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
that's fun and then also in unison mode

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.170 
that's fun and then also in unison mode
do<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.190> tune<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.370> oscillators<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:15.910> little<00:01:16.090> bit

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
do you tune the oscillators a little bit

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.050 
do you tune the oscillators a little bit
you<00:01:16.330> get<00:01:16.480> nice

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.280 

it's<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:22.520> 432<00:01:23.520> step<00:01:23.850> sequencer<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.960> Phil

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it's a 432 step sequencer with Phil

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.620 
it's a 432 step sequencer with Phil
variations<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.040> each<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> voices

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
variations and each one of the voices

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.590 
variations and each one of the voices
has<00:01:28.110> their<00:01:28.350> own<00:01:28.380> step<00:01:28.979> sequencer<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:30.360> mono

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
has their own step sequencer in mono

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.609

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
mode in poly mode they go to number one

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
mode in poly mode they go to number one
so<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.280> nice<00:01:35.600> nice<00:01:36.600> variation

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
so you can get this nice nice variation

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.560 
so you can get this nice nice variation
on<00:01:37.380> them<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.000> unison<00:01:39.299> mode<00:01:39.479> they

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
on them and then in unison mode they

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
on them and then in unison mode they
also<00:01:39.690> stay<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.289> number<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:40.649> and<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.880> all

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
also stay on number one and they all

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.340 
also stay on number one and they all
send<00:01:42.240> MIDI<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.659> all<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:42.899> out<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.200> can

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
send MIDI they all go out you can

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.050 
send MIDI they all go out you can
configure<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.979> MIDI<00:01:44.130> channel<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
configure the MIDI channel so you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.630 
configure the MIDI channel so you
basically<00:01:45.299> get<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:46.130> 32<00:01:47.130> step<00:01:47.340> step<00:01:47.520> sequencer

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
basically get a 32 step step sequencer

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.130 
basically get a 32 step step sequencer
that<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.850> send<00:01:51.240> via<00:01:51.479> MIDI<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.960> any

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that you can send via MIDI to any

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.450 
that you can send via MIDI to any
channel<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.500> want<00:01:52.679> it's<00:01:53.069> really<00:01:53.280> easy<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
channel you want it's really easy to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.279 
channel you want it's really easy to
program<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.179> either<00:01:54.300> record<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.110> live

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
program you can either record it in live

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.389
