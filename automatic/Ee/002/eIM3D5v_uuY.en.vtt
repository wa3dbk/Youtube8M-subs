00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:44.224
Two of the four pieces, 

00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:47.127
the Schumann and the Brahms,

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:51.693
are very widely played in the classical piano repertoire.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.979
The Liszt and the Janacek aren't so widely played.

00:00:55.728 --> 00:00:58.233
And it's exactly because I didn't want a disk 

00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:00.388
of only best known romantic works

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.600
that I chose these two works, 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.800
the Janacek and the Liszt.

00:01:24.028 --> 00:01:28.022
Recording the CD was also very hard work

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:30.552
because I had to be part of every aspect

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:32.459
of the production.

00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:36.499
I recorded the disk, I did the editing.
