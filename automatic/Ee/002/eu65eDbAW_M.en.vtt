00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 people as I told you guys 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.100
 that I was showing a sneaker then here 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.410
 after a few weeks you can see that the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.330
 area and it was well spent and the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.280
 part of the flip and also of the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.019
 flip is well spent however as people 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.540
 passed the super bonder here at the seam 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.550
 She did not get to see the sneakers. 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.039
 What happened was that up ahead and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.720
 opened a hole was in a session where 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.330
 they exchanged tea that he was very 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.220
 and I do not even know what maneuver 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.490
 is spending tennis in this region here 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.399
 but ended up tearing up 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.579
 a tip for you guys will put the super 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.770
 bonder give a reinforced in the part of the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.930
 oil flip where it picks on sneakers 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.500
 You're going to get him to step up 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.750
 also not to register 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.760
 he rips in the middle said rolet here in the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.770
 he also ended up ripping the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.780
 language that uses the tongue out I already 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.329
 I put it here on the side the shoelace 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.039
 you may believe a little worn but 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.030
 I usually put it in here. 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.439
 to avoid that he already ended up tearing and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.799
 here is the tip I give to 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.780
 you and you use a piece of 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.150
 you do not have time you do not use 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.509
 cut a little bit the size of the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.020
 hole tear and ended up making passes 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.729
 bombonera in the hole and lap shoelace 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.070
 it will serve as a reinforcement and will 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.330
 staying up it gets a little ugly but 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.650
 after you start to maneuver 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.729
 and he's going to wither away, he's already giving 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.799
 finishing 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:38.250
 You can pass the ball over to 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.479
 leave it tight does not breathe 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.030
 smoke 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.000
 this is just smoke coming out of the reaction 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.470
 of the fabric with the band is toxic not 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.350
 breathe the votes you can see 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.630
 hard and this will fit your sneakers 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.170
 if you end up resisting more will pass 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.329
 here o 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.100
 they can see how the chamois spend on 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.350
 area where it is in a different color 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.799
 especially in the area where garbage passes 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.780
 now I'm going to spend it everywhere it 's 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.129
 spending and on the next videos showing 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.129
 to you how are you going to stay in tennis
