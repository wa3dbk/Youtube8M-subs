pyro 1022 is what we call knife

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.779 
pyro 1022 is what we call knife
reversals<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.410> what<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.400> saw<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.730> the

reversals and what you just saw on the
screen<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.150> basically<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.470> idea<00:00:19.800> here

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
screen is basically that the idea here

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.480 
screen is basically that the idea here
is<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.000> certain<00:00:21.210> positions<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.490> stances

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
is that in certain positions and stances

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.359 
is that in certain positions and stances
the<00:00:23.910> enemy<00:00:24.330> will<00:00:24.930> enter<00:00:25.350> your<00:00:25.500> hip<00:00:25.740> box<00:00:26.010> at<00:00:26.310> a

certain angle and if you time your

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.349 
certain angle and if you time your
knifes<00:00:28.680> white<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.279> right<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.330> actually

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
knifes white just right you can actually

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.060 
knifes white just right you can actually
hit<00:00:31.080> them<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.859> their<00:00:32.130> HP<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.790> below<00:00:33.210> 50%<00:00:34.070> you

hit them if their HP is below 50% you

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.069 
hit them if their HP is below 50% you
can<00:00:35.309> actually<00:00:35.610> kill<00:00:36.090> them<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.899> we're<00:00:37.050> just

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
can actually kill them so we're just

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.750 
can actually kill them so we're just
basically<00:00:37.440> demonstrating<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> timing<00:00:38.670> on

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
basically demonstrating the timing on

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.479 
basically demonstrating the timing on
that<00:00:39.030> basically<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:40.230> soon<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.800> their<00:00:41.190> sprite

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
that basically as soon as their sprite

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.639 
that basically as soon as their sprite
shows<00:00:41.850> up<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> screen<00:00:42.480> just<00:00:42.930> hit<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.440> hold

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
shows up on the screen just hit and hold

get the swipe off usually you can either
kill<00:00:48.600> them<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:48.930> they're<00:00:49.200> below<00:00:49.350> 50%<00:00:49.800> HP<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.640> you
