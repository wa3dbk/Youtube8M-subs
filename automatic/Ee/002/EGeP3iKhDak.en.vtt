I

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:04.550 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.870 

okay<00:00:05.380> first<00:00:06.380> number<00:00:06.680> start<00:00:07.100> here<00:00:07.340> is<00:00:07.550> the

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
okay first number start here is the

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.270 
okay first number start here is the
baseline<00:00:08.270> okay<00:00:09.260> this<00:00:09.500> is<00:00:09.680> when<00:00:09.860> you're<00:00:10.100> just

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
baseline okay this is when you're just

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.950 
baseline okay this is when you're just
standing<00:00:10.790> up<00:00:11.059> this<00:00:11.270> is<00:00:11.420> the<00:00:11.540> amount<00:00:11.720> of<00:00:11.840> oxygen

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
standing up this is the amount of oxygen

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.780 
standing up this is the amount of oxygen
he's<00:00:12.440> breathing<00:00:12.800> in<00:00:12.890> and<00:00:12.980> out<00:00:13.100> at<00:00:13.340> any<00:00:13.520> given

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
he's breathing in and out at any given

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.940 
he's breathing in and out at any given
time<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.570> next<00:00:14.720> number<00:00:15.290> here<00:00:15.560> this<00:00:15.769> is<00:00:15.890> called

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
time the next number here this is called

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.700 
time the next number here this is called
the<00:00:16.160> aerobic<00:00:16.730> threshold<00:00:17.150> that's<00:00:17.930> the<00:00:18.290> most

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
the aerobic threshold that's the most

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.400 
the aerobic threshold that's the most
efficient<00:00:19.340> place<00:00:19.640> from<00:00:20.570> a<00:00:20.689> breathing<00:00:21.169> point

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
efficient place from a breathing point

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.880 
efficient place from a breathing point
of<00:00:21.500> view<00:00:21.700> okay<00:00:22.700> so<00:00:23.060> as<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:24.290> coaches<00:00:24.619> just<00:00:24.710> said

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
of view okay so as the coaches just said

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.960 
of view okay so as the coaches just said
this<00:00:25.040> would<00:00:25.220> be<00:00:25.250> where<00:00:25.489> they<00:00:25.610> would<00:00:25.759> be<00:00:25.849> doing

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
this would be where they would be doing

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.429 
this would be where they would be doing
their<00:00:26.180> tempo<00:00:26.450> work<00:00:26.660> doesn't<00:00:27.140> work<00:00:27.290> on

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
their tempo work doesn't work on

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.030 
their tempo work doesn't work on
endurance<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:29.210> 80<00:00:29.599> is<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.320> anaerobic

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
endurance the 80 is the anaerobic

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.880 
endurance the 80 is the anaerobic
threshold<00:00:31.250> that's<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.119> maximum<00:00:32.739> level<00:00:33.739> of

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
threshold that's the maximum level of

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.650 
threshold that's the maximum level of
oxygen<00:00:34.070> absorption<00:00:34.670> okay<00:00:35.239> for<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.510> starts

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
oxygen absorption okay for it starts

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.020 
oxygen absorption okay for it starts
dropping<00:00:35.989> off<00:00:36.230> so<00:00:36.829> basically<00:00:37.190> you're<00:00:37.760> looking

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
dropping off so basically you're looking

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.770 
dropping off so basically you're looking
at<00:00:38.210> people<00:00:39.199> here<00:00:39.410> your<00:00:40.219> meter<00:00:41.030> training<00:00:41.570> in

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
at people here your meter training in

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.560 
at people here your meter training in
threshold<00:00:42.199> training<00:00:42.530> okay<00:00:42.890> in<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.280> 190s<00:00:43.879> and

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
threshold training okay in the 190s and

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.470 
threshold training okay in the 190s and
then<00:00:44.719> your<00:00:44.870> aerobic<00:00:45.379> training<00:00:45.789> your<00:00:46.789> would<00:00:47.359> be

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
then your aerobic training your would be

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.500 
then your aerobic training your would be
in<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.660> 160s<00:00:48.519> so<00:00:49.519> each<00:00:49.820> each<00:00:50.149> one<00:00:50.329> of<00:00:50.359> these

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
in the 160s so each each one of these

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.939 
in the 160s so each each one of these
numbers<00:00:50.809> will<00:00:50.989> then<00:00:51.140> correspond<00:00:51.649> it<00:00:51.859> was

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
numbers will then correspond it was

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.099 
numbers will then correspond it was
certain<00:00:52.460> target<00:00:52.910> right<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:53.629> target<00:00:53.960> right

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
certain target right the target right

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:55.660 
certain target right the target right
right<00:00:54.440> right<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:54.980> here's<00:00:55.160> in<00:00:55.370> here<00:00:55.550> are<00:00:55.609> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
right right and here's in here are the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.750 
right right and here's in here are the
heart<00:00:55.850> rates<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:56.600> this<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:56.929> this<00:00:57.289> is<00:00:57.499> his

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
heart rates so this is this is his

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.319 
heart rates so this is this is his
milliliters<00:00:58.760> per<00:00:59.089> kilogram<00:00:59.269> per<00:00:59.899> minute<00:01:00.219> 51.4

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
milliliters per kilogram per minute 51.4

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.800 
milliliters per kilogram per minute 51.4
milliliters<00:01:02.329> of<00:01:02.359> oxygen<00:01:03.019> yeah<00:01:03.559> at<00:01:04.630> at<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
milliliters of oxygen yeah at at the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.210 
milliliters of oxygen yeah at at the
aerobic<00:01:06.260> threshold<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.920> anaerobic

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
aerobic threshold the anaerobic

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.880 
aerobic threshold the anaerobic
threshold<00:01:07.370> at<00:01:07.909> 73.3<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.110> this<00:01:09.260> is<00:01:09.440> that<00:01:09.590> vo2

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
threshold at 73.3 so this is that vo2

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.490 
threshold at 73.3 so this is that vo2
max<00:01:10.280> number<00:01:10.520> okay<00:01:10.940> and<00:01:11.150> then<00:01:11.660> down<00:01:11.810> here<00:01:11.870> are

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
max number okay and then down here are

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.380 
max number okay and then down here are
the<00:01:12.740> heart<00:01:13.100> rates<00:01:13.310> that<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.610> reached<00:01:13.820> at<00:01:14.120> the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
the heart rates that you reached at the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.680 
the heart rates that you reached at the
time<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:15.080> those<00:01:15.290> events<00:01:15.830> happened<00:01:16.280> soso<00:01:16.850> 168

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
time that those events happened soso 168

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.560 
time that those events happened soso 168
would<00:01:17.960> be<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.590> efficiency<00:01:19.240> kind<00:01:20.240> of<00:01:20.330> training

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
would be the efficiency kind of training

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.240 
would be the efficiency kind of training
yeah<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.140> then<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:21.470> would<00:01:21.620> be<00:01:21.740> max<00:01:22.010> heart

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
yeah and then this would be max heart

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.310 
yeah and then this would be max heart
rate<00:01:22.310> reaches<00:01:22.700> over<00:01:23.240> here<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.600> max<00:01:23.810> testing

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
rate reaches over here to max testing

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
rate reaches over here to max testing
can<00:01:24.470> be<00:01:24.560> used<00:01:24.800> also<00:01:25.670> for<00:01:26.050> you<00:01:27.050> know<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.340> using

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
can be used also for you know you using

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.580 
can be used also for you know you using
the<00:01:28.550> vo2<00:01:29.180> max<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.660> applying<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.290> heart

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
the vo2 max and applying it to a heart

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.290 
the vo2 max and applying it to a heart
rate<00:01:30.740> rain<00:01:31.010> absolutely<00:01:31.580> that's<00:01:31.790> how<00:01:31.940> you<00:01:32.000> can

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
rate rain absolutely that's how you can

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.880 
rate rain absolutely that's how you can
know<00:01:32.330> where<00:01:32.900> you<00:01:33.110> need<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.470> be<00:01:33.500> for<00:01:33.830> your

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
know where you need to be for your

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.430 
know where you need to be for your
training<00:01:34.220> animals<00:01:34.510> and<00:01:35.510> it's<00:01:35.900> very<00:01:36.080> hard<00:01:36.350> to

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
training animals and it's very hard to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.900 
training animals and it's very hard to
do<00:01:36.620> this<00:01:36.800> on<00:01:36.980> your<00:01:37.010> own<00:01:37.190> but<00:01:37.460> if<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:37.640> know<00:01:37.760> what

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
do this on your own but if you know what

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.160 
do this on your own but if you know what
the<00:01:38.000> heart<00:01:38.180> rate<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.510> then<00:01:38.750> that's<00:01:38.900> what<00:01:39.050> the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
the heart rate is then that's what the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.840 
the heart rate is then that's what the
Harvey<00:01:39.440> train<00:01:39.770> yep<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.340> then<00:01:40.520> periodically

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
Harvey train yep and then periodically

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.090 
Harvey train yep and then periodically
you<00:01:41.240> would<00:01:41.420> reassess<00:01:42.200> things<00:01:42.530> those<00:01:42.950> are

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
you would reassess things those are

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.760 
you would reassess things those are
traits<00:01:43.310> as<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.360> become<00:01:44.480> stronger<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.650> fitter

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
traits as you become stronger and fitter

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.510 
traits as you become stronger and fitter
and<00:01:45.920> faster<00:01:46.870> a<00:01:47.870> beer<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.560> max<00:01:48.770> test<00:01:49.040> is<00:01:49.220> any

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
and faster a beer to max test is any

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.740 
and faster a beer to max test is any
ideas<00:01:50.000> any<00:01:50.350> experience<00:01:51.350> what<00:01:51.530> videos<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:52.750> not

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
ideas any experience what videos is not

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.710 
ideas any experience what videos is not
at<00:01:53.840> all<00:01:54.400> basically<00:01:55.400> what<00:01:55.550> it<00:01:55.580> is<00:01:55.670> it's<00:01:55.940> a<00:01:56.180> test

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
at all basically what it is it's a test

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.450

16-minute pest but I doubt anyone's

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.880 
16-minute pest but I doubt anyone's
going<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.380> make<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.619> 16<00:02:06.070> minutes<00:02:06.369> oh<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:08.649> is

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
going to make it 16 minutes oh that is

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.090 
going to make it 16 minutes oh that is
long<00:02:09.130> as<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.369> go<00:02:09.600> yeah<00:02:10.600> it's<00:02:10.780> like<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.860> test

coster<00:02:21.010> phobic<00:02:21.400> at<00:02:21.819> all<00:02:21.970> now<00:02:22.569> all<00:02:23.290> right<00:02:23.470> what

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
coster phobic at all now all right what

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.920 
coster phobic at all now all right what
it<00:02:24.220> does<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.610> test<00:02:24.850> your<00:02:25.060> oxygen<00:02:25.540> intake

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
it does is a test your oxygen intake

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.729 
it does is a test your oxygen intake
consumption<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:28.569> machine<00:02:28.870> here<00:02:29.140> calibrates

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
consumption the machine here calibrates

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.470 
consumption the machine here calibrates
the<00:02:29.890> air<00:02:30.190> how<00:02:30.700> much<00:02:30.850> oxygen<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
the air how much oxygen in the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.030 
the air how much oxygen in the
atmosphere<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:32.440> then<00:02:32.620> as<00:02:32.739> you're<00:02:32.890> breathing

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
atmosphere and then as you're breathing

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.370 
atmosphere and then as you're breathing
it<00:02:33.850> tests<00:02:34.180> how<00:02:34.269> much<00:02:34.450> oxygen<00:02:34.630> your<00:02:34.959> body<00:02:35.110> free

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
it tests how much oxygen your body free

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.780 
it tests how much oxygen your body free
that<00:02:35.620> takes<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.040> difference<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.550> that's<00:02:36.640> how

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
that takes a difference and that's how

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.790 
that takes a difference and that's how
much<00:02:36.940> oxygen<00:02:37.120> your<00:02:37.450> bodies<00:02:37.720> using<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.680> as

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
much oxygen your bodies using and as

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.490 
much oxygen your bodies using and as
they<00:02:38.920> want<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.370> wonderful<00:02:40.000> pride<00:02:40.239> as<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.720> bro<00:02:41.320> big

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
they want I wonderful pride as a bro big

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.430 
they want I wonderful pride as a bro big
exercise<00:02:41.739> when<00:02:42.100> your<00:02:42.220> body's<00:02:42.519> using<00:02:42.880> oxygen

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
exercise when your body's using oxygen

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.020 
exercise when your body's using oxygen
produce<00:02:44.440> energy<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.550> then<00:02:45.640> what<00:02:45.760> we<00:02:45.850> do<00:02:46.000> is

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
produce energy and then what we do is

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.340 
produce energy and then what we do is
we'll<00:02:46.269> test<00:02:46.510> your<00:02:46.690> anaerobic<00:02:47.140> threshold

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
we'll test your anaerobic threshold

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.800 
we'll test your anaerobic threshold
that's<00:02:48.040> worth<00:02:48.280> your<00:02:48.790> body<00:02:49.000> changes<00:02:49.630> from

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
that's worth your body changes from

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.070 
that's worth your body changes from
using<00:02:50.170> oxygen<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:51.400> stored<00:02:52.239> glycogen<00:02:52.750> and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
using oxygen to stored glycogen and

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.290 
using oxygen to stored glycogen and
other<00:02:53.260> kind<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.590> entertain<00:02:54.070> your<00:02:54.190> body<00:02:54.370> so

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
other kind of entertain your body so

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.240 
other kind of entertain your body so
that's<00:02:55.870> when<00:02:56.019> your<00:02:56.110> muscles<00:02:56.769> pretty<00:02:56.980> much

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
that's when your muscles pretty much

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.190 
that's when your muscles pretty much
starting<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.610> burn<00:02:57.790> okay<00:02:58.600> so<00:02:58.690> that's<00:02:58.989> what<00:02:59.110> we

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
starting to burn okay so that's what we

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.600 
starting to burn okay so that's what we
want<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.410> find<00:02:59.560> out<00:02:59.800> where<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.160> go<00:03:00.220> heart<00:03:00.430> rate

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
want to find out where you go heart rate

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.449 
want to find out where you go heart rate
is<00:03:00.790> at<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.269> point<00:03:01.600> we<00:03:02.040> want<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.280> be<00:03:03.370> as

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
is at that point we want that to be as

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.860 
is at that point we want that to be as
high<00:03:03.610> as<00:03:03.760> possible<00:03:03.820> we're<00:03:04.570> going<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.750> see

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
high as possible we're going to see

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.410 
high as possible we're going to see
where<00:03:05.049> it's<00:03:05.170> at<00:03:05.320> that<00:03:05.769> will<00:03:05.860> give<00:03:06.010> us<00:03:06.420> training

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
where it's at that will give us training

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.300 
where it's at that will give us training
zones<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.140> we<00:03:08.290> know<00:03:08.410> what<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.650> what<00:03:09.100> heart

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
zones so we know what that what heart

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.940 
zones so we know what that what heart
rate<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:09.610> have<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.850> trained<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:10.959> that's<00:03:11.769> a

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
rate to have you trained in so that's a

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.009 
rate to have you trained in so that's a
little<00:03:12.040> overview<00:03:12.489> but<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:13.390> guess<00:03:13.750> we'll<00:03:13.900> get

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
little overview but I guess we'll get

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.370 
little overview but I guess we'll get
started<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.500> together<00:03:14.860> until<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:16.200> I'll<00:03:17.200> step

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
started so together until the I'll step

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.820 
started so together until the I'll step
up<00:03:17.470> on<00:03:17.650> here

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.619 

we<00:03:23.830> have<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.010> dish<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:24.819> have<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> choice<00:03:25.209> of

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
we have a dish so you have a choice of

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.740 
we have a dish so you have a choice of
about<00:03:25.930> 4,000<00:03:26.709> channels<00:03:27.159> this<00:03:27.610> is<00:03:27.760> this<00:03:28.329> is<00:03:28.480> ok

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
about 4,000 channels this is this is ok

00:03:28.750 --> 00:04:08.100 
about 4,000 channels this is this is ok
for<00:03:29.019> you<00:03:29.140> ok

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:27.480 

how<00:04:08.680> best<00:04:08.890> as<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.100> go<00:04:09.310> now

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.830 

are<00:04:28.490> we<00:04:28.639> hit<00:04:28.789> as<00:04:28.909> we<00:04:29.090> hit<00:04:29.240> his<00:04:29.360> anaerobic

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
are we hit as we hit his anaerobic

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.289 
are we hit as we hit his anaerobic
