off<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.510> helps<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.260> wall<00:00:25.800> with<00:00:26.099> some

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
off it helps to have a wall with some

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.550 
off it helps to have a wall with some
nice<00:00:26.430> contrast<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> white<00:00:28.349> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
nice contrast if you have a white a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.070 
nice contrast if you have a white a
really<00:00:28.920> pale<00:00:29.429> wall<00:00:29.789> these<00:00:30.570> guys<00:00:30.720> aren't<00:00:30.929> going

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
really pale wall these guys aren't going

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.299 
really pale wall these guys aren't going
to<00:00:31.140> show<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.590> well<00:00:31.740> unless<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.189> have

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
to show up that well unless you have

glitter<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.320> them<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:34.920> odds<00:00:35.100> are<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.430> they're

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
glitter on them but odds are if they're

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
contrast it really really shows up nice

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.330

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
but my experience that's not strong

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.220 
but my experience that's not strong
enough<00:00:50.000> don't<00:00:51.000> use<00:00:51.210> things<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.570> duct<00:00:51.989> tape

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
enough don't use things like duct tape

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
enough don't use things like duct tape
or<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> could<00:00:52.710> take<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.160> lot<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> paint<00:00:53.969> off

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
of the wall you choose and that probably

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.369 
of the wall you choose and that probably
won't<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> well<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.199> into

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
won't have a well you can get into

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.720 
won't have a well you can get into

at least for the ends and it's going to
be<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.360> an<00:01:15.479> X<00:01:15.689> shape<00:01:16.159> that'll<00:01:17.159> actually<00:01:17.310> help

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
be in an X shape that'll actually help

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.810 
be in an X shape that'll actually help
give<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.299> maximum<00:01:18.840> support<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.700> keep<00:01:20.700> in

not want the tape on the string touching
the<00:01:59.310> snowflakes<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.119> result<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.570> rip

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the snowflakes that can result in rip

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.749 
the snowflakes that can result in rip
snowflakes<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.920> part<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> string<00:02:02.579> gives

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
snowflakes if part of the string gives

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.020 
snowflakes if part of the string gives
away<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:06.180> then<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.420> you're<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:06.869> is

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
away and then what you're going to do is

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.339 
away and then what you're going to do is
basically<00:02:09.030> go<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.539> end<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:09.929> string

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
basically go to the end of your string

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.400 
basically go to the end of your string
and<00:02:11.180> finish<00:02:12.180> your<00:02:12.209> off

and finish your off

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.930 
and finish your off
then<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.160> go<00:02:14.280> back<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.820> to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
then you go back and you have to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.610 
then you go back and you have to
readjust<00:02:15.210> some<00:02:15.660> things<00:02:15.930> make<00:02:16.260> sure<00:02:16.410> some

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
readjust some things make sure some

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.930 
readjust some things make sure some
things<00:02:16.800> are<00:02:16.980> staying<00:02:17.310> right<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.820> it's

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
things are staying right that it's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.910 
things are staying right that it's
looking<00:02:18.210> okay<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:19.290> may<00:02:19.410> actually<00:02:19.560> want<00:02:19.800> to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
looking okay you may actually want to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.950 
looking okay you may actually want to
then<00:02:20.100> change<00:02:20.130> some<00:02:20.520> positions<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.630> by<00:02:21.810> and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
then change some positions but by and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.880 
then change some positions but by and
large<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.770> your<00:02:22.890> snowflakes<00:02:23.400> hung<00:02:23.700> up
