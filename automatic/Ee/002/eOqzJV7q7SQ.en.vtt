00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
can see I have a very strange way of

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.050 
can see I have a very strange way of
putting<00:05:12.830> on<00:05:13.250> my<00:05:13.400> mascara<00:05:13.910> I<00:05:14.270> blink<00:05:15.050> my<00:05:15.140> eyelids

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
putting on my mascara I blink my eyelids

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.850 
putting on my mascara I blink my eyelids
and<00:05:17.060> I<00:05:17.210> like<00:05:17.420> to<00:05:17.600> apply<00:05:17.630> my<00:05:18.020> mascara<00:05:18.170> in<00:05:18.740> this

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
and I like to apply my mascara in this

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.060 
and I like to apply my mascara in this
way<00:05:19.160> because<00:05:20.120> as<00:05:20.480> you<00:05:20.600> can<00:05:20.780> see<00:05:21.050> well<00:05:21.590> take<00:05:21.920> off

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
way because as you can see well take off

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.560 
way because as you can see well take off
the<00:05:22.190> tip<00:05:22.870> when<00:05:23.870> I<00:05:23.900> blink<00:05:24.260> my<00:05:24.380> eyelashes<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.640> use

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
the tip when I blink my eyelashes I use

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.250 
the tip when I blink my eyelashes I use
the<00:05:26.750> wand<00:05:27.020> to<00:05:27.470> push<00:05:28.370> up<00:05:28.700> my<00:05:29.330> lashes<00:05:29.900> even

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
the wand to push up my lashes even

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.180 
the wand to push up my lashes even
further

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
further

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.400 
further
so<00:05:31.640> it<00:05:31.940> helps<00:05:32.270> to<00:05:32.300> further<00:05:32.930> curl<00:05:33.260> my<00:05:33.380> lashes

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
so it helps to further curl my lashes

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.950 
so it helps to further curl my lashes
and<00:05:34.040> just<00:05:34.100> make<00:05:34.400> my<00:05:34.610> eyes<00:05:34.820> look<00:05:34.960> more
