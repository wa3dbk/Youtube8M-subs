00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and it works really good i actually

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.320 
and it works really good i actually
created<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.409> route<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:06.360> through<00:02:06.390> am<00:02:07.350> an

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
created this route it through am an

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.809 
created this route it through am an
add-on<00:02:09.330> called<00:02:10.140> gather<00:02:10.530> if<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.520> don't<00:02:11.700> know

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
add-on called gather if you don't know

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.640 
add-on called gather if you don't know
what<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:11.970> is

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
what that is

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.509 
what that is
so<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:14.150> turn<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.510> on<00:02:14.629> and<00:02:14.870> just<00:02:15.650> mainly<00:02:16.189> for

so you turn it on and just mainly for

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.869 
so you turn it on and just mainly for

it's even easier well I'm going to be

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.699 
it's even easier well I'm going to be
trained<00:02:39.049> more<00:02:39.230> routes<00:02:39.819> actually<00:02:40.819> have<00:02:41.709> what

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
trained more routes actually have what

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:50.069 
trained more routes actually have what
