bottom<00:03:45.260> a<00:03:45.440> little<00:03:45.530> bit<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:47.209> then<00:03:49.329> take<00:03:50.329> your

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
bottom a little bit and then take your

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.930 
bottom a little bit and then take your
new<00:03:50.600> pot<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:52.060> here's<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.180> trick<00:03:54.850> when<00:03:55.850> you

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
new pot and here's the trick when you

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.580 
new pot and here's the trick when you
put<00:03:56.120> them<00:03:56.209> in<00:03:57.549> make<00:03:58.549> sure

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.460 

did<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.520> get<00:04:01.670> it<00:04:01.790> all<00:04:01.940> in<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.209> rungs<00:04:02.470> being

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
did you get it all in the rungs being

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.470 
did you get it all in the rungs being
very<00:04:03.709> careful<00:04:04.010> having<00:04:04.610> two<00:04:04.760> people<00:04:04.910> do<00:04:05.270> this

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
very careful having two people do this

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.380 
very careful having two people do this
is<00:04:05.750> better<00:04:06.170> than<00:04:06.380> one<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:08.090> make<00:04:08.390> sure<00:04:10.240> that<00:04:11.240> it

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
is better than one and make sure that it

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.970 
is better than one and make sure that it
goes<00:04:11.480> in<00:04:11.750> now<00:04:11.959> it<00:04:12.080> didn't<00:04:12.350> go<00:04:12.440> in<00:04:12.470> all<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:12.830> way

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
goes in now it didn't go in all the way

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.430 
goes in now it didn't go in all the way
okay<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:13.880> we're<00:04:14.810> going<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:14.959> have<00:04:15.050> to<00:04:15.200> do<00:04:15.319> is

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
okay so we're going to have to do is

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.640 
okay so we're going to have to do is
going<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.709> have<00:04:15.800> to<00:04:15.890> take<00:04:16.070> it<00:04:16.220> back<00:04:16.340> out<00:04:17.650> being

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
going to have to take it back out being

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.129 
going to have to take it back out being
very<00:04:18.709> careful<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:20.269> you<00:04:20.299> can<00:04:20.690> take<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:21.019> out

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
very careful and you can take it out

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.860 
very careful and you can take it out
just<00:04:21.560> a<00:04:21.889> little<00:04:21.919> bit<00:04:22.480> and<00:04:23.480> since<00:04:23.690> I<00:04:23.840> already

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
just a little bit and since I already

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.050 
just a little bit and since I already
have<00:04:24.230> some<00:04:24.470> mix<00:04:24.650> in<00:04:24.830> there<00:04:25.100> I<00:04:25.280> can<00:04:25.669> take<00:04:25.880> some

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
have some mix in there I can take some

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.370 
have some mix in there I can take some
of<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.270> out<00:04:28.480> being<00:04:29.480> very<00:04:29.720> careful<00:04:29.900> not<00:04:30.230> to

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
of it out being very careful not to

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:40.720 
of it out being very careful not to
break<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.680> branches<00:04:33.310> like<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:39.580> didn't<00:04:40.580> say

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
break the branches like so I didn't say

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:49.450 
break the branches like so I didn't say
it<00:04:40.850> was<00:04:40.970> going<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.180> be<00:04:41.240> easy

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.030 

I<00:04:51.160> think<00:04:52.160> you're<00:04:52.460> there<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:54.380> then<00:04:54.530> we'll<00:04:54.710> try

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
I think you're there so then we'll try

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.730 
I think you're there so then we'll try
it<00:04:55.070> again<00:04:56.560> put<00:04:57.560> it<00:04:57.680> in<00:04:57.950> there<00:04:58.220> okay<00:04:59.740> perfect

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
it again put it in there okay perfect

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.100 
it again put it in there okay perfect
now<00:05:00.950> another<00:05:01.850> thing<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:02.270> you'll<00:05:02.450> see<00:05:02.660> too<00:05:02.870> is

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
now another thing that you'll see too is

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.140 
now another thing that you'll see too is
I<00:05:03.650> bucket<00:05:04.100> full<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.400> dirt<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.090> also<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:05.870> wire

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
I bucket full of dirt and also a wire

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.970 
I bucket full of dirt and also a wire
basket<00:05:08.150> or<00:05:08.300> a<00:05:08.360> wire<00:05:08.660> shelf<00:05:09.290> on<00:05:09.470> top<00:05:09.680> of<00:05:09.860> it

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
basket or a wire shelf on top of it

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.710 
basket or a wire shelf on top of it
that's<00:05:10.190> so<00:05:10.370> I<00:05:10.400> can<00:05:10.520> sit<00:05:11.030> there<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.180> put<00:05:11.360> soil

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
that's so I can sit there and put soil

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.510 
that's so I can sit there and put soil
in<00:05:12.050> it<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:12.350> it<00:05:12.530> will<00:05:12.620> drop<00:05:12.830> down<00:05:12.890> back<00:05:13.310> into

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
in it and it will drop down back into

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:21.850 
in it and it will drop down back into
the<00:05:13.640> bucket<00:05:14.950> mix<00:05:15.950> this<00:05:16.130> up<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.460> little<00:05:16.550> bit<00:05:20.860> put

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
the bucket mix this up a little bit put

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.900 
the bucket mix this up a little bit put
your<00:05:22.010> soil<00:05:22.160> in<00:05:22.520> there<00:05:24.220> see<00:05:25.220> this<00:05:25.370> wire<00:05:25.550> shelf

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
your soil in there see this wire shelf

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.490 
your soil in there see this wire shelf
idea<00:05:26.300> is<00:05:26.390> really<00:05:26.750> good<00:05:26.930> because<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.170> can<00:05:27.380> just

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
idea is really good because you can just

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.460 
idea is really good because you can just
sit<00:05:27.740> there<00:05:27.890> and<00:05:27.920> shake<00:05:28.600> all<00:05:29.600> the<00:05:29.660> dirt<00:05:30.050> in<00:05:30.260> here

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
sit there and shake all the dirt in here

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.320 
sit there and shake all the dirt in here
throw<00:05:30.830> it<00:05:30.860> in<00:05:31.190> there<00:05:31.840> where<00:05:32.840> you<00:05:32.960> need<00:05:33.140> to<00:05:33.290> move

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
throw it in there where you need to move

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:42.100 
throw it in there where you need to move
like<00:05:35.330> so<00:05:35.570> and<00:05:36.140> then<00:05:38.470> Pat<00:05:39.470> it<00:05:40.720> now<00:05:41.720> don't<00:05:41.930> worry

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
like so and then Pat it now don't worry

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.490 
like so and then Pat it now don't worry
about<00:05:42.260> the<00:05:42.530> branches<00:05:42.920> falling<00:05:43.190> out<00:05:43.460> right<00:05:43.700> now

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
about the branches falling out right now

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.720 
about the branches falling out right now
you<00:05:45.500> don't<00:05:45.710> really<00:05:45.920> need<00:05:46.130> to<00:05:46.190> be<00:05:46.340> concerned

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
you don't really need to be concerned

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.020 
you don't really need to be concerned
about<00:05:46.850> that<00:05:47.030> research<00:05:47.510> main<00:05:48.200> concern<00:05:48.650> is

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
about that research main concern is

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:57.990 
about that research main concern is
getting<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.210> soil<00:05:51.400> down<00:05:52.400> in<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:53.450> rut<00:05:53.600> area

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.500 

okay<00:05:59.000> that's<00:05:59.690> good<00:06:00.400> next<00:06:01.400> take<00:06:01.669> a<00:06:01.700> look<00:06:01.790> make

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
okay that's good next take a look make

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.150 
okay that's good next take a look make
sure<00:06:02.660> that<00:06:02.870> the<00:06:02.960> plant<00:06:03.200> is<00:06:03.350> bunched<00:06:03.770> up<00:06:03.919> but

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
sure that the plant is bunched up but

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.850 
sure that the plant is bunched up but
you<00:06:04.280> don't<00:06:04.400> want<00:06:04.669> it<00:06:06.130> stifling<00:06:07.130> in<00:06:07.639> there<00:06:08.060> and

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
you don't want it stifling in there and

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.040 
you don't want it stifling in there and
when<00:06:09.860> you<00:06:09.950> go<00:06:10.100> to<00:06:10.160> put<00:06:10.400> a<00:06:10.430> branch<00:06:10.700> in<00:06:11.030> if<00:06:11.810> you're

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
when you go to put a branch in if you're

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:18.520 
when you go to put a branch in if you're
very<00:06:12.320> careful<00:06:14.650> like<00:06:15.650> so<00:06:17.110> you<00:06:18.110> can<00:06:18.139> do<00:06:18.410> it

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
very careful like so you can do it

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.010 
very careful like so you can do it
without<00:06:18.680> breaking<00:06:19.220> a<00:06:19.580> branch<00:06:19.850> if<00:06:20.600> you<00:06:20.810> break

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
without breaking a branch if you break

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.680 
without breaking a branch if you break
the<00:06:21.139> branch<00:06:21.410> that's<00:06:22.190> okay<00:06:22.550> hey<00:06:22.820> your<00:06:23.330> plants

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
the branch that's okay hey your plants

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.940 
the branch that's okay hey your plants
are<00:06:23.780> really<00:06:23.930> healthy<00:06:24.350> at<00:06:24.440> this<00:06:24.650> point

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
are really healthy at this point

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.100 
are really healthy at this point
hopefully<00:06:25.280> and<00:06:26.000> you'll<00:06:26.690> have<00:06:26.840> a<00:06:26.870> lot<00:06:27.050> of

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
hopefully and you'll have a lot of

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.290 
hopefully and you'll have a lot of
cuttings<00:06:27.500> I<00:06:27.760> usually<00:06:28.760> go<00:06:28.910> with<00:06:28.940> the<00:06:29.150> one

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
cuttings I usually go with the one

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.850 
cuttings I usually go with the one
gallon<00:06:29.600> pot<00:06:29.810> anything<00:06:30.290> bigger<00:06:30.500> than<00:06:30.710> one

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
gallon pot anything bigger than one
