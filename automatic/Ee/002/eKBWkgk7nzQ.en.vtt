what we're going to type in this

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.960 
what we're going to type in this
component<00:02:39.420> oops

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
component oops

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.670 
component oops
let's<00:02:42.970> find<00:02:43.270> it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.539 

oh<00:02:46.739> we<00:02:47.489> don't<00:02:47.609> have<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:48.030> yet<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.719> let's<00:02:49.549> before

we're going to do is we're going to drag
the<00:03:03.599> Krypton<00:03:04.049> controller<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.819> so<00:03:06.000> basics

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the Krypton controller so it so basics

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.459 
the Krypton controller so it so basics
will<00:03:06.659> automatically<00:03:07.590> know<00:03:07.799> we're<00:03:08.040> using<00:03:08.340> this

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:09.469 
will automatically know we're using this

will automatically know we're using this
what<00:03:10.469> you<00:03:10.590> call<00:03:10.799> this<00:03:11.700> toolkit<00:03:12.420> on<00:03:12.689> a<00:03:13.290> thing<00:03:13.620> so

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
what you call this toolkit on a thing so

what we're going to do is we're going to
find<00:03:17.159> cooked<00:03:17.609> in<00:03:17.790> magnitude<00:03:19.129> this<00:03:20.129> is<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.519> and

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
find cooked in magnitude this is you and

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.720 
find cooked in magnitude this is you and
then<00:03:22.169> we're<00:03:22.439> going<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.650> pick<00:03:22.889> a<00:03:22.919> team<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.579> I'm

color but not completely oh so yeah you

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.080 
color but not completely oh so yeah you
could<00:04:24.840> resize<00:04:25.199> it<00:04:25.440> like<00:04:25.680> anything<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.430> this

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
could resize it like anything and this

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.830 
could resize it like anything and this
is<00:04:27.270> how<00:04:27.419> you<00:04:27.479> do<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.960> in<00:04:28.199> all<00:04:29.389> visual<00:04:30.389> basics

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
is how you do it in all visual basics

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.249 
is how you do it in all visual basics
and<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:32.550> got<00:04:32.729> this<00:04:32.909> custom<00:04:33.449> foam<00:04:33.810> window

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
and you got this custom foam window

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.529 
and you got this custom foam window
which<00:04:34.680> is<00:04:34.889> not<00:04:35.250> like<00:04:35.520> your<00:04:35.820> actual<00:04:36.360> phone

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
which is not like your actual phone

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.689 
which is not like your actual phone
window<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.169> later<00:04:37.919> which<00:04:38.190> I'm<00:04:38.430> probably

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
window and later which I'm probably

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.490 
window and later which I'm probably
going<00:04:38.970> to<00:04:39.090> show<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.270> how<00:04:39.479> to<00:04:39.539> make<00:04:39.840> your<00:04:40.440> own

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
going to show you how to make your own

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.270 
going to show you how to make your own
instead<00:04:41.159> of<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.490> students<00:04:42.060> but

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
instead of you students but

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.060 
instead of you students but
not<00:04:44.940> yet<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.420> also<00:04:46.290> you<00:04:46.500> could<00:04:46.710> do<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.010> in

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
not yet and also you could do this in

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.090 
not yet and also you could do this in
this<00:04:47.370> OC<00:04:47.850> same<00:04:48.720> process<00:04:49.260> a<00:04:49.470> little<00:04:49.889> bit

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
this OC same process a little bit

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.560 
this OC same process a little bit
different<00:04:50.670> steps<00:04:51.050> so<00:04:53.000> you're<00:04:54.000> going<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.270> have

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
different steps so you're going to have

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.990 
different steps so you're going to have
