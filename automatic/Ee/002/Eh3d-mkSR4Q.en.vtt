00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
is actually a European specific model so

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.720 
is actually a European specific model so
it<00:00:22.560> doesn't<00:00:22.859> actually<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.430> rear

great<00:00:32.040> obviously<00:00:32.189> by<00:00:32.550> Intel<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.329> performance

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
great obviously by Intel the performance

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.750 
great obviously by Intel the performance
seems<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.140> quite<00:00:34.290> robust<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.579> rear
