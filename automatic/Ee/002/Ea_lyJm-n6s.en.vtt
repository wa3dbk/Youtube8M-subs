00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:10.070
 Very much the Siamese is a sense of rhythm N guitar It is this time of the guitarist sound creator 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:14.839
 I would like to talk about how to practice strokes to improve 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.280
 First of all , what is absolutely necessary to improve the sense of rhythm is to practice the metronome first 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.850
 It is to use when 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:26.400
 Well this is not a metronome, for example, when it is a copy you like 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:32.940
 This sure it is that I'll fit the cd Narii sound source if there was Meide their 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:36.390
 Especially when I was playing with only the image of my head I used to play music originally when I was a beginner 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.989
 Who is another but more such Toka was doing piano is another 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.840
 I started guitar for the first time without doing basically anything 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.310
 I copied it at 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.980
 If you do not fit the cd in a situation where you are in trouble, somehow it is in your head 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:54.940
 Will play to rely on the sense of rhythm of 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.480
 In that case , the performance will be repeated without a standard rhythmic sense, so that one's own 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.690
 is not it 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.829
 4 I feel like I got a sense of rhythm 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.520
 Then I can do it for some time 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.690
 Month Hey Yeah You are the bad rhythm 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.670
 Since but it will be struggling with why fix do not know how good is the kind of such form 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:15.220
 From the beginners as much as possible 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.090
 It 's very important to be aware of practicing as you click and then cd 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.830
 I think 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.510
 Another 8 click Well also it's a thing of the metronome which is also in the Toka now smartphone apps 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.780
 By all means also such things because there is a lot of free stuff 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:31.910
 I think there is no loss with one 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.410
 In terms of playing it is to be aware of the note length and post benefit 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.410
 For example, stroke is common 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.460
 Big also one one say say from the Well at the time said that not being able to pick Gane Well I 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.060
 It becomes that element, for example, when this goes 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.080
 a 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.690
 Like 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:58.700
 The case of ignoring the note length-making a rattling noise 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:02.620
 For beginners, the only case is that the head goes in and the note length is going somewhere 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.620
 It is a pattern often seen in 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.570
 Among Tteyuu hit was folded sputum not 's and put away a bad stroke of hurts Do rhythm 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:18.530
 The first turn of 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:23.360
 That contains the the issue in the costume snow that one Two Three Four One-Two Three Four 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.210
 Because I'm made rhythm the first turn in it's only two pieces of note 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.920
 garter 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:37.170
 Two it not in the Motoatama I do not go to be first stretched the length of entering I Tanpa Papata 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:44.200
 Doo eh guess I'm this useless and appropriate has become a length or a 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:46.319
 The performance I'm playing right now says the South Lake culture of the smallest unit of the phrase unit 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.489
 If you can do it while being aware of things 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.680
 Rhythm is after in you should come a little stability to be aware of the benefits 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:59.400
 It is where the rest of a hot air 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.400
 Although there is no benefit what the present performance is actually 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.960
 Say standing standing was Tantatan 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:11.590
 The Tteyuu 1233 nights of the head is the real claudication 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:16.930
 Well I'm resting in the state of stretching and saying that I want a note 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.920
 Even if there is a benefit from that, even if it is the length of the note properly originally 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.350
 Is the same 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.830
 eh 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.830
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:32.410
 For example, if it is playing like this 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:37.290
 It doesn't extend this, so if you can do one note for the first time 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.290
 Rest note is another one worth even when the edge 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:44.780
 ana 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.780
 Well It is one of the differences is not stretched or have stretched this Hano note 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.460
 The haunted version hey 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:58.230
 ana 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.230
 In this properly also Ntte edge and do not wait in that sound this 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.480
 You 're going to be like that 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:09.430
 So it's very important to wait for notes properly 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.460
 I've been going over and over again, but when I do this kind of stroke empty picking 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.330
 If you can not do it, the rhythm is very easy to go crazy 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.330
 For example, often 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:26.199
 Is because like a Pikkin has not been at all this is an up and down from time to time 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:30.789
 It will become difficult to take a rhythm in the not to at all equally 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:33.659
 So the right hand is always high-the right hand is always this movement 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.659
 Only when necessary Te 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:44.719
 In the better was raised by a suddenly stroke has been stable 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:48.919
 It is a place like now If you have you practice stroke while taking care of it good 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:51.420
 All means because I think that sense of rhythm will be better This is also exactly the same in the acoustic guitar in the other station 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:56.990
 Please try to reference 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.990
