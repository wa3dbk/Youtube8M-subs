00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
that's a nice little feature you pin

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.620 
that's a nice little feature you pin
them<00:01:22.369> put<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> GUI<00:01:23.700> down<00:01:23.939> which<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.150> graphical

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
them put the GUI down which is graphical

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.410 
them put the GUI down which is graphical
user<00:01:24.659> interface<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.159> put<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> ruffle

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
user interface you can put the ruffle

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.300 
user interface you can put the ruffle
user<00:01:27.600> interface<00:01:28.020> transparency<00:01:28.740> down<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.130> then

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
user interface transparency down so then

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.640 
user interface transparency down so then
obviously<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:31.579> visible<00:01:32.579> makes<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.270> easier

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
obviously this visible makes it easier

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
obviously this visible makes it easier
not<00:01:34.650> easier<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> guess<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> makes<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.970> um

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
not easier but it guess it makes it um

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.530 
not easier but it guess it makes it um
let's<00:01:36.869> clustered<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.520 
graphics are pretty sweet in this game
you<00:01:41.100> see<00:01:41.250> here<00:01:41.460> nice<00:01:41.729> graphics<00:01:42.259> one<00:01:43.259> thing

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
that I don't really like about this game

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.120 
that I don't really like about this game
is<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> controls<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.530> kind<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.860> annoying

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
is the controls that kind of annoying

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.810 
is the controls that kind of annoying
that<00:01:48.020> um<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.409> guess<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.130> could<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.399> used<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> it

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that um I guess you could get used to it

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.850 
that um I guess you could get used to it
so<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.630> see<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.350> shoot<00:01:54.860> pretty

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519
