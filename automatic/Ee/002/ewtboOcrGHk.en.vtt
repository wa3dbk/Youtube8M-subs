00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.580
No way

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.820
We're not talking this through

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.400
You tricked me

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.580
And you tricked my friends too

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.200
Your purple uniform means bad

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.680
You took away the life I had

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.180
Now I wear a bib that says "Let's Eat!"

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.180
I make some noise with pots and pans

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.320
I'll use my endoskeleton to

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.300
Make you want to never come back again

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.140
But if you do

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.680
We'll get revenge and see how you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.520
Like being stuffed into

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.740
An animatronic golden suit

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.040
Let's see how you like it

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.860
It's like it's meant to be

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.680
Let's see how you like it

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.680
It's like it's meant to be

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.500
Let's see how you like it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.360
It's like it's meant to be

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.420
Let's see how you like it

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.360
'Cause my phantom's hungry!

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.580
C - H - I - C -A

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm never gonna go away

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.220
I look through your right window

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.840
Yellow's all you're gonna see today

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.420
I'm a chicken with a nasty bite

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.780
I'm a girl with an appitite

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.920
The other one is just some party girl

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.080
I've got more fight, just ask the world

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.700
Oh No

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.820
There's a new guard in town

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.100
Let's warn him

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.120
He really needs to get out

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.660
The place is gonna catch on fire

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.500
Don't have the time for a new hire

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.900
'Cause this is between him and us

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.080
Hallucinate, I scream at you

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.320
You really don't now what to do

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.580
It means you gotta run before

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.260
You know who gets you

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.980
But if he does

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.540
We'll get revenge and burn

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.720
The building to the ground

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.540
I'd like one last cupcake

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.300
Before we all go down

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.660
I really want to be

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.660
With all my friends, set free

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.300
I'm getting so tired

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.980
Of being hungry!

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:29.740
(Oh No)

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.760
C-H-I-C-A

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.260
I'm never gonna go away

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.120
I look through your right window

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.560
Yellow's all you're gonna see today

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.420
I'm a chicken with a nasty bite

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.000
I'm a girl with an appitite

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.860
The other one is just some party girl

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.400
I've got more fight, just ask the world

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:59.160
Oh no
