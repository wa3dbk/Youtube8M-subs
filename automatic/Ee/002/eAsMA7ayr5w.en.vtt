we we wear a lot of different hats so we

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.380 
we we wear a lot of different hats so we
can<00:01:03.760> form<00:01:04.000> many<00:01:04.239> ensembles<00:01:05.819> so<00:01:06.819> the<00:01:07.090> the

can form many ensembles so the the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.910 
can form many ensembles so the the

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
crackdown Stoppers originally was a

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.630 
crackdown Stoppers originally was a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
traditional Dixieland jazz band

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.859 
traditional Dixieland jazz band
ironically<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:12.759> think<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.149> started<00:01:13.569> as<00:01:13.719> an

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
ironically I think it started as an

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.779 
ironically I think it started as an
off-duty<00:01:14.350> group<00:01:14.710> if<00:01:14.950> they<00:01:14.979> were<00:01:15.159> that<00:01:15.490> they

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
off-duty group if they were that they

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.849 
off-duty group if they were that they
were<00:01:15.819> doing<00:01:16.119> I<00:01:16.359> believe<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:16.689> was<00:01:16.749> the<00:01:16.859> 1970s

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
were doing I believe it was the 1970s

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:22.469 
were doing I believe it was the 1970s
and<00:01:18.389> they<00:01:19.389> played<00:01:19.689> for<00:01:21.060> maybe<00:01:22.060> about<00:01:22.210> two

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
and they played for maybe about two

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.919 
and they played for maybe about two
decades<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:23.259> then<00:01:23.679> the<00:01:23.799> group<00:01:23.979> sort<00:01:24.549> of

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
decades and then the group sort of

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.760 
decades and then the group sort of
folded<00:01:25.929> and<00:01:26.880> other<00:01:27.880> things<00:01:28.299> took<00:01:29.200> precedence

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
folded and other things took precedence

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.120 
folded and other things took precedence
but<00:01:30.069> a<00:01:30.100> couple<00:01:30.369> of<00:01:30.579> years<00:01:30.700> ago<00:01:31.829> based<00:01:32.829> on<00:01:32.979> the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
discount military music because there I

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.440 
discount military music because there I
think<00:03:50.040> there's<00:03:50.340> no<00:03:50.550> higher<00:03:50.760> calling<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.390> a
