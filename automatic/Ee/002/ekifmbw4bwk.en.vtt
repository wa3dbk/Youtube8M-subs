00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.129
 the windows 7 operating system is a 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.490
 already well-known and very good subject to 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.599
 once we will see this topic a preliminary 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.599

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.440
 in the start menu part 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.840
 the browser part of windows and 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.320
 many more issues if we are going to install 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.560

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.920
 patched your operating system from 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.809
 windows 7 with the next patch I'm going 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.460

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.530
 necessary files for 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.750

 this application of huila in which I 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.100
 has to verify this route that leads to 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.080
 resort system is the place where 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.790

 wait while the 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.250
 transformation if we are going to refresh the 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.300

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.390
 good topic let's perfect documents in 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.030
 my documents and how can you see the 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.670
 quantity the quality of this subject we can 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.030
 watch the time on wifi 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:37.590
 if the battery 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:40.160
 the volume seen as well as the east 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.900
 the start menu 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.100
 now I 'm going to leave you something else ok some 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.740
 some tutorials it says that the time 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.090
 calm down is manually changed true and 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.920
 have to do a series of processes 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.800
 but I 'll leave you also on the subject 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.990
 of jarvis in this pack that says change 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.100
 in which I am leaving you a small 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:04.790
 very simple application with the east with 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.710
 the order that uses the service theme if 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.450
 let's double click here 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.080
 we run communicator 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.800
 this is running this change of 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.970
 org 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.030
 to see and see we are going to see good 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.960
 gives the three of the who or by default or who 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.690
 when you want to subtract author 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.039
 you are going to put the stress to restore it 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.900
 Now I'm going to put chains and I'm going to 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.270
 look for the time I was in 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.470
 desk 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.450
 in the theme and in the theme of windows 7 in 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.080
 changed until now we are going to give 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.700
 click and it's changing the ready time 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.700
 then I have changed work 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.760
 without network I accept 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:57.720
 okay 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.850
 ready perfect then let's do 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.790
 this savings then it is already 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.980
 completely configured the themes that 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.620
 I would also like to teach you how to 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.450
 change the icons but the problem is 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.710
 that when I retrieve the icons by 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.870
 default 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.950
 it is not possible to recover the icons by 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.420
 default 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.420
 so I'll leave your 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.600
 responsibility to change the icons without 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.780
 look around for these icons that are 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.110
 compatible with this topic and change them and 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.940
 well let's uninstall it easily 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.820
 let's type the work just in case 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.870
 someone wants to return to his voice although 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.160
 it is now is very good 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.740
 let's do 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.820
 let's open our pack I'm going to 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:47.960
 leave to download it changed and 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.100
 I will open the application ready is with 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.490
 this gold by default 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.320
 we are going to restore it because it can leave us 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.830
 error let's see if we get an error 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.249
 can be 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.919
 ready we have an error we accept ok 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.359
 these if they pass close program what 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.179
 I will do is open or half of 

00:06:05.359 --> 00:06:09.289
 chores 

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:12.399
 initially now tasks like the 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:15.409
 system just disappeared the process 

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:19.119
 explorer.exe I will start the process of 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.119
 new explorer 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:26.049
 point that is the desk that I'm going to 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.329
 accept to see a moment 

00:06:26.049 --> 00:06:32.539
 explorer.exe ready I accept start and as 

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:34.239
 you can see work has been returned yes and 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.829
 good the subject and you can 

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:40.560
 return it to normal 

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:46.590
 then our windows 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:48.780
 is itself completely as it was before 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.020
 he can return the bottom of the 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.020
 desk 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:59.840
 default by subject but in itself we are going to 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.840
 use the jarvis theme already to finish 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:08.660
 with this little transformation of this 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:13.569
 very good subject if we go to jarvis 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:16.649
 yes perfect we come back again work 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:16.649

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.169
 leave with this topic so that what 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:35.219

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:49.349
 little bit more style to your system remember 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.270
