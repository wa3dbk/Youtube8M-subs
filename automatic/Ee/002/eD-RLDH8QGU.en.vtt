my straight line back perfectly I did my
offset<00:00:25.029> back<00:00:26.339> pretty<00:00:27.339> much<00:00:27.429> perfectly<00:00:27.939> with

offset back pretty much perfectly with

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.269 
offset back pretty much perfectly with
one<00:00:28.300> pull-up<00:00:28.539> and<00:00:28.929> then<00:00:29.710> I<00:00:29.800> did<00:00:29.949> my<00:00:29.980> alley

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
one pull-up and then I did my alley

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:31.950 
one pull-up and then I did my alley
docking<00:00:30.789> pretty<00:00:31.119> much<00:00:31.269> perfectly<00:00:31.689> one

docking pretty much perfectly one

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.620 
docking pretty much perfectly one
pull-up<00:00:32.169> so<00:00:33.160> we're<00:00:33.400> all<00:00:33.610> good<00:00:33.940> those<00:00:34.300> two<00:00:34.510> are

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
pull-up so we're all good those two are

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
initial hump and look out the traffic I

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.880 
initial hump and look out the traffic I
didn't<00:00:49.660> make<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:49.870> hump<00:00:50.080> far<00:00:50.410> enough<00:00:50.620> I

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
didn't make the hump far enough I

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.160 
didn't make the hump far enough I
couldn't<00:00:51.310> see<00:00:51.520> I<00:00:51.790> kind<00:00:52.420> of<00:00:52.480> stumbled<00:00:52.930> getting

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
couldn't see I kind of stumbled getting

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.240 
couldn't see I kind of stumbled getting
forward<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.620> little<00:00:53.740> bit<00:00:53.860> more<00:00:56.250> couldn't

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
forward a little bit more couldn't

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.680 
forward a little bit more couldn't
really<00:00:57.370> see<00:00:57.670> traffic<00:00:57.880> behind<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.270> bush<00:00:58.480> I

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
really see traffic behind a bush I

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.690 
really see traffic behind a bush I
finally<00:00:58.990> see<00:00:59.170> traffic<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.860> it's<00:00:59.980> far<00:01:00.550> enough

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
finally see traffic and it's far enough

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.970 
finally see traffic and it's far enough
but<00:01:01.060> it's<00:01:01.180> still<00:01:01.390> coming<00:01:01.660> and<00:01:01.930> I<00:01:02.380> decided<00:01:02.800> to

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
but it's still coming and I decided to

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.450 
but it's still coming and I decided to
just<00:01:03.160> go<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:04.449> was<00:01:04.809> too<00:01:05.019> far<00:01:05.230> to<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.470> right<00:01:05.650> my

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
just go I was too far to the right my

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.930 
just go I was too far to the right my
wheels<00:01:07.230> because<00:01:08.230> of<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.470> hump<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:09.070> ended<00:01:09.850> up

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
wheels because of the hump I ended up

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.250 
wheels because of the hump I ended up
losing<00:01:10.480> traction<00:01:10.900> on<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.750> ground<00:01:13.870> and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
losing traction on the on the ground and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.720 
losing traction on the on the ground and
they<00:01:14.470> started<00:01:14.740> spinning<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:15.310> so<00:01:15.490> with<00:01:15.610> the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
they started spinning and so with the

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.720 
they started spinning and so with the
traffic<00:01:16.060> coming<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.570> that<00:01:16.659> wheel<00:01:16.840> spinning<00:01:17.230> I

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
traffic coming and that wheel spinning I

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.490 
traffic coming and that wheel spinning I
just<00:01:18.730> kind<00:01:18.909> of<00:01:18.940> got<00:01:19.060> flustered<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:19.870> I<00:01:20.230> ended

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
just kind of got flustered and I ended

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.190 
just kind of got flustered and I ended
up<00:01:20.590> hitting<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:21.010> curb<00:01:21.960> straight<00:01:22.960> out<00:01:23.080> the

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
up hitting the curb straight out the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.940 
up hitting the curb straight out the
gate<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:25.360> out<00:01:25.480> of<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.690> course<00:01:25.900> so<00:01:26.170> as<00:01:26.650> many

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
gate right out of the course so as many

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.350 
gate right out of the course so as many
times<00:01:27.159> as<00:01:27.340> I've<00:01:27.460> taken<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:27.850> course<00:01:28.150> I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
times as I've taken that course I

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.390 
times as I've taken that course I
haven't<00:01:28.630> never<00:01:28.930> taken<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.350> entry<00:01:29.950> onto<00:01:30.159> the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
haven't never taken that entry onto the

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.210 
haven't never taken that entry onto the
course<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.659> I<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.590> guy<00:01:32.710> didn't<00:01:32.950> even<00:01:32.979> say

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
course so I the guy didn't even say

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.370 
course so I the guy didn't even say
anything<00:01:33.280> we<00:01:33.909> did<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.210> initial<00:01:34.420> loop<00:01:34.900> it's

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
anything we did the initial loop it's

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.320 
anything we did the initial loop it's
like<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.530> figure<00:01:35.890> 8<00:01:36.040> loop<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:36.970> we<00:01:37.060> did<00:01:37.210> the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
like a figure 8 loop so we did the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.760 
like a figure 8 loop so we did the
initial<00:01:37.479> loop<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:38.020> thought<00:01:38.260> I<00:01:38.290> was<00:01:38.440> doing<00:01:38.560> well

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
initial loop I thought I was doing well

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.290 
initial loop I thought I was doing well
all<00:01:38.979> this<00:01:39.130> good<00:01:39.340> stuff<00:01:39.370> then<00:01:39.820> he<00:01:39.909> tells<00:01:40.090> me<00:01:40.240> to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
all this good stuff then he tells me to

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.510 
all this good stuff then he tells me to
go<00:01:40.479> ahead<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:40.780> go<00:01:41.530> left<00:01:41.800> back<00:01:42.100> into<00:01:42.400> the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
go ahead and go left back into the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.890 
go ahead and go left back into the
school<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:43.060> right<00:01:43.210> then<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.510> was<00:01:43.570> just<00:01:43.630> like

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
school and right then I was just like

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.760 
school and right then I was just like
what<00:01:44.200> did<00:01:44.260> I<00:01:44.380> do

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
what did I do

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.520 
what did I do
so<00:01:45.370> we<00:01:45.490> pulled<00:01:45.729> in<00:01:45.909> and<00:01:46.150> it's<00:01:47.140> like<00:01:47.229> you<00:01:47.409> know

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
so we pulled in and it's like you know

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.320 
so we pulled in and it's like you know
he<00:01:47.620> did<00:01:47.830> like<00:01:48.400> no<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.700> was<00:01:48.880> like<00:01:49.000> you<00:01:49.120> hit<00:01:49.210> that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
he did like no it was like you hit that

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.420 
he did like no it was like you hit that
first<00:01:49.390> curb<00:01:49.810> so<00:01:50.620> right<00:01:50.830> off<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:50.979> gate<00:01:51.220> I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
first curb so right off the gate I

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.550 
first curb so right off the gate I
messed<00:01:51.760> up<00:01:51.909> so<00:01:52.150> fortunately<00:01:52.780> I'm<00:01:53.020> going<00:01:53.320> again
