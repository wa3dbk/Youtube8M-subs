them<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.440> go<00:03:22.620> up<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:22.860> down<00:03:22.980> oh<00:03:23.190> no<00:03:23.520> no<00:03:23.670> no<00:03:23.790> no

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
them to go up and down oh no no no no

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.260 
them to go up and down oh no no no no
put<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.380> shade<00:03:25.950> down<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.670> don't<00:03:26.850> climb<00:03:27.090> in

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
put the shade down so I don't climb in

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.949

the<00:03:27.360> window<00:03:27.860> also<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:28.890> might<00:03:29.250> add<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:30.120> top<00:03:30.720> to

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
the window also I might add a top to

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.860 
the window also I might add a top to
this<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.890> like<00:03:32.400> that's<00:03:32.820> one<00:03:33.180> more<00:03:33.390> grid<00:03:33.690> high

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
this that like that's one more grid high

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.740 
this that like that's one more grid high
that<00:03:34.230> can<00:03:34.440> fold<00:03:34.740> down<00:03:35.360> because<00:03:36.360> that's<00:03:36.570> what<00:03:36.720> I

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
that can fold down because that's what I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.370
