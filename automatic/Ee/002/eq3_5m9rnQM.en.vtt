00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 welcome to another video I'm the louse it 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.430
 pokemon and good this time I bring 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.529
 a new chapter of equipment guide 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.240
 competitive and good this time 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.730
 let's talk about a team that 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.590
 it's not really seen the truth in fact I 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.389
 until very recently I did not know about 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.640
 this team had to investigate and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.369
 dig a little to know more about 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.710
 how it worked but equally it's a 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.900
 equipment that well used can be loaded 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.750
 to a whole team if it's not that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.630
 several complete equipment since good the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.880
 strategy of this team itself is the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.800
 evasion completely destroy the evasion 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.390
 and good the team we're going to talk about 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.250
 this time the team is 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.570
 gravity equally if they did not see the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.250
 previous chapter of this guide 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.960
 competitive teams that was for the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.399
 I'm going to leave the button pass 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.960
 in link in the description so that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.820
 can go to check it or at the end of the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.950
 video but good now let's talk 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.329
 directly from this here in this type 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.430
 of equipment that are the teams of 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.890
 seriousness that we're going to talk about 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.420
 how it works then well maybe what 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.550
 know or there is not a movement called 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.980
 severity and what this movement does 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.960
 called gravity is that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.790
 completely removes any kind of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.380
 levitation of any pokemon by 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.930
 example if you have the ability to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.300
 avoidance if you have the helium balloon or 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.010
 even if it 's flying type makes 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.170
 be affected by attacks as per 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.000
 earthquake example live earth or 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.259
 any ground attack so 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.990
 we could destroy completely 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.770
 any evasion against attacks by 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.290
 ground type and also for example 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.180
 we could greatly reduce the evasion 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.680
 of the rival team since the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.900
 we would go down on two levels 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.720
 well we could attack with 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.960
 movements that have 70 percent of 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.369
 evasion and attack 100% of the time 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.080
 so this is fine if we want 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.130
 use movements like for example 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.100
 blizzard flare thunder kicking high 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.440
 high among others so if they want 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.539
 attack with the most powerful movements 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.940
 but with less evasion and always hit 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.610
 really with this it will work 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.410
 perfectly but good is this guide 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.630
 of equipment actually works a lot 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.910
 better in double combats since the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.720
 gravity only lasts 5 turns so 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.520
 there it goes 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.320
 If you want to use something, believe me 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.080
 the best where they could use it would be 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.000
 in the double teams but good now 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.890
 let's start talking about the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.690
 invoker is and all about this 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.250
 team first of all we'll talk 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.680
 about the best invoker is that 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.360
 we can find here we have a 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.830
 silverlight isabella and is so good 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.140
 invoker thanks to his skill 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.790
 joker since he only has one 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.310
 weakness which would be the pokemon of 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.170
 fairy type so thanks to this pokemon 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.940
 since he only has one weakness and 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.460
 that we will always be able to but can 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.980
 put the 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.020
 gravity with priority always we 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.480
 we can make sure to put the gravity 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.620
 with priority not so that we do not 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.240
 come out one hit that I'm going to 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.890
 we only have one weakness and 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.840
 make sure that gravity always 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.550
 it's on and another great one 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.470
 invoker that we can see here is two 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.540
 clubs and two triples so good summoner 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.190
 that is the evolutionary mineral since if you 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.590
 we put the evolutionary mineral on top of 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.150
 this pokemon would gain defenses 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.250
 incredibly high so if we want 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.560
 a pretty tough PokÃ©mon that has 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.450
 more weaknesses if you do not have priority 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.490
 but also has some very good 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.569
 defensive statistics believe me that two 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.219
 clubs is the option 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.260
 so these would be the two best 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.900
 invoker is that there will be to put the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.489
 gravity and now let's see what 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.040
 they would be the best attackers because 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.769
 likewise the as there is invoker is 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.129
 very good the pokemon that are dedicated to 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.560
 get the most out of this pseudo 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.120
 climate so to speak gravity and good 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.730
 so not left to talk 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.909
 right we'll start talking about 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.290
 tyrannize throw interests so good 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.560
 pokemon attacker with this weather if what 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.450
 we can use with earthquake with rock 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.129
 sharp as we remember that apart from 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.129
 earthquake that we can beat 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.810
 absolutely everything since the team 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.939
 otherwise you will not have any kind of 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.109
 levitation and apart with sharp rock that 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.120
 apart from being for being 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.219
 remember that it has a lot of power 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.980
 and apart it will not fail because the 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:04.469
 gravity decreases team evasion 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.980
 and pulling opposite - side itar 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:10.469
 offensive is a very good attacker in this 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.260
 in this pseudo climate and we can also 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:15.030
 see it on the special side since by the 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.560
 special side this tyrannize learn 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.410
 blizzard learns 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.020
 flare learns thunder and if not me 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.790
 I'm wrong to also learn this focus 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.740
 blast I do not remember what it's called in 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.930
 Spanish but if I'm not wrong I think that 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.610
 he also learns it so let's remember 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.340
 that now that the evasion of 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.990
 the rival pokemon will always accept 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.570
 with these very many movements 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.220
 power but little accuracy for example 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.560
 also another great pokemon here would be 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.360
 this land horus especially in fashion 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.980
 in totem mode I think it's the mode 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.650
 normal I do not think it's the normal mode 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.360
 sorry and here it would be so good since with 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.760
 alive earth apart for its ability that 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.830
 including the power increase 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.620
 also if we arrive and we get to 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.090
 put for example the life sphere that does not 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.550
 They will lower our lives thanks to their 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.650
 skill and apart it would be very good 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.900
 because we would hit him absolutely everything 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.200
 since there is no levitation against 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.300
 this team 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.940
 and another pokemon that would also work 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.320
 very well it could also work very 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.360
 well with choice escarp because what 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.280
 would do so faster and start 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.530
 absolutely clean everything with kicks 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.770
 high high kicks high high is a 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.270
 movement very, very risky already 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.490
 that we remember that if we fail we 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.530
 we will be taking away 50% of life 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.090
 then remember that what we do with 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.950
 gravity is to destroy completely 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.410
 any type of evasion that can 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.940
 have the opponent so he kicks high 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.850
 high that we get to put accepts 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.890
 right chords 100% so also 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.140
 this fear is one of the best 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.350
 options for super fast and powerful in 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:48.260
 this pseudo climate and good now let's 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.540
 see finally a pretty combination 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.280
 good that would work with this climate and 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.420
 we could also combine it very well 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.010
 with the odd space teams and 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.990
 they would work too well since there are 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.180
 many pokemon of rare spaces are very 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.550
 powerful but they are very slow for example 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.380
 this upper marwat but if we carry 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.780
 let's also put a space 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.640
 weird remember that we could hit the 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.240
 one hundred percent of the earthquakes since 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.340
 the room will not exist 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.930
 we can get it right one hundred percent of 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.120
 the sharp rocks since neither 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.190
 there will be evasion some and what 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.930
 we would do it in the fastest way since 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.539
 we would have the weird space with those two 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.830
 pokemon that are very powerful but without 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.960
 However, they are very slow 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.120
 so also combine it with a 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.830
 rare space team would be the best 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.919
 thing that we could do with these 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.449
 equipment of pseudo climate of gravity and 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.979
 good would be everything for this moment I hope 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.740
 that you have liked this little guide 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.819
 of competitive teams and if they liked it 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.110
 please do not forget to like 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.639
 comments subscribe if they are not 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.190
 subscribed to this channel as we go up 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.349
 two daily videos and upload content 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.669
 quite varied equally if they want 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:52.349
 check in the equipment guide 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.789
 competitive for button teams 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.099
 peace I will leave the link in the description 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:58.050
 or at the end of the video as well as 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.909
 a fight in pokemon with darius is with 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.090
 one more weather team respectively 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:04.470
 a sandstorm team and good 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.360
 for the moment it would be all do not forget to give 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:10.139
 like since if you remember that if we arrived 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.639
 from 70 to 80 likes we will continue with this 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:13.349
 series but good at the moment it would be 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.159
 all thanks for this video see you in 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:15.990
 another adventure 

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:18.440
