 sitting here on December 8, 1685 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.450
 when it is founded with the arrival of 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.090
 Spaniards before the discovery of 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.520
 silver poplar important minerals not 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.860
 it was a population in that area they closed 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.330
 the southeast of the entity existed only 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.730
 indigenous groups that were 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.350
 regrouping precisely to be 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.510
 employees in the extraction of large 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.580
 amounts of silver and to a lesser extent 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.680
 gold minerals that in a short time 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.900
 they made that the place will be planned 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.600
 will trace and be built impressive 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.150

 in Spain relaunched by the King of Spain 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.090
 in the centers very closely ' 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.820
 Latin America including this part of 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.060
 here from the north because poplars that are 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.480
 they built the buildings all with the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.480
 same style 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.459
 a central place that the main square 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.470
 that the parish be built on

 buildings around this center 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.040
 historical 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.690
 we have then south and that's how it was like 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.580
 it was built the gold and silver 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.459
 appreciated minerals that they gave 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.530
 identity strength popularity and power poplars 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.319
 they were also the metals that pre 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.610
 they destined to a disappearance the 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:12.299
 we speak is covered in magic I do not know to 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.430
 where if we want to talk about its history 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:19.510
 and we want to talk about the families of 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.750
 aspens of what happened here the one that 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.620
 has disappeared in almost 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.550
 of the people who have always supported the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.200
 causes not from the art of culture the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.420
 mining activity and great wealth 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.070
 due to the heavy amounts of silver 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.920
 that the first two were extracted 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.690
 centuries of its formation and growth 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.060
 was marked as the first stage of 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.580
 three that identify poplars with brightness 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.490
 falls and resurgence without each of 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.010
 they in this first stage shone by 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.780
 its foundation and rising as a city 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.940
 It was necessary to create a 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.130
 proper infrastructure and of 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.470
 level for the viceroys and landowners of 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.419
 the time those who commanded the works 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.700
 of metal extraction and shipping to 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.970
 center of the country in the strokes began the 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.800
 construction of the city ​​under the 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.620
 David forward direction in that 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.190
 you tell me about the estuary that is 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.960
 precisely the church 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.520
 this temple was followed by monuments 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.960
 important as the current palace 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.390
 municipal in 1899 and the plaza de armas la 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.610
 old municipal jail today house of the

 culture the house of delights without 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.050
 Museum of manners before 

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:34.389
 as well as a large number of haciendas that 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.909
 they remain protected and protected by 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.429
 its streets and alleys of the now center 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.899
 historical but that at the time were 

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:42.999
 the abode of great personalities 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:45.729
 among those who emphasize archdukes 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:47.550
 Viceroys General Colonels Colonels and

 Jesuits had francisco eusebio kino 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.119
 while already in the modern era 

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:54.550
 characters like the tenor alfonso ortiz 

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:56.559
 pulled the actress Maria Felix and the first 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.040
 Sonoran who became president of 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:02.620
 the Republic félix Soloaga 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.250
 are established to whom we speak is 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.630
 and little by little they discover great 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.820
 silver deposits are establishing 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.370
 but the construction of the city was 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.449
 scheduled to be made to the margins 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.449
 of the plank stream 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.320
 in this first stage we also talk 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.810
 it became the scene of bloody 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.690
 battles between the republican army and 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.860
 the second mexica empire 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:35.580

 sinaloa and the two lower californias up 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.020
 in 1831 year in which the 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.420
 separation of the sound states and 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.290
 sinaloa being as city of the 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.290
 Sonoran territory 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.920
 after the cut we will know the 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.960
 story of a 20th century character 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.540
 that revived to show the fall of the 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:09.220
 mining its crisis and deterioration of many 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.220
 of its impressive buildings
