we're here testing with the limo car I

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.859 
we're here testing with the limo car I
mean<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.440> just<00:00:25.470> hear<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.040> going<00:00:26.340> by<00:00:29.869> he's

so<00:00:45.789> far<00:00:46.000> everything<00:00:46.329> is<00:00:46.420> perfect<00:00:46.899> in<00:00:47.350> terms<00:00:47.410> of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
so far everything is perfect in terms of

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.290 
so far everything is perfect in terms of
their<00:00:47.890> weight<00:00:48.039> distribution<00:00:48.730> you<00:00:49.030> feel

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
their weight distribution you feel

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.660 
their weight distribution you feel
really<00:00:49.629> connected<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:50.289> the<00:00:50.440> ground<00:00:50.860> but

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
really connected to the ground but

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.459 
really connected to the ground but
equally<00:00:52.120> it's<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.660> very<00:00:52.870> comfortable<00:00:53.140> right

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469
