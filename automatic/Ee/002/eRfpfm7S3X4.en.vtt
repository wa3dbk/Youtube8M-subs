00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.420
 doubt the game I prefer from all

 time is the game that wanted me 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.990
 mark when I was kid and we 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.119
 Moreover, it is often considered 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.019
 best of the series of smash bros I 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.530
 do not know if it's really 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.380
 better 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.330
 if the tube role below all that but 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.039
 in any case, one thing that is certain is 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.520
 that this is the most technical of the series 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.250

 no doubt about it it's true that it 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.399
 does not look like that but the games 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.140

 of the development team 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.190
 you have to realize the incredible 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.020
 number of parameters come into play when 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.450
 of a fight that are the courses the 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.040
 objects or the mode chosen each 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.090
 detail must be taken into account for 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.040
 assure you the victory 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.360
 but of course that would be a game of 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.180
 fighting without fake cast of characters 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.860

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.970
 smash bros 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.650
 the unlikely encounter between these 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.599
 very different universes any of

 his licenses in one game is a 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.120
 wonderful shot of poker because it allows

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.620
 hundreds of elements or characters 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.079
 from different games of the box 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.120

 nothing starts from the premise that 6.4 advances 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.840
 but the super basic smash bros it's 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.280
 a fighting game that connects all 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.280
 biggest stars of nintendo 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.069

 walk because it's Nintendo Nintendo 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:08.660
 he gets to make this game a game 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.200
 worship by putting all their characters 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.349
 all their universe merge to 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.850

 flow and committing easier 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.490
 for me it does not stay 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.440
 the best game to tell cloud 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.450
 on the lhjmq wolf 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.230
 is simply the best I do not 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:55.470
 never go that so for me I knew 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.690
 super smash bros melee having issued the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.800
 first game in the series when I knew 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.510
 that this game was out 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.880
 I went directly bought in 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.350
 store this game interested me because 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.920
 I grew up with the characters of 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.290
 nintendo 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.790
 the idea of ​​adding multiple characters 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.530
 not only allowed me to know 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.990
 several games that I never had 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.030
 knowledge being young but also 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.310
 the sets that represented each series 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.140
 interested me and gave me the taste of 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.490
 know more about each enemy on each 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.770
 event that relates to 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.710
 playable characters I took better 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.470
 metroid and about fire 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.570
 emblem game &amp; watch ice climbers and I 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.190
 even pass the collectible trophies 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.420
 I loved the system and the fighting or 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.610
 much more fluid than the previous one 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.090
 game and the maneuverability of the characters and 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.430
 r stunning it's a game that's worth the 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.230
 worth trying especially with friends ya 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.350
 sometimes cuts can be surprising 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.330
 and can even cause laughter 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.830
 not seriously and try at least one 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.830
 After ca worth
