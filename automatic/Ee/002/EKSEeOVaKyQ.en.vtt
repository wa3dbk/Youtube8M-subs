00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
someone's like searching on YouTube

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.390 
someone's like searching on YouTube
they're<00:03:50.319> not<00:03:50.470> going<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.680> click<00:03:50.920> that<00:03:51.099> because

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
they're not going to click that because

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
they're not going to click that because
they've<00:03:51.519> probably<00:03:51.640> seen<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:52.030> million<00:03:52.269> times

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
they've probably seen a million times

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.900 
they've probably seen a million times
before<00:03:52.750> so<00:03:53.650> what<00:03:53.799> I<00:03:53.829> normally<00:03:53.950> try<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:54.640> do<00:03:54.760> is

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
before so what I normally try and do is

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.569 
before so what I normally try and do is
just<00:03:55.209> pick<00:03:55.900> like<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.140> really<00:03:56.590> good<00:03:56.769> screen<00:03:57.190> from

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
just pick like a really good screen from

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.000 
just pick like a really good screen from
the<00:03:57.760> video<00:03:58.030> and<00:03:58.420> then<00:03:58.840> like<00:03:59.049> color<00:03:59.530> corrector

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
the video and then like color corrector

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.069 
the video and then like color corrector
they<00:04:00.220> make<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.549> a<00:04:00.609> bit<00:04:00.730> brighter<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.540> then<00:04:01.870> use

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
they make it a bit brighter and then use

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.440 
they make it a bit brighter and then use
that<00:04:02.109> well<00:04:03.069> then<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:03.609> kind<00:04:03.819> of<00:04:03.880> stands<00:04:04.209> out

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
that well then it kind of stands out

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.150 
that well then it kind of stands out
like<00:04:04.780> from<00:04:05.019> all<00:04:05.139> of<00:04:05.260> like<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.440> text<00:04:06.010> which

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
like from all of like the text which

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.180 
like from all of like the text which
isn't<00:04:06.310> normally<00:04:06.579> too<00:04:06.730> small<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.150> read<00:04:07.269> anyway

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190
