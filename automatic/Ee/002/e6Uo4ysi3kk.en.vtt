00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.719 
your baby you could just be in a singlet
and<00:02:02.909> nappy<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.009> other<00:02:05.189> great<00:02:05.460> thing<00:02:05.670> about

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
and nappy so the other great thing about

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.300 
and nappy so the other great thing about
seamless<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.570> they<00:02:07.049> are<00:02:07.170> very<00:02:07.380> stretchy<00:02:07.770> so

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
seamless is they are very stretchy so

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.510 
seamless is they are very stretchy so
you'll<00:02:08.520> find<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.119> often

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
you'll find you can often

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.790 
you'll find you can often
skipper<00:02:09.880> sighs<00:02:10.120> so<00:02:10.750> for<00:02:10.990> example<00:02:11.380> just<00:02:11.560> get

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
skipper sighs so for example just get

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.430 
skipper sighs so for example just get
four<00:02:12.610> zero<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.240> then<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.630> next<00:02:13.930> time<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.140> buy

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
four zero and then the next time you buy

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.320 
four zero and then the next time you buy
them<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:15.160> zero<00:02:15.400> because<00:02:15.730> they<00:02:16.030> tend<00:02:16.270> to

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
them to zero because they tend to

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.780 
them to zero because they tend to
stretch<00:02:16.720> even<00:02:17.230> when<00:02:17.320> your<00:02:17.440> baby<00:02:17.590> grows<00:02:17.920> now

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
stretch even when your baby grows now

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.330 
stretch even when your baby grows now
for<00:02:18.970> each<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.180> those<00:02:19.450> clothing<00:02:19.990> items<00:02:20.410> I'd

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
for each of those clothing items I'd

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.700 
for each of those clothing items I'd
recommend<00:02:21.940> getting<00:02:22.150> about<00:02:22.390> seven<00:02:22.960> of<00:02:23.050> each<00:02:23.260> so

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
recommend getting about seven of each so

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.310 
recommend getting about seven of each so
seven<00:02:24.130> long<00:02:24.370> sleeve<00:02:24.730> onesie<00:02:25.180> 7<00:02:25.690> short<00:02:25.960> sleeve

onesies or rompers and seven singlets

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.110 
onesies or rompers and seven singlets
and<00:02:29.410> that's<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.920> good<00:02:30.250> minimum<00:02:30.520> number<00:02:30.970> that

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
and that's a good minimum number that

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.970 
and that's a good minimum number that
will<00:02:31.270> mean<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:32.260> won't<00:02:32.440> have<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.890> be

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
will mean that you won't have to be

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.820 
will mean that you won't have to be
washing<00:02:33.400> every<00:02:33.880> single<00:02:34.240> day<00:02:34.620> probably<00:02:35.620> every

washing every single day probably every

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
second day and you'll also probably want

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.970 
second day and you'll also probably want
to<00:02:39.820> get<00:02:40.060> both<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.630> newborn<00:02:41.080> size<00:02:41.320> which<00:02:41.710> in

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
to get both the newborn size which in

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.860 
to get both the newborn size which in
Australia<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:42.610> generally<00:02:42.970> called<00:02:43.210> four<00:02:43.570> zero

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
Australia is generally called four zero

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.940 
Australia is generally called four zero
as<00:02:44.640> well<00:02:45.640> as<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.690> zero<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:47.080> three<00:02:47.440> months<00:02:47.770> size

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.770 
as well as the zero to three months size
so<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.460> sometimes<00:02:48.670> called<00:02:49.120> three<00:02:49.420> zero

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780
