performance<00:00:24.930> over<00:00:25.500> here<00:00:25.710> instead<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.310> like

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
performance over here instead of like

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.080 
performance over here instead of like
I'd<00:00:26.699> run<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> 305<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.779> get<00:00:27.949> 320<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.039> their<00:00:29.220> Galaxy

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.860 

so<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.530> course<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.700> first<00:01:22.000> of<00:01:22.510> this<00:01:22.660> game

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
so of course the the first of this game

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.050 
so of course the the first of this game
wasn't<00:01:23.200> be<00:01:23.440> a<00:01:23.470> lot<00:01:23.710> I<00:01:23.740> think<00:01:23.950> okay<00:01:24.670> they<00:01:24.820> almost

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.020 
wasn't be a lot I think okay they almost
two<00:01:25.180> years<00:01:25.450> ago<00:01:25.540> now<00:01:25.800> time<00:01:26.800> moves<00:01:27.160> really

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
two years ago now time moves really

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.630 
two years ago now time moves really
really<00:01:28.390> quick<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:30.040> it<00:01:30.160> definitely<00:01:30.280> seems

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
really quick but it definitely seems

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.340 
really quick but it definitely seems
like<00:01:30.880> they<00:01:31.030> have<00:01:31.060> amp<00:01:31.300> up<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.720> graphics<00:01:32.140> and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
like they have amp up the graphics and

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.950 
like they have amp up the graphics and
the<00:01:32.440> cool<00:01:32.650> effects<00:01:33.180> definitely<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.480> in<00:01:34.810> the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
the cool effects definitely in in the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.000

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
water here and also definitely seems

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.280 
water here and also definitely seems
like<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.520> maps<00:01:39.730> that<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.600> drive<00:01:40.840> on<00:01:41.020> it's<00:01:41.260> a
