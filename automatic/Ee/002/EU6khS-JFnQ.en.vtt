00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.650
 hello love thirsty today should that one 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.680
 give a liqueur again and with a 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.750
 Tasteful combination of cinnamon vanilla 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.210
 and espresso is really good 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.730
 Christmas is therefore great 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.860
 as a gift or souvenir and therefore 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.869
 only have to rest for five to seven days 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.630
 So he will be there in time 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.899
 christmas ready the recipe you can find 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.440
 again on my website it 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.809
 blog.de we need for it 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.539
 vanilla pods cinnamon sticks espresso 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.760
 brown or crumbly powder can be the 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.890
 The latter I use here quiet 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.109
 water which you depending on the quality too 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.019
 can put through tap water and 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.890
 vodka that does not have to be an absolute vodka 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.480
 but maybe not the cheapest 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.659
 First we cut the vanilla pod 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.300
 lengthwise on scratch then that mark out 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.520
 and then distribute it about 2 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.250
 centimeter long pieces 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.560
 Now we go into a pot 250 grams 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.479
 from candied sugar this one half 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.789
 liters of water to enter the 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.009
 cinnamon sticks and then a girl 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.049
 also the complete vanilla pods 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.450
 like and the slashed steps 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.450
 even with stirring we heat everything 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.929
 and cook it in about 20 minutes to a 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.280
 sugar syrupy liquid one 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.100
 in parallel, we give the espresso 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.119
 powder in a suitable container 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.459
 transferred it with half a liter 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.220
 Boiling water and leave the mixture 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.079
 then pull something 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.349
 We turn back the syrup to the 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.989
 now enough is boiled and pour the 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:50.619
 whole pot contents to be prepared 

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:52.509
 Conduct espresso mixture and everything 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.380
 Cool for about a quarter of an hour 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.770
 let's shoot and then we'll shoot that too 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.360
 vodka into it now we equip 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.829
 a dark bottle with a funnel 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.750
 and pour in the liqueur approach and 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.789
 really to pour in everything so 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.400
 also the cinnamon sticks and the 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.780
 slashed red emergency 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.370
 could also be a bright bottles 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.709
 must use this then, however, 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.079
 with aluminum foil then develop 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.109
 screw and now for five to seven 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.209
 let it take days and then we give 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.880
 on a decorative bottle one 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.459
 funnel into this a cloth coffee filter 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.380
 or such a close-meshed filter 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.530
 as I use it here and be the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.660
 liqueur approach we filter it so and so 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.730
 Now vanilla pods remain and stood 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.600
 in the bottle beer for the approach 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.550
 have used 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.260
 and that was already labeled 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.850
 and decorate the bottle completely 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.550
 your taste I wish you much 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.160
 fun in the preparation or even the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.370
 give away a nice advent and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.250
 But then neck would prefer something 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.590
 would like to prepare another drinkable 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.030
 for example, a tangerine liqueur over the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.770
 surely the grandma will be happy too 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.020
 or a black beer liqueur 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.300
 probably more suitable for men 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.080
 then just have a look 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.330
 videos into it 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.220
 I still have to say until the 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.220
 next time bye in
