I<00:00:10.200> won't<00:00:10.980> feel<00:00:11.340> yet<00:00:11.610> what<00:00:11.820> it's<00:00:12.030> going<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.450> do

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
I won't feel yet what it's going to do

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
thoughts it's not going to be a Mars

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.300 
thoughts it's not going to be a Mars
rover<00:00:24.240> or<00:00:24.600> something<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.099> can

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
rover or something you can so you can

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.250 
rover or something you can so you can
leave<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.640> far<00:00:26.910> out<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.170> be

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
leave that far out it's going to be

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.519 
leave that far out it's going to be
useful<00:00:28.500> though<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:30.480> robot<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.929> going<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.349> ride

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
useful though the robot is going to ride

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.680 
useful though the robot is going to ride
around<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.009> house<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.550> while<00:00:32.820> doing<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.239> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
around the house and while doing that it

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.520 
around the house and while doing that it
encounters<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.620> little<00:00:35.010> bump<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.530> as

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
encounters this little bump here and as

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
encounters this little bump here and as
you<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.860> see<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.520> very<00:00:38.850> high<00:00:39.090> bar<00:00:39.360> but

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
you can see it's not a very high bar but

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.330 
you can see it's not a very high bar but
it's<00:00:39.780> moved<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.350> that's<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.739> problem<00:00:41.010> I

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
it's moved and that's the problem I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.720 
it's moved and that's the problem I
can't<00:00:42.329> use<00:00:42.540> wheels<00:00:42.780> since<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.430> robot<00:00:44.430> has<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
can't use wheels since the robot has to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.830 
can't use wheels since the robot has to
turn<00:00:44.910> around<00:00:44.940> its<00:00:45.420> own<00:00:45.539> axle<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> I'm<00:00:48.570> stuck

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
turn around its own axle so I'm stuck

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.020 
turn around its own axle so I'm stuck
with<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> caterpillar<00:00:49.770> traction<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.520> Lego<00:00:50.789> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
with the caterpillar traction for Lego I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.630 
with the caterpillar traction for Lego I
can't<00:00:51.840> use<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.530> closed<00:00:52.860> buffers<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> my

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
can't use the closed buffers of my

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.619 
can't use the closed buffers of my
previous<00:00:53.910> video<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.690> either<00:00:56.030> since<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
previous video and either since the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.740 
previous video and either since the
close<00:00:57.840> buffer<00:00:58.230> give<00:00:58.379> too<00:00:58.590> much<00:00:58.739> traction<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
close buffer give too much traction and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.939 
close buffer give too much traction and
the<00:01:00.750> robot<00:01:01.109> won't<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.410> able<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.739> turn<00:01:01.920> around

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the robot won't be able to turn around

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.620 
the robot won't be able to turn around
his<00:01:02.340> own<00:01:02.460> axle<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:04.019> I've<00:01:04.350> rocked<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
his own axle so I've rocked the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.820 
his own axle so I've rocked the
caterpillar<00:01:06.630> tracks<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.080> some<00:01:07.290> extra<00:01:07.590> left

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
caterpillar tracks with some extra left

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.240 
caterpillar tracks with some extra left
arms<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.710> it<00:01:10.710> works<00:01:11.040> use

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
arms as you can see and it works use

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.530 
arms as you can see and it works use
just<00:01:11.610> fine<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.799> motors<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.939> connected

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
just fine the motors are connected

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.850 
just fine the motors are connected
directly<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:17.159> lead-acid<00:01:17.759> battery<00:01:18.740> using<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
directly to a lead-acid battery using a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.840 
directly to a lead-acid battery using a
voltage<00:01:20.549> converter<00:01:21.950> I've<00:01:22.950> done<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.430> because

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
voltage converter I've done that because

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.890 
voltage converter I've done that because
the<00:01:24.060> IR<00:01:24.600> receivers<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.619> Lego<00:01:26.270> have<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> sort<00:01:27.780> of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the IR receivers of Lego have a sort of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.100 
the IR receivers of Lego have a sort of
circuitry<00:01:28.860> inside<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.610> limits<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.750> amount

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
circuitry inside that limits the amount

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.179 
circuitry inside that limits the amount
of<00:01:31.439> current<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.960> these<00:01:33.960> motors<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.740> consume

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
of current and these motors can consume

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.280 
of current and these motors can consume
quite<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.670> bit<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.060> current<00:01:36.450> although<00:01:37.229> a

weight<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> rover<00:01:47.430> I've<00:01:48.210> put<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.540> two

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
weight of the rover I've put on two

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.359 
weight of the rover I've put on two
dumbbells<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.280> each<00:01:50.549> four<00:01:50.939> kilograms<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
dumbbells of each four kilograms and

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.030 
dumbbells of each four kilograms and
with<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.610> weight<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.060> has<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.590> get<00:01:55.590> over<00:01:55.799> this

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
with this weight it has to get over this

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.319 
with this weight it has to get over this
bump<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.880> let's<00:01:57.390> see<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.810> does<00:01:59.210> here's<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
bump so let's see what does here's the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.940 
bump so let's see what does here's the
power<00:02:00.570> switch<00:02:00.780> put<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> on

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.640 

well

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.650 
well

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.310 
well
as<00:02:09.650> you<00:02:09.860> can<00:02:10.040> see<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.490> it<00:02:11.180> came<00:02:11.420> over<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.900> with

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
as you can see it it came over it with

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.070 
as you can see it it came over it with
some<00:02:12.520> whistle<00:02:13.520> struggling<00:02:14.000> but<00:02:14.630> that's<00:02:14.870> fine

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
some whistle struggling but that's fine

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.350 
some whistle struggling but that's fine
because<00:02:15.380> right<00:02:16.340> now<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.550> total<00:02:17.030> weight<00:02:17.180> is
