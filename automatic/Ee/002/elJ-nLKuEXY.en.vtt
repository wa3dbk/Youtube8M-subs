00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.560
 Hello everyone tankers with you and hook 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.110
 today I will lift the veil of secrecy which 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.160
 wraps up the legendary medium tank 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.340
 made a huge contribution to development 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.480
 tank construction and breaking the course of the war 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:25.859
 soviet t-34 85 namely his play 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.500
 a copy called t-34 85 winning already 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.949
 very soon we will celebrate 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.920
 victory day signifies victory 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.040
 soviet army over nazi germany 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.460
 and on this day April 29 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.079
 exactly 70 years ago was still in the very 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.870
 the height of the biggest battle in history 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.879
 Berlin offensive 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.670
 which on both sides participated more 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.360
 three million people 10 thousand 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.579
 aircraft and 7 thousand tanks including 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.879
 our today's hero video 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.030
 The history of the creation of the tank is very extensive and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.880
 I advise everyone to read it 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.670
 starting from prototypes a 20 and from 32 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.200
 continuing the most massive tank in 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.140
 stories t-34 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.700
 which was made more 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 eighty four thousand units and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.259
 ending with the latest modification of the t-34 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.840
 85 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.420
 but I'm already in front of the review 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.030
 tank in the world of tanks blitz 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.380
 and the first thing that catches your eye is 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.909
 45 year old combat camouflage with two 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.880
 crossed white 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.150
 stripes that served as a guide for 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.189
 allied aviation and other crews 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.310
 allowing you to very quickly navigate to 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.390
 The battlefield is based on the two-color one. 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.000
 summer camouflage 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.000
 small highlight is the logo 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.950
 blitz which shows ownership 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.140
 this tank to the virtual regiment 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.649
 lovers spend their free time 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.509
 for managing multi-ton machines 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.170
 able to destroy the enemy 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.869
 technique 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.509
 one thing I can say for sure is camouflage 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.520
 exclusive and hardly a tank with him 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.880
 will buy until next month of May 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.030
 or never again at all so particular 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.620
 the value for this unit is in 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.160
 collectors will admire him in 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.620
 hangar 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.070
 or still sometimes they will lay out a tank 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.880
 into battle that's about 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.000
 performance characteristics of the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.110
 t-34 85 got historic sure 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.760
 module set 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:40.540
 Sample 1947 here and improved 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.470
 234 m engine extended tower and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.780
 famous gun sis with-53 which was 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.070
 designed to destroy the first 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.170
 tigers and panthers 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.290
 combination of good mobility 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.710
 maneuverability and armament did 80 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.190
 heel 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.590
 dangerous enemy on the battlefield especially 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.140
 with numerical superiority because 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.320
 bulky and heavy German cars 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.830
 simply could not keep up with agile 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.680
 80 heels the same thing happens in 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.430
 a blitz platoon of two tankers will be able to 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.040
 confuse any enemy cannon with-53 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.570
 is alternative on pumped 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.280
 t-34 85 since it has increased 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.650
 rate of fire rather than top but 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.140
 but less armor penetration and quite 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.020
 mediocre accuracy of 042 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.420
 but here at the victorious tank the gun gets 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.550
 increase in accuracy to a comfortable 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.310
 values ​​in 039 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.860
 in the middle distance it turns out that 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.900
 size goes only in victory but 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.660
 increased tank yield allows 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.790
 use without much concern for 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.600
 purse snapping shells with 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.030
 the breaking of which is 167 millimeters 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.900
 enough to break through all the tanks in the side 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.290
 and poop 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.140
 down to 8 levla my definite advice 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.270
 do not skimp on sabots 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.000
 because for effective play on 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.850
 armor piercing need and charging skill when 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.090
 winning 80 heel will throw down the list in 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.910
 battle 8 levla and here is booking absolutely 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.609
 similarly pumped from fellow then 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.160
 It has at TANÇ not work but would 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.100
 that only on the gun mask I won't be on 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.700
 stop this parameter 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.970
 85 q in the battles met everyone and know how her 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.550
 correctly destroy here that concerns 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.150
 mobility is not so simple 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.740
 motor b 234 m inferior in power 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:43.230
 top engine t-34 85 ordinary 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.930
 520 vs six hundred difference is pretty 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.630
 tangible but possible developers 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.540
 equated mobility with hidden 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.580
 chassis parameters such as 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.530
 resistance to soil pickup 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.720
 and so on why I thought so 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.180
 firstly it feels clean 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.760
 subjectively see for yourself how I have a couple 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.580
 minutes diligently drive the tank on the cards 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.100
 admiring the beauty of the second chassis 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.900
 has an increased rate 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.230
 agility and this is a clear hint 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.080
 that there is something a whole tank twirled 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.870
 will be a little harder than we pump oh 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.780
 which I consider to be one of the best tanks 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.680
 on the sixth laval and so I hope it 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.320
 will be mastered by all who have it for t-34 85 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.110
 the victorious will be sold only on 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.820
 May holidays part of the package for the price 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:39.330
 at 9 bucks and 99 cents 99 micro cents 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.140
 99 on per cent so collectors and 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.370
 just lovers of soviet st fly up 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.280
 I can advise the tank only to those 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.550
 tankers who have already fully mastered 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.800
 the usual 80 heel gameplay maneuverable 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.830
 tanks are still not the easiest 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.890
 on this definitely legendary tanks 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.740
 fought many wasps tankers and on his 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.860
 earlier modifications whose honor 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.910
 in our game many awards are named this 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.640
 lavrinenko 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.670
 and buddha and of course alexander 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.370
 Michael Fadin Remember the story of friends 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.840
 but on this I have everything for today 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.780
 see you soon tankers 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.530
 don't forget to like if you like 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.780
