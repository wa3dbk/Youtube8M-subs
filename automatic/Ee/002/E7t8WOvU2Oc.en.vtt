00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
next thing that we will install is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.479 
next thing that we will install is
greenify<00:00:48.770> okay<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:49.829> greenify

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
greenify okay so greenify

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.610 
greenify okay so greenify
which<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.969> act<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.390> AI<00:00:51.420> xposed<00:00:51.809> module<00:00:52.020> okay

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
which can act as AI xposed module okay

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.650 
which can act as AI xposed module okay
so<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.399> work<00:00:53.610> without<00:00:53.850> exposed<00:00:54.420> but

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
so it kind of work without exposed but

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420 
so it kind of work without exposed but
its<00:00:54.870> capabilities<00:00:55.440> are<00:00:55.469> much<00:00:56.010> more<00:00:56.250> enhanced

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
its capabilities are much more enhanced

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.970 
its capabilities are much more enhanced
when<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.180> aren't<00:00:57.510> using<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.440> xposed

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
when you aren't using it with xposed

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.830 
when you aren't using it with xposed
installer<00:00:59.100> so<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.210> need<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> do<00:01:00.629> is

installer so all you need to do is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.290 
installer so all you need to do is
working<00:01:01.320> mode<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.710> head<00:01:01.949> over<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.280> boost<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
working mode and head over to boost a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.990 
working mode and head over to boost a
case<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.199> go<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> options<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
case you have to go to options and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.530 
case you have to go to options and
experimental<00:01:06.630> features<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:08.150> then<00:01:09.150> select

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
experimental features and then select

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.590 
experimental features and then select
the<00:01:10.170> working<00:01:10.650> mode<00:01:10.799> boost<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the working mode boost to get the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.620 
the working mode boost to get the
maximum<00:01:13.070> capabilities<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.369> greenify<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.509> what

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
maximum capabilities of greenify so what

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.359 
maximum capabilities of greenify so what
you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.900> do<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.560> select<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.189> apps

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you can do is we can select the apps

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.130 
you can do is we can select the apps
that<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.729> don't<00:01:18.000> use<00:01:18.270> much<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.869> don't

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
that you don't use much and you don't

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.649 
that you don't use much and you don't
need<00:01:19.320> notifications<00:01:20.070> from<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.759> hibernate

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
need notifications from and hibernate

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.149 
need notifications from and hibernate
them<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.320> they<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.500> not<00:01:22.710> run<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
them so that they do not run in the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.649 
them so that they do not run in the
background<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.850> eat<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.180> essential

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
background and eat up essential

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.530 
background and eat up essential
resources<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.950> battery<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> very

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
resources and battery so it's a very

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.600 
resources and battery so it's a very
good<00:01:27.750> app<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.770> next<00:01:29.040> module<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.520> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
good app and the next module that you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.640 
good app and the next module that you
need<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.909> install<00:01:30.060> would<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.750> amplify

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
need to install would be amplify

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.140 
need to install would be amplify
okay<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.729> there's<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> amplify<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.790> what<00:01:35.939> this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
okay so there's the amplify so what this

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.789 
okay so there's the amplify so what this
does<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.920> selects<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.729> switches<00:01:39.090> off

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
does is it selects and switches off

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.260 
does is it selects and switches off
wakelocks<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.040> stuff<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.150> not

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
wakelocks and stuff so if you do not

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.450 
wakelocks and stuff so if you do not
know<00:01:42.540> how<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.780> handle<00:01:43.049> all<00:01:43.380> these<00:01:43.590> stuffs<00:01:43.920> okay

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
know how to handle all these stuffs okay

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
need to install is boot manager okay so

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.399 
need to install is boot manager okay so
if<00:02:04.469> not<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> menu<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.140> need

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
if not have it in the menu so you need

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.589 
if not have it in the menu so you need
to<00:02:07.530> install<00:02:07.740> boot<00:02:08.190> manager<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.420> this

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
to install boot manager so what this

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.320 
to install boot manager so what this
does<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.899> essentially<00:02:10.500> athos<00:02:11.330> startup

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
does is essentially athos startup

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.850 
does is essentially athos startup
manager<00:02:12.780> or<00:02:12.959> auto<00:02:13.170> start
