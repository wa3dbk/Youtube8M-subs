but either way pretty freakin awesome
the<00:01:35.400> way<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.579> turned<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:35.939> kind<00:01:36.420> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the way it turned out kind of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.780 
the way it turned out kind of
predictable<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.710> cuz<00:01:38.130> dance<00:01:38.369> while<00:01:38.640> is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
predictable in a way cuz dance while is

to<00:04:01.739> be<00:04:01.799> honest<00:04:01.980> with<00:04:02.069> you<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.310> just<00:04:02.340> kind<00:04:02.609> of

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
to be honest with you it just kind of

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.670
