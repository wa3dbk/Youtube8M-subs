00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
pages what's the coolest thing it has it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.400 
pages what's the coolest thing it has it
has<00:01:30.979> all<00:01:31.399> these<00:01:31.640> reference<00:01:32.539> things<00:01:32.959> in<00:01:33.259> the

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
has all these reference things in the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.160 
has all these reference things in the
back<00:01:33.619> like<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.850> resistor<00:01:35.390> color<00:01:35.720> codes

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
back like the resistor color codes

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.410 
back like the resistor color codes
different<00:01:36.860> types<00:01:37.220> of<00:01:37.429> it<00:01:38.060> seems<00:01:38.270> like<00:01:38.390> it

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
different types of it seems like it

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.139 
different types of it seems like it
might<00:01:38.600> be<00:01:38.780> useful<00:01:38.959> for<00:01:39.259> some<00:01:39.679> make<00:01:40.340> project

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
might be useful for some make project
