00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.010
 the first time I heard about the incident I felt the need to 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.010
 share it with the most smoke easier 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.849
 the umbilical cord 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.019
 important during pregnancy 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.019
 is now also 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.789
 the blood of the newborn 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.310
 ojeda in the umbilical cord and the placenta 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.760
 then the covenant 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.840
 contains a lot of stem cells 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.010
 these wonderful ones were the ability to divide indefinitely 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.870
 and also to differentiate to produce specialized cells 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.679
 enrique hernando siles and tissues of the human body 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.970
 scientific investigations allowed to discover the multiple and beneficial 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.280
 possibilities offered by the use of stem cells 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.230
 to combat the numerous 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.650
 I do not know how close a person is to his life 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.090
 umbilical cord stem cells 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.159
 if they use to 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.410
 in that sense unemployment 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.110
 since once transplanted they reproduce forming new cells are the marrow 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.800
 bone without rejection disc 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.490
 I do not know what to do about the same person they have a genetic compatibility 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.900
 exact 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.300
 and can also be used with relatives who are compatible 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.410
 Transplants of cells recovered from the blood of the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.480
 umbilical cord for the treatment of multiple pathologies 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.530
 also carried out investigations open hopeful results assured 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.790
 treatment of other parts 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.270
 this wide range of current and future applications 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.070
 opens public therapeutic expectations before the eventuality of 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.070
 typical diseases and without treatment 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.690
 That's why the need to recover and preserve cord blood stem cells 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.970
 detonating 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.970
 is a transcendental decision question 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.599
 in the network, all your family 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:16.369
 to develop this revolutionary technological advance 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.949
 in the year 2004 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.899
 with the backing of a scientific breakthrough 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:26.589
 years of dedication to the research and development of new techniques for the 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:31.579
 All the family's outstanding health professionals came together to create a 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.009
 service of excellence in the recovery and conservation of 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.439
 stem cells for personal use 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.989
 and almost 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.019
 the first bank of umbilical cord stem cells in chiclayo 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:48.770
 on day 6 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.200
 We offer a child a family insurance 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.099
 now all life the use of stem cells 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.609
 acute of the function where do they emerge from the year 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:04.169
 in another order means that there is a future treatment I do not know about him 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.159
 it is considered favorite 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.499
 the civil life service covers three main stages 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:16.019
 collection of the cord blood sample with a kit provided by life itself 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:20.089
 which contains the necessary elements to carry out this work a 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:24.799
 professionally let me keep that simple blood sample from the 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.049
 umbilical cord instead of throwing it away 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.579
 this procedure without pain or and does not affect the baby or the mother as it 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.450
 performs once cut the separator umbilical cord of the newborn 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:42.279
 the blood sample obtained from the stem cells arrives 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:46.419
 perfectly individualized with a modern barcode system to 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.939
 our laboratory 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.879
 in a special container but seen the equipment 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:56.459
 being able to keep up to 36 hours which allows its transfer from this places 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.539
 distant 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:03.369
 the next stage corresponds to the processing of the samples received 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.590
 the life professionals to follow have maximum instruments 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:10.719
 precision 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:15.739
 latest technology and thus stricter biosafety regulations with the 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.859
 order to select the stem cells that will be preserved 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:25.749
 the selected companies are interested in the stem cell bank 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:29.139
 where by the cryopreservation method 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.819
 are available to guarantee the provision of the same 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.819
 in the event of future use 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.479
 finished the procedure 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.589
 and after it provides a detailed report of the number of cells 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:47.229
 mothers who have been private high 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.700
 being the same 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.029
 available to parents for their possible use other sides 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.490
 leaving evidence that the centuries 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.050
 belong exclusively to his family 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.159
 and it is they who decide when to use networks 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.909
 some more 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:08.919
 your privacy 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.969
 for the shelter 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.969
 throughout the program 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.449
 the stem cell bank said 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.449
 the spreads 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.490
 science brings us closer and is that we know that by having 16 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.249
 I think we were at our level 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:38.509
 the decision made 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.509
 the future both 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.330
 it's not a life ahead
