00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.030 

if<00:01:04.120> this<00:01:04.330> exercise<00:01:04.629> is<00:01:04.839> too<00:01:05.019> hard<00:01:05.379> for<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:05.770> you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
if this exercise is too hard for you you

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.520 
if this exercise is too hard for you you
can<00:01:06.729> do<00:01:06.880> this<00:01:07.030> exercise<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.450> same<00:01:07.690> way<00:01:07.930> but

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
can do this exercise the same way but

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.810

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
body weight to make this easier you can

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.850 
body weight to make this easier you can
also<00:01:16.030> do<00:01:16.270> this<00:01:16.390> exercise<00:01:16.540> but<00:01:17.260> coming<00:01:17.590> down<00:01:17.710> on
