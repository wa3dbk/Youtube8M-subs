how<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.870> start<00:00:43.110> burning<00:00:43.350> calories<00:00:43.649> faster

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370

well<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.180> common<00:00:45.480> misconception<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.680> your

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
well a common misconception is that your

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.130 
well a common misconception is that your
genes<00:00:47.399> determine<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:48.180> metabolic<00:00:48.390> rate<00:00:48.690> in

for<00:00:52.230> our<00:00:52.350> inability<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> keep<00:00:53.160> our<00:00:53.309> weight

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
for our inability to keep our weight

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.790 
for our inability to keep our weight
under<00:00:53.820> control<00:00:53.989> but<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> truth<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.530> your
