pesto<00:05:15.740> blues<00:05:17.020> 245<00:05:18.190> because<00:05:19.190> I<00:05:19.490> was<00:05:20.090> going<00:05:20.300> to

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
pesto blues 245 because I was going to

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.820 
pesto blues 245 because I was going to
get<00:05:20.450> six<00:05:20.750> but<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:21.020> thought<00:05:21.260> it<00:05:21.380> would<00:05:21.470> look<00:05:21.590> more

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
get six but I thought it would look more

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.290 
get six but I thought it would look more
like<00:05:22.010> electric<00:05:22.580> blue<00:05:22.760> but<00:05:22.970> it's<00:05:23.120> actually

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
like electric blue but it's actually

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:37.630 
like electric blue but it's actually
pretty<00:05:24.020> different<00:05:33.520> three<00:05:34.960> purple<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:37.460> that's

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
pretty different three purple so that's

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.860 
pretty different three purple so that's
a<00:05:37.729> total<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:38.500> four<00:05:40.060> and<00:05:41.060> then<00:05:41.419> five<00:05:43.090> six<00:05:44.090> and

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
a total of four and then five six and

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.590 
a total of four and then five six and
peso<00:05:45.830> Purple's<00:05:46.400> all<00:05:46.610> have<00:05:46.820> like<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.150> overlap

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
peso Purple's all have like the overlap

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.300 
peso Purple's all have like the overlap
so<00:05:48.260> we're<00:05:48.380> none<00:05:48.530> of<00:05:48.650> the<00:05:48.770> other<00:05:48.919> ones<00:05:49.130> too

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
so we're none of the other ones too

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:57.100 
so we're none of the other ones too
they're<00:05:49.520> just
