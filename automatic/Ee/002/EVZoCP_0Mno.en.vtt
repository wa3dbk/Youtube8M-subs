that<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.480> easiest<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> turbo<00:01:04.559> at

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that the easiest way to get the turbo at

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.020 
that the easiest way to get the turbo at
the<00:01:04.739> start<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> begin<00:01:05.430> holding<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> gas

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the start is to begin holding the gas

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.700 
the start is to begin holding the gas
button<00:01:06.360> right<00:01:06.570> when<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> two<00:01:06.960> disappears

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
button right when the two disappears

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.370 
button right when the two disappears
however<00:01:08.580> timing<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.390> everything<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:10.229> can

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
however timing is everything you can

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.289 
however timing is everything you can
actually<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> bigger<00:01:11.100> boost<00:01:11.340> take<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> look

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
actually get a bigger boost take a look

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.880 
actually get a bigger boost take a look
at<00:01:12.390> me<00:01:12.510> racing<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.140> ghosts<00:01:13.500> using<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
gas right when the tube began to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020 
gas right when the tube began to
disappear<00:01:19.439> when<00:01:19.860> racing<00:01:20.220> my<00:01:20.340> ghost<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.729> timed

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
they call it fire hopping it's

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.940 
they call it fire hopping it's
essentially<00:03:01.599> just<00:03:02.079> hopping<00:03:02.470> from<00:03:02.680> side<00:03:02.920> to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
essentially just hopping from side to

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.190 
essentially just hopping from side to
side<00:03:03.129> after<00:03:03.670> using<00:03:03.879> your<00:03:04.030> drift<00:03:04.329> boost<00:03:04.569> this

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
side after using your drift boost this

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.170 
side after using your drift boost this
is<00:03:05.349> supposed<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.650> sustain<00:03:06.069> your<00:03:06.220> boost<00:03:06.519> longer

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
is supposed to sustain your boost longer

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.849 
is supposed to sustain your boost longer
than<00:03:07.329> normal<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.810> this<00:03:08.170> certainly<00:03:08.349> does<00:03:08.709> seem

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
than normal and this certainly does seem

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.130 
than normal and this certainly does seem
to<00:03:09.010> be<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.220> case<00:03:09.400> however<00:03:09.879> it's<00:03:10.480> not<00:03:10.690> always

I'll<00:03:41.290> let<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.560> take<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.919> lead<00:03:42.069> in<00:03:42.220> this

I'll let it take the lead in this

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.830 
I'll let it take the lead in this
section<00:03:42.579> so<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:42.940> could<00:03:43.150> test<00:03:43.329> out<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.569> less

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
section so I could test out a less

section so I could test out a less
obvious<00:03:44.079> route<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.799> am<00:03:45.010> straight<00:03:45.459> for<00:03:45.639> the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
obvious route I am straight for the

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
streams of water these streams speed you

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.349 
streams of water these streams speed you
up<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.190> if<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.370> can<00:03:48.519> avoid<00:03:48.609> the<00:03:48.910> rocks<00:03:49.060> on<00:03:49.329> the

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
up and if you can avoid the rocks on the

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.119 
up and if you can avoid the rocks on the
way<00:03:49.510> down<00:03:49.720> this<00:03:50.169> certainly<00:03:50.680> could<00:03:50.859> be<00:03:50.980> the

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
way down this certainly could be the

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.220 
way down this certainly could be the
faster<00:03:51.459> method<00:03:51.849> as<00:03:52.329> I<00:03:52.480> did<00:03:52.720> come<00:03:52.900> out<00:03:53.019> in<00:03:53.139> the

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
my time I'm not saying this is

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.839 
my time I'm not saying this is
conclusive<00:03:56.709> but<00:03:56.859> perhaps<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.400> less<00:03:57.609> obvious

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
conclusive but perhaps the less obvious

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.819 
conclusive but perhaps the less obvious
routes<00:03:58.359> are<00:03:58.690> something<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.169> consider<00:03:59.560> when

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
routes are something to consider when
