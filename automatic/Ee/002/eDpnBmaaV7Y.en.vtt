that much wood in there right now so you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.970 
that much wood in there right now so you
can't<00:00:53.610> really<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:54.000> any<00:00:54.150> secondaries<00:00:54.980> firing

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the camera view around a little bit but

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.009 
the camera view around a little bit but
it<00:02:10.310> takes<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.090> 45<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.780> then<00:02:11.870> goes<00:02:12.110> up<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
it takes a 45 and then goes up to the

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.710 
it takes a 45 and then goes up to the
ceiling

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.800 

adapter<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.860> then<00:02:22.730> right<00:02:23.120> from<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.480> point

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
adapter and then right from that point

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.140 
adapter and then right from that point
there's<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.980> second<00:02:25.310> floor<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.730> then<00:02:25.880> a

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
there's the second floor and then a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.800 
there's the second floor and then a
third<00:02:26.930> floor<00:02:27.290> loft<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.520> that's<00:02:29.330> all<00:02:29.540> the

third floor loft and that's all the
class<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.380> Simpson<00:02:31.160> dura<00:02:31.340> vent<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.790> believe<00:02:32.780> that

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
class a Simpson dura vent I believe that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.270 
class a Simpson dura vent I believe that
was<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.410> 48<00:02:34.100> inch<00:02:34.310> pieces<00:02:34.640> on<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.690> roof<00:02:36.280> going

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
was the 48 inch pieces on the roof going

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.870 
was the 48 inch pieces on the roof going
from<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:37.970> point<00:02:38.240> on<00:02:38.390> upwards<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:40.160> uh<00:02:40.190> like<00:02:40.790> I

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
from that point on upwards but uh like I

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.070 
from that point on upwards but uh like I
said<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.180> throws<00:02:41.420> off<00:02:41.570> some<00:02:41.750> good<00:02:41.870> heat

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
said this throws off some good heat

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.360 
said this throws off some good heat
right<00:02:42.920> now<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.100> blower<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:44.360> on<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:46.100> just

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
right now the blower is on that just

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.450 
right now the blower is on that just
simply<00:02:46.670> circulates<00:02:47.180> heat<00:02:47.450> out<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.840> back<00:02:48.460> of

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
simply circulates heat out the back of

00:02:49.460 --> 00:03:08.780 
simply circulates heat out the back of
the<00:02:50.380> rear<00:02:52.420> guard<00:02:53.420> plate
