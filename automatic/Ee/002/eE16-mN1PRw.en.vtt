00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
things that I've seen happen in the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.610 
things that I've seen happen in the
tutorials<00:00:37.100> that<00:00:37.429> I've<00:00:37.879> come<00:00:38.090> across<00:00:38.620> online

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
tutorials that I've come across online

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.090 
tutorials that I've come across online
is<00:00:40.269> that<00:00:41.269> the<00:00:41.449> lights<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:42.530> put<00:00:42.739> next<00:00:43.039> to

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
is that the lights that you put next to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.770 
is that the lights that you put next to
the<00:00:43.160> bridge<00:00:43.339> are<00:00:43.550> very<00:00:43.789> bright<00:00:44.089> and<00:00:44.449> they<00:00:44.570> tend

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
the bridge are very bright and they tend

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.380 
the bridge are very bright and they tend
to<00:00:44.839> bleach<00:00:45.199> out<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.800> lot<00:00:46.399> of<00:00:46.519> these<00:00:46.609> screens

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
to bleach out a lot of these screens

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.380 
to bleach out a lot of these screens
here<00:00:47.749> which<00:00:48.410> isn't<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:48.829> bad<00:00:48.980> along<00:00:49.429> the<00:00:49.699> sides

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
here which isn't so bad along the sides

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.989 
here which isn't so bad along the sides
here<00:00:50.660> but<00:00:50.839> it's<00:00:51.679> sure<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.920> shame<00:00:52.190> to<00:00:52.429> bleach<00:00:52.789> out

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
here but it's sure a shame to bleach out

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.209 
here but it's sure a shame to bleach out
that<00:00:53.210> main<00:00:53.420> viewer<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:54.409> was<00:00:54.980> trying<00:00:55.100> to

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
that main viewer so I was trying to

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.139 
that main viewer so I was trying to
think<00:00:55.309> of<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.519> way<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.670> keep<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:56.089> from

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
think of a way to keep that from

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.000 
think of a way to keep that from
happening<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:56.839> what<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:56.989> decided<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.469> do<00:00:57.649> was<00:00:57.890> to

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
happening so what I decided to do was to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.489 
happening so what I decided to do was to
glue<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.219> piece<00:00:58.460> of<00:00:58.640> styrene<00:00:58.940> plastic<00:00:59.839> to<00:01:00.409> the

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
glue a piece of styrene plastic to the

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:04.479 
glue a piece of styrene plastic to the
back<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.069> and<00:01:02.589> this<00:01:03.589> is<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.859> styrene<00:01:04.129> here

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
back of it and this is the styrene here

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
the along the outside of the bridge and

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.310 
the along the outside of the bridge and
the<00:01:30.740> floor<00:01:31.009> is<00:01:31.039> all<00:01:31.340> painted<00:01:31.759> black<00:01:32.320> again

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
that's really just to block the lighting

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.940 
that's really just to block the lighting
out<00:01:34.969> so<00:01:35.149> that<00:01:35.299> when<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.750> lights<00:01:36.380> do<00:01:36.590> come<00:01:36.799> on

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
out so that when the lights do come on

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.639 
out so that when the lights do come on
you<00:01:37.130> can<00:01:37.280> appreciate<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.880> colors<00:01:38.149> that<00:01:38.649> are

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
you can appreciate the colors that are

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.499 
you can appreciate the colors that are
supposed<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.219> be<00:01:40.399> seen<00:01:40.700> rather<00:01:41.030> than<00:01:41.270> trying

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
supposed to be seen rather than trying

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.120 
supposed to be seen rather than trying
rather<00:01:41.930> than<00:01:42.140> seeing<00:01:42.380> through<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.680> floor<00:01:42.920> or

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
rather than seeing through the floor or

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.849 
rather than seeing through the floor or
through<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.369> plastic<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.500> that's<00:01:45.500> all<00:01:45.649> just

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
through the plastic so that's all just

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.249 
through the plastic so that's all just
to<00:01:45.979> block<00:01:46.159> out<00:01:46.430> light<00:01:46.460> work<00:01:46.909> not<00:01:47.899> supposed<00:01:48.200> to

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
to block out light work not supposed to

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.120 
to block out light work not supposed to
shine<00:01:48.469> through<00:01:50.200> alright<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.649> I<00:01:51.680> have<00:01:51.979> it

here<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:05.719> can<00:02:05.840> see<00:02:06.049> a<00:02:06.289> lot<00:02:06.859> of<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.070> detail

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
here so you can see a lot of the detail

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.410 
here so you can see a lot of the detail
you<00:02:09.100> know<00:02:09.190> one<00:02:09.610> thing<00:02:09.759> I<00:02:09.850> did<00:02:10.000> want<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.270> also

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
you know one thing I did want to also

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.449 
you know one thing I did want to also
point<00:02:10.750> out<00:02:10.899> is<00:02:11.050> because<00:02:11.380> these<00:02:11.680> lights<00:02:12.160> are

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
point out is because these lights are

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.460 
point out is because these lights are
very<00:02:12.790> bright<00:02:12.940> as<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.540> can<00:02:13.690> see<00:02:13.900> here<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:16.470> had

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
very bright as you can see here so I had

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.809 
very bright as you can see here so I had
to<00:02:17.650> coat<00:02:17.980> both<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.270> inside<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.819> outside

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
to coat both the inside and the outside

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.880 
to coat both the inside and the outside
with<00:02:22.330> several<00:02:22.750> coats<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.140> paint<00:02:23.380> actually<00:02:23.680> I

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
with several coats of paint actually I

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.610 
with several coats of paint actually I
primed<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.459> with<00:02:25.209> black<00:02:25.510> primer<00:02:25.930> along<00:02:26.470> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
primed it with black primer along the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.660 
primed it with black primer along the
outside<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.590> then<00:02:29.800> along<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.280> inside

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
outside and and then along the inside

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.430 
outside and and then along the inside
and<00:02:30.970> then<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.209> repainted<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.840> inside<00:02:32.200> with<00:02:32.410> a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
and then I repainted the inside with a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.210 
and then I repainted the inside with a
white<00:02:32.760> primer<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.230> then<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.440> course<00:02:35.470> finally

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
white primer and then of course finally

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.080 
white primer and then of course finally
painted<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.680> outside<00:02:38.680> with<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.250> light<00:02:39.880> gray

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
painted the outside with the light gray

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.610 
painted the outside with the light gray
color<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:41.019> rest<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.350> ship<00:02:41.500> is

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
color that the rest of the ship is

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.949 
color that the rest of the ship is
painted<00:02:41.950> with<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:42.430> that's<00:02:43.360> necessary

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
painted with and that's necessary

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.620 
painted with and that's necessary
because<00:02:44.140> if<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.340> don't<00:02:45.640> apply<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.420> many

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
because if you don't apply that many

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.229 
because if you don't apply that many
coats<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.950> light<00:02:48.160> will<00:02:48.489> shine<00:02:48.820> through<00:02:48.880> the

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
coats the light will shine through the

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.540 
coats the light will shine through the
plastic<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.650> when<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:50.860> turn<00:02:51.010> everything<00:02:51.310> on

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
plastic so when you turn everything on

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.790 
plastic so when you turn everything on
they'll<00:02:52.180> get<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.480> glowing<00:02:52.780> effect<00:02:53.200> all

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
they'll get this glowing effect all

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.620 
they'll get this glowing effect all
along<00:02:54.190> here<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.640> that's<00:02:54.819> not<00:02:55.180> supposed<00:02:55.569> to

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
along here and that's not supposed to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.530 
along here and that's not supposed to
happen<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.819> so<00:02:57.819> yeah<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.090> looks<00:02:58.269> pretty<00:02:58.330> good

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
happen so so yeah it looks pretty good

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.930 
happen so so yeah it looks pretty good
and<00:02:58.950> I'm<00:02:59.950> gonna<00:03:00.069> turn<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> lights<00:03:00.610> off<00:03:00.760> here

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
and I'm gonna turn the lights off here

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.240 
and I'm gonna turn the lights off here
so<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.120> can<00:03:01.209> just<00:03:01.239> get<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> better<00:03:01.600> view<00:03:01.840> and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
so you can just get a better view and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.590 
so you can just get a better view and
what<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.340> lights<00:03:03.550> off<00:03:03.760> at<00:03:04.030> least<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.300> can<00:03:04.450> see

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
what the lights off at least you can see

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.759 
what the lights off at least you can see
that<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.840> light's<00:03:05.050> not<00:03:05.170> coming<00:03:05.560> through<00:03:05.680> the

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
that the light's not coming through the

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.770 
that the light's not coming through the
plastic<00:03:06.220> there<00:03:06.400> but<00:03:06.670> because<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.540> video

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
plastic there but because of the video

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.630 
plastic there but because of the video
camera<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.260> does<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.650> pure<00:03:08.920> bleached<00:03:09.160> out<00:03:09.370> but

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
camera it does the pure bleached out but

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.580 
camera it does the pure bleached out but
as<00:03:09.850> I'm<00:03:10.000> looking<00:03:10.150> at<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.630> actually<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.410> view

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
as I'm looking at it actually that view

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.100 
as I'm looking at it actually that view
screen<00:03:11.890> looks<00:03:12.489> looks<00:03:12.880> pretty<00:03:13.150> good<00:03:13.360> so<00:03:13.660> I

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
screen looks looks pretty good so I

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.350 
screen looks looks pretty good so I
thought<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.829> would<00:03:15.070> give<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.610> that<00:03:15.760> hint<00:03:16.060> there

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
thought I would give you that hint there

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.180 
thought I would give you that hint there
when<00:03:16.600> you're<00:03:16.750> putting<00:03:17.019> your<00:03:17.110> ship<00:03:18.040> together

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
when you're putting your ship together

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.979 
when you're putting your ship together
something<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.269> keep<00:03:19.420> in<00:03:19.570> mind<00:03:19.750> are<00:03:19.959> the

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
something to keep in mind are the

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.229 
something to keep in mind are the
brightness<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.650> these<00:03:20.790> lights<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:21.910> light<00:03:22.180> up

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
brightness of these lights that light up

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.259 
brightness of these lights that light up
to<00:03:22.450> bridge<00:03:22.600> area<00:03:22.900> oh<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:23.980> by<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.160> way<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.790> was

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
to bridge area oh and by the way I was

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.690 
to bridge area oh and by the way I was
able<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.630> figure<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.440> out<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:26.769> I<00:03:27.190> should<00:03:27.610> have

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
able to figure it out I I should have

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.170 
able to figure it out I I should have
tried<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:27.910> little<00:03:28.060> harder<00:03:28.590> but<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:30.640> can<00:03:30.880> test

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
tried a little harder but you can test

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.130 
tried a little harder but you can test
these<00:03:31.329> lights<00:03:31.630> out<00:03:31.840> by<00:03:32.140> simply<00:03:34.140> partially

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
these lights out by simply partially

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.009 
these lights out by simply partially
inserting<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:36.070> pieces<00:03:36.880> into<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.450> circuit

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
inserting the pieces into the circuit

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.470 
inserting the pieces into the circuit
board<00:03:38.200> here<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:39.400> can<00:03:39.549> test<00:03:40.090> each<00:03:40.239> piece

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
board here and you can test each piece

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.090 
board here and you can test each piece
of<00:03:40.660> adjuster<00:03:41.019> you<00:03:41.230> know<00:03:41.440> attaching<00:03:41.859> it<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:41.980> a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
of adjuster you know attaching it to a

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.280 
of adjuster you know attaching it to a
9-volt<00:03:43.060> battery<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.540> at<00:03:43.600> least<00:03:43.810> light<00:03:44.049> up<00:03:44.170> the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
9-volt battery and at least light up the

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.509 
9-volt battery and at least light up the
lights<00:03:44.470> there<00:03:44.650> for<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.070> check<00:03:45.250> them<00:03:45.370> out

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
lights there for you to check them out

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.690 
lights there for you to check them out
so<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:47.350> is<00:03:47.470> possible<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:48.010> do<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.430> then<00:03:48.519> once

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
so that is possible to do and then once

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.039 
so that is possible to do and then once
you<00:03:48.790> do<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.239> can<00:03:49.359> easily<00:03:49.480> pull<00:03:49.810> them<00:03:49.959> out

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
you do that you can easily pull them out

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.330 
you do that you can easily pull them out
because<00:03:50.350> they're<00:03:50.470> not<00:03:50.500> all<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.859> way<00:03:50.950> inserted

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
because they're not all the way inserted

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.930 
because they're not all the way inserted
all<00:03:52.239> right<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:53.220> I'll<00:03:54.220> move<00:03:54.340> on<00:03:54.519> here<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:54.790> the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
all right so I'll move on here to the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.510 
all right so I'll move on here to the
primary<00:03:55.359> home
