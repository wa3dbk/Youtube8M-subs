so we originally started with a lawn on
this<00:00:06.490> property<00:00:06.880> and<00:00:07.690> there's<00:00:08.049> plenty<00:00:08.350> of

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:08.379 
this property and there's plenty of

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.020 
this property and there's plenty of

what our forest floor is starting to
look<00:00:37.810> like<00:00:38.050> now<00:00:38.290> so<00:00:39.220> you<00:00:39.310> can<00:00:39.430> see<00:00:39.610> that<00:00:39.820> we're

we don't want and we're going to mulch
them<00:01:09.340> around<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.330> plants<00:01:10.690> that<00:01:10.750> we<00:01:10.990> do<00:01:11.170> want

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
them around the plants that we do want

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.940 
them around the plants that we do want
to<00:01:11.729> try<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:12.850> open<00:01:13.150> up<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.890> light<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:16.950> these

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
to try and open up the light for these

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.160 
to try and open up the light for these
plants<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.490> we<00:01:18.670> do<00:01:18.790> want<00:01:18.940> so<00:01:19.240> this<00:01:19.540> valerian

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
plants that we do want so this valerian

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.010 
plants that we do want so this valerian
right<00:01:20.350> here<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.970> blocking<00:01:22.600> a<00:01:22.659> lot<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.960> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
right here is blocking a lot of the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.680 
right here is blocking a lot of the
light<00:01:23.200> for<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.560> strawberries<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.299> what<00:01:25.420> we<00:01:25.540> do

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
light for the strawberries so what we do

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.469 
light for the strawberries so what we do
is<00:01:25.840> we<00:01:25.990> chop<00:01:26.260> it<00:01:28.200> open<00:01:29.200> up<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.440> canopy<00:01:29.950> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
is we chop it open up the canopy and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.880 
is we chop it open up the canopy and
then<00:01:31.479> I'm<00:01:31.600> going<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.780> take<00:01:32.020> this<00:01:32.229> valerian<00:01:32.770> and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
then I'm going to take this valerian and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.700 
then I'm going to take this valerian and
I'm<00:01:32.979> actually<00:01:33.159> going<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:34.200> chop<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.229> right<00:01:35.500> down

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
I'm actually going to chop it right down

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.109 
I'm actually going to chop it right down
to<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.630> forest<00:01:37.630> floor<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:39.040> we<00:01:39.190> have<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.369> pair

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
to the forest floor here we have a pair

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.590 
to the forest floor here we have a pair
that<00:01:40.180> was<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.860> was<00:01:42.070> injured<00:01:42.369> last<00:01:42.460> winter<00:01:43.420> so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
that was that was injured last winter so

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.060 
that was that was injured last winter so
we<00:01:43.690> had<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.930> cut<00:01:44.110> it<00:01:44.229> back<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:44.799> it's<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> little

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
we had to cut it back so it's a little

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.010 
we had to cut it back so it's a little
bit<00:01:45.280> stunted<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:45.939> we<00:01:46.450> can<00:01:46.570> see<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:46.869> this

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
bit stunted and we can see that this

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.179 
bit stunted and we can see that this
rhubarb<00:01:47.500> is<00:01:47.680> starting<00:01:48.040> to<00:01:49.110> shade<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.260> out<00:01:50.409> as

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
rhubarb is starting to shade it out as

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.649 
rhubarb is starting to shade it out as
well<00:01:51.460> as<00:01:51.580> this<00:01:51.729> comfrey<00:01:52.150> here<00:01:52.390> which<00:01:52.510> is<00:01:52.630> a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
well as this comfrey here which is a

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.350 
well as this comfrey here which is a
really<00:01:53.350> great<00:01:53.500> green<00:01:53.950> manure<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:55.150> dynamic

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
really great green manure and a dynamic

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.570 
really great green manure and a dynamic
accumulator<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:56.799> I'm<00:01:56.890> going<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.040> chop<00:01:57.340> these

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
accumulator so I'm going to chop these

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.030 
accumulator so I'm going to chop these
two<00:01:57.850> plants<00:01:58.180> down<00:01:58.450> or<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.020> open<00:01:59.409> light<00:01:59.619> up<00:01:59.830> for

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
two plants down or to open light up for

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.710 
two plants down or to open light up for
the<00:02:00.159> repair<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:01.240> can<00:02:01.360> become<00:02:01.689> that

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
the repair so that it can become that

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.649 
the repair so that it can become that
emergent<00:02:02.439> layer<00:02:02.650> if<00:02:03.340> we<00:02:03.549> don't<00:02:04.000> let<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.450> light

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
emergent layer if we don't let the light

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.300 
emergent layer if we don't let the light
into<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.049> plants<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.439> we<00:02:05.590> want<00:02:05.890> they<00:02:06.130> can

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
into the plants that we want they can

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.119 
into the plants that we want they can
get<00:02:06.490> stunted<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:08.409> they<00:02:08.679> won't<00:02:08.860> actually

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
get stunted and and they won't actually

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.369 
get stunted and and they won't actually
shoot<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:10.360> where<00:02:10.509> we<00:02:10.629> want<00:02:10.840> them<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.019> be<00:02:11.200> which

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
shoot to where we want them to be which

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:12.410 
shoot to where we want them to be which
is<00:02:11.499> a<00:02:11.529> nice<00:02:11.739> tall

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
is a nice tall

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.589 
is a nice tall
all<00:02:12.480> three<00:02:13.700> one<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.819> interesting<00:02:15.270> things

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
all three one of the interesting things

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.320 
all three one of the interesting things
about<00:02:15.720> rhubarb<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.430> really<00:02:17.790> great<00:02:18.000> to

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
about rhubarb and it's really great to

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.740 
about rhubarb and it's really great to
to<00:02:18.989> plant<00:02:19.349> them<00:02:19.620> right<00:02:19.880> around<00:02:20.880> trees<00:02:21.270> because

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
to plant them right around trees because

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.780 
to plant them right around trees because
they<00:02:22.500> basically<00:02:22.709> are<00:02:23.130> water<00:02:23.459> harvesting

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
they basically are water harvesting

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.229 
they basically are water harvesting
surfaces<00:02:24.720> all<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.989> water<00:02:25.910> comes<00:02:26.910> right<00:02:27.209> down

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
surfaces all the water comes right down

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.949 
surfaces all the water comes right down
the<00:02:28.170> center<00:02:28.380> stem<00:02:28.950> right<00:02:29.520> here<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.780> if<00:02:30.870> you

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
the center stem right here so if you

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.080 
the center stem right here so if you
plant<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.530> rhubarb<00:02:32.100> right<00:02:32.340> by<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.550> tree<00:02:32.940> it's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
plant a rhubarb right by a tree it's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.550 
plant a rhubarb right by a tree it's
going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.360> enhance<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:34.020> amount<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.290> water

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
going to enhance the amount of water

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.320 
going to enhance the amount of water
that<00:02:34.739> that<00:02:34.890> tree<00:02:35.190> gets<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.550> harvest<00:02:35.940> now

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
that that tree gets to harvest now

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.210 
that that tree gets to harvest now
different<00:02:36.870> types<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.410> cover<00:02:37.650> crops<00:02:37.950> will<00:02:38.130> do

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
different types of cover crops will do

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.449 
different types of cover crops will do
different<00:02:38.550> things<00:02:38.580> for<00:02:38.940> example<00:02:39.569> we<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.870> use

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
different things for example we can use

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.280 
different things for example we can use
anything<00:02:41.459> from<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.940> leguminous<00:02:42.750> family<00:02:43.380> to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
anything from the leguminous family to

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.350 
anything from the leguminous family to
fix<00:02:46.290> nitrogen<00:02:46.560> anything<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.580> leguminous

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
fix nitrogen anything the leguminous

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.520 
fix nitrogen anything the leguminous
family<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:48.900> going<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.080> actually<00:02:49.230> have

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
family is going to actually have

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.590 
family is going to actually have
nitrogen<00:02:50.160> fixing<00:02:50.489> nodules<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.209> roots<00:02:51.420> and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
nitrogen fixing nodules on the roots and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.640 
nitrogen fixing nodules on the roots and
so<00:02:51.720> that's<00:02:51.870> going<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.080> build<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.470> soil

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
so that's going to build the soil

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.729 
so that's going to build the soil
fertility<00:02:53.600> we<00:02:54.600> use<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.959> cover<00:02:55.200> crop<00:02:55.530> of

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
fertility we use the cover crop of

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.830 
fertility we use the cover crop of
buckwheat<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.790> potato<00:02:57.150> bed<00:02:57.420> here<00:02:57.660> on<00:02:57.750> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
buckwheat in the potato bed here on the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.070 
buckwheat in the potato bed here on the
front<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.290> food<00:02:58.500> forest<00:02:58.880> because<00:02:59.880> that

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
front of the food forest because that

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.190 
front of the food forest because that
bioaccumulates<00:03:01.080> phosphorus<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.920> potassium

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
bioaccumulates phosphorus and potassium

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.720 
bioaccumulates phosphorus and potassium
so<00:03:04.200> when<00:03:04.410> we're<00:03:04.530> choosing<00:03:04.769> our<00:03:05.100> cover<00:03:05.400> crop

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
so when we're choosing our cover crop

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.050 
so when we're choosing our cover crop
we're<00:03:06.660> not<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:07.019> looking<00:03:07.200> at<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.920> plant<00:03:08.670> that

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
we're not just looking at a a plant that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.020 
we're not just looking at a a plant that
can<00:03:09.410> shade<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.769> provide<00:03:11.280> mulch<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:11.850> we're

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
can shade and provide mulch but we're

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.280 
can shade and provide mulch but we're
looking<00:03:12.090> for<00:03:12.269> crops<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.840> are<00:03:12.959> actually

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
looking for crops that are actually

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.170 
looking for crops that are actually
going<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.650> help<00:03:13.830> build<00:03:14.250> nutrients<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
going to help build nutrients in the

that the needs of a system are not met

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.289 
that the needs of a system are not met
from<00:03:40.410> within<00:03:40.560> we<00:03:41.130> pay<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.549> price<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.820> energy

from within we pay the price and energy

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.390 
from within we pay the price and energy
and<00:03:42.450> pollution<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.560> what<00:03:43.709> we're<00:03:43.859> trying<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.250> do
