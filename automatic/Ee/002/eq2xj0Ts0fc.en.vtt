00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
the jam and solo basically took all the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.529 
the jam and solo basically took all the
best<00:00:16.949> functions<00:00:17.460> from<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.760> old<00:00:17.910> jam<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.420> we

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
best functions from the old jam and we

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.840 
best functions from the old jam and we
put<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.720> into<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> compact<00:00:19.470> pedal<00:00:19.830> form<00:00:20.160> we've

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
put it into a compact pedal form we've

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.380 
put it into a compact pedal form we've
got<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> single<00:00:21.510> pedal<00:00:21.840> we're<00:00:22.320> still<00:00:22.619> able<00:00:22.830> to

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
got a single pedal we're still able to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.089 
got a single pedal we're still able to
sample<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.689> using<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> auxiliary<00:00:25.710> input

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
sample in using the auxiliary input

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.250 
sample in using the auxiliary input
sample<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.849> any<00:00:27.000> any<00:00:27.300> type<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.660> file<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.170> we

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
sample in any any type of file that we

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.800 
sample in any any type of file that we
want<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:29.039> solo<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.060> want<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.330> learn<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
want to a solo that we want to learn and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.620 
want to a solo that we want to learn and
we<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.289> slow<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.949> solo<00:00:32.340> down<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.940> while<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
we can slow the solo down and while it

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.690 
we can slow the solo down and while it
retains<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.230> original<00:00:34.260> pitch<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.610> we

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
retains the original pitch so that we

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.889 
retains the original pitch so that we
can<00:00:35.880> learn<00:00:36.090> learn<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> lick<00:00:38.450> this<00:00:39.450> has<00:00:39.660> all

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
can learn learn the lick this has all

I'm<00:00:58.020> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.230> play<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.620> sample<00:00:59.370> using

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
I'm going to play a little sample using

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
I'm going to play a little sample using
the<00:00:59.699> jam<00:00:59.910> man<00:01:00.090> solo<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.780> i'm<00:01:01.350> using<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.649> RP

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the jam man solo and i'm using the RP

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.219 
the jam man solo and i'm using the RP
1000<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.090> my<00:01:03.239> sounds<00:01:03.589> i've<00:01:04.589> recorded<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.710 
rhythmic patch using a distortion which
kind<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.439> gives<00:01:13.590> me<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.330> just<00:01:15.330> something<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
kind of gives me a just something to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.380 
kind of gives me a just something to
play<00:01:15.930> off<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:19.159> so<00:01:20.159> i<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.430> overdub<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.030> top<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
play off of so i can overdub on top of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:33.109 
play off of so i can overdub on top of
that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.700 

that's<00:01:34.119> going<00:01:34.390> we<00:01:34.600> have<00:01:34.719> infinite<00:01:35.200> layers<00:01:35.439> we

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
that's going we have infinite layers we

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.260 
that's going we have infinite layers we
can<00:01:35.859> do<00:01:35.950> anything<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:36.549> here<00:01:36.759> that<00:01:36.789> we<00:01:36.969> want<00:01:37.179> to

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:01.040 

now<00:01:53.040> at<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> soul<00:01:53.580> and

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050

it's<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.840> easy<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.170> basically<00:02:28.590> create<00:02:28.830> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
it's that easy to basically create a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.740 
it's that easy to basically create a
multi-layered<00:02:29.580> loop<00:02:29.790> using<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.270> jam<00:02:30.510> man

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
multi-layered loop using the jam man

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.920 
multi-layered loop using the jam man
with<00:02:31.290> infinite<00:02:31.770> layers<00:02:32.010> infinite<00:02:32.640> levels<00:02:33.030> 16

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
with infinite layers infinite levels 16

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.050 
with infinite layers infinite levels 16
hours<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.470> looping<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.250> basically<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.820> sky's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
hours of looping you basically the sky's

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.240 
hours of looping you basically the sky's
the<00:02:36.090> limit<00:02:36.300> 99<00:02:37.020> presets<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:38.010> could<00:02:38.160> do

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
the limit 99 presets you could do

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.790 
the limit 99 presets you could do
anything<00:02:38.280> with<00:02:38.850> these<00:02:38.970> pedals<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:40.260> thanks<00:02:40.710> for

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
anything with these pedals so thanks for

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.960 
anything with these pedals so thanks for
tuning<00:02:41.100> into<00:02:41.220> gear<00:02:41.790> wire<00:02:41.970> calm<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:43.820> sit<00:02:44.820> from
