 Pressurized watering while william

 second stage in order to use the irrigation 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.410
 by sprinkling on hillside for planting

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.530
 Today the town of Wilde has been 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.550
 deserving more to an irrigation system by 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:20.879
 pressure and to the program that you have executed 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.140
 several works here in huay la güicha se 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:27.150
 did in the style of the reservoirs 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.449
 improving channel and now with the 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.749
 risks spray 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:36.960
 I think cool life is improving in 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:39.830
 their crops and in all their 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.710
 economies that it has 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:48.080
 we do not eat peasants 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:51.000
 you have to value is that those are coming 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.830
 program area resources 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.440
 the installation of the irrigation system 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:59.030
 pressurized while william second 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.560
 stage has as objectives among others 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.850
 increase agricultural land with 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.760
 sowing crops such as corn vetch 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:12.270
 potato and incorporate 7 hectares of 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.450
 land under irrigation I want to mention that 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.680
 this work will be able to incorporate a total 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:21.680
 of 7 hectares of pea crops 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.680
 corn 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.350
 specifically that those broken in these 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.330
 growing areas the installation is 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.000
 reinstalled in this second stage 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.820
 10 sprinkler modules making a 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.600
 total of 40 installed in all 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.850
 not flog this sector has 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.320
 increased a pressurized irrigation 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:47.070
 incorporating to activity seven 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.990
 more hectares making a total with the 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.409
 second stage and the first a total of 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.009
 14 hectares 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:57.150
 with the technification 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:00.260
 we will benefit a total of 80 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:03.470
 families in this opportunity 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.750
 as knowledge for all I believe 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.700
 that this irrigation technified in these 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.710
 times where the water really is 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.320
 scarce I think that for us 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.810
 as a program we are proud 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.670
 the second stage of the irrigation system 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.950
 pressurized that was installed in the 

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.960
 Why lounge community and has been 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.510
 possible thanks to resources 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.030
 ordinary of the program that entity 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.840
 has 25 years of work in the
