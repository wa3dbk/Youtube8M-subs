00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:05.370
 will celebrate the ten years of the bachelor's degree in photography the first 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.370
 area graduation course in all latin america 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.509
 1966 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.589
 the scenario I can only complete the doctorate day 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.810
 In 1999, the first American higher education course was 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:25.780
 2009 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.730
 at the time of those investigated by the baccalaureate funds that made history 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.600
 the academic background it has a broader view of the process 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.920
 you do not see your technique and how could it not be celebrated 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.390
 means to reflect 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.920
 professional teachers students and students gather in the campo santo amaro 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.780
 to debate the evolution of photography in the last decade revolution the signal 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.520
 of our chemical air force was replaced by the digital one in a blink 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.920
 of eyes artur believed does not replace the future fecomercio 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.040
 she creates a new photo is a new field of work the new futures 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.090
 possibility of interaction 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.200
 with internet security this means greater complexity and diversity of 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.259
 knowledge 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.409
 see for example how photography expanded interacting with various processes 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.130
 that transformed reality 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.010
 therefore being attentive to the whole universe is fundamental to 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.240
 student training 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.149
 teachers are updated 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.460
 equipment and senac are also updated I think it is a lot of 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:32.810
 things more factors than 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.000
 influence of the quality of the quality film course that 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.250
 expressed in several works produced by students and alumni of the baccalaureate in 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.410
 photography 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.130
 practice from the conclusion of the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.030
 and that left no doubt the image should reveal the artistic expression of who 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.060
 sees the world through the lens 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.630
 certainly do not stand out people who do something other than a 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.990
 different image that has the capacity to transform the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.429
 never repeat the boom again
