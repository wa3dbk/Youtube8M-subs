00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
like we will only show last year and we

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.760 
like we will only show last year and we
took<00:03:09.700> we<00:03:09.910> talk<00:03:10.120> about<00:03:10.210> Moyes<00:03:10.570> alone<00:03:11.020> oh<00:03:11.260> I've

took we talk about Moyes alone oh I've

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.350 
took we talk about Moyes alone oh I've
clearly<00:03:12.340> proof<00:03:12.670> right<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.180> weren't

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
clearly proof right and you weren't

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.660 
clearly proof right and you weren't
having<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.690> last<00:03:13.930> year<00:03:14.140> but<00:03:14.350> on<00:03:14.680> assist<00:03:15.100> on<00:03:15.580> a

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
having it last year but on assist on a

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.420 
having it last year but on assist on a
sort<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:15.970> serious<00:03:16.330> level<00:03:16.510> off<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:18.310> I

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
sort of serious level off I think I

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.620 
sort of serious level off I think I
still<00:03:18.700> think<00:03:18.940> you're<00:03:19.060> gonna<00:03:19.150> get<00:03:19.300> it<00:03:19.420> sought

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
still think you're gonna get it sought

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.110 
still think you're gonna get it sought
for<00:03:19.870> because<00:03:20.170> of<00:03:20.200> them<00:03:20.530> you'll<00:03:21.130> run<00:03:21.370> you

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.050 
impressed with him with the weekend but
it<00:04:14.470> does<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:17.260> we<00:04:17.380> need<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.680> bring<00:04:17.859> in<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.370> strong

from the 4-1-2-1-2

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.000 
from the 4-1-2-1-2
we<00:04:24.850> have<00:04:24.970> recently<00:04:25.479> is<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:26.080> lot<00:04:26.350> better<00:04:26.590> I<00:04:26.770> mean

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
we have recently is a lot better I mean

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.700 
we have recently is a lot better I mean
we<00:04:27.340> saw<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.580> new<00:04:27.820> small<00:04:28.180> place<00:04:28.420> so<00:04:28.870> better<00:04:29.410> from

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
we saw a new small place so better from

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.590 
we saw a new small place so better from
incision<00:04:30.130> under<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.460> weekend<00:04:30.880> because<00:04:31.090> it

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
incision under that weekend because it

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.750 
incision under that weekend because it
wasn't<00:04:32.260> planing<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.800> back<00:04:33.130> through<00:04:33.640> your

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
wasn't planing that back through your

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.850 
wasn't planing that back through your
back<00:04:33.970> five<00:04:34.300> or<00:04:34.330> whatever<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.930> was<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.170> he

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
back five or whatever it was and he

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.980 
back five or whatever it was and he
wasn't<00:04:36.040> worried<00:04:36.460> about<00:04:36.520> coming<00:04:37.360> forward<00:04:37.690> and

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
wasn't worried about coming forward and

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.930 
wasn't worried about coming forward and
apt<00:04:38.170> in<00:04:38.380> having<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.220> get<00:04:39.400> back<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.790> putting

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
apt in having to get back and putting

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.150 
apt in having to get back and putting
the<00:04:40.030> ad<00:04:40.120> cover<00:04:40.420> so<00:04:40.720> I<00:04:40.990> think<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:41.470> tactics<00:04:41.950> do

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
the ad cover so I think the tactics do

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.650 
the ad cover so I think the tactics do
us<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.460> little<00:04:42.580> bit<00:04:42.760> more<00:04:43.000> now<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.210> suit<00:04:43.540> and

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
us a little bit more now the suit and

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.410 
us a little bit more now the suit and
attacking<00:04:43.960> pair<00:04:44.290> that<00:04:44.500> we<00:04:44.650> have<00:04:44.910> but<00:04:45.910> I<00:04:46.090> think

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
attacking pair that we have but I think

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
attacking pair that we have but I think
it's<00:04:46.570> more<00:04:46.720> personal

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
it's more personal

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.860 
it's more personal
then<00:04:48.130> tactic<00:04:48.640> and<00:04:48.880> I<00:04:48.940> think<00:04:49.180> give<00:04:49.510> us<00:04:49.540> another

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
then tactic and I think give us another

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.980 
then tactic and I think give us another
window<00:04:50.290> or<00:04:50.320> two<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:51.190> we'll<00:04:51.340> be<00:04:51.760> back<00:04:52.000> through

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
window or two and we'll be back through

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.810 
window or two and we'll be back through
a<00:04:53.020> level<00:04:53.380> where<00:04:53.590> we<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:54.040> constantly<00:04:54.370> say<00:04:54.760> you

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
a level where we can constantly say you

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.060 
a level where we can constantly say you
know<00:04:54.970> we<00:04:55.300> can<00:04:55.330> go<00:04:55.570> we<00:04:55.960> can<00:04:55.990> go<00:04:56.140> and<00:04:56.380> challenge

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.110 

Kenny<00:05:00.070> now<00:05:00.250> actually<00:05:00.610> we've<00:05:00.730> got<00:05:00.850> one<00:05:01.000> more

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
Kenny now actually we've got one more

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.790 
Kenny now actually we've got one more

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
doesn't seem like a striker that's

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.800 
doesn't seem like a striker that's
nervous<00:05:59.650> about<00:06:00.010> not<00:06:00.340> boring<00:06:00.910> I<00:06:01.150> mean<00:06:01.540> he<00:06:01.690> had

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
nervous about not boring I mean he had

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.650 
nervous about not boring I mean he had
that<00:06:01.930> opportunity<00:06:02.200> where<00:06:02.710> where<00:06:03.550> Adrian<00:06:04.060> is

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
that opportunity where where Adrian is

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.930 
that opportunity where where Adrian is
the<00:06:04.780> Western<00:06:05.140> PA<00:06:05.350> kick<00:06:06.160> the<00:06:06.310> ball<00:06:06.520> out<00:06:06.730> he

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
the Western PA kick the ball out he

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.660 
the Western PA kick the ball out he
didn't<00:06:07.210> go<00:06:07.330> too<00:06:07.390> far<00:06:07.600> and<00:06:08.200> he<00:06:08.980> set<00:06:09.190> up<00:06:09.310> rushing

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
didn't go too far and he set up rushing

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.270 
didn't go too far and he set up rushing
and<00:06:09.820> just<00:06:09.970> shooting<00:06:10.360> an<00:06:10.540> open<00:06:11.260> destroy<00:06:11.590> made

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
and just shooting an open destroy made

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.120 
and just shooting an open destroy made
in<00:06:12.400> one<00:06:12.780> setting<00:06:13.780> so<00:06:14.080> I<00:06:14.350> think<00:06:14.830> he<00:06:14.920> will<00:06:15.100> come

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
in one setting so I think he will come

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:25.260 
in one setting so I think he will come
good<00:06:15.550> and<00:06:15.850> they'll<00:06:16.150> get<00:06:16.530> a<00:06:23.040> goodnights<00:06:24.270> not

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
good and they'll get a goodnights not

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.990 
good and they'll get a goodnights not
for<00:06:25.510> that<00:06:26.250> perhaps<00:06:27.250> that<00:06:27.430> will<00:06:27.670> leave<00:06:27.880> it

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
for that perhaps that will leave it

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.030 
for that perhaps that will leave it
there
