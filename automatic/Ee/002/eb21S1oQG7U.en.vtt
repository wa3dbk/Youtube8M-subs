this<00:00:13.990> project<00:00:14.350> is<00:00:14.920> the<00:00:15.580> one<00:00:15.760> that<00:00:16.029> led<00:00:16.270> me<00:00:16.299> to

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
this project is the one that led me to

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.400 
this project is the one that led me to
do<00:00:16.779> the<00:00:17.560> 1032<00:00:18.330> modification<00:00:19.330> video<00:00:19.660> series

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
do the 1032 modification video series

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.540 
do the 1032 modification video series
now<00:00:21.279> with<00:00:21.579> this<00:00:22.650> 726<00:00:24.150> snowblower<00:00:25.150> I<00:00:26.460> did<00:00:27.460> the

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
now with this 726 snowblower I did the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.779 
now with this 726 snowblower I did the
modification<00:00:28.589> the<00:00:29.589> year<00:00:29.800> before<00:00:30.009> for<00:00:30.279> one<00:00:30.699> of

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
modification the year before for one of

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.560 
modification the year before for one of
my<00:00:30.819> neighbors<00:00:31.390> and<00:00:31.860> after<00:00:32.860> this<00:00:33.570> modification

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
my neighbors and after this modification

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.410 
my neighbors and after this modification
was<00:00:34.720> complete<00:00:35.140> I<00:00:35.520> became<00:00:36.520> so<00:00:36.790> impressed<00:00:37.210> with

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
was complete I became so impressed with

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.230 
was complete I became so impressed with
it<00:00:37.570> that's<00:00:38.020> when<00:00:38.350> I<00:00:38.380> started<00:00:38.950> to<00:00:39.190> locate<00:00:39.970> and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
it that's when I started to locate and

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.000 
it that's when I started to locate and
look<00:00:40.930> for<00:00:41.230> a<00:00:41.500> nicer<00:00:43.350> 1032<00:00:44.350> that<00:00:44.620> could<00:00:44.800> be

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
look for a nicer 1032 that could be

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.450 
look for a nicer 1032 that could be
restored<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:46.060> turned<00:00:47.050> into<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.620> video<00:00:48.100> series

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
restored and turned into a video series

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.990 
restored and turned into a video series
so<00:00:49.650> anyway<00:00:50.650> that's<00:00:50.950> how<00:00:51.730> we're<00:00:51.910> getting

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
so anyway that's how we're getting

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.390 
so anyway that's how we're getting
started<00:00:52.540> with<00:00:52.690> our<00:00:52.720> video<00:00:53.170> today<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:53.800> our

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
started with our video today and our

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.210 
started with our video today and our
next<00:00:54.760> step<00:00:54.970> is<00:00:55.210> now<00:00:55.990> on<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.650> 726<00:00:57.640> we<00:00:58.480> also<00:00:59.260> made

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
next step is now on the 726 we also made

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.049 
next step is now on the 726 we also made
the<00:01:00.550> little<00:01:00.910> additives<00:01:01.900> for<00:01:02.860> our<00:01:03.130> guides<00:01:03.490> for

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
the little additives for our guides for

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.810 
the little additives for our guides for
a<00:01:04.299> natural<00:01:04.600> stone<00:01:05.049> driveway<00:01:05.619> and<00:01:05.979> our<00:01:06.549> first

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
a natural stone driveway and our first

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.370 
a natural stone driveway and our first
step<00:01:07.090> is<00:01:07.299> we'll<00:01:07.509> be<00:01:07.540> going<00:01:07.930> over<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:08.230> outside

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
step is we'll be going over that outside

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.860 
step is we'll be going over that outside
next<00:01:10.470> no<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.500> don't<00:01:11.860> have<00:01:12.040> our<00:01:12.100> John<00:01:12.700> Deere<00:01:12.909> 726

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
next no I don't have our John Deere 726

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.200 
next no I don't have our John Deere 726
modification<00:01:14.770> project<00:01:15.340> here<00:01:15.550> right<00:01:15.760> now<00:01:15.970> so

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
modification project here right now so

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.750 
modification project here right now so
we're<00:01:17.020> using<00:01:17.230> the<00:01:17.860> 1032<00:01:18.610> for<00:01:19.300> an<00:01:19.390> example<00:01:19.780> and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
we're using the 1032 for an example and

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.750 
we're using the 1032 for an example and
these<00:01:21.760> are<00:01:22.030> our<00:01:22.060> guides<00:01:22.540> that<00:01:23.409> on<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.040> 1032

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
these are our guides that on the 1032

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.620 
these are our guides that on the 1032
and<00:01:25.120> I<00:01:25.900> did<00:01:26.080> basically<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.830> same<00:01:27.000> thing<00:01:28.000> for

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
and I did basically the same thing for

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.100 
and I did basically the same thing for
the<00:01:29.110> 726<00:01:30.070> modification<00:01:30.940> I<00:01:31.120> took<00:01:31.900> little

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
the 726 modification I took little

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.100 
the 726 modification I took little
pieces<00:01:32.229> of<00:01:32.770> metal<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.690> they're<00:01:34.690> a<00:01:34.720> little<00:01:34.930> bit

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
pieces of metal and they're a little bit

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.740 
pieces of metal and they're a little bit
thicker<00:01:35.409> than<00:01:35.560> what<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.130> factory<00:01:36.750> guides

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
thicker than what the factory guides

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.910 
thicker than what the factory guides
come<00:01:38.049> with<00:01:38.290> so<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:39.549> will<00:01:39.760> help<00:01:40.320> make<00:01:41.320> this<00:01:41.530> last

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
come with so it will help make this last

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.469 
come with so it will help make this last
a<00:01:42.159> little<00:01:42.310> bit<00:01:42.430> longer<00:01:42.549> they're<00:01:43.150> about<00:01:43.450> a

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
a little bit longer they're about a

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.160 
a little bit longer they're about a
quarter<00:01:43.930> inch<00:01:44.080> thick<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.710> then<00:01:45.580> I<00:01:46.170> heated

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
quarter inch thick and then I heated

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.190 
quarter inch thick and then I heated
them<00:01:47.409> up<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:47.860> bent<00:01:48.250> them<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:49.420> match<00:01:49.930> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
them up and and bent them to match the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.680 
them up and and bent them to match the
contour<00:01:50.680> of<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.400> bottom<00:01:51.880> now<00:01:52.060> this<00:01:52.299> assures

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
contour of the bottom now this assures

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.450 
contour of the bottom now this assures
to<00:01:52.990> help<00:01:53.700> keep<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.450> deck<00:01:56.170> from<00:01:56.619> sinking<00:01:57.220> and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
to help keep the deck from sinking and

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.240 
to help keep the deck from sinking and
digging<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.020> crushed<00:01:59.320> rock<00:01:59.560> driveway

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
digging in to the crushed rock driveway

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.830 
digging in to the crushed rock driveway
it<00:02:01.000> kind<00:02:01.330> of<00:02:01.450> acts<00:02:01.689> like<00:02:01.900> a<00:02:02.049> guide<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:03.840> floats

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
it kind of acts like a guide and floats

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.699 
it kind of acts like a guide and floats
this<00:02:05.729> deck<00:02:06.729> up<00:02:07.000> above<00:02:07.420> even<00:02:08.200> though<00:02:08.560> it's

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
this deck up above even though it's

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.070 
this deck up above even though it's
cutting<00:02:09.039> through<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.399> snow<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:10.390> floats<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.989> up

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
cutting through the snow it floats it up

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.360 
cutting through the snow it floats it up
above<00:02:11.379> the<00:02:11.560> rocks<00:02:11.769> to<00:02:12.520> help<00:02:12.790> assure<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:14.370> many

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
above the rocks to help assure that many

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.000 
above the rocks to help assure that many
of<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.640> rocks<00:02:15.849> that<00:02:16.000> are<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.270> the

of the rocks that are in the
top<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.519> driveway<00:02:17.760> don't<00:02:18.150> get<00:02:18.299> sucked<00:02:18.540> up

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
top of the driveway don't get sucked up

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.300 
top of the driveway don't get sucked up
into<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.170> auger<00:02:19.409> system<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:21.620> cause<00:02:22.620> problems

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
into the auger system and cause problems

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.509 
into the auger system and cause problems
for<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:24.060> auger<00:02:24.290> now<00:02:25.290> we<00:02:25.920> are<00:02:26.099> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.489> a

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
for the auger now we are going to get a

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.460 
for the auger now we are going to get a
few<00:02:26.790> rocks<00:02:27.090> here<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.450> there<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.959> we<00:02:28.079> can<00:02:28.230> hear

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
few rocks here and there and we can hear

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.319 
few rocks here and there and we can hear
them<00:02:28.560> once<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.459> while<00:02:29.640> when<00:02:30.030> you're

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
them once in a while when you're

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.880 
them once in a while when you're
watching<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> videos<00:02:31.170> as<00:02:31.470> they<00:02:31.620> pass<00:02:31.860> through

the system but this is the best way to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.559 
the system but this is the best way to
maintain<00:02:36.470> as<00:02:37.470> far<00:02:37.860> as<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.190> know<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.640> nice<00:02:39.239> natural

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
started with rebuilding the carburetor

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.039 
started with rebuilding the carburetor
and<00:03:10.650> shortly<00:03:11.250> thereafter<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:12.209> discovered

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
and shortly thereafter it discovered

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.530 
and shortly thereafter it discovered
that<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.950> engine<00:03:14.250> also<00:03:14.430> had<00:03:14.790> internal<00:03:15.239> engine

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
that the engine also had internal engine

and is sent for a very long length of

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
time now we have to weigh in a lot of

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.930 
time now we have to weigh in a lot of
the<00:03:28.799> cost<00:03:29.069> sometimes<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.359> reality<00:03:30.959> and

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
the cost sometimes and the reality and

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.530 
the cost sometimes and the reality and
at<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.150> time<00:03:33.419> the<00:03:34.019> engines<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:35.540> the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
at the time the engines that the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.360 
at the time the engines that the
replaceable<00:03:37.109> engines<00:03:37.590> were<00:03:37.709> not<00:03:37.919> that<00:03:38.129> much

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
replaceable engines were not that much

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.119 
replaceable engines were not that much
money<00:03:38.699> and<00:03:39.510> when<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.959> repairs<00:03:40.410> start<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.980> get

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
money and when the repairs start to get

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.720 
money and when the repairs start to get
up<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.790> about<00:03:42.030> 1/2<00:03:42.720> or<00:03:42.959> 3/4<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.949> cost<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.699> a

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
up to about 1/2 or 3/4 of the cost on a

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.509 
up to about 1/2 or 3/4 of the cost on a
new<00:03:45.000> engine<00:03:45.769> sometimes<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:47.010> best<00:03:47.220> thing<00:03:47.489> to

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
new engine sometimes the best thing to

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.270 
new engine sometimes the best thing to
do<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:47.879> replace<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:49.139> engine<00:03:49.319> now<00:03:50.250> I

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
do is replace the engine now I

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.970 
do is replace the engine now I
recommended<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.359> they<00:03:52.049> replace<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.500> with<00:03:52.949> a

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
recommended that they replace it with a

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.140 
recommended that they replace it with a
larger<00:03:53.609> engine<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.919> my<00:03:55.919> pick<00:03:56.220> was<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.760> 11

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
larger engine and my pick was the 11

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739

built engine a lot of these engines are
a<00:04:04.949> lot<00:04:05.190> more<00:04:05.569> modern<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:07.079> have<00:04:07.489> features<00:04:08.489> that

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
a lot more modern and have features that

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.619 
a lot more modern and have features that
make<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:09.419> it's<00:04:09.599> easier<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.500> start<00:04:10.889> and

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
make it so it's easier to start and

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.020 
make it so it's easier to start and
operate<00:04:12.629> a<00:04:12.659> lot<00:04:12.989> smoother<00:04:13.620> than<00:04:14.040> many<00:04:14.699> of<00:04:14.879> the

operate a lot smoother than many of the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.770 
operate a lot smoother than many of the
older<00:04:15.299> engines<00:04:15.889> so<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:17.880> was<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.389> engine

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
older engines so that was the engine

that we chose for the project now the
