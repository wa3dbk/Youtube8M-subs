find<00:00:27.109> an<00:00:27.410> application<00:00:28.130> was<00:00:28.340> because<00:00:28.640> when<00:00:28.760> you

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
find an application was because when you

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.480 
find an application was because when you
think<00:00:28.880> application<00:00:29.600> we<00:00:29.720> have<00:00:29.840> a<00:00:29.869> very

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
think application we have a very

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.220 
think application we have a very
well-defined<00:00:31.490> idea<00:00:32.390> of<00:00:32.510> what<00:00:32.660> that<00:00:32.689> is<00:00:32.870> it's

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
well-defined idea of what that is it's

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.189 
well-defined idea of what that is it's
Photoshop<00:00:33.800> it's<00:00:34.129> you<00:00:34.370> know<00:00:35.199> instant

sets<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.869> tools<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> laptop

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
sets of tools that we have on the laptop

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.230 
sets of tools that we have on the laptop
one<00:01:53.610> set<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.940> tools<00:01:54.150> are<00:01:54.479> tools<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.619> exploring

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
one set of tools are tools for exploring

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.870 
one set of tools are tools for exploring
so<00:01:57.240> we've<00:01:57.390> got<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> web<00:01:57.810> browser<00:01:58.050> we've<00:01:58.710> got<00:01:58.920> an

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
so we've got a web browser we've got an

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.450 
so we've got a web browser we've got an
email<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.660> chat<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.140> things<00:02:01.440> like<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.680> and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
email and chat and things like that and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.090 
email and chat and things like that and
then<00:02:02.610> there's<00:02:02.820> tools<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.390> expressing<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.800> so

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
then there's tools for expressing and so

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.550 
then there's tools for expressing and so
we've<00:02:05.250> got<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.090> camera<00:02:06.660> we've<00:02:07.020> got<00:02:07.229> word

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
we've got the camera we've got word

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.760 
we've got the camera we've got word
processing<00:02:08.310> we've<00:02:08.580> got<00:02:08.759> musical<00:02:09.770> composition

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
processing we've got musical composition

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.280 
processing we've got musical composition
tools<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.670> things<00:02:11.880> like<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.959> know<00:02:13.050> one<00:02:13.260> of

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
another aspect of learning if they can

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.009 
another aspect of learning if they can
put<00:02:46.860> together<00:02:47.130> scales<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:48.000> make<00:02:48.690> things

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
put together scales and make things

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.979 
put together scales and make things
sound<00:02:49.260> nice<00:02:49.760> their<00:02:50.760> brains<00:02:50.880> working<00:02:51.239> to

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
sound nice their brains working to

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.930 
sound nice their brains working to
translate<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.860> creativeness<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.790> other

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
translate that creativeness to other

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.000 
translate that creativeness to other
aspects<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.540> their<00:02:54.660> lives<00:02:54.840> too<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.620> was<00:02:55.739> more

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
aspects of their lives too it was more

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.130 
aspects of their lives too it was more
of<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.310> case<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.360> know<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.720> start<00:02:57.989> from

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
of a case of you know it start from

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.670 
of a case of you know it start from
scratch<00:02:58.440> like<00:02:59.040> how<00:02:59.280> do<00:02:59.340> we<00:02:59.489> want<00:02:59.820> kids<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.930> work

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
scratch like how do we want kids to work

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.470 
scratch like how do we want kids to work
with<00:03:01.920> these

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
with these

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.180 
with these
so<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.230> was<00:03:03.319> one<00:03:03.500> of<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.680> first<00:03:03.950> things

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
so that was one of the first things

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.740 
so that was one of the first things
we're<00:03:04.459> thinking<00:03:04.790> about<00:03:04.970> was<00:03:05.120> how<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:05.450> we

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
we're thinking about was how can we

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.229 
we're thinking about was how can we
build<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.319> sharing<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.239> communication

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
build the sharing and the communication

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.199 
build the sharing and the communication
directly<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:10.519> software<00:03:10.909> that<00:03:11.120> the

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
directly to the software that the

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.089 
directly to the software that the
children<00:03:11.390> views<00:03:11.840> on<00:03:12.110> these<00:03:12.200> machines<00:03:12.409> the

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
children views on these machines the

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.610 
children views on these machines the
children<00:03:13.519> can<00:03:13.700> discover<00:03:14.090> what's<00:03:14.780> inside<00:03:15.590> of

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
children can discover what's inside of

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.619 
children can discover what's inside of
it<00:03:15.890> or<00:03:16.159> outside<00:03:16.610> of<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.879> or<00:03:17.120> between<00:03:17.510> each

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
it or outside of it or between each

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.640 
it or outside of it or between each
other<00:03:18.459> themselves<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.700> explore<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.750> kids

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
other themselves and explore and kids

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.320 
other themselves and explore and kids
will<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.310> they'll<00:03:22.430> reach<00:03:22.610> out<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:23.030> kids<00:03:23.209> in

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
will and they'll reach out to kids in

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.940 
will and they'll reach out to kids in
different<00:03:23.660> countries<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.110> we<00:03:24.349> have<00:03:24.530> systran

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
different countries and we have systran
