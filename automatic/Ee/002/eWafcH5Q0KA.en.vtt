course<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.960> need<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.260> generate<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.680> whole<00:00:38.010> new

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
course you need to generate a whole new

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.580 
course you need to generate a whole new
world<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.790> month<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.360> spawn<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
world for this month to spawn in the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.380 
world for this month to spawn in the
grass<00:00:40.890> although<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.700> actually<00:00:41.850> spawn<00:00:42.270> it

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
grass although you can actually spawn it

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.479 
grass although you can actually spawn it
in<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.690> seeds<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.649> example<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:44.129> i<00:00:44.280> have

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
in with seeds so for example if i have

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
in with seeds so for example if i have
seeds<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.879> my<00:00:45.000> inventory<00:00:45.270> i<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.289> place

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
seeds in my inventory i can just place

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.069
