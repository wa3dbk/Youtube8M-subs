00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.020
 welcome to a new day the same in a 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.059
 plis-plas the fast wire of the summer 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.580
 Today I'm going to teach you how to deconstruct 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.519
 some pieces to a garment that is a 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.139
 only garment and add it in two garments to 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.730
 It happens to me that you see my wardrobe 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.380
 and I see things that I do not put on since 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.600
 time and there are some that are 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.970
 susceptible to convert them in two 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.310
 garments that type of garments are those 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 as for example this dress that has 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.449
 a cut at the waist as you see with some 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 waist points or for example 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.309
 garments like this diver that are a part 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.500
 above clearly differentiated from a 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.050
 bottom part and that separates with a 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 elastic this type of garments are 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.010
 easy to divide and I'll show you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.989
 like in the first place what are we going to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.120
 to do is flip the dress and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.820
 put it upside down in this case you see that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.440
 has here a medium seam that is the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.350
 that links the bottom with the part 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.260
 above and we are interested in this part 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.390
 let's say stay with the skirt and the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.160
 top without this seam in concrete because 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.620
 because here is a rubber an elastic that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.780
 is going to be what helps us 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.060
 can continue to have certain fronts it 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.640
 fit to the body not simply and simply 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.510
 let's cut the top and make a 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.820
 small incision like this 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.420
 and we are going to cut the flush 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.420
 sewing 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.280
 we have already cut through here we have the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.590
 skirt and around here the top once 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.530
 we have the trimmed top we return to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.000
 turn and it's time to make sure 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.799
 that this border cited is the most 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.990
 possible uniform in the event that at 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.369
 cut the skirt as it does not fit 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.170
 your waist should not happen because 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.500
 good has the elastic but good there 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.869
 a very easy solution that would be one with 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.280
 a sewing machine simply make you 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.780
 a couple of folds more like the skirt 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.939
 has folds there is no problem 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.369
 crazy 6 and you are already narrowing in case 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.920
 the skirt without losing that design of 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.869
 tablitas and deploy another very solution 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.119
 simple simply when you go to 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.129
 put that skirt simply accompanies it 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.950
 It's like an accessory with a belt 

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:07.229
 elastic that will do that force or that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.329
 rubber that you may need we are going to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.220
 continue with the diver and let's do 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.200
 exactly the same thing that we have done with 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.420
 the previous item we are going to give you the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.400
 turn so that the cut is as 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.190
 accurate possible again with the scissors 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.120
 we make a small incision 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.010
 and we are going to cut so that the top is 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.320
 free and let's say the elastic is 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.450
 stay with the pants and cut the 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.240
 end of this top to make it the most 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.890
 regular and uniform possible over here you see 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.410
 that we have the pants that are about 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.810
 style pants we will do to look at what 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.520
 comfortable with a rubber waistband and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.800
 then relaxed pants already here 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.020
 you can see the result of the dress 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.330
 divided in two on the one hand this touch 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.460
 It is a crop top which I combined with a 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.650
 high-waisted pants and on the other hand 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.760
 You see how I used the gala skirt 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.920
 that I have not needed or put 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.900
 belt or rubber band or more gathers 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.400
 I combined with a part above that 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.530
 It was a black top but I can combine it 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.420
 with a lot of things and who knows 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.100
 I think that's almost safer that I'm going 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.180
 to put these two clothes much more 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.310
 separate than what I was putting 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.819
 the dress and now we see also the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.189
 trousers like 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.139
 style I will make more and very comfortable and now has 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.180
 come your turn thinking about that 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.790
 clothes you have in the closet that you do not 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.900
 you put and have that easy division 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.760
 the area of ​​the waist that is going to 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.349
 allow to divide them in two if you have 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.849
 liked the video fingers up and 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.849
 I'll leave you with two other videos 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.409
 Y
