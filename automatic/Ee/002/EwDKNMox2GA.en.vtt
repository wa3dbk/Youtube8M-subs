ramps first type of skateboard ramp
you're<00:00:09.760> gonna<00:00:09.850> have<00:00:10.090> is<00:00:10.360> called<00:00:10.600> the<00:00:10.720> pyramid

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.140 
you're gonna have is called the pyramid

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.770 
you're gonna have is called the pyramid
a<00:00:11.350> pyramid<00:00:12.280> it's<00:00:12.400> basically<00:00:12.730> a<00:00:12.880> three-sided<00:00:13.660> a

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
a pyramid it's basically a three-sided a

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.010 
a pyramid it's basically a three-sided a
four-sided<00:00:14.410> ramp<00:00:14.980> that<00:00:15.640> has<00:00:15.910> hips<00:00:16.270> all<00:00:16.689> over

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
four-sided ramp that has hips all over

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.640 
four-sided ramp that has hips all over
it<00:00:17.230> and<00:00:17.350> basically<00:00:18.220> just<00:00:18.370> an<00:00:18.490> angled<00:00:18.910> Bank<00:00:19.150> and

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
it and basically just an angled Bank and

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.470 
it and basically just an angled Bank and
it's<00:00:20.650> used<00:00:20.980> for<00:00:21.130> actually<00:00:21.760> skating<00:00:22.090> over

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
quarter pipe and then another quarter

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.940 
quarter pipe and then another quarter
pipe<00:01:15.729> turned<00:01:16.030> upside<00:01:16.420> down<00:01:16.600> on<00:01:16.869> top<00:01:17.289> of<00:01:17.320> it<00:01:17.560> you

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
pipe turned upside down on top of it you

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.480 
pipe turned upside down on top of it you
used<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.250> roll<00:01:18.399> down<00:01:18.640> into<00:01:18.909> to<00:01:19.299> gain<00:01:19.420> speed<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
used to roll down into to gain speed the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.590 
used to roll down into to gain speed the
next<00:01:21.700> type<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:21.850> ramp<00:01:22.090> you<00:01:22.180> have<00:01:22.299> after<00:01:22.479> that
