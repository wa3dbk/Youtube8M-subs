00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
year which I don't see why you would

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.899 
year which I don't see why you would
need<00:01:11.970> both<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.270> those<00:01:12.740> powers<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.010> mean<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.640> I

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
need both of those powers I mean I I

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.940 
need both of those powers I mean I I
guess<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.140> how<00:01:16.229> they<00:01:16.290> come<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.680> handy

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
guess I can see how they come in handy

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.760 
guess I can see how they come in handy
in<00:01:17.040> very<00:01:17.250> rare<00:01:17.689> situations<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:19.049> separately

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
in very rare situations it's separately

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.149 
in very rare situations it's separately
but<00:01:20.900> seems<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.049> overkill<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.920> me<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
but seems like overkill but to me the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.859 
but seems like overkill but to me the
weirdest<00:01:23.700> one<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.689> Hulk<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.619> see<00:01:26.869> ghosts

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
weirdest one is that Hulk can see ghosts

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.399 
weirdest one is that Hulk can see ghosts
uh<00:01:28.340> as<00:01:29.340> seems<00:01:29.880> weird<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.210> me<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.840> inspiration

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
uh as seems weird to me the inspiration

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.649 
uh as seems weird to me the inspiration
for<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.799> Incredible<00:01:32.250> Hulk<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.729> run<00:01:33.090> from<00:01:33.329> two

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
for the Incredible Hulk was run from two

for the Incredible Hulk was run from two

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
main sources which would be the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.969

massive amounts of gamma rays would

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.800 
massive amounts of gamma rays would
actually<00:02:58.139> take<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.620> Hulk's<00:02:58.950> form<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.810> turn

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
would work but they probably came up

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.039
