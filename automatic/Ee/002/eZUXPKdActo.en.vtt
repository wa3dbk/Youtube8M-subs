00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.510 
don't want to make a verdict to ollie so
enjoy<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.230> video<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.739> thanks<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.309> watching

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.819 

so<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.730> start<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> boot<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:43.620> press

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
so we start with the boot up just press

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.770 
so we start with the boot up just press
the<00:00:44.010> button<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.379> their<00:00:46.379> turns<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.629> i<00:00:48.629> did

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the button and their turns on and i did

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.350 
the button and their turns on and i did
this<00:00:48.930> before<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.500> was<00:00:49.530> around<00:00:50.010> 15<00:00:50.670> seconds

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
this before and it was around 15 seconds

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.990 
this before and it was around 15 seconds
so<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.989> doesn't<00:00:52.350> take<00:00:52.559> long<00:00:52.590> at<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.489> this

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
so it doesn't take long at all and this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.540 
so it doesn't take long at all and this
just<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.300> regular<00:00:54.539> boot<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.399> you<00:00:56.399> can

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
just a regular boot up and you can

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.599 
just a regular boot up and you can
compare<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.239> probably<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:57.989> any<00:00:58.410> imac<00:00:59.399> or

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
compare it to probably like any imac or

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.819 
compare it to probably like any imac or
macbook<00:01:00.510> pro<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.260> probably<00:01:01.440> won't<00:01:01.739> be

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
macbook pro and it probably won't be

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.960 
macbook pro and it probably won't be
faster<00:01:02.250> than<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.890> battery<00:01:05.400> life<00:01:05.549> is

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
faster than that so the battery life is

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.070 
faster than that so the battery life is
just<00:01:06.570> estimated<00:01:07.409> over<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:09.570> will<00:01:09.600> say

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
just estimated over here and it will say

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.450 
just estimated over here and it will say
something<00:01:10.560> around<00:01:11.210> four<00:01:12.210> hours<00:01:13.220> 45<00:01:14.220> or

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
something around four hours 45 or

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.390 
something around four hours 45 or
something<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.990> battery<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.380> almost<00:01:16.680> full

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
something and the battery is almost full

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.260 
something and the battery is almost full
so<00:01:18.140> apple<00:01:19.140> says<00:01:19.770> themselves<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.790> has<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
so apple says themselves that it has a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.620 
so apple says themselves that it has a
five<00:01:21.750> hour<00:01:22.049> battery<00:01:22.080> life<00:01:22.820> well<00:01:23.820> web<00:01:24.270> surfing

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
five hour battery life well web surfing

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.460 
five hour battery life well web surfing
battery<00:01:25.200> life<00:01:25.409> i<00:01:25.729> did<00:01:26.729> use<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> macbook<00:01:28.290> air

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
battery life i did use the macbook air

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.429 
battery life i did use the macbook air
yesterday<00:01:28.740> quite<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> bit<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.750> did<00:01:30.930> surf<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
you watch a video the battery life

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.899 
you watch a video the battery life
really<00:01:39.750> starts<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.350> suck<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.979> mean<00:01:41.220> from<00:01:41.820> like

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
really starts to suck I mean from like

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.170 
really starts to suck I mean from like
three<00:01:42.630> hours<00:01:42.659> estimate<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.590> goes<00:01:43.799> down<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.180> one

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
three hours estimate it goes down to one

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.780 
three hours estimate it goes down to one
and<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.360> half<00:01:45.390> hours<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.560> general<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.610> don't

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and a half hours in general if you don't

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.289 
and a half hours in general if you don't
do<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> lot<00:01:48.090> only<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.840> chatting<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> stuff<00:01:49.860> is

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
do a lot only like chatting and stuff is

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.249 
do a lot only like chatting and stuff is
completely<00:01:51.299> fine<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:52.079> you'll

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
completely fine and I think you'll

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.950 
completely fine and I think you'll
almost<00:01:52.470> get<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> five<00:01:53.159> hours<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.299> if<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.750> do

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
almost get the five hours but if you do

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.590 
almost get the five hours but if you do
some<00:01:55.680> multitasking<00:01:56.009> play<00:01:56.880> some<00:01:57.090> videos<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
some multitasking play some videos and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.870 
some multitasking play some videos and
so<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.140> can't<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.649> expect<00:01:59.130> five<00:01:59.460> hours

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
so on you can't really expect five hours

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.410 
so on you can't really expect five hours
or<00:02:00.000> anything<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.149> about<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
or anything so that was about the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.980 
or anything so that was about the
battery<00:02:03.960> life<00:02:04.549> next<00:02:05.549> thing<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.270> key<00:02:06.450> watch<00:02:06.659> as

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
battery life next thing the key watch as

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.130 
battery life next thing the key watch as
you<00:02:07.259> might<00:02:07.439> notice<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:08.129> isn't<00:02:08.910> backless<00:02:09.300> this

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you might notice it isn't backless this

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.580
