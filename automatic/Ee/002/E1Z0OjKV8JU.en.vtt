00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
before you go to start putting stuff in

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.070 
before you go to start putting stuff in
the<00:00:06.810> paint<00:00:07.080> stripper<00:00:08.719> first<00:00:09.719> thing<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:09.929> need

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
the paint stripper first thing you need

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.000 
the paint stripper first thing you need
to<00:00:10.139> do<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.380> separate<00:00:12.830> right<00:00:15.560> like<00:00:16.560> these<00:00:16.800> will

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
to do is separate right like these will

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.910 
to do is separate right like these will
all<00:00:17.369> these<00:00:17.640> parts<00:00:17.910> will<00:00:18.150> be<00:00:18.210> white<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.920> all

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
all these parts will be white and all

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.000 
all these parts will be white and all
these<00:00:20.100> parts<00:00:20.430> will<00:00:20.580> be<00:00:20.640> red<00:00:21.590> so<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.650> need<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
these parts will be red so you need to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.750 
these parts will be red so you need to
separate<00:00:23.550> piles<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.560> then<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.650> can

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
separate piles for that then you can

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.960 
separate piles for that then you can
separate<00:00:26.760> each<00:00:27.150> pile<00:00:28.429> between<00:00:29.429> metal<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
separate each pile between metal and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.170 
separate each pile between metal and
plastic<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.720> don't<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.619> them<00:00:32.030> separated<00:00:33.030> yet

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
plastic I don't have them separated yet

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.180 
plastic I don't have them separated yet
but<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.200> you'll<00:00:37.530> need<00:00:37.710> four

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
but so you can you'll need four

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.660 
but so you can you'll need four
different<00:00:38.579> piles<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.600> store<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:41.309> parts

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
different piles you can store the parts

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.350 
different piles you can store the parts
in<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.290> container<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:43.440> something<00:00:44.300> your<00:00:45.300> own

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
in a container or something your own

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.369 
in a container or something your own
little<00:00:45.600> container<00:00:49.700> I'll<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.969> these

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
little container I'll have these

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.069 
little container I'll have these
separated<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.469> four<00:00:52.770> parts<00:00:53.010> yep<00:00:53.690> all<00:00:54.690> this

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
separated in four parts yep all this

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.000 
separated in four parts yep all this
will<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.350> white<00:00:57.260> all<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.440> will<00:00:58.680> be<00:00:58.770> red<00:01:01.010> just

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
will be white all this will be red just

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.810 
will be white all this will be red just
gotta<00:01:02.190> separate<00:01:02.609> what's<00:01:02.850> plastic<00:01:04.670> will<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
gotta separate what's plastic will be a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480 
gotta separate what's plastic will be a
lot<00:01:06.060> easier<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:07.040> once<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.310> then

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
lot easier because once you do that then

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.899 
lot easier because once you do that then
you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.030> take<00:01:10.310> whatever<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.610> going<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you can just take whatever is going to

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.020 
you can just take whatever is going to
be<00:01:12.000> white<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.810> metal<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:14.070> throw<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.700> all<00:01:14.850> in

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
be white it's metal and throw it all in

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.539 
be white it's metal and throw it all in
the<00:01:15.090> paint<00:01:15.330> stripper<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:15.960> time<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:17.460> then

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the paint stripper at one time and then

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.499 
the paint stripper at one time and then
take<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:19.220> wash<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.670> set<00:01:21.479> it

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
take all that out wash it and set it

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.570 
take all that out wash it and set it
aside<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.200> throw<00:01:22.770> everything<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.340> red

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
aside and then throw everything is red

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.010 
aside and then throw everything is red
in<00:01:24.560> there<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> same<00:01:26.670> thing<00:01:30.020> might
