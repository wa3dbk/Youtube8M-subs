00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.070
 Japanese 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.000
 Two people of Kenjiro Aoi 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.250
 The next mark is in the upper left corner of the screen. For Japan 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.019
 There is still Italy from now on 53 Hiroshima 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.199
 Unusual 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.199
 I've been waiting 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.119
 The Japanese patent played for 1 minute 26 seconds 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.689
 Boasts the first Kantori 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.089
 In high school 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.729
 Like a rival 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.960
 While recognizing Koyamauchi 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.130
 It also seemed to be smiling, but one of the fun in the same sea area 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.930
 In elementary school 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.380
 The rest was done so 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 And from March 2008 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.900
 There was a pottery ceremony 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.570
 A job that aims to form an Olympic pair by pairing 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.930
 is not it 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.190
 Two people 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.190
 Training area 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.980
 All Japanese departments are also active. 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.920
 It was also possible that the governor could not 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.040
 There is also a place that bears the fourth point 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.439
 Japan is expensive, but full hi-vision remains 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.420
 Australia and Ireland one by one while school 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.130
 I encourage you to visit, but after all you are a stone player. 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.580
 In the case of man-hours as an example 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.360
 2 Top Plans in Croatia 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.700
 Sanyo Straria 42 in Ireland 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 Japan should be behind this 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.990
 If you receive Macnica from the left side of the wafer 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.140
 It is good 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.150
 A little bit of speed and the love of Okinawa 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.090
 Say that 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.870
 Yes, I came here a little off 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.940
 I hold this mark and deny the charges 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.550
 I'm heading towards wanting to confirm that would be such 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.730
 I will 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.910
 At the top 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.320
 Croatia has changed 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.000
 On the other hand I saw Japan 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.220
 After all 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.300
 Is Australia behind Ireland? 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.050
 I can not do this for a while 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.590
 Japan is well done but still 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.869
 I'm a professional to do it Doctor and nurse at proxy here 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.779
 Contains 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.009
 Once 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.129
 I did not leave Australia 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.259
 There will be a lot of apple penetration 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.709
 It is quite difficult to lose this place 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.230
 Now we can see 422 Ireland Japan after Offstraia 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.230
 There was a little bit of Ireland and Japan 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.649
 Croatia top 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.369
 20 seconds later the government comes round 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.670
 Australia participates 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.069
 26 seconds 3 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.529
 Neat 3-36 seconds sales 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.089
 It is a real battle 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:48.029
 Running this number of people this much does not really have this difference 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.429
 So this time Japan will be developing 14 inches soon 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:52.909
 I'm going around the curtain 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.669
 422 Ireland 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.899
 Ireland is 37 seconds late 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.899
 Ireland and Japan have opened a little bit 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:05.539
 I'm just wondering if you keep going this way It's coming from behind 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.239
 It will be the Netherlands, but now I have tears 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.289
 Has been 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:14.249
 But if you get here well it will be a simple shot 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:15.579
 It means that you will be late 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.079
 It's hard to say that Japan is still here 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.810
 That's right, and if you do, you will keep 32nd place 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:26.129
 It will be part of the first race and 9 races 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.619
 There is a third place keep 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:30.819
 I can bow and I want to make it happen 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.079
 It will be 11 races in all 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.079
 Now I played top clutch 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.359
 Croatia was a run like this today 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.279
 Take the top for the first time in the history of the Olympics 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.849
 I'm glad 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.019
 Of the more than a dozen people, especially for scenes with a loss 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.609
 I think it's a nice thing around the mark 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.779
 Youth who became an instructor and applied 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.779
 Still there was a fear that it was a point by all means 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:07.019
 Fine weather 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.019
 More about Australian gas pipes 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.739
 I saw Ireland on the 4th 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.629
 In the fourth place 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:19.620
 Ireland 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.840
 It's about time it's big, and it's an honor to go with this book 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.949
 Organized by the executive committee is a mountain that can win the stone in Japan 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.949
 It is so rare that the money is wonderful 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.009
 I will show my motivation 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.120
 Teaching where delivery is roaring 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.080
 One of the skippers who are 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.879
 I looked like it was pretty 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.610
 And now 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.629
 Overall ranking top in current ranking- 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.539
 Great Britain 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.740
 How is Britain today? 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.740
 The result was a finish in the middle 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.120
 But Japan this endurance race .22 yuan 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:05.089
 It is with this steam 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.730
 Ninth 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.430
 The race is over 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.719
 Japan gathers and gathers points 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:13.770
 5 points 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.550
 This is a comprehensive point Japan is this nicely relaxed 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.550
 It came to have no such thing 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:23.259
 Supermarket 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.449
 It is serious, and the rest 204 moon 73 to consolate after this is high rank 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.449
 I want to keep it and aim for a medal 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.279
 There has been so far 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.779
 Became Australia 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:41.139
 Trial run 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.089
 France is around here 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.870
 Around that 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.199
 Fighting the other two races while keeping rivals always 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.189
 Stated to ask 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:54.189
 Things that only care about that of edition 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.650
 Another is reversed because the Spanish player has bloomed in the local area 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.270
 It may be done 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.520
 From now on, assembling various races and difficult things 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.520
 Will be 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.449
 We will have Japan painting final 11 races 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.449
 Up to here Japan is Sweden 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.659
 The potential for metal left on the top 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:22.740
 Japan's final game in good 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.599
 Well, there is a one-shot game metal court 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.210
 It became 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.449
 Mr. Koyama takes a Japanese medal 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:32.289
 In the same race today 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:33.650
 Before that 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.009
 It is an indication that it is prohibited by he within 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.009
 Will be 

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:44.759
 Further 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.809
 The newly appointed United States and the United Kingdom 

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:51.239
 America wins 1 to win a gold medal 

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:53.069
 Will come to be loaded 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:53.679
 other than this
