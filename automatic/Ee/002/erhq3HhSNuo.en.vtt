right we throw the flash standing
we<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.900> use<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.319> flash<00:02:25.650> mainly<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
we can use this flash mainly in the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.400 
we can use this flash mainly in the
situation<00:02:26.970> when<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.390> assume<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.780> one<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.319> the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
situation when we assume that one of the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.229 
situation when we assume that one of the
condo<00:02:28.739> terrorists<00:02:29.280> could<00:02:29.430> position<00:02:29.880> himself

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
condo terrorists could position himself

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.300 
condo terrorists could position himself

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
on the close distance behind this sort

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.479 
on the close distance behind this sort
of<00:02:32.400> smoke<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:33.080> this<00:02:34.080> case<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.770> can<00:02:34.920> run<00:02:35.160> right

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
of smoke in this case we can run right

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.250 
of smoke in this case we can run right
through<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.910> smoke<00:02:36.300> after<00:02:36.750> having<00:02:36.989> throw<00:02:37.200> in

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
through the smoke after having throw in

through the smoke after having throw in
a<00:02:37.349> flash<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.890> frack<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.520> opponent<00:02:39.000> before<00:02:39.060> he

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
a flash and frack the opponent before he

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.510 
a flash and frack the opponent before he

has absolutely no chances to avoid this
flash<00:02:42.080> often<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.200> happens<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.250> when<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
flash often it happens so that when the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.910 
flash often it happens so that when the
