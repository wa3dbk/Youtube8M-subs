it to fire up your burner more and give
you<00:02:55.070> more<00:02:55.280> heat<00:02:55.520> so<00:02:56.239> that's<00:02:56.390> our<00:02:56.540> bottom

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
you more heat so that's our bottom

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.900 
you more heat so that's our bottom
section<00:02:59.060> our<00:02:59.239> top<00:02:59.510> section<00:03:00.520> slops<00:03:01.520> in<00:03:01.700> over

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
section our top section slops in over

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.729 
section our top section slops in over
the<00:03:02.000> top<00:03:02.120> there<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.989> turns<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.320> lock<00:03:03.560> in

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
the top there and just turns to lock in

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.080 
the top there and just turns to lock in
so<00:03:04.070> there<00:03:04.220> we<00:03:04.310> go<00:03:04.340> we've<00:03:04.580> got<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.790> complete

section between the two layers what that

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.810 
section between the two layers what that
does<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.620> once<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.950> unit<00:03:25.190> starts<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.610> heat<00:03:25.790> up

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
does is once the unit starts to heat up

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.140 
does is once the unit starts to heat up
it's<00:03:26.390> actually<00:03:26.930> preheating<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:28.150> methylated

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
it's actually preheating the methylated

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.759 
it's actually preheating the methylated
spirits<00:03:29.540> before<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:29.989> starts<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.350> burn<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.650> so

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
spirits before it starts to burn it so

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.620 
spirits before it starts to burn it so
you're<00:03:30.890> burning<00:03:31.160> vapor<00:03:31.400> rather<00:03:32.120> than<00:03:32.269> fuel

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
you're burning vapor rather than fuel

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
you're burning vapor rather than fuel
which<00:03:32.780> is<00:03:32.810> more<00:03:33.080> efficient<00:03:33.380> they're<00:03:33.560> also

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
which is more efficient they're also

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.370 
which is more efficient they're also
preheated<00:03:34.549> top<00:03:34.730> burns<00:03:34.940> hotter<00:03:35.239> as<00:03:35.420> well<00:03:35.600> so

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
preheated top burns hotter as well so

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.740 
preheated top burns hotter as well so
that<00:03:36.530> just<00:03:36.739> drops<00:03:36.950> into<00:03:37.130> there<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.750> then

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
that just drops into there and then

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.580 
that just drops into there and then
we're<00:03:38.930> ready<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.200> go

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
we're ready to go

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.180 
we're ready to go
we<00:03:39.890> were<00:03:39.980> then<00:03:40.160> out<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:40.459> add<00:03:40.940> fuel<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:42.100> lot<00:03:43.100> of

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
we were then out and add fuel a lot of

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.280 
we were then out and add fuel a lot of
people<00:03:43.459> add<00:03:43.700> fuel<00:03:44.150> with<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.690> top<00:03:44.870> section<00:03:45.200> off

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
people add fuel with the top section off

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.660 
people add fuel with the top section off
that<00:03:45.470> makes<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:45.739> easier<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.160> put<00:03:46.310> your<00:03:46.459> fuel

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
that makes it easier to put your fuel

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.030 
that makes it easier to put your fuel
into<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.780> actual<00:03:48.140> spirit<00:03:48.560> burner<00:03:48.769> and

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
into the the actual spirit burner and

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.720 
into the the actual spirit burner and
then<00:03:49.790> drop<00:03:50.000> our<00:03:50.120> top<00:03:50.330> section<00:03:50.690> on<00:03:51.459> we<00:03:52.459> can<00:03:52.610> then

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
then drop our top section on we can then

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.850 
then drop our top section on we can then
light<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.299> we're<00:03:53.510> ready<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.780> go<00:03:53.959> when

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
light it and we're ready to go when

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.979 
light it and we're ready to go when
we're<00:03:55.040> using<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.400> pen<00:03:55.670> we<00:03:56.480> have<00:03:56.510> our<00:03:56.750> pen

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
we're using a pen we have our pen

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.320 
we're using a pen we have our pen
supports<00:03:57.440> out<00:03:57.620> like<00:03:57.830> that<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.459> our<00:03:59.090> pen

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
supports out like that and our pen

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.150 
supports out like that and our pen
simply<00:03:59.690> sits<00:03:59.870> on<00:04:00.019> there<00:04:00.200> so<00:04:00.709> plenty<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.100> heat

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
simply sits on there so plenty of heat

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.320 
simply sits on there so plenty of heat
coming<00:04:01.370> up<00:04:01.640> for<00:04:02.600> cooking<00:04:02.720> in<00:04:02.959> our<00:04:03.019> pan

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
coming up for cooking in our pan

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.490 
coming up for cooking in our pan
otherwise<00:04:05.330> if<00:04:05.690> we<00:04:05.810> want<00:04:05.959> to<00:04:05.989> use<00:04:06.140> one<00:04:06.290> of<00:04:06.350> our

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
otherwise if we want to use one of our

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.910 
otherwise if we want to use one of our
pots<00:04:06.799> we<00:04:07.580> just<00:04:07.760> fold<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.090> pen<00:04:08.269> support<00:04:08.660> in<00:04:08.920> and

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
pots we just fold the pen support in and

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.180 
pots we just fold the pen support in and
that<00:04:10.040> allows<00:04:10.280> us<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.549> use<00:04:10.820> out<00:04:11.530> our<00:04:12.530> pen<00:04:12.799> inside

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
that allows us to use out our pen inside

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.060 
that allows us to use out our pen inside
there<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.790> depending<00:04:14.720> on<00:04:15.049> conditions<00:04:15.500> may

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
there and depending on conditions may

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.390 
there and depending on conditions may
take<00:04:16.310> about<00:04:16.489> 11<00:04:16.850> minutes<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.810> boil<00:04:18.400> your

take about 11 minutes to to boil your

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.290 
take about 11 minutes to to boil your
water<00:04:19.780> but<00:04:21.130> very<00:04:22.130> very<00:04:22.340> efficient<00:04:22.850> in<00:04:22.970> terms

water but very very efficient in terms

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.060

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
to boil at water a bit quicker we can

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.409 
to boil at water a bit quicker we can
just<00:04:39.719> drop<00:04:39.900> our<00:04:40.129> pan<00:04:41.129> on<00:04:41.339> as<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.520> lid<00:04:41.759> and<00:04:41.969> in

we can regulate the temperature using

we can regulate the temperature using
