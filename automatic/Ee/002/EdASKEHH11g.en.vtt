00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740

guess<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:15.000> would<00:00:15.269> best<00:00:15.570> describe<00:00:15.719> it

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
so I did play or manager cuz I figured I

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.980 
so I did play or manager cuz I figured I
assumed<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.369> that's<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> only<00:00:21.390> way<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.750> can

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.769 
assumed that that's the only way you can
play<00:00:22.170> as<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.769> players<00:00:23.300> now<00:00:24.300> I'm<00:00:24.390> gonna<00:00:24.539> warn

hopefully move up in the rankings or not

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.410 
hopefully move up in the rankings or not
in<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.350> rankings<00:02:13.770> but<00:02:13.950> move<00:02:14.160> up<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.210> next

league and eventually get into the
Premier<00:02:17.250> League<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.610> don't<00:02:17.760> know<00:02:17.850> how<00:02:17.970> long

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
Premier League I don't know how long

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.970 
Premier League I don't know how long
you'll<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.570> doing<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.170> part<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.830> had

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
you'll be doing this and this part I had

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.200 
you'll be doing this and this part I had
to<00:02:20.130> cut<00:02:20.310> out<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.550> sound<00:02:20.790> because<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.120> would

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
to cut out the sound because it would

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.850 
to cut out the sound because it would
have<00:02:21.300> been<00:02:21.390> very<00:02:21.420> annoying<00:02:21.990> listen<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> song

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
have been very annoying listen to a song

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.670 
have been very annoying listen to a song
it<00:02:23.100> like<00:02:23.310> full<00:02:24.300> or<00:02:24.810> hike<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:26.100> 3/4<00:02:26.910> times<00:02:27.120> speed

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
it like full or hike to 3/4 times speed

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.740 
it like full or hike to 3/4 times speed
so<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.010> me<00:02:29.190> making<00:02:29.550> my<00:02:29.670> guy<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.150> was

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
so this is just me making my guy I was

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.600 
so this is just me making my guy I was
making<00:02:31.050> my<00:02:31.170> guy<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.740> then<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.950> decided<00:02:32.430> I

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
making my guy and then I decided I

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.280 
making my guy and then I decided I
didn't<00:02:32.820> really<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.390> face<00:02:33.660> he<00:02:33.840> had<00:02:34.050> I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
didn't really like the face he had I

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.810 
didn't really like the face he had I
didn't<00:02:34.770> want<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.100> go<00:02:35.250> with<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.490> default

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
didn't want to just go with the default

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.260 
didn't want to just go with the default
face<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.720> then<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.860> started<00:02:38.460> randomizing<00:02:39.120> it

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
face so then I started randomizing it

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.890 
face so then I started randomizing it
and<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:41.580> know<00:02:41.700> after<00:02:41.880> randomizing<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.750> for

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and you know after randomizing it for

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.500 
and you know after randomizing it for
about<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.140> minute<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.590> realized<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.510> should

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
about a minute I realized I should

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.080 
about a minute I realized I should
probably<00:02:45.750> start<00:02:46.320> looking<00:02:46.410> at<00:02:46.980> what<00:02:47.970> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
probably start looking at what the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.260 
probably start looking at what the
people<00:02:48.360> look<00:02:48.600> like<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:50.400> not<00:02:50.610> necessarily

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
people look like and not necessarily

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.700 
people look like and not necessarily
their<00:02:51.450> skin<00:02:51.720> color<00:02:51.900> because<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.230> was<00:02:52.320> hoping<00:02:52.470> on

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
their skin color because I was hoping on

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.440 
their skin color because I was hoping on
you<00:02:52.920> know<00:02:53.040> getting<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.850> guy<00:02:53.970> that's<00:02:54.210> white

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.010 
through all the other complexions and
then<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.440> was<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.710> okay<00:03:02.100> well<00:03:02.880> what<00:03:03.660> if<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.840> just

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
then I was like okay well what if I just

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.900 
then I was like okay well what if I just
changed<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.440> complexion<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:05.100> white<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.790> know

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910

changed the complexion of white you know
the<00:03:06.060> whitest<00:03:06.330> one<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.840> make<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.440> then

assuming<00:03:50.880> it's<00:03:51.180> just<00:03:51.330> how<00:03:51.690> easy<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.260> want<00:03:52.440> the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
assuming it's just how easy you want the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.240 
assuming it's just how easy you want the
game-mode<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:54.090> be<00:03:54.300> like<00:03:54.750> manage<00:03:55.709> like

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
game-mode to be like manage like

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.729 
game-mode to be like manage like
managing<00:03:56.730> mode<00:03:56.940> so<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.510> made<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.810> close<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
managing mode so I made it close to the

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.680 
managing mode so I made it close to the
little<00:03:58.890> low<00:03:59.010> end<00:03:59.270> because<00:04:00.270> like<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.510> said<00:04:00.660> I

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
little low end because like I said I

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.260 
little low end because like I said I
