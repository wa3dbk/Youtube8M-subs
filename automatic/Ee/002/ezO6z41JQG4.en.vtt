controller<00:00:22.380> at<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.710> car<00:00:23.390> ok<00:00:24.390> let's<00:00:24.960> get<00:00:25.110> this

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
controller at the car ok let's get this

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.109 
controller at the car ok let's get this
thing<00:00:25.380> open<00:00:25.770> already<00:00:26.099> kept<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.489> tape<00:00:26.700> so<00:00:27.029> the
