three two one really go Thomas goal we

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.060 
three two one really go Thomas goal we
change<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.080> direction<00:04:50.259> so<00:04:50.650> he<00:04:50.740> doesn't<00:04:51.009> have

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
change the direction so he doesn't have

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.820 
change the direction so he doesn't have
to<00:04:51.150> what<00:04:52.150> happened<00:04:52.570> these<00:04:53.380> are<00:04:53.530> kind<00:04:53.710> of

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
to what happened these are kind of

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.920 
to what happened these are kind of
little<00:04:54.130> drawback<00:04:54.400> you<00:04:54.760> can<00:04:54.940> see<00:04:55.090> sometimes<00:04:55.510> it

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
little drawback you can see sometimes it

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:06.010 
little drawback you can see sometimes it
gets<00:04:56.229> attached

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.570 

Thomas<00:05:06.830> is<00:05:06.979> coming<00:05:07.190> through<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.850> city<00:05:08.150> here<00:05:11.530> I

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
Thomas is coming through the city here I

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.059 
Thomas is coming through the city here I
don't<00:05:13.580> want<00:05:13.759> that<00:05:14.139> but<00:05:15.139> sometimes<00:05:15.380> you<00:05:15.770> might

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
don't want that but sometimes you might

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.860 
don't want that but sometimes you might
have<00:05:16.280> to<00:05:16.660> give<00:05:17.660> him<00:05:17.690> some<00:05:18.080> heat<00:05:19.539> for<00:05:20.539> the<00:05:20.660> third

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
have to give him some heat for the third

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.480 
have to give him some heat for the third
time<00:05:21.110> I<00:05:21.139> believe<00:05:21.500> for<00:05:21.740> for<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.009> second<00:05:22.370> time

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
time I believe for for the second time

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.850 
time I believe for for the second time
