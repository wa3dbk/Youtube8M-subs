00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:17.260

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:34.059
 what we have today what agenda b 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:40.830
 stray dogs and that with them these dogs 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:43.360
 that we have ceased to wander what is the problem 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.980
 the problem is that its those homeless 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 dogs attack people what 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.140
 and if these dogs are after humans also on 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.809
 they will attack us 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.600
 what sentences i certainly don't 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:04.650
 getting ready now go away 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.650
 dirty animals 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:18.940
 don't you understand that with such a slogan 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:22.619
 but 1 really have to knock out this one 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.320
 joke tracks what type you are dirty and stomach 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.190
 can embed tracks on get up dogs 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.640
 to destroy their collective inside 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.119
 well done anya and it was our team years 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:42.039
 tracking very well from the inside destroys 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:47.500
 more and he has a tail and after all bidding 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:52.450
 like it then you come up with 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.190
 these dogs don't bite me for example 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.960
 a concert for them to hold 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:04.300
 Ivanovo Ivanovo 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:07.600
 cereals about you on its bottom as well, there 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.929
 like these animals before others 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.929
 the animals 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:25.239
 I came up with the Bremen musicians 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.690
 and I sat down on the road why I sat at 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.760
 streaker 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.920
 but think a little bit because I 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.700
 troubadour and there can be two troubadours 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.440
 no donkey 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.940
 the more you in the last election 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.569
 voted for the communists everything converges 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.840
 can then be given to find an ass in 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:52.489
 the zoo 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:56.260
 that is, I am at home like a zoo is yours 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.780
 the house is what you are stupid tracks 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.350
 but beautiful 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.569
 beautifully they are all either stupid naive here 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.110
 so that now all go together in those 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.300
 the places where these animals live will not find 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.760
 then butter and truchen will show us this 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:20.550
 after all, he quickly learned his date 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.550
