00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
time and I mean so dearly have probably

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.270 
time and I mean so dearly have probably
been<00:00:47.880> there<00:00:48.140> since<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> team<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:49.740> founded<00:00:49.860> so

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
a professional probably that he was able

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.969 
a professional probably that he was able
to<00:01:05.250> move<00:01:05.790> seamlessly<00:01:06.509> from<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.829> was<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
to move seamlessly from what was a

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
will be one of the few that would have

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.139 
will be one of the few that would have
been<00:01:12.420> able<00:01:12.569> to<00:01:12.810> cross<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.920> divide<00:01:14.149> without

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
any effort whatsoever and that's a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.020 
any effort whatsoever and that's a
testament<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.429> the<00:01:17.520> way<00:01:17.609> he<00:01:17.729> looked<00:01:17.880> after
