00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello very good dear subscribers 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.130
 today I am the ghost biker ' and if 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.170
 you also want to be the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.480
 ghost biker ' very attentive to this 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.920
 video because this is a guide a kit 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.630
 pretty funny with which you can 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.670
 modify your character a little 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.609
 so that it is not equal to everyone's and with 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.990
 this can you put on your helmet 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.269
 permanently and also a mask in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.310
 which you want is worth helmet and mask 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.289
 it's a pretty funny bit and as I've 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.439
 said for your character to be 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.450
 something more special not something different from 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.700
 rest of characters let's see how it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.649
 So this clip is very simple 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.350
 do the only thing we have to do is 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.180
 hold the select and we will see that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.219
 if we go to our inventory then 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.020
 we have the masks and we have the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.120
 helmets this works with any type 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.469
 of mask and any helmet worth you can 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.420
 choose how you want to customize to 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.980
 your character I have this mask 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.140
 for example next to none where 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.660
 put any by the closest I have the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.100
 Skeleton helmet and then helmets 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.510
 I have the helmet, the only helmet I have 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.460
 and you have seen how handsome I am for 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.960
 true that I have painted my eyes and I 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.610
 I have painted the lips for you 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.830
 I think that deserves a line 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.210
 and apart let's continue with the gray what 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.320
 we leave in the cel de just where he puts 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.970
 inventory when we get on the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.040
 motorcycle we press inventory we prepare 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.870
 in masks and when he makes the gesture of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.100
 put on the helmet quickly we give the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.720
 Quickly 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.430
 we put the mask will stay a 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.260
 little bit and we will stay with 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.300
 the mask of the helmet at the same time 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.130
 good arrival of djs but fatal if I 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.570
 got off the bike the helmet takes it off if 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.970
 It is correct but so that it is not removed 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.800
 let's press start let's go to 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.630
 online and we will look for a new session 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.160
 is worth with the helmet mounted thus in the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.590
 motorcycle as we were with the helmet and 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.150
 the mask on we will be online and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.280
 new session what will happen to the cloud 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.680
 of rockstar will upload us and download 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.210
 in a new session and when you leave us in 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.369
 this new session we will have 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.990
 permanently our helmet and our 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.030
 mask both at the same time 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.550
 I think it's a click we like 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.020
 a lot since good you can investigate 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.640
 with our customizable character from 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.470
 a different way to the rest of 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.850
 players who are in gta each 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.200
 one may be wearing the mask that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.729
 want with the helmet you want to make 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.170
 different I do not know different 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.640
 combinations that are made so be a 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.320
 little bit more special and apart is 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.790
 quite handsome is not quite handsome 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.470
 when people see you and with the helmet 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.790
 good as you are going to see the cloud of face 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.630
 It takes an egg so it goes a little 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.220
 the video here 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.320
 I'm already in my house because 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.210
 He had instead of appearances 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.040
 property and here you see how I'm already with 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.320
 the helmet and with the mask and I do not have 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.640
 any kind of problem I'm going the helmet 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.350
 he does not take off the mask he does not take it off 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.700
 we can do what we want with 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.380
 it so I hope you liked it 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.610
