32 pretty good okay so let's reverse all
I<00:03:27.170> want<00:03:27.440> unfortunately<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.310> did<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.579> before<00:03:28.810> so

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
I want unfortunately I did it before so

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.750 
I want unfortunately I did it before so
one<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.079> these<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:30.530> actually<00:03:30.680> he's<00:03:31.579> probably

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
one of these is actually he's probably

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.440 
one of these is actually he's probably
going<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.030> be<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:32.269> one<00:03:33.400> yeah<00:03:34.400> well<00:03:34.790> madam<00:03:35.120> is

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
going to be this one yeah well madam is

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.949 
going to be this one yeah well madam is
that's<00:03:36.519> non<00:03:37.519> shiny<00:03:37.880> one<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.299> this<00:03:38.360> is<00:03:38.570> just<00:03:38.720> a

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
that's non shiny one and this is just a

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.620 
that's non shiny one and this is just a
Rosen's<00:03:39.769> research<00:03:40.630> this<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:43.239> plank<00:03:44.239> loop

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
Rosen's research this is a plank loop

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.520 
Rosen's research this is a plank loop
this<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.350> rare<00:03:46.280> one<00:03:46.519> it's<00:03:47.239> non-chinese<00:03:47.810> warm

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
this is a rare one it's non-chinese warm

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:56.440 
this is a rare one it's non-chinese warm
it<00:03:48.680> up<00:03:48.820> evolution<00:03:49.820> of<00:03:50.390> Bernie<00:03:52.209> ok<00:03:53.209> so<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:55.450> is

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
it up evolution of Bernie ok so the is

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.050 
it up evolution of Bernie ok so the is
good<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.930> guess<00:03:57.079> two<00:03:57.620> stars<00:03:58.100> to<00:03:58.519> have<00:03:58.670> not<00:03:58.820> going

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
good I guess two stars to have not going

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.130 
good I guess two stars to have not going
a<00:03:59.500> reverse<00:04:00.500> holo<00:04:00.739> neither<00:04:01.190> King<00:04:02.019> star<00:04:03.019> and

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
a reverse holo neither King star and

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.130 
a reverse holo neither King star and
women<00:04:06.140> down<00:04:06.320> on<00:04:06.620> holographic<00:04:07.599> stuff<00:04:08.599> we're

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
women down on holographic stuff we're

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.729 
women down on holographic stuff we're
okay<00:04:09.950> so<00:04:10.370> pretty<00:04:10.730> good<00:04:12.819> put<00:04:13.819> them<00:04:13.970> over<00:04:14.000> there

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
okay so pretty good put them over there

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.370 
okay so pretty good put them over there
and<00:04:15.739> then<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.549> next<00:04:16.700> bucket<00:04:17.000> which<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.959> this

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
and then the next bucket which is this

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.219 
and then the next bucket which is this
one<00:04:18.760> feel<00:04:19.870> nothing<00:04:20.870> open<00:04:21.229> before<00:04:22.660> see<00:04:23.660> blue

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
one feel nothing open before see blue

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:33.790 
one feel nothing open before see blue
field<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:25.310> it's<00:04:25.430> no<00:04:25.520> plea

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.340 

ok<00:04:34.800> this<00:04:35.040> packet

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
ok this packet

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.810 
ok this packet
and<00:04:36.980> so<00:04:37.510> 23<00:04:38.980> those<00:04:39.980> two<00:04:40.280> should<00:04:40.490> be<00:04:40.550> them

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
and so 23 those two should be them

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.700 
and so 23 those two should be them
hopefully<00:04:41.360> fingers<00:04:42.140> crossed<00:04:42.320> yeah<00:04:43.130> I<00:04:43.400> so

this<00:05:54.350> is<00:05:54.590> stuff<00:05:55.130> my<00:05:56.060> end<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.450> reverse<00:05:56.810> holo<00:05:57.080> is

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
this is stuff my end the reverse holo is

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.890 
this is stuff my end the reverse holo is
huh<00:06:00.250> Luke<00:06:01.250> colio<00:06:01.850> awesome<00:06:02.720> yeah<00:06:04.600> I've<00:06:05.600> got

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980 
the reverse holo is they just like

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.530 
the reverse holo is they just like
reverse<00:06:13.370> hollows<00:06:13.790> of<00:06:14.030> it<00:06:14.180> I<00:06:14.360> don't<00:06:14.600> know<00:06:14.720> of<00:06:15.110> a
