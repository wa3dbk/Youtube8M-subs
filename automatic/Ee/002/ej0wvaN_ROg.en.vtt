00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 berti guys it's the third time there 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.029
 I make this video but it does nothing 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.280
 welcome to this new tutorial between 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.650
 quotes on the rhythm problem that 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.630
 persists in many beginners of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.759
 this world in the sense that you succeed in 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.670
 find good rhythm of the songs o 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.130
 however your pace to give to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.460
 songs is if a bit like the bitch note 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.640
 he is busy and so today I have prepared 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.289
 a predefined pace that will be fine for 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.510
 so many songs so too 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.510
 great news for you fans a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.610
 what not to try immediately before you do me 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.260
 explain facts vigor video acres and then 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.000
 try I am at risk that will not happen 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.030
 but know for the rest in let's get started 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.030
 immediately 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.590
 ok then a quick note this 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.480
 rhythm does not have a structure defined in the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.630
 meaning that I think that now variable 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.610
 I'll say the rhythm like but you have to know that 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.010
 it is variable in the sense that the song 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.900
 song can vary the speed and the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.640
 rhythm time but will always remain there 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.660
 same now, however, let's see what is and what 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.590
 I mean 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.120
 the rhythm is this ok this is what 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.570
 should therefore be see the 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:33.810
 pace slowly is just pausini na il 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:35.880
 indent to Pasina ok June pausini more 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.270
 slowly and learn it, I recommend it 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.540
 because you will not miss learning from 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:48.450
 Just suio up down down is fine 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.430
 now we will try it with random songs 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.729
 I will show you that it works then 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.780
 we suffered with for example the cat 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:01.119
 and the fox 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:05.070
 he sees all his course here I have it 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.070
 won because it was I think it requires it 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.099
 let's try 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.099
 here 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
 do you want 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.890
 be nice 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.200
 we have another song for example a 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.670
 50 special don't call me you have me 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.400
 elected with honor you asked me 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.670
 then it comes to success comes on ok 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.670
 then 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.090
 let's try 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.090
 Well 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.090
 60 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.370
 look 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.370
 I played 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:21.690
 Gianni takes away your problems 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.690
 you have seen then 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.050
 let's send the three people come over bridge 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.050
 of bastia and therefore 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.540
 there 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.980
 but I tell you 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.849
 but withdrawal 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.599
 then so to try another 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.310
 song like for example I do not know is not 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.310
 that I still have to be a george technician 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:41.280
 guys lots of songs with whoever you want 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.280
 for example baiardo then bay 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.310
 all 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.910
 it's obviously not there 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.910
 I watch 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.910
 or 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.090
 behind so many 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.650
 and it is seen or other songs that I have 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.160
 just made for example whatsapp di 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.160
 infor not blondes 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.199
 already 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.809
 mannini 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.680
 no 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.720
 Massei 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.660
 torino you have seen 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.330
 we 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.000
 I will remain clinton 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.800
 you have obviously seen what I was saying 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.980
 it is variable in the sense that we now 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.480
 we did the same time for each 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.490
 agreement but for example in some songs 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.650
 like soul sister we should 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.050
 do it much faster then an agreement 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.880
 and four parts that will become 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.730
 eighth therefore what it means for example 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.290
 is the sister we should do up high up 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.290
 down but fast then 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.450
 no 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.030
 how have you seen guys and this is a 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.010
 default rhythm for many songs 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.700
 most played are random heights and has 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.920
 worked 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.780
 obviously the structure will be 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.910
 variable you can do it faster 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.890
 it should halve the braking or in any case 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.870
 you will have to do it again more slowly 

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.670
 you need to exchange some pen in matera 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.890
 theme will always be what could be 

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.320
 a universal rhythm let me know in the 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.240
 comments what you think anyway 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.920
 if he helped you because to myself 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.510
 since he helped me so much because me 

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.550
 I didn't know I used this rhythm ho 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.270
 since I used it so many times 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.770
 for the rest in the other write me maybe 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.540
 tutorial to do in helping you as it can 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.370
 be the pace either in bars or in 

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.560
 something else technical users though 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:55.840
 not only very good for the rest there 

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.840
 let's see an upcoming tutorial well guys 

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.970
 I say
