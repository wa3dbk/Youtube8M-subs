00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.649
 her dear youtube community and 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.330
 welcome to this 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.040
 announcement video with one 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.559
 surprising if not all 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.940
 shocking message many of you 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.640
 maybe have it in the tank screen 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.560
 seen what may come now 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.539
 i think i could explain the market 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.720
 It's still a little bit to and indeed 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.560
 yellow-red and that was yesterday 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.810
 The format was a ceremonial 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.239
 day a little sad but not so 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 we actually dare to really dare 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.070
 considering that we abolish game point 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.719
 on Wednesday because that's also in the time 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.219
 not really cracked so much anymore 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.440
 and we also said that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.110
 have had fun so long 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.789
 fun at it now is the fun 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.500
 continue to be less and be bock on new 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.149
 things and there are from next 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.640
 wednesday a format us just point 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.160
 want to call and explained 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.280
 sebastian again briefly it is 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.300
 again, a shopping shipment , so we 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.280
 have been such a lately 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.930
 felt a bit penned in ours 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.580
 own formats because so jam-packed 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.590
 where we travel and make challenges and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.299
 will have played game poker and 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.490
 that's why we do not do any with pon now 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.250
 format where we basically everything 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.840
 and we can do what we want 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.210

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.320
 film what we're up for 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.409
 How may it be said to the end 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.689
 So even if video at games 6000 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.890
 Clicks then it was 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.090
 in principle, strings are waiting for fun 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.710
 but now we are also slowly 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.670
 absurd games that's why we thought 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.400
 do something completely new 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.540

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.700
