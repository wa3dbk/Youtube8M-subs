00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.480
 I will not give these tents 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.760
 by manufacturing material 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.260
 there by 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.050
 permeability and in fact all of these 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.390
 data can be found on the internet that is in 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.440
 In this case, I would like to show 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.689
 some practical example 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.420
 use this tent use 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:32.310
 not the first season that is excellent 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.310
 tents under largely justifies itself 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.580
 a very simple process is established 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.910
 installation takes literally there 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.270
 a few minutes it's going on 2 arcs 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.670
 i.e. feet when cut with pegs in 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.769
 pegs included lightweight ordinary 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.900
 aluminum measles here are two aluminum 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.850
 arc inserted the top pass further 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.839
 snap to the side 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.839
 by braces 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.390
 upper arc slightly smaller in size 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:09.310
 lower return path more lower arc 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.080
 slightly smaller size in the spirit area there 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.900
 still ventilation vents 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.450
 why focus them on them 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.460
 need to keep open even if you 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.560
 let's say we decided to choose with this tent 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.680
 autumn to avoid strong 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.900
 accumulation of condensate inside the tent she 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.510
 waterproof in the rain 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.150
 I already had to spend the night water she did not 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.150
 misses but both outside and inside 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:45.120
 tent entrance one but valves 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.720
 let's say so their 2 1 valve is natural 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.440
 water protection 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:56.560
 here it has such button type 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:02:01.860
 fasteners here it is and the second valve is 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.300
 mosquito net mesh is quite small 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.000
 no mosquitoes Masha nor even more so 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.149
 step not prolaz closes on 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.070
 good quality zipper all 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.510
 very reliable but this grid has one 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.060
 negative moment she is also not very 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.620
 well passes air that is in 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.720
 the tent needs good ventilation 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.820
 therefore, ventilation vents need 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.860
 keep open 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.810
 that's inside the tent that's gone now 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.790
 operators to show a little please 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.010
 forgiveness for sin only after 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.990
 overnight stay inside tent presents 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.080
 here is such a space 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.860
 enough space to accommodate 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.880
 one man 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.930
 Well, about my size that is 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.750
 where is the height meter eighty- five 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.580
 accordingly, that's about like inside 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.350
 either standard foam is placed 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.370
 self-inflating mat all you need 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.250
 like things or there it is in that 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.770
 space well, where usually we are 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.040
 we put the boots here is a backpack 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.220
 if you are not a 100 liter monster 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.500
 all that up to 85 liters she calmly 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.440
 placed there in the headboard that is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.270
 can also be used as a pillow 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.710
 well here is a man not to say 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.880
 which is very spacious but 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:26.590
 enough to live 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.660
 spend the night now about the most interesting 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.840
 Pro is the dignity of this tent 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.600
 is that it is packed here 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.060
 in such a bag it is this and complete 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.820
 packaging is natural in full 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.740
 slightly bigger and full weight 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.500
 this tent is only one 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.230
 kilogram 200 grams that is if you 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.400
 want to go hiking somewhere 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:55.660
 choose light better then i'm options 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.870
 not yet seen so here's the tent 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.870
 ksl 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.050
 mosquito netting can also 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.950
 become attached ie used that 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.790
 same also fastener nose loop book 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.380
 show will not be closed 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.500
 condition she looks like this 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.500
 way 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:21.400
 it should also be noted that skinning is better 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.130
 put everything in full plus 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.500
 meaning that all rope mitin and 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.110
 then you will have enough tents 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.030
 amount of volume in order to be possible 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.500
 it was back to turn around and at least 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.830
 somehow there is a tent 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.889
 small but quite enough for yourself 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.639
 one person, that is , several 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:46.030
 walked out time up to three to four days 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.669
 alone and she showed herself altogether with 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:53.020
 the best side so here are the chambers 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:55.150
 some yes my friend actually 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.630
 companion now you don't see him he 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.639
 is on the other side of the camera here we are 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:06.280
 we use our own such tents 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:10.320
 both of them already have this tent 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:13.630
 The first season has already visited and 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.310
 Altai region and Mongolia and native forests 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.550
 Mari Republic Demons proper 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.280
 we live so these tents they 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.949
 principles practically but for any 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.900
 climatic zones well, so middle band 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:31.539
 something close was the autumn-winter experience then 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.370
 there is the November use of this 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.099
 the tent also has its own given 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:40.270
 she was there Mongolia happens and very 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:43.090
 cold in the cold season and and 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.560
 enough but it is single layer therefore 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.990
 consider that you have to stock up 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.530
 good sleeping bag and quite good 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.530
 a rug 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:01.490
 put and understand simply enough 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.490
 as I said, then there are others only 2 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.139
 quickdraws 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.020
 Yes , I also have to say these guys 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.300
 they go all bundled and they have 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.940
 one good is worth something 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.550
 I have not changed them and I will not change 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.260
 they are woven reflective thread 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.830
 evening night air 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:26.130
 fires melt but they are better seen and less 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.490
 The likelihood that you alone ban everything 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.490
 thank
