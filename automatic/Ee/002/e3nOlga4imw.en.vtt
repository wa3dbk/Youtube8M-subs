00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
okay so we are here today with my 1976

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.730 
okay so we are here today with my 1976
Datsun<00:00:07.680> 280z<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.780> we<00:00:09.780> are<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.410> be<00:00:10.530> doing

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
Datsun 280z and we are going to be doing

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.990 
Datsun 280z and we are going to be doing
an<00:00:11.309> air<00:00:11.610> conditioning<00:00:12.120> retrofit<00:00:12.780> on<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:14.000> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
an air conditioning retrofit on it the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.510 
an air conditioning retrofit on it the
system<00:00:15.540> was<00:00:16.400> back<00:00:17.400> down<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:19.220> sealed<00:00:20.220> off

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
system was back down and sealed off

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.870 
system was back down and sealed off
basically<00:00:21.619> when<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> car<00:00:22.949> was<00:00:23.130> restored<00:00:23.310> but

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
basically when the car was restored but

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.689 
basically when the car was restored but
had<00:00:24.029> never<00:00:24.269> been<00:00:24.449> charged<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:28.519> should<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
had never been charged so should be a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.049 
had never been charged so should be a
fairly<00:00:30.000> simple<00:00:30.300> procedure<00:00:31.460> but<00:00:34.820> one<00:00:35.820> thing

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
fairly simple procedure but one thing

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.940 
fairly simple procedure but one thing
that<00:00:36.090> I've<00:00:36.270> noticed<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> compressor

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that I've noticed is on the compressor

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.389 
that I've noticed is on the compressor
here<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.120> there<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.739> good<00:00:41.160> deal

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
here you can see there is a good deal

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.529 
here you can see there is a good deal
amount<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.850> oil<00:00:42.469> around<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.510> inlet<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
amount of oil around the inlet and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.130 
amount of oil around the inlet and
outlet<00:00:46.079> ports<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.670> we're<00:00:48.480> gonna<00:00:48.629> pull<00:00:48.930> those

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
outlet ports so we're gonna pull those

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.430 
outlet ports so we're gonna pull those
off<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.890> change<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> o-rings<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
off and change the o-rings in there and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.080 
off and change the o-rings in there and
the<00:00:53.190> other<00:00:53.430> issue<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.719> had<00:00:54.930> seen<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:56.090> since

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the other issue that I had seen is since

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.779 
the other issue that I had seen is since
this<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> factory<00:00:58.350> installation<00:00:59.340> this

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
this is not a factory installation this

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.119 
this is not a factory installation this
is<00:00:59.850> an<00:01:00.059> aftermarket<00:01:00.710> installation<00:01:01.710> installed

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
is an aftermarket installation installed

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.660 
is an aftermarket installation installed
when<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> car<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.719> bought<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.810> there's<00:01:07.140> no

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
when the car was bought so there's no

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.320 
when the car was bought so there's no
information<00:01:08.670> about<00:01:08.960> refrigerant<00:01:09.960> level<00:01:10.439> or

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
information about refrigerant level or

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.320 
information about refrigerant level or
refrigerant<00:01:12.330> weight<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.990> anything<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.610> we're

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
refrigerant weight or anything so we're

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.960 
refrigerant weight or anything so we're
just<00:01:15.360> gonna<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> guess<00:01:16.320> at<00:01:16.680> it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
just gonna have to guess at it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.310 
just gonna have to guess at it
luckily<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:20.659> evaporator<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:21.960> installed

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
luckily the evaporator that's installed

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.940 
luckily the evaporator that's installed
on<00:01:22.619> earth<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> evaporator<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:23.970> pit

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
on earth and not the evaporator it's pit

on earth and not the evaporator it's pit
receiver<00:01:25.950> dryer<00:01:26.930> does<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.920> sight<00:01:29.250> glass

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
receiver dryer does have a sight glass

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.410 
receiver dryer does have a sight glass
on<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.150> we'll<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.450> able<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.750> use<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:32.420> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
on it so we'll be able to use that the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.069 
on it so we'll be able to use that the
only<00:01:33.780> parts<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:35.030> made<00:01:36.030> lines<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:37.049> the

of<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.220> compressor<00:01:51.900> but<00:01:52.900> I<00:01:53.410> did<00:01:54.130> notice<00:01:54.340> on

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
of the compressor but I did notice on

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.210 
of the compressor but I did notice on
the<00:01:54.880> lines<00:01:55.120> on<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.630> receiver<00:01:56.110> dryer<00:01:56.620> there<00:01:57.100> is

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
the lines on the receiver dryer there is

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.600 
the lines on the receiver dryer there is
some<00:01:57.400> cracking<00:01:58.030> at<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.930> end<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.440> lines<00:02:00.070> I

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
some cracking at the end of the lines I

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.580 
some cracking at the end of the lines I
don't<00:02:00.670> know<00:02:00.880> if<00:02:00.940> you<00:02:01.090> can<00:02:01.240> see<00:02:01.480> that<00:02:01.750> or<00:02:02.020> not

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
don't know if you can see that or not

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.460 
don't know if you can see that or not
it<00:02:02.770> looks<00:02:03.010> like<00:02:03.160> it's<00:02:03.430> focusing<00:02:04.080> but<00:02:05.080> I'm

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
it looks like it's focusing but I'm

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.950 
it looks like it's focusing but I'm
hoping<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.190> that's<00:02:06.910> not<00:02:07.210> going<00:02:07.510> to<00:02:07.660> end<00:02:07.870> up

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
hoping that that's not going to end up

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.750 
hoping that that's not going to end up
causing<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.440> problem<00:02:08.979> but<00:02:09.460> if<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.630> does<00:02:10.840> well<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
causing a problem but if it does well it

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.980 
causing a problem but if it does well it
does<00:02:12.970> there's<00:02:13.240> not<00:02:13.390> much<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.690> can<00:02:13.750> do<00:02:13.960> about

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
does there's not much I can do about

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.160 
does there's not much I can do about
that<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> don't<00:02:14.590> have<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.890> replace<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.400> hoses

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
that I don't have to replace the hoses

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.170 
that I don't have to replace the hoses
but<00:02:17.430> let's<00:02:18.430> get

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
but let's get
