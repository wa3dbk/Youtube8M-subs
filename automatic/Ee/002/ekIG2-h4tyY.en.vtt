00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.370
 there is everybody knows sin city in this 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.049
 product for a new video is 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.080
 today make a video of it a little 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.750
 special since I'm going to show you a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.730
 glitch dance fifa ultimate team 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.930
 so it's a glitch that allows the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.580
 search where the player that one 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.470
 wish therefore ie if they have 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.740
 choose street seek a day is a form 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.570
 2d of a form to 9 2 games of ti and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.620
 when breaker the one we really want 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.480
 so for that you have to go in 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.270
 the concept team once in the team 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.230
 concept you choose a player follows 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.230
 you want so I chose 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.480
 several for example bruyn kart 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.820
 man of the match you press square 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.739
 thinks looking to play the boring player 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.070
 that these transfers there you have all 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.719
 players that match de bruyn 86 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.969
 so there are several 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.890
 Cloud you than them 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.370
 bruyne including 86 hockey none of the six 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.970
 other cards 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.130
 so now you have to be able to put 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.860
 the maximum price at the immediate purchase price 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.939
 or you put the style you want 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.290
 despite everything so you have to once 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.700
 did that you have to leave the team 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.740
 concept went to the market of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.439
 transfers and there you will see 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.390
 to appear a head of a character and 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.610
 that a shadow with marc and bruyn en 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.409
 below and there you go you can 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.950
 you see that if we launch the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.790
 research 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.000
 we only have debruyn in kart man of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.939
 the game no no normal breuil 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.820
 ifo quincy frien than the two brunettes in 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.270
 man of the match so that's great 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.450
 for the for the resale purchase for the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.329
 technique of 59 and especially for not getting 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.890
 get scammed if we buy it at the shot is 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.600
 one or two minutes we do not want 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.219
 to do all the pages so that's the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.100
 best way not to be done 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.420
 scammed and so where now we 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.759
 can put the immediate purchase price 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.469
 therefore only Swiss about 850 mm or 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.119
 so we will put 850000 credit and will 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.140
 show you that we can actually 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.140
 put the immediate purchase price 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.380
 eight hundred and fifty thousand here I run 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.360
 looking for him 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.110
 and there he offers me three cards one to 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.940
 1:51 840 to 860 so if you bah 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.540
 buy you take the one at 840 miles 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.920
 55 minutes left 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.200
 if you had started looking for 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.440
 debruyn without going through this technique 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.800
 in man of the match that would have given that 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.830
 wait kevin of bruyne there you would have 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.360
 you will pass knowing he was at 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.680
 the 55th minute would have done I have not 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.230
 how not to fast a lot because 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.620
 here I must within 5 pages and there are only 4 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.430
 minutes 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.780
 so it would have been long all these cons 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.269
 not dream especially someone happy 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.760
 maybe bought before you so here you go 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.410
 my little technique to find the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.660
 player that we want the if the 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.640
 whistle according to the oms a match always 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.120
 we want it will work soon be here 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:15.610
 everything is planned for tonight at 19 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.030
 hours so here are the guys the video gets 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.040
 completed 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.660
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.769
 not to let go of a like site and sin city 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.769
 chase everyone
