00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
little sizzles on them so I thought that

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.490 
little sizzles on them so I thought that
was<00:03:06.790> quite<00:03:06.970> appropriate<00:03:07.599> so<00:03:07.930> just<00:03:08.140> simply

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
was quite appropriate so just simply

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.300 
was quite appropriate so just simply
spoon<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.780> into<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:11.109> Sun<00:03:11.680> into<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:11.980> day<00:03:12.130> a

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
of any cream which is still quite

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.039 
of any cream which is still quite
difficult<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:37.000> could<00:03:37.150> pour<00:03:37.420> just<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.780> little

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
difficult you could pour just a little

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.550 
difficult you could pour just a little
bit<00:03:38.170> more<00:03:38.340> evaporated<00:03:39.340> milk<00:03:39.370> on<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.880> top<00:03:40.560> like

bit more evaporated milk on the top like

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.099 
bit more evaporated milk on the top like
that<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.850> just<00:03:43.180> makes<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.630> a<00:03:43.660> perfect

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
that and that just makes it a perfect
