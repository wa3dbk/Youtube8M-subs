00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 good the chamber of deputies approved and 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.640
 sent to the Senate the project that 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.350
 reform the fishing law but the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.300
 initiative establishes concessions to 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.740
 perpetuity and that the catch quotas 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.990
 be fixed by eight committees 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.059
 fishing technical scientists are going to 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.770
 ask for more details that I proved accurate 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.580
 with whom with catalina still out 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.439
 Taste these layers with the German wave 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.289
 hello good morning for camera 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.199
 deputies approved in particular and also 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.640
 in general this fishing bill 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.030
 that has not been exempt from controversy 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.530
 He entered the congress on December 14 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.320
 from last year of 2011 there was much much 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.270
 conflict around this was very 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.879
 criticized by artisanal fishermen 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.070
 but finally and he was approved in the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.590
 camera now a new step in the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.390
 Senate the project was not as bad as 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.370
 it seemed the economy minister said 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.890
 Pablo Longueira after he left 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.270
 approved something that is celebrated in the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.280
 government and for that we are with the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.590
 undersecretary of fishing pablo galilea very 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.049
 good morning good morning good morning 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.760
 paola hermann we are indeed 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.980
 happy because yesterday we saw 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.110
 is relevant in the processing of this 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.970
 important law remember that fishing 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.910
 it's an economic sector that had more than 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.850
 130 thousand families in Chile 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.220
 and we achieved that a large part of the project 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.980
 be approved with a broad majority 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.460
 Carlos deep in parliamentarians in 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.660
 the need to get close to 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.820
 that management decisions 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.070
 fishing is more based on aspects 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.140
 biological and scientific and away a 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.540
 little of political issues many times 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.160
 the year of elections in the fish 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.840
 to win the votes, the 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.090
 quotas and we believe that that has taken us 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.530
 that the vast majority of fisheries 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.930
 is in a critical state and therefore 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.090
 the creation of scientific committees 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.440
 that required a high quorum that they are going to 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.940
 make him definitively those that are going to 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.340
 recommend the main measures of 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.460
 administration is a big step but 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.830
 In addition they are also complicated law 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.930
 undersecretary how can we explain in 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.840
 simple that what you celebrate of 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.540
 this approval in the lower house when 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.340
 we celebrate first the agreement that 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.590
 managed at the table that a little the minister 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.550
 longueira and that was also very criticized 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.350
 that nobody believed that 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.790
 possible that between industrial and 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.440
 craftsmen will reach an agreement on 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.080
 fractionation matter that 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.240
 we celebrate that 34 million dollars at 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.830
 year are transferred from the industry to 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.620
 artisanal fishermen so that 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.090
 handicrafts in Chile that are the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.010
 they need resources to be able to 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.460
 develop can count on more 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.280
 fishing resources we celebrate that 90% 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.960
 the artisanal fishermen of the 83,000 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.630
 that exist in those who are going to leave 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.250
 the first mile exclusive to them and 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.720
 this will also build the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.160
 sustainability of the resource that is 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.530
 precisely the first mile where 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.870
 many fisheries resources reproduce 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.420
 and the first mile is going to be just for 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.430
 we also celebrate improving the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.320
 audit where the camera understood 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.360
 that artisanal fishermen 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.400
 medium and large size will incorporate the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.220
 satellite positioner to be able 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.540
 also certify catches the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.950
 capture certification of others 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.580
 elements that we consider 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.790
 important then we also celebrate that 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.340
 You no longer exempt from payment of patent 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.500
 to the artisanal petals in relation to 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.970
 the management areas we celebrate the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.320
 obligation that they can 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.180
 with life insurance in our 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.070
 artisanal fishermen there are many points 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.450
 that a secretary is very favorable 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.770
 but there is an indication that you 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.450
 they replied that it has to see exactly 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.430
 with the bids on the quotas of 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.000
 fishing that was rejected are going to exist 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.580
 with this in the senate and good as well as 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.380
 we have to break with the myth that the 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.170
 artisanal fishing is going to end with 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.880
 this law we have to break also with 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.560
 the other myth that the government wanted 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.480
 little less than closing for a few 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.450
 families that have developed let's say it 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.500
 the industry for more than 60 years in 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.780
 kiel and they have worked 50 thousand people 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.790
 and we have to say let's say that 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.800
 We regret that the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.840
 indication that we proposed in 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.459
 relation to the tender that was a 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.080
 opening mechanism for them to enter 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.090
 new actors so that there is a 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.280
 greater competition so that there is more 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.470
 economic efficiency plus stability in 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.690
 employment but that we will replace it in 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.970
 the senate and I'm sure we're going to 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.340
 incorporate the tender as well as in 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.489
 the issue of tradable licenses of 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.750
 fishing where we picked 100% 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.430
 of what the court of the free 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.580
 competition here 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.620
 economics of the country that pointed us to 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.539
 make the fees more transferable 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.220
 divisible and also that way can 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.500
 enter new players in the sector 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.940
 industrialist of the country his secretary said 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.660
 I in the presentation that this project 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.460
 has generated much controversy 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.229
 mainly among fishermen 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.300
 craftsmen who have even come to 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.759
 say that they are with this could be finished 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.590
 artisanal fishing about 83,000 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.289
 artisanal fishermen how will they be 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.229
 them if this project is approved as 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.860
 you hope they are going to stay very much 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.599
 better and as they are today than any sector 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.490
 of the economy is guaranteed by law 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.440
 that 55 percent of resources goes to 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.210
 be for the little ones and precisely 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.620
 for artisanal miners 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.509
 surely they would like to have the 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.250
 possibility of bringing 55 percent 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.020
 of copper and guaranteed by good law 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.570
 that's going to happen with this project in the 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.479
 artisanal fishing and already noted let's say 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.710
 that many of the subjects that are 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.830
 they approved yesterday they have a live 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.360
 benefits for artisanal fisheries are not 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.669
 artisanal fishing goes on while 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.620
 fishery resources because there also 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.380
 are guaranteed by law and the base 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.120
 fundamental pillar of this project is the 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.340
 careful the fishery of the sustains 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.500
 to the recovery of it and so 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.540
 We are both safe 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.610
 that we are doing a very good law 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.260
 fishing for chile and because there was so much 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.580
 conflict then a secretary like that 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.620
 can understand that they will stay better 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.330
 positioned they believe that this is 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.460
 benefiting the industrialists in 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.380
 detriment of the possibilities that 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.960
 they can have good there are several 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.639
 reasons the first giorgio here and the 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.960
 detractors who have interests 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.550
 political electoral politicians 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.340
 remember that this election year 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.460
 and they have won a communication battle 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.320
 and where they have installed myths that are not 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.970
 certain or half truths have been told 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.520
 the half truths are also 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.460
 half lies and therefore there are 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.110
 a first one the second reason is that 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.699
 there is a sector effectively fishing 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.100
 craft that requires greater 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.900
 inspection that is the one that is the 50 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.220
 percent of the fishery landings 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:26.669
 in Chile they are barely 10 percent of 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:29.460
 the fishermen of the country what you need 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:32.009
 in greater oversight and obviously 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.330
 and they are a little unhappy because they 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.440
 will force him already said to the 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.330
 integration of positioners 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.759
 satellite capture certification 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.410
 the patent payment remember let's say 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.259
 that a small carnival a small 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.479
 merchant pays a patent and in some 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:47.220
 artisanal fisheries sector are 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:49.080
 bigger ones did not pay patent today 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:52.770
 they will be forced and there is a reason 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.389
 of dissatisfaction his secretary the bancada 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.580
 deputy a socialist party said that 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.770
 was going to go to the constitutional court 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.509
 because they believe that this law this 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.060
 bill lasts the constitution to 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:05.160
 not guarantee that the resources of the sea 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.590
 they belong to all citizens as 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.060
 you receive that they are in their 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.699
 legitimate rights we are 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.320
 absolutely convinced that we 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:16.139
 we are making a law absolutely 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.380
 attached to the constitution and the law and 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:20.849
 the fish are red cores this means 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.250
 that the fish are nobody's 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.530
 while nobody fishes them and therefore 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.440
 the pretension of the socialist party of 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.870
 nationalize fishery resources is a 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.550
 something that we do not doctrinately 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.510
 we understand we think it's not convenient 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.510
 for him
