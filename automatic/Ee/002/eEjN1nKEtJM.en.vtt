00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
mechanics that just keep the gameplay

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.200

sucks<00:04:37.510> is<00:04:37.840> when<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.139> game<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:39.160> have<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.550> go

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
sucks is when a game you have to go

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.400 
sucks is when a game you have to go
through<00:04:40.000> their<00:04:40.180> boring<00:04:40.570> parts<00:04:41.050> of<00:04:41.139> the<00:04:41.260> game

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410

through their boring parts of the game
and<00:04:41.740> I<00:04:41.979> feel<00:04:42.160> like<00:04:42.280> that<00:04:42.400> will<00:04:42.520> be<00:04:42.639> more<00:04:42.820> easily

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
and I feel like that will be more easily
