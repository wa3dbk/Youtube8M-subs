 hello youtube friends in this video les 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.470
 I will teach how to wash your bottle without 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.059
 need to use this that is for 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.940
 steal bottles are not going to 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.400
 need what they will need is a 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.400
 I'm going to use this one if you do not have 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.070
 a stick a pencil that you do not use your soap 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.320
 to wash dishes a sponge I'll 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.510
 I recommend it to be one of these and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.099
 they had their and taking advantage if they want 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.590
 leave me in the comments if you want 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.470
 to teach them how to cover their bottle 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 and how can you see what I'm squeezing and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.520
 nothing comes out and as you can see my 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.520
 experience 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.269
 the nursery has nothing, I'm going to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.269
 flip again 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.410
 and it's already out 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.880
 is that it's a trick that I just 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.680
 discover if they want to leave me in the 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.650
 comments if you want them to be taught 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.100
 taking advantage of a health with so much magna 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.720
 that today is your birthday good I'll 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.240
 I say that you have a good time in your 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.580
 birthday and give you many gifts and 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.060
 that you keep serving many more years 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.810
 good greetings are going to start 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.810
 I raise with water 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.700
 and a little soap 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:22.200
 Now he taught them 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.200
 they are going to throw me out of their soap 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.430
 and since they have thrown him 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.180
 and they are going to visit him 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.409
 and this is so that he does not bet anymore 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.409
 Then they go pouring water well 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.820
 perennial here I will make a cut 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.600
 after his sponge I told them that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.420
 they needed and they're going to put it 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.770
 A) Yes 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.109
 ace 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.390
 and then with his little stick that said 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.929
 they were going to need they are going to start carving 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.450
 all the bottle so it's the same as 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.959
 with which were the bottles how 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.959
 it's called 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.900
 and since you think it 's clean 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.489
 through the water 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.840
 again here I will make other cuts 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.840
 for the most part 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.130
 and it is that it has left milk 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.520
 having 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.190
 now let's wash this part 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.249
 I recommend you better hit it 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.710
 and since they have it that way 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.050
 d 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.050
 to 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.930
 and it's not worth it 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.240
 i 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.240
 more 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.740
 the reason but in the middle 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.739
 also the vibrations that go to 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.069
 need a towel for the towel they go to 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.670
 accept this if you prefer they can 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.329
 wait for it to dry but if you want 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.329
 they can dry it 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.800
 and I'm ready 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.389
 ready now with a towel Havana 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:19.419
 near the level they will dry it and go to 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.870
 put the towel to clean it by 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.870
 inside 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.669
 wait until you put it 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.120
 here I will make a cut 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.949
 since the tea more or less so like 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.800
 with the same stick they will do when 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.020
 make him towards the towel until he is in 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.960
 dry tone 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.470
 good life of broke, try not to 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.470
 break 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.940
 good and so you have to be ready and 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:57.150
 good since it is dry they are going to put here 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:05:00.780
 I'm a little bread and they're going to do it 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.060
 and ready, remember that if you want them 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.060
 teach how it was that I covered it 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.910
 teach in the introduction you want to teach 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.130
 the principle leave less comments and 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.350
 if they want to reach twin challenges 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.120
 count is good there is only one idea that is 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.830
 it happened to me if you want to inform in the 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.200
 I comment I hope you liked it already 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.870
