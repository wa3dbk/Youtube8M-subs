 Hello everyone today, June 19 and this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.340

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.340
 its new flagship lg g3 Ukraine 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.020
 dji decided to emphasize 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.820
 and in the title gets to highlight his three 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.129
 key strengths 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.129
 camera screen design 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.010
 the main innovation in the screen in lgd has become 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.949
 the fact that he got permission kwan hd and 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.290
 matrix and ps respectively on this 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.360
 The booth presents the lg g3 screen and 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.250
 other leading smartphone now we 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.670
 try to show you the difference 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.670
 in them 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.210
 since the improved camera has become one of 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.210
 accents presentation lg g3 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.870
 we decided to check and compare scanners lg 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.000
 g2 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.670
 we will take pictures in the same conditions 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.890
 and with the same settings and lay them out 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.230
 network and you can clearly see in 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.230
 how much the quality has changed 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.200
 There is no a laser disc to track 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.990
 deduce go absolutely exit because 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.180
 he is visible range 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.130
 need still not constantly being watched 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.130
 it does well anyway too 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.500
 chained over 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.460
 there poster tubes light and sung to him 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.190
 can be more 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.400
 no way this i forget anything 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.400
 me 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:30.030
 I would like to see how it works as a 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.470
 could be winter 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.470
 but no, they wo nâ€™t give me 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.140
 this 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.170
 here's the g3 keyboard work hard 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.850
 now you can for example adjust 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.850
 keyboard height 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.730
 very convenient for those with fingers 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.530
 more who is smaller and who needs 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.330
 more screen see another one 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.040
 innovation is now for 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.900
 you do not need to edit the text 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.970
 reach for the window in which she 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.190
 is displayed 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.880
 just hold the space bar and 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.560
 move left and right 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.360
 move the cursor over the last phrase 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.810
 which will appear immediately above your 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.810
 keyboard 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.910
 these were highlights from Kiev 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.490
 presentations of lg g3 which attracted our 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.740
 attention also we still have a record with 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.320
 London presentation and even can for 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.360
 but the most complete information you get 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.610
 from our review which will be like 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.470
 only we will get a smartphone for a test drive 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.470
