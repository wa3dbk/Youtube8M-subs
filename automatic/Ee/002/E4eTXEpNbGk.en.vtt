two<00:00:20.460> drives<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.880> compare<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:21.720> to

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
two drives to compare but it's just to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.259

at<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> time<00:00:27.109> with<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.289> if<00:00:28.410> you're

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
at the time with that if you're

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.529 
at the time with that if you're
switching<00:00:28.830> from<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.099> mechanical<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.939> an<00:00:30.060> SSD

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
drives at this price point say from

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.979 
drives at this price point say from
crucial<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.340> other<00:00:44.460> makers<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.210> may

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
crucial and other makers like that may

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.100 
crucial and other makers like that may
have<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.800> higher<00:00:47.520> read<00:00:47.850> speed<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:48.629> where<00:00:48.899> the

have a higher read speed but where the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.220 
have a higher read speed but where the
840<00:00:49.590> pro<00:00:49.710> definitely<00:00:50.960> beats<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> other

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
in right speed the next thing I wanted

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.990 
in right speed the next thing I wanted
to<00:01:07.680> talk<00:01:07.890> about<00:01:07.950> real<00:01:08.340> quick<00:01:08.549> was<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
to talk about real quick was the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.910 
to talk about real quick was the
software<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.020> comes<00:01:10.140> included<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.740> the

migration<00:01:17.340> software<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.030> include<00:01:18.950> has

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
migration software that they include has

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
migration software that they include has
a<00:01:19.979> lot<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.310> neat<00:01:20.729> features<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:21.840> thing

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
a lot of neat features but one thing

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.380 
a lot of neat features but one thing
that<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.350> definitely<00:01:22.860> tried<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.640> was<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.090> disk

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that I definitely tried out was the disk

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.950 
that I definitely tried out was the disk
cloning<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:26.159> wasn't<00:01:26.520> impressed<00:01:26.970> if

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
cloning and I just wasn't impressed if

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.380 
cloning and I just wasn't impressed if
you<00:01:28.020> click<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.500> disk<00:01:28.770> cloning<00:01:29.270> underneath<00:01:30.270> the

you click on disk cloning underneath the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.850 
you click on disk cloning underneath the
software<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.990> I'd<00:01:31.079> show<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.650> just

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
software and I'd show you but I just

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.050 
software and I'd show you but I just

drives at this price point the the cons
were<00:03:25.380> definitely<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.100> included<00:03:26.520> software<00:03:26.750> I

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
were definitely the included software I

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.810 
were definitely the included software I

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040

but the norton ghost mishap was just

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.080 
but the norton ghost mishap was just
something<00:03:45.510> kind<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.720> put<00:03:45.870> me<00:03:45.990> off<00:03:46.110> about<00:03:46.320> that

something kind of put me off about that

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.420 
something kind of put me off about that
