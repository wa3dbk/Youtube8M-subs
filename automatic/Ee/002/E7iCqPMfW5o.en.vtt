00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 19 German and welcome to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.790
 a new episode of the theke tutorials 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.189
 and today we take care of that 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.300
 recycler i have to say very briefly beforehand 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.730
 yes i have a lot of tutorial 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.560
 suggestions come in but the come 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.760
 also guaranteed 1 i have now in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.380
 the last episode already made 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.300
 there are still some coming now 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.439
 but the next ones will follow this recycler 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.939
 because I did that last time 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.750
 had to go now if necessary 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.060
 we show here 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.720
 and that's why we just take care of it 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.940
 once very fast and recycler and yes 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.399
 first quite blunt as power animal 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.469
 you need six stones 11 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.570
 benefit that is if your iron stream 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.000
 in the oven does not matter which electric 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.340
 Front is or the normal oven under 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.210
 the blue electric oven two redstone 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:54.570
 63 copper a chandelier dust and dirt 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.539
 so or earth and that starts with that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.239
 First we make copper cable 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.879
 have six hits and three suitcases 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.720
 we will do six copper cables then 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.520
 we need another and two red 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.860
 be and already we have a electric 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 circus then we make ourselves one 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.619
 machines block out eight more so and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.420
 then you need the six again 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.310
 Stones here are the way to go 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.750
 the complete electrics circuit and here 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.020
 the machines block and that way around 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.729
 and already have a compressor and the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.460
 completely here comes in the above 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.960
 Light stone dust Dirt comes here 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.610
 and here and then just once 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.840
 the corners find the clock and already 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.490
 we have one of the recycler he is 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.780
 not compatible with 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 So he has so first how can you do that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.540
 say he is not suitable for 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.229
 home improvement and midfield not synonymous 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.780
 absolutely and that's why I just say 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:59.670
 use a black box with low 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.100
 voltage and can contact us here the recycler 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.780
 grow and then here, for example, does not matter 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.700
 what do directly to such a 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.560
 It does not matter which object I know 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.390
 Not 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.310
 that's why it works 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.230
 I'll wait with everything now 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:22.750
 a little more has made one more 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:28.010
 Here is a script already looking upside down 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:31.069
 what so you can really everything in it 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.750
 even because I have to do that like this 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.030
 here, for example, for rest flow in 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.680
 do not really do anything with it 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.660
 how can I get in here? 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.040
 he transforms into every item 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.200
 Somehow what she got in and out and 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.970
 javascript what can you trap out of everything 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.530
 do everything what the recycler is 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.690
 scrap I can come here 800 times 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.400
 he can work with eight 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.900
 I can be one again 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.709
 the crane do as you see it then 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.709
 little faster 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.609
 so what you can do with scrap everything 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.719
 We now wait just once a 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:11.239
 have a little more eleven times 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:13.849
 now we come here for example 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.650
 make a red box i do not know 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.700
 directly if that makes sense now 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.040
 to make scrapbook 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.359
 I can do it often with creative mode 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.109
 I often want to use it there then comes 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:26.590
 somehow item out that 's mostly 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.639
 nothing is valuable 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.829
 I had never really what 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:37.189
 is valuable 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:39.739
 the stupid thing is that there is one 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:44.139
 is quantitative came out that dummheit 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:48.739
 that you always when I have it 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:50.239
 right if I'm normal there 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.370
 can I use them once coming 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.540
 only one item out so you can 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.579
 imagine such a lottery or like that 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.879
 so much sometimes very funny at all 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.579
 this is worth it later would be on 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.680
 any case worth the take in the grave 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.330
 I pay now he's back everything 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.490
 everything 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:15.050
 would be worthwhile later in any case 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:19.130
 to take the spread and put it in one 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.590
 mass makes you look comes the 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.660
 kicked off yes or so and he works 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:29.150
 I can guarantee much faster 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.200
 Again, do a script in here like this and 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.970
 already is a little something again 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.400
 I could theoretically happen now 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.120
 I was able to do so much mist here 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.120
 So do it 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.350
 so we have off again and then 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.120
 Let's just do it again, you see 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.220
 works much faster 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.660
 julietta, in turn, I believe 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.310
 already explained I say now anyway 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.920
 again with the artificially 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.480
 things make diamonds for example 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.690
 Of course you need new ones for that 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.460
 pieces or stones or anything 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.410
 Actually, there are many recipes like that 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.490
 was everything I have myself 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.590
 extra soon which a few more now 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.060
 make shots more I have to hope 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.430
 Everything was understandable if someone else 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.770
 could ask as I said ask 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.350
 or even make suggestions yourself 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.730
 hopefully not too many because yes 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.340
 that's a bit fierce though 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.840
 nevertheless, somehow it gets already 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.200
 maybe even today but everything 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.130
 well 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.130
 See you
