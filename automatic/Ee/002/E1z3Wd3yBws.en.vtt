00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.339 

it's<00:00:11.849> really<00:00:12.120> nothing<00:00:12.360> wrong<00:00:12.719> with<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.110> I

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
it's really nothing wrong with that I

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.110 
it's really nothing wrong with that I
just<00:00:13.620> don't<00:00:13.740> like<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.009> when<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.429> oil<00:00:14.460> mixes

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
just don't like it when the oil mixes

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.200 
just don't like it when the oil mixes
with<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.450> charcoal<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.080> easier<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.710> work

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
with the charcoal it's easier to work

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.870 
with the charcoal it's easier to work
when<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.480> use<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.260> paper<00:00:19.710> product<00:00:20.189> if<00:00:20.670> you

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
when I use that paper product if you

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.820 
when I use that paper product if you
don't<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> blending<00:00:21.930> stump<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.619> roll

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
don't have a blending stump you can roll

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.349 
don't have a blending stump you can roll
up<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.160> piece<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.460> think<00:00:23.640> I'm<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.090> do<00:00:24.210> is

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
up a piece I think I'm going to do is

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.269 
up a piece I think I'm going to do is
I'm<00:00:24.449> going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> look<00:00:24.750> at<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.140> top<00:00:25.619> eyelid<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
I'm going to look at the top eyelid and

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.640 
I'm going to look at the top eyelid and
the<00:00:26.369> bottom<00:00:26.730> eyelid<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.300> work<00:00:27.510> from<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.019> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the bottom eyelid and work from that and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.960 
the bottom eyelid and work from that and
I'm<00:00:28.710> going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:28.980> drawing<00:00:29.160> pretty<00:00:29.550> loosely

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
I'm going to be drawing pretty loosely

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.939 
I'm going to be drawing pretty loosely
here<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:30.510> my<00:00:30.660> charcoal<00:00:31.080> pencil<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> begin

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
here with my charcoal pencil to begin

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.610 
here with my charcoal pencil to begin
with<00:00:32.130> diagonal<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.149> happens<00:00:33.660> there<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.500> I'm

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
with diagonal that happens there so I'm

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.880 
with diagonal that happens there so I'm
going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.800> try<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> create<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:36.210> slight

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
going to try to create that slight

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.510 
going to try to create that slight
diagonal<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.190> create<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> drawing<00:00:39.180> here

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
diagonal when I create the drawing here

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.380 
diagonal when I create the drawing here
so<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.700> will<00:00:41.850> help<00:00:41.940> me<00:00:42.120> keep<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
so that will help me keep the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.860 
so that will help me keep the
relationships<00:00:43.260> about<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:44.480> they<00:00:45.480> go<00:00:45.629> ahead

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
relationships about right they go ahead

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.990 
relationships about right they go ahead
and<00:00:46.079> look<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> pupil<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.190> I'm<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and look at the pupil and I'm going to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.790 
and look at the pupil and I'm going to
go<00:00:48.120> ahead<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.480> draw<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> shape<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
go ahead and draw the shape for that and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
go ahead and draw the shape for that and
again<00:00:50.039> that's<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.579> circle<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
again that's going to be a circle on the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.299 
again that's going to be a circle on the
inside<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.379> pupil<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
inside and the pupil is going to be the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.459 
inside and the pupil is going to be the
darkest<00:00:53.789> bar<00:00:54.449> go<00:00:54.600> ahead<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.020> start<00:00:55.260> adding

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
darkest bar go ahead and start adding

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.250 
darkest bar go ahead and start adding
value<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:57.149> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.449> let<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.809> pretty

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
value here I'm going to let it be pretty

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.880 
value here I'm going to let it be pretty
dark<00:00:59.359> but<00:01:00.359> I'm<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.989> careful<00:01:01.559> where

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
dark but I'm going to be careful where

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.010 
dark but I'm going to be careful where
my<00:01:02.100> thumb<00:01:02.309> out<00:01:02.340> from<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.870> pupil<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.720> again

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
my thumb out from the pupil and again

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.100 
my thumb out from the pupil and again
I'm<00:01:07.170> looking<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:08.150> stages<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.600> Oracle<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
I'm looking at my stages that Oracle is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.850 
I'm looking at my stages that Oracle is
a<00:01:10.140> loose<00:01:10.500> medium<00:01:12.170> what<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> mean<00:01:13.409> by<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
a loose medium what I mean by that is

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.719 
a loose medium what I mean by that is
not<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.210> can't<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.259> touch<00:01:16.729> I

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
not that you can't get really touch I

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.510 
not that you can't get really touch I
want<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.360> layers<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.960> smooth<00:01:19.860> texture

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
want to have layers of smooth texture

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.440 
want to have layers of smooth texture
and<00:01:21.170> not<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.470> smooth<00:01:22.830> texture<00:01:23.430> darker<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
and not so smooth texture darker in the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.140 
and not so smooth texture darker in the
center<00:01:25.130> it's<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.430> bit<00:01:26.549> lighter<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
center it's a little bit lighter on the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.219 
center it's a little bit lighter on the
outside<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.960> gets<00:01:28.020> darker<00:01:28.409> again

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
outside and then it gets darker again

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.219 
outside and then it gets darker again
hit<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:31.740> white<00:01:32.189> charcoal<00:01:33.229> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
hit this with some white charcoal and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.450 
hit this with some white charcoal and
what<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.860> about<00:01:34.979> white<00:01:35.340> charcoal<00:01:35.850> in

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.310 

drawing<00:01:41.460> an<00:01:41.549> eye<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.939> want<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.450> we're

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
drawing an eye if you want to we're

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
drawing an eye if you want to we're
still<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.939> going<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
still in the going a little bit as a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.470 
still in the going a little bit as a
slightly<00:01:46.079> different<00:01:46.380> direction

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.570 

I'm<00:01:50.140> going<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.500> opposite<00:01:50.980> direction<00:01:51.040> a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
I'm going the opposite direction a

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.930 
I'm going the opposite direction a
little<00:01:51.670> bit<00:01:51.910> here<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.920> just<00:01:54.190> like<00:01:54.730> that

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
little bit here and just like that

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.740 
little bit here and just like that
because<00:01:55.180> remember<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.880> eye<00:01:57.910> I'm<00:01:58.270> drawing<00:01:58.600> you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
because remember the eye I'm drawing you

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.590 
because remember the eye I'm drawing you
can<00:01:58.900> see<00:01:59.230> white<00:02:00.010> underneath<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.850> iris<00:02:01.420> and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
can see white underneath the iris and

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.310 
can see white underneath the iris and
people<00:02:03.270> begin<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.450> side<00:02:04.690> of<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.900> eye<00:02:04.930> needs

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
people begin the side of the eye needs

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.520 
people begin the side of the eye needs
to<00:02:05.530> be<00:02:06.570> considerably<00:02:07.570> darker<00:02:07.780> in<00:02:08.050> value<00:02:08.080> that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
to be considerably darker in value that

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.260 
to be considerably darker in value that
is<00:02:08.710> a<00:02:08.740> little<00:02:09.190> bit<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.460> a<00:02:09.550> highlight<00:02:09.760> right

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
is a little bit of a highlight right

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.610 
is a little bit of a highlight right
here<00:02:10.540> because<00:02:10.750> there<00:02:10.930> is<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.050> little<00:02:11.290> bit<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.560> a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
here because there is a little bit of a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.010 
here because there is a little bit of a
highlight<00:02:12.010> on<00:02:12.420> there<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.570> this<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:13.840> going<00:02:13.960> to

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
highlight on there and this is going to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
and we'll go ahead and start making some

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.760 
and we'll go ahead and start making some
of<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.590> dark<00:02:20.830> values<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.400> exist<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.530> top

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
of the dark values that exist the top

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.400 
of the dark values that exist the top
portion<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.310> eyelid

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.550 

bottom<00:02:31.310> portion<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.820> eye<00:02:32.470> there's<00:02:33.470> a

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
bottom portion of the eye there's a

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.680 
bottom portion of the eye there's a
little<00:02:34.370> piece<00:02:34.490> of<00:02:34.670> skin<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:34.970> kind<00:02:35.300> of<00:02:35.420> sticks

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
little piece of skin that kind of sticks

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.620 
little piece of skin that kind of sticks
out<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:37.490> then<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.730> gets<00:02:37.910> dark<00:02:38.270> right

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
out and then it gets dark right

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.770 
out and then it gets dark right
underneath<00:02:38.960> that<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:41.090> I'm<00:02:41.330> going<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.540> leave<00:02:41.660> it

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
underneath that so I'm going to leave it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.650 
underneath that so I'm going to leave it
what's<00:02:41.960> going<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.200> quickly<00:02:42.560> add<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.480> little<00:02:44.480> bit

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
what's going to quickly add a little bit

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.320 
what's going to quickly add a little bit
of<00:02:44.930> value<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.950> orbital<00:02:46.790> lobe<00:02:47.030> which<00:02:47.300> is

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
of value to the orbital lobe which is

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.960 
of value to the orbital lobe which is
where<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:48.010> even<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.130> material<00:02:49.580> right<00:02:49.760> on<00:02:49.880> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
where the even the material right on the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.670 
where the even the material right on the
surface

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
surface

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.500 
surface
but<00:02:51.680> it's<00:02:52.010> kind<00:02:52.220> of<00:02:52.250> like<00:02:52.340> drawing<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:53.390> is

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
but it's kind of like drawing it is

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.750 
but it's kind of like drawing it is
drawing<00:02:54.070> so<00:02:55.070> that's<00:02:55.250> kind<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.460> what<00:02:55.610> I'm<00:02:55.730> doing

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
drawing so that's kind of what I'm doing

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.450 
drawing so that's kind of what I'm doing
right<00:02:56.150> now<00:02:56.210> I'm<00:02:56.510> looking<00:02:56.660> at<00:02:56.870> any<00:02:57.080> areas<00:02:57.560> that

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
right now I'm looking at any areas that

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.720 
right now I'm looking at any areas that
I'm<00:02:59.420> not<00:02:59.660> completely<00:03:00.410> satisfied<00:03:00.620> with<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.430> can

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
I'm not completely satisfied with I can

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.000 
I'm not completely satisfied with I can
go<00:03:01.850> back<00:03:02.120> here<00:03:02.660> trying<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.530> see<00:03:03.710> where<00:03:03.860> there's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
go back here trying to see where there's

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.160 
go back here trying to see where there's
contrast<00:03:04.490> between<00:03:04.610> light<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.000> dark<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:06.110> the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
contrast between light and dark and the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.600 
contrast between light and dark and the
light<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:06.470> dark<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:06.830> this<00:03:07.010> side<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.400> that's

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
light and dark on this side and that's

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.920 
light and dark on this side and that's
where<00:03:07.850> we're<00:03:07.940> going<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.120> make<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.420> eyelashes

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
where we're going to make the eyelashes

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.930 
where we're going to make the eyelashes
and<00:03:09.380> basically<00:03:09.890> I'm<00:03:10.040> gonna<00:03:10.160> make<00:03:10.310> check<00:03:10.610> marks

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
and basically I'm gonna make check marks

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.130 
and basically I'm gonna make check marks
in<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:13.670> case<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.180> eyelashes<00:03:14.690> are<00:03:14.810> starting

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
in this case the eyelashes are starting

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.010 
in this case the eyelashes are starting
to<00:03:15.230> point<00:03:15.410> straight<00:03:15.710> towards<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.160> viewer

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
to point straight towards the viewer

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.090 
to point straight towards the viewer
then<00:03:19.570> as<00:03:20.570> we<00:03:20.750> get<00:03:20.930> closer<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.770> center<00:03:22.070> of

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
then as we get closer to the center of

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.560 
then as we get closer to the center of
the<00:03:22.190> eye<00:03:22.220> they<00:03:22.670> get<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.970> get<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:23.240> little<00:03:23.270> bit

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
the eye they get to get it a little bit

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.180 
the eye they get to get it a little bit
longer

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.690 

alright<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:29.320> just<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.470> push<00:03:30.710> the<00:03:30.890> realism<00:03:31.250> one

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
alright and just to push the realism one

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.490 
alright and just to push the realism one
step<00:03:32.060> further<00:03:32.360> might<00:03:33.110> be<00:03:33.230> getting<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.470> little

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
step further might be getting a little

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.410 
step further might be getting a little
carried<00:03:33.890> away<00:03:34.130> here<00:03:34.340> remember<00:03:35.180> what<00:03:35.300> I<00:03:35.360> was
