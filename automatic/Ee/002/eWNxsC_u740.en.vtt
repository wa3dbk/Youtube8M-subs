well<00:00:57.030> let<00:00:57.180> me<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.320> some<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.649> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
features of Francesco Bernoulli as you

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.130 
features of Francesco Bernoulli as you
can<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:01.410> Francesco<00:01:02.010> Bernoulli<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.699> an

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
can see Francesco Bernoulli is an

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
can see Francesco Bernoulli is an

car beautifully modeled very flat so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.609 
car beautifully modeled very flat so
there<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.250> hardly<00:01:32.579> any<00:01:32.820> chance<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.810> i<00:01:34.110> mean
