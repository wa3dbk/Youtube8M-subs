00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.330
 hello very good everyone I'm sp 26 and 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.040
 welcome to this new tutorial in the 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.280
 I want to teach how to delete folders 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.830
 impossible to erase 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.230
 I already did a tutorial related to this 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.420
 topic previously enough 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.939
 time and good the tutorial had quite 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.169
 quite successful and with this tutorial what 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.029
 what I want to do is a small 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.369
 update of the video that I made 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.140
 previously that good equal of the game 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.960
 around here some miniature and others for 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.579
 that you can go to this tutorial and nothing 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.770
 people what we want to do is erase 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.350
 these folders that are impossible to 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.320
 erase that traumatize us and even we 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.440
 despair and that really we are 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.120
 they go a little crazy not then 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.780
 let's try just to try 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.640
 delete it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.249
 we give him a right button and I give him 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.159
 eliminate what we would all do 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:55.230
 as you see me jump this message this 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.269
 hateful message with which then I give 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.609
 try again I can give you one hundred thousand 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.899
 times and he's going to tell me that he does not 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.149
 going to erase is not going to tell me 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.010
 absolutely nothing and what we want 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.290
 make it obvious not to try 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.380
 delete them and I tell you is testing 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.510
 different things and really the only one 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.290
 it works is the one that I teach in the video 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.150
 I did a couple of years ago I think that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.980
 It is the only solution that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.890
 that I have found with this problem and 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.280
 Look, I used a lot of programs 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.590
 to try to delete this folder that does not 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.390
 that does not let you erase programs like a 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.340
 locker total commander was the being is not 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.040
 boot also in a safe mode and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.530
 boot with another operating system with 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.300
 ubuntu and I've tried to erase the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.970
 folder from there but it is impossible is 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.090
 a folder that I do not know for what it is not 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.409
 it is allowed to be erased and it is very complicated 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.249
 take out other 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.990
 other ways to erase the good 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:58.960
 so what are we going to do in this 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.750
 video I want to say before I start 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.509
 some of the reasons why it is 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.939
 possible that you can not erase it is the 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.500
 what to say are the causes more 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.780
 general and that usually happen to all the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.200
 world the first would be because the file 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.569
 or folder is being used by another 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.340
 system process ie the folder 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.530
 you have an open program and the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.239
 is using that program then 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.790
 we have that is the folder contains 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.040
 Hidden files or hidden folders 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.829
 then in this way we do not 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.480
 we can erase this this folder is not 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.640
 the agreement case is not the case 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.640
 then it is a folder simply 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.099
 empty and it does not let me erase what's worth 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.549
 then we have the system is infected 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.829
 by virus is a possible cause for the 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.900
 which we can not delete that folder that 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.620
 have some kind of virus and then that 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.290
 it would be a bigger problem 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.480
 another other cause would be that the file or 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.489
 folder is read-only and that's why 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.950
 we can delete it good in short 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.099
 there are endless causes that the hard drive 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.870
 well I do not know that it is defective or 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.490
 any story of those infinite 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.280
 Causes 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.750
 what we have here specifically is the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.580
 next that is a folder that does not 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.950
 we can brown because it does not have 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.990
 security properties then 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.120
 windows interprets that the folder is 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.920
 with the short name and we 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.440
 we try to delete it by default with the 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.720
 long name for it is necessary to know 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.160
 that the short name or that's why 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.320
 we have to know what is the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.170
 short name to be able to delete the 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.410
 folder is then said all this 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.710
 let's go to the solution to eliminate this 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.140
 desperate folder and what are we going to 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:44.640
 do is go here to start and 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.610
 we write ce md well these three letters 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.480
 we give in accordance will enter us to 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.040
 open the windows command console 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.860
 so I do not know it, it's how 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.660
 it would be ms 2 the old operating system 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.450
 of windows and nothing what we're going to do 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.070
 is the next thing we're going to direct 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.530
 where we have the folder the folder in 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.000
 this case we have it in scott's in 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.130
 the desk then we have to 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.900
 enter the following command already 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.700
 I say depending on where you have the 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.580
 folder are you going to have to 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.410
 to one place or another in this case I the 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.870
 I have on the desk and it's good 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.940
 principle rather easier then what 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.040
 what we have to do is the following 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.040
 give up space and we write 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.520
 which is in English desk we give 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.900
 enter and as you can see it says yes 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.860
 that right now we are in the 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.470
 Windows desktop is worth where you are 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.030
 seeing now is visualizing everything 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.680
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.840
 write the following command to see 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.270
 the properties that folders have 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.110
 and what we have on the desk 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.400
 we write the following days 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.870
 bar of 7 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.389
 x perfect we give the enter and good 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.340
 As you can see, I already appear here 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.620
 as you can see we have different directories 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.310
 and here we have tutorial and the name 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.380
 short is tutor and we have the symbol 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.810
 of infinity 1 as you see if the name of 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.270
 long is tutorial photoshop hop effect 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.310
 agree tutorial that I recommend for 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.740
 another on the other hand it's worth a tutorial 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.030
 that I was pretty good so that you 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.860
 I recommend that you see it is a tutorial 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.000
 of photoshop is worth what we want to do 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.320
 now it is to eliminate or eliminate what is 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.449
 the folder and we're going to do it from the 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.900
 next way we can not erase it 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:34.030
 entering the long name because 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.710
 that is, what does not understand windows with the 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.780
 short name not with the long name 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.330
 that is how everyone tries 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.919
 eliminate it with the long name so for 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.229
 defect then we have to delete it 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.930
 with the short name and we're going to make 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.699
 the following way we write ere of 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.150
 that would be the command to erase 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.940
 records 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.920
 then we would put the name on 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.240
 name as such in short agreement that 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.940
 will be right now 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.400
 underlining blinking whatever it is to 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.360
 that you see it better the name 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.360
 it would be you 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.380
 here and now we would put the infinity that 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.540
 is done by typing to the degree and 4 we give 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.420
 space puts me the infinity key the 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.980
 infinity symbol and one 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.050
 automatically when you click or enter 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.120
 I'm going to delete the folder agreement 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.340
 let's do it and see if it clears 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.840
 there we have it as current it has been 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.820
 Deleting the folder is the process or the 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.919
 easiest method to do it 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.260
 many people become very crazy to 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.729
 delete folders and well I the truth that 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.380
 I had some problem that another with 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.790
 this and the truth that then despair 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.460
 quite have a folder there that does not 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.440
 we can erase but as you see in the end 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.960
 it can be deleted and quite simple no 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.580
 you have to format the pc you do not have to 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.290
 go crazy just with these 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.600
 steps that we have made are going to be able to 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.880
 erase without using any kind of 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.710
 program any type of software so 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.199
 nothing people I hope so this tutorial 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.880
 I liked you, it has served you well 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.250
