 not crazy if you like the shape of the scale 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.510
 see see him a bit sporty 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.579
 orients between off best in a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.620
 slightly stooped posture you said no 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.160
 times at rows sport motorsport tours 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.140
 you can easily handle the engine 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.640
 visor is equipped with a tin loop spring 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.559
 on preparation these are the two 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.120
 dots that are in it like before you 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.979
 on the inside of extra visor can 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.330
 paste that causes this visor 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.710
 no longer covers 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.710
 so you can easily pull it out 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.280
 on the outside there is a 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.530
 anti scratch coating and on the inside 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.869
 is not an anti-fog coating because the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.400
 pin okay I should be able to film there 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.400
 and I also got back very easily 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.860
 it is also equipped with a sun visor 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.500
 very easy to operate 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.329
 the side are up there does it come 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.920
 sometimes that comes down too far 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.439
 enough down and through it 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.030
 nose cap you have when you bend over 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.299
 is actually not bothered by that sun either 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.950
 under it sometimes you see it comes through here 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.990
 closes and falls on a pan 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.329
 makes sure you get to the bottom and 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.439
 gets extra space at the top 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.450
 allowing the nice air in 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.740
 can it be a little warmer love both 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.079
 ventilation in the helmets are your eyes 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.759
 yet protected against the things that the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.290
 Helmet can fly when you get it all the way 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.360
 so we did close when it was raining 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.490
 it is fresh click you close it sucks 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.229
 completely stuck against the edge and is you 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.250
 he is also completely soundproof 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.130
 quieter from 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.570
 the ventilation at the front is the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.540
 adjust the red at the bottom 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.430
 Then slide left is open and right is 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.840
 close and at the top 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.220
 about two big air happers that 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.360
 easy to operate 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.850
 buttons easy to find with a 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.200
 glove air enters here and comes 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.860
 at the rear at the outlet again 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.510
 from 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.890
 you see the small spoiler makes sure 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.300
 that what under pressure on the back of 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.940
 each comes through which is really a warm one 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.550
 sucks air out of the helmet 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.630
 fit of this helmet is between round and 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.130
 in oval 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.360
 you have some rounder head you can do this too 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.270
 another 10 days by trying to explain 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.920
 oval oval shape and head you can also 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.270
 watching the ego gets a little longer 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.190
 stretched 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.250
 the lining is made of sweat and 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.040
 moisture transport material can go out completely 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.660
 and can also be washed 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.100
 the leak roll is also built into the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.280
 lining is you see when you see the lining 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.570
 look at the bottom a bit more 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.489
 walking inwards provides the term 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.680
 could n't have been difficult intent in it 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.209
 beginning but on the other hand, which closes 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.100
 therefore very well off with man along 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:10.260
 the neck ensures that the helmet also has something 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.640
 quieter, other side and bottom 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.980
 you are neatly finished with a leather 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.299
 leather material ensures that it is on 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.280
 sustainable that he tidy a little longer 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.220
 you remain solely jet liner is 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.540
 fixed with three in snaps 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.989
 then only have the inside cap out there 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.989
 still in it 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.620
 sitting at the front is the guy with 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.620
 to press 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.470
 at the edge of hell without you gone and 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.720
 make sure you don't get a pressure point 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.880
 I your forehead that I am also a tasty 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.740
 hand and if you look at the lining like that 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.180
 you know that there are many open areas 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.770
 but also easy due to the ventilation 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.540
 also comes to your head and to the 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.610
 back can also be removed 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.530
 and here the buttons where you see it 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.990
 for it is stuck in front of the eyebrows 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.490
 not at all on the forehead 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.350
 so then the inside of the helmet viewers 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.820
 we can clearly see the ventilation grooves 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.489
 so that the air can also move 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.050
