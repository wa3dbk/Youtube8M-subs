00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:05.250
 the grand prix of germany am 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.899
 nürburgring the ninth race of the season 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.960
 pirelli supplies the mixtures medium 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.550
 and soft the route is technical 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.930
 challenging with a wide range 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.930
 different curves 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.789
 at the many changes of direction 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.950
 high lateral forces arise 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.529
 Large amounts of energy through the tires 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.630
 conduct further stress such as hard 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.880
 braking maneuvers and frequent contact with 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.060
 The caps are typical of the track in 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.060
 the eifel 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.870
 it rains relatively often on nürburgring 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.910
 therefore, the track is mainly too 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.320
 beginning of the race weekend still pretty much 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.550
 Green only in the further course stores 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.620
 a rubber layer on the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.510
 ideal line from the rough asphalt and the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.760
 low temperatures lead to a 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.559
 quite strong wear of the tires 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.510
 remains rubber abrasion between the 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:07.060
 sticking stones of the asphalt surface 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.979
 and increases the grip of the mature abrasion 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.560
 can also strip in small rubber 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.710
 These will marbles so mumble 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.020
 called few grams are they easy 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.360
 often outside of curves or beside 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.360
 to see the ideal line in braking zones 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.190
 lose faster degrading tires 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.640
 more rubber in the form of marvel or as 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.640
 gumming 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.630
 the more downforce the asphalt picks up 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.430
 the higher the grip this allows 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.230
 but faster lap times are limited 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.370
 at the same time the abrasion and wear 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:52.080
 the tires will be the reason for this 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.000
 Data from the free trainings on 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.070
 friday during the weekend always 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.740
 again revised and updated 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.300
 because only the last data allow 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.020
 the precise development of the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.020
 race strategy
