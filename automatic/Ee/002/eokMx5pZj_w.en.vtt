00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
looking at them very quickly

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.340 
looking at them very quickly
side-by-side<00:00:50.989> there's<00:00:51.989> not<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> whole<00:00:52.320> lot

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
side-by-side there's not a whole lot

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.760

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
that's different between these two shoes

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.689 
that's different between these two shoes
especially<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> amount<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.460> price

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699

has<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> retail<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.879> around<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.300> hunt<00:01:00.480> $200<00:01:01.379> where

this<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.160> retails<00:01:02.520> closer<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.030> around<00:01:03.210> 120<00:01:03.780> so

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
this one retails closer to around 120 so

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.219

any differently at all and I would say

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.570 
any differently at all and I would say
that<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.790> fits<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.180> touch<00:01:18.720> narrower<00:01:19.490> but<00:01:20.490> they

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that it fits a touch narrower but they

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.980 
that it fits a touch narrower but they

are brand new and who's to say that they

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
are brand new and who's to say that they

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
or as high-quality as a predator LZ but

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.660 
or as high-quality as a predator LZ but
there's<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.500> huge<00:01:40.890> difference<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.520> I

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
there's not a huge difference like I

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.999 
there's not a huge difference like I
said<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.180> been<00:01:42.659> saying<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.890> can

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
said like I'm been saying here you can

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.109 
said like I'm been saying here you can
see<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> shapes<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.549> little<00:01:44.700> bit<00:01:44.790> off<00:01:44.909> it's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
see the shapes a little bit off it's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.580 
see the shapes a little bit off it's
like<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.420> said<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.750> not<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:46.079> high<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
like I said it's just not as high of a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.460 
like I said it's just not as high of a
quality<00:01:47.009> synthetic<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:48.409> definitely<00:01:49.409> not

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
quality synthetic but definitely not

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.380 
quality synthetic but definitely not
something<00:01:49.740> that's<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.979> major<00:01:50.460> drop-off<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
something that's a major drop-off and

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.539 
something that's a major drop-off and
that's<00:01:51.540> gonna<00:01:51.659> really<00:01:51.930> change<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:53.280> overall

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
that's gonna really change the overall

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.980 
that's gonna really change the overall
feel<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.149> shoe<00:01:54.329> other<00:01:54.570> than<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
feel of the shoe other than the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.510 
feel of the shoe other than the
thickness<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> which<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.920> guy<00:01:56.070> said<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
thickness of it which I guy said it's a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.499 
thickness of it which I guy said it's a
little<00:01:56.790> bit<00:01:56.909> thicker<00:01:57.090> than<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.420> would

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
little bit thicker than you would

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.450 
little bit thicker than you would
normally<00:01:57.600> get<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.500> far<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.890> lethal<00:01:59.070> zones

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
normally get as far as the lethal zones

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.980 
normally get as far as the lethal zones
are<00:01:59.640> concerned<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.450> particular<00:02:00.630> shoe

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
are concerned on this particular shoe

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.810 
are concerned on this particular shoe
that<00:02:01.200> they're<00:02:01.530> identical<00:02:01.680> they're<00:02:02.579> made<00:02:02.729> up

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
that they're identical they're made up

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.510 
that they're identical they're made up
of<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> same<00:02:03.420> rubber<00:02:04.100> position<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> same

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
of the same rubber position in the same

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.399 
of the same rubber position in the same
spot<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.390> there's<00:02:06.570> no<00:02:06.750> difference<00:02:06.930> there<00:02:07.290> at

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
spot so there's no difference there at

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.719 
spot so there's no difference there at
all<00:02:07.500> I'll<00:02:07.649> go<00:02:07.770> over<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> least<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> lethal

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
all I'll go over the least of the lethal

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
all I'll go over the least of the lethal
zones<00:02:08.940> really<00:02:09.149> really<00:02:09.420> quickly<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.500> if<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
zones really really quickly but if you

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.530 
zones really really quickly but if you
want<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> full<00:02:11.099> review<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.030> predator<00:02:12.510> LZ

from the predator LZ line is just a
extra<00:02:47.840> grip<00:02:48.079> on<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.439> ball<00:02:48.620> which<00:02:48.859> you<00:02:48.889> may<00:02:49.189> or

talk about that in the review and then

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.129 
talk about that in the review and then
of<00:02:52.730> course<00:02:52.909> you<00:02:53.000> have<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.359> pass<00:02:53.599> pad<00:02:53.900> on<00:02:54.049> the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
Incept which is again very City much

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.569 
Incept which is again very City much
exactly<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.959> same<00:02:57.049> as<00:02:57.200> Prairie<00:02:57.530> LZ<00:02:57.889> maybe<00:02:58.489> a

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
exactly the same as Prairie LZ maybe a

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.599 
exactly the same as Prairie LZ maybe a
little<00:02:59.030> bit<00:02:59.359> less<00:02:59.720> padded<00:03:00.349> but<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:01.430> still

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
that foam insert in the instep which

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.220 
that foam insert in the instep which
gives<00:03:04.099> a<00:03:04.189> shoe<00:03:04.370> slightly<00:03:04.849> padded<00:03:05.090> feel<00:03:05.480> when

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
gives a shoe slightly padded feel when

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.190 
gives a shoe slightly padded feel when

part of the foot but other than that you

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.940 
part of the foot but other than that you
have<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.629> same<00:03:11.810> external<00:03:12.260> internal<00:03:12.650> heel

have the same external internal heel

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.099 
have the same external internal heel
counter<00:03:13.159> here<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:13.970> have<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.209> same<00:03:14.510> synthetic

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109

suede<00:03:15.230> liner<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:16.340> insole<00:03:16.579> is<00:03:16.639> a<00:03:16.669> little<00:03:16.879> bit

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
suede liner the insole is a little bit

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.039 
suede liner the insole is a little bit
different<00:03:17.299> I'm<00:03:17.359> not<00:03:17.480> gonna<00:03:17.629> go<00:03:17.720> into<00:03:17.840> too<00:03:18.019> much

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
different I'm not gonna go into too much

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.960 
different I'm not gonna go into too much
detail<00:03:18.319> there<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:18.919> then<00:03:19.519> like<00:03:19.639> I<00:03:19.699> said<00:03:19.729> the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
detail there and then like I said the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.119 
detail there and then like I said the
fit<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.359> lacing<00:03:20.629> system<00:03:20.780> very<00:03:21.620> very<00:03:21.889> similar

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
fit and lacing system very very similar

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.649 
fit and lacing system very very similar
I<00:03:22.280> would<00:03:22.579> say<00:03:22.699> the<00:03:22.849> shoe<00:03:23.030> fits<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.389> touch

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 
I would say the shoe fits a touch

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.839 
I would say the shoe fits a touch
narrower<00:03:24.169> like<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.650> said<00:03:24.859> as<00:03:25.459> far<00:03:25.669> as<00:03:25.699> the

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
narrower like I said as far as the

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.930 
narrower like I said as far as the
soleplate<00:03:26.269> goes<00:03:27.159> while<00:03:28.159> it<00:03:28.310> appears<00:03:28.639> to<00:03:28.849> be

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
soleplate goes while it appears to be

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.879 
soleplate goes while it appears to be
pretty<00:03:29.150> much<00:03:29.269> exactly<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.900> same<00:03:30.109> it<00:03:30.379> is<00:03:30.739> a

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
pretty much exactly the same it is a

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.409 
pretty much exactly the same it is a
different<00:03:31.340> plastic<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:31.909> a<00:03:31.970> little<00:03:32.299> bit

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
different plastic it's a little bit

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.800 
different plastic it's a little bit
stiffer<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.760> but<00:03:34.760> overall<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.209> feels<00:03:35.540> not

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
stiffer and but overall the feels not

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.089 
stiffer and but overall the feels not
all<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.139> different<00:03:36.560> as<00:03:36.620> far<00:03:36.680> as<00:03:36.859> what<00:03:37.040> I

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
all that different as far as what I

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.640 
all that different as far as what I
could<00:03:37.250> tell<00:03:37.400> from<00:03:37.609> when<00:03:37.729> I<00:03:37.790> first<00:03:37.970> tried<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.359> on

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
could tell from when I first tried it on

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.809 
could tell from when I first tried it on
like<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.739> said<00:03:39.919> the<00:03:40.010> shape<00:03:40.190> is<00:03:40.310> very<00:03:40.340> much<00:03:40.669> the

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
like I said the shape is very much the

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.300 
like I said the shape is very much the
same<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.299> it's<00:03:42.229> still<00:03:42.470> my<00:03:42.590> coach<00:03:42.799> compatible

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
same and it's still my coach compatible

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.409 
same and it's still my coach compatible
as<00:03:43.370> well<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:43.669> if<00:03:43.729> you<00:03:43.790> do<00:03:43.879> have<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.090> microchip

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
as well so if you do have the microchip

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.119 
as well so if you do have the microchip
and<00:03:44.629> want<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:44.930> track<00:03:45.079> your<00:03:45.109> stats<00:03:45.379> you<00:03:46.099> can

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
and want to track your stats you can

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.110 
and want to track your stats you can
definitely<00:03:46.519> put<00:03:46.639> that<00:03:46.760> in<00:03:46.879> this<00:03:47.000> particular

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
definitely put that in this particular

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.360 
definitely put that in this particular
shoe<00:03:47.599> the<00:03:48.139> same<00:03:48.349> stud<00:03:48.560> pattern<00:03:48.709> is<00:03:49.010> still<00:03:49.190> here

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
shoe the same stud pattern is still here

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.640 
shoe the same stud pattern is still here
so<00:03:49.489> you<00:03:49.579> have<00:03:49.639> that<00:03:49.849> a<00:03:49.909> zero<00:03:50.389> 2.0<00:03:51.019> stud<00:03:51.290> pattern

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
so you have that a zero 2.0 stud pattern

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.500 
so you have that a zero 2.0 stud pattern
with<00:03:52.280> these<00:03:52.430> triangular<00:03:52.909> studs<00:03:53.120> which<00:03:53.329> kind

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
with these triangular studs which kind

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.119 
with these triangular studs which kind
of<00:03:53.569> give<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.840> combo<00:03:54.379> between<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.769> bladed

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
of give you that combo between a bladed

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.729 
of give you that combo between a bladed
and<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.549> conical<00:03:55.970> stud<00:03:56.209> in<00:03:56.329> terms<00:03:56.510> of<00:03:56.720> feel<00:03:56.900> it

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
and a conical stud in terms of feel it

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:58.899 
and a conical stud in terms of feel it
provides<00:03:58.040> pretty<00:03:58.250> good<00:03:58.430> traction<00:03:58.669> when

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
provides pretty good traction when

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:59.949 
provides pretty good traction when
pushing<00:03:59.120> off<00:03:59.329> but<00:03:59.510> you<00:03:59.569> still<00:03:59.599> have<00:03:59.810> pretty

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
pushing off but you still have pretty

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.899 
pushing off but you still have pretty
good<00:04:00.139> maneuverability<00:04:00.530> when<00:04:01.459> your<00:04:01.609> foot<00:04:01.760> is

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
good maneuverability when your foot is

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:02.409 
good maneuverability when your foot is
planted

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
planted

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.089 
planted
keep<00:04:02.870> in<00:04:03.019> mind<00:04:03.169> you<00:04:03.260> only<00:04:03.290> have<00:04:03.590> three<00:04:03.829> studs

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
keep in mind you only have three studs

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.280 
keep in mind you only have three studs
on<00:04:04.280> each<00:04:04.459> side<00:04:04.699> in<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.090> forefoot<00:04:05.449> area<00:04:05.510> so

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
on each side in the forefoot area so

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.020 
on each side in the forefoot area so
it's<00:04:06.409> not<00:04:06.500> an<00:04:06.590> ideal<00:04:06.949> stud<00:04:07.189> pattern<00:04:07.519> for<00:04:07.699> super

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
it's not an ideal stud pattern for super

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.819 
it's not an ideal stud pattern for super
hard<00:04:08.239> ground<00:04:08.479> services<00:04:08.750> but<00:04:09.470> if<00:04:09.560> you're<00:04:09.680> gonna

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
hard ground services but if you're gonna

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.199 
hard ground services but if you're gonna
be<00:04:09.949> playing<00:04:10.129> on<00:04:10.250> firm<00:04:10.579> ground<00:04:10.609> you're<00:04:11.090> not

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
be playing on firm ground you're not

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.390 
be playing on firm ground you're not
gonna<00:04:11.299> have<00:04:11.509> any<00:04:11.689> issues<00:04:11.870> as<00:04:12.409> far<00:04:12.769> as<00:04:13.040> traction

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
gonna have any issues as far as traction

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.580 
gonna have any issues as far as traction
goes<00:04:13.729> and<00:04:14.000> then<00:04:14.359> one<00:04:14.599> last<00:04:14.810> major<00:04:15.229> thing<00:04:15.560> that

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
goes and then one last major thing that

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.719 
goes and then one last major thing that
I<00:04:15.709> noticed<00:04:15.979> is<00:04:16.070> that<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:16.370> does<00:04:16.549> weigh<00:04:16.699> a

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
I noticed is that this does weigh a

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.550 
I noticed is that this does weigh a
little<00:04:16.909> bit<00:04:17.120> more<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:17.810> has<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:18.019> listed<00:04:18.380> weight

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
little bit more this has a listed weight

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.249 
little bit more this has a listed weight
of<00:04:18.680> 9.4<00:04:19.489> ounces<00:04:19.970> which<00:04:20.479> is<00:04:20.599> about<00:04:20.780> average<00:04:21.019> for

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
of 9.4 ounces which is about average for

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.409 
of 9.4 ounces which is about average for
soccer<00:04:21.680> shoe<00:04:21.919> where<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.639> predator<00:04:22.909> LZ<00:04:23.060> has<00:04:23.389> a

eight ounces which is not a huge
difference
