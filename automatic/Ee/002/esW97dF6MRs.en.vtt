when everything is all washed out in a
couple<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:33.800> years<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:35.420> growing<00:01:35.690> nice<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.140> big

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
couple of years and growing nice and big

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.120 
couple of years and growing nice and big
you<00:01:40.930> can<00:01:41.930> see<00:01:41.960> by<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.320> size<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.890> primer

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
you can see by the size of the primer

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.770 
you can see by the size of the primer
canes<00:01:45.100> versus<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.340> flora<00:01:46.730> canes<00:01:47.060> here<00:01:47.420> you

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
canes versus the flora canes here you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.470 
canes versus the flora canes here you
see<00:01:47.990> this<00:01:48.830> is<00:01:49.010> last<00:01:49.280> year's<00:01:49.550> growth<00:01:49.790> here<00:01:50.150> so

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
see this is last year's growth here so

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.110 
see this is last year's growth here so
you<00:01:50.570> know<00:01:50.660> I'm<00:01:50.720> in<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.110> in<00:01:51.290> a<00:01:51.820> little<00:01:52.820> stick

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
you know I'm in that in a little stick

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.350 
you know I'm in that in a little stick
and<00:01:53.390> then<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.620> is<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:55.340> is<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.760> new<00:01:56.090> growth

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
and then this is this is the new growth

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.130 
and then this is this is the new growth
here<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:57.230> year<00:01:57.440> it's<00:01:58.340> quite<00:01:58.850> larger<00:01:59.180> quite<00:02:00.080> a

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
here this year it's quite larger quite a

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.670 
here this year it's quite larger quite a
bit<00:02:00.290> larger<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:01.190> they'll<00:02:01.580> be<00:02:01.760> substantial<00:02:02.680> by

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
bit larger so they'll be substantial by

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.050 
bit larger so they'll be substantial by
next<00:02:03.979> season<00:02:04.100> they'll<00:02:04.460> be<00:02:04.610> really<00:02:04.940> sturdy<00:02:07.060> put

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
next season they'll be really sturdy put

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.760 
next season they'll be really sturdy put
up<00:02:08.179> heavier<00:02:08.510> wires<00:02:08.780> because<00:02:09.320> the<00:02:09.470> fruit<00:02:09.649> will

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
up heavier wires because the fruit will

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.290 
up heavier wires because the fruit will
be<00:02:09.800> much<00:02:10.040> heavier<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:13.400> that's<00:02:13.640> right

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
be much heavier and that's right

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.680 
be much heavier and that's right
boys<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.380> berries
