helix and the herb stack um I have never

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.259 
helix and the herb stack um I have never
found<00:00:10.650> one<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.490> hopefully<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.000> would<00:00:12.120> be<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.720 
the comparison of the helix and the herb
stack<00:00:16.170> I'm<00:00:16.800> talking<00:00:17.160> about<00:00:17.190> each<00:00:17.490> one

button guys as you see you hold it down
and<00:00:40.530> whatever<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:40.950> already<00:00:41.190> temperature

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and whatever it is already temperature

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.510 
and whatever it is already temperature
you<00:00:41.820> want<00:00:42.050> it<00:00:43.050> works<00:00:43.410> they<00:00:44.040> all<00:00:44.160> go<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you want it works they all go up to the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.279 
you want it works they all go up to the
temperature<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.850> want<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.510> you've<00:00:45.780> seen<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
temperature you want as you've seen it

temperature you want as you've seen it
started<00:00:46.739> off<00:00:46.829> 102<00:00:47.430> degrees<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.629> reason<00:00:48.870> why

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
started off 102 degrees the reason why

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.950 
started off 102 degrees the reason why
was<00:00:49.079> 102<00:00:49.469> degrees<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:50.039> some<00:00:50.910> reason<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
was 102 degrees because some reason it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.720 
was 102 degrees because some reason it
gotta<00:00:52.230> work<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.980> heat<00:00:53.160> tape<00:00:53.340> gotta<00:00:53.520> work

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
gotta work the the heat tape gotta work

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.029 
gotta work the the heat tape gotta work
to<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> tubs<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:55.079> 102<00:00:55.500> degrees<00:00:55.800> is

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to the tubs and for 102 degrees is

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.520 
to the tubs and for 102 degrees is
actually<00:00:56.370> 90<00:00:56.610> degrees<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.210> tubs<00:00:57.530> which

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
actually 90 degrees in the tubs which

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
actually 90 degrees in the tubs which
you<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.820> sucks<00:01:00.090> because

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
you know it's kind of sucks because

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.260 
you know it's kind of sucks because
they've<00:01:00.629> got<00:01:00.870> colder<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.649> only<00:01:02.129> 110<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
they've got colder and the only 110 you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.579 
they've got colder and the only 110 you
actually<00:01:03.570> can't<00:01:03.780> make<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> woman<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.409> what<00:01:04.500> you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
actually can't make a woman and what you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.910 
actually can't make a woman and what you
want<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.860> can't<00:01:07.860> go

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
want it to be all as you see I can't go

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.390 
want it to be all as you see I can't go
down<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.930> too<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.010> 92

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
down or up so this too if this is at 92

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.100 
down or up so this too if this is at 92
degrees<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.060> I'm<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.540> bring<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.810> 85

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
degrees and I'm going to bring it to 85

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.660 
degrees and I'm going to bring it to 85
degrees<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.740> would<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.040> run<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.369> all<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
degrees I would have to run it all the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.620 
degrees I would have to run it all the
way<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:16.759> then<00:01:17.759> bring<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.420> all<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.540> way

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
way up and then bring it all the way

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.380 
way up and then bring it all the way
down<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.290> what<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.470> want<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.490> that's<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> only

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
down to what I want it that's the only

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.609 
down to what I want it that's the only
downfall<00:01:21.600> about<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.320> arm<00:01:23.030> device<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.590> other

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
downfall about this arm device the other

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.530 
downfall about this arm device the other
thing<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.100> don't<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.340> about<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
thing I don't like about this is the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.469 
thing I don't like about this is the
probe<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.040> short<00:01:29.400> short<00:01:29.820> probe<00:01:30.240> it's

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
probe it's a short short probe it's

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.179 
probe it's a short short probe it's
about<00:01:30.659> three<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.140> half<00:01:31.170> feet<00:01:31.439> four<00:01:31.770> feet<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
about three and a half feet four feet a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.370 
about three and a half feet four feet a
very<00:01:32.549> short<00:01:32.880> probe<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.990> not<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.140> lot

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
very short probe it's not it's not a lot

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.969 
very short probe it's not it's not a lot
to<00:01:34.409> work<00:01:34.710> with

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
to work with

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.550 
to work with
I<00:01:35.750> don't<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> doesn't<00:01:37.290> come<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
I don't like the doesn't come with a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.170 
I don't like the doesn't come with a
stand<00:01:37.890> actually<00:01:38.220> does<00:01:38.520> come<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.850> stand

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
stand actually does come with a stand

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.160 
stand actually does come with a stand
it's<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:40.729> clear<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.119> type<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.329> device<00:01:42.780> that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
very stupid and I don't like I don't

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.170 
very stupid and I don't like I don't
like<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.430> idea<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.259> laid<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:53.180> okay

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
like that idea so I laid here okay

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.420 
like that idea so I laid here okay
that's<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.600> about<00:01:54.780> that

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
that's that's about that

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.560

from<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.820> ten<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.390> rate

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
from one with ten if I have the rate

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.090 
from one with ten if I have the rate
this<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.899> would<00:01:58.020> rate<00:01:58.170> probably<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.649> seven

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
this I would rate probably a seven

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.300 
this I would rate probably a seven
because<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.420> works<00:02:00.659> great<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.200> works<00:02:01.380> fine<00:02:01.619> but
