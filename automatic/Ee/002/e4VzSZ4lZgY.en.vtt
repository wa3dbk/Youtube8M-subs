00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
unboxing my laptop

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.240 
unboxing my laptop
it's<00:00:12.509> our<00:00:12.750> actually<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.349> already<00:00:13.590> been<00:00:13.889> Alton's

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.430 
it's our actually I already been Alton's
I<00:00:14.370> guess<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:15.150> that's<00:00:15.450> why<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.870> slinging

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
I guess so that's why this is slinging

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.050 
I guess so that's why this is slinging
out<00:00:16.650> but<00:00:17.460> I'm<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:19.130> change<00:00:20.130> put<00:00:20.820> everything

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
out but I'm so I change put everything

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.620 
out but I'm so I change put everything
back<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.810> kind<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.500> power<00:00:22.740> came<00:00:23.400> basically<00:00:24.090> so

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
back to kind of power came basically so

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:38.319 
back to kind of power came basically so
first<00:00:25.320> we're<00:00:25.500> gonna<00:00:25.560> put<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.890> up<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:37.129> a

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
first we're gonna put it up like this a

00:00:38.329 --> 00:01:19.219 
first we're gonna put it up like this a
box<00:00:39.329> within<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.780> box<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.759> here's<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:19.020> actual

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
box within a box so here's the actual

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.859 
box within a box so here's the actual
device<00:01:20.540> let's<00:01:21.540> open<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:23.000> nice<00:01:24.000> qualities<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
device let's open it nice qualities I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.450 
device let's open it nice qualities I
like<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> little<00:01:25.290> keyboard<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.950> good<00:01:26.250> for

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
like the little keyboard it's good for

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.760 
like the little keyboard it's good for
me<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> work<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.840> then<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.619> is

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
me to work on it and then see this is

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.429 
me to work on it and then see this is
where<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.009> turn<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.430> right<00:01:29.579> there

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
where you turn it on right there

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.899 
where you turn it on right there
no<00:01:32.150> it'll<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:34.140> bunch<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> stuff<00:01:34.770> turn<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
no it'll do bunch of stuff turn on and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.190 
no it'll do bunch of stuff turn on and
everything<00:01:37.880> loading<00:01:38.880> loading<00:01:39.030> loading<00:01:40.939> okay

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
everything loading loading loading okay

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.929 
everything loading loading loading okay
so<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> reason<00:01:43.409> why<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> made<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> whole<00:01:44.759> new

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
so the reason why I made a whole new

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.270 
so the reason why I made a whole new
channel<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.079> because<00:01:46.290> we

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
channel to do this is because we

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.240 
channel to do this is because we
couldn't<00:01:47.670> figure<00:01:47.909> out<00:01:48.140> what<00:01:49.140> whose<00:01:49.680> channel

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
couldn't figure out what whose channel

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.850 
couldn't figure out what whose channel
it<00:01:50.430> would<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:52.380> had<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.590> make<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> new

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
it would be on so we had to make a new

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.539 
it would be on so we had to make a new
channel<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:55.020> basically<00:01:56.270> what<00:01:57.290> me<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:59.040> my

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
channel so basically what me and my

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.880 
channel so basically what me and my
brother<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:02.030> is<00:02:03.110> on<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.409> channel<00:02:04.680> it's

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
brother do is on this channel it's
