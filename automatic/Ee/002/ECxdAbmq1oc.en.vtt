said<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.540> he<00:01:45.689> had<00:01:45.899> never<00:01:45.990> got<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> game<00:01:46.500> plan

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
said that he had never got a game plan

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.569 
said that he had never got a game plan
because<00:01:47.000> LeBron<00:01:48.000> James<00:01:48.299> benches<00:01:49.070> 450<00:01:50.070> pounds

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
because LeBron James benches 450 pounds

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.359 
because LeBron James benches 450 pounds
he's<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.119> he's<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.020> man-child<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:53.070> doesn't

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
he's on he's like a man-child it doesn't

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.609 
he's on he's like a man-child it doesn't
hit<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.420> saw<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.810> real<00:01:54.960> life<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
hit you with you saw in real life you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
hit you with you saw in real life you
couldn't<00:01:56.009> process<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:56.850> he's<00:01:57.240> so

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
couldn't process it because he's so

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.990 
couldn't process it because he's so
unlike<00:01:57.840> anything<00:01:58.140> you've<00:01:58.350> ever<00:01:58.409> seen<00:01:58.680> uh<00:01:59.000> Mike

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
unlike anything you've ever seen uh Mike

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.980 
unlike anything you've ever seen uh Mike
should<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.299> said<00:02:00.450> yeah<00:02:00.600> I'll<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.719> out

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
should have said yeah I'll just out

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.450 
should have said yeah I'll just out
skilling<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.619> that's<00:02:01.979> probably<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.399> he

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
skilling and that's probably what he

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.310 
skilling and that's probably what he
would<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.810> Mike<00:02:04.140> would

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
would do but I do think that Mike would

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.380 
would do but I do think that Mike would
probably<00:02:04.710> rip<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.399> LeBron<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.149> end<00:02:06.299> of

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
probably rip up the LeBron in the end of

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.510 
probably rip up the LeBron in the end of
the<00:02:06.450> day<00:02:06.570> at<00:02:06.719> man<00:02:06.899> Mike's<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.350> icon<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the day at man Mike's the icon and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.190 
the day at man Mike's the icon and
that's<00:02:08.789> what<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.000> would<00:02:09.090> come<00:02:09.239> down<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.479> but

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
that's what it would come down to but

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.770 
that's what it would come down to but
then<00:02:10.440> he<00:02:10.679> brings<00:02:10.890> Kobe<00:02:11.550> Bryant<00:02:12.000> into<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.270> mix

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
then he brings Kobe Bryant into the mix

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.199 
then he brings Kobe Bryant into the mix
and<00:02:12.930> he<00:02:13.110> knows<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.440> he<00:02:13.860> absolutely<00:02:14.610> knows<00:02:15.000> that

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
and he knows it he absolutely knows that

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.880

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
only 88 keys there's only two ways you

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.660 
only 88 keys there's only two ways you
can<00:02:43.560> dribble<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.010> ball<00:02:44.190> well<00:02:44.459> there's<00:02:44.580> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
can dribble the ball well there's a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.670
