00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.270
 in magnitude always of minecraft 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.570
 peasant starting from the man where 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.100
 who are steel hm3 equal put almost me 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.420
 I meet on the subject for what I am going to 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.620
 who made time that you have to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.680
 agree this is my marriage that 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.540
 honestly it does not have much seniority and 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.350
 It seems to be very good because it is very 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:38.339
 well done and nothing because this edges 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.039
 teacher this part at a time then one day 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:44.249
 bored a serious summer friday and 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.309
 two practically Saturday is enough and 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:49.699
 Well, since I have not been able to get so many 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.789
 items could be removed as before to 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.859
 half every three or four in a day three 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.620
 or four recorded already rendered itself 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.170
 same day and then on grounds that there 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.329
 a lot of focus or I do not know 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.580
 is what happens to people today 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.939
 so do not be sorry to hire you to kill us 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.450
 whose purpose is not the same as 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.570
 this one this game I have arsonists 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.070
 arsonist must be said and many people I 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.049
 Question that you think is the best 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.820
 instant 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.680
 also which I recommend you then 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.600
 I recommend essentially for the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.390
 the arsonist mobile what has 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.799
 regeneration to fire and your player to his 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.640
 opponents after burning and 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.140
 they are practically dead this someone 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.390
 more besides I do not like them because there is another 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.289
 which is called a rat that can reach you 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.020
 help win to win the games but 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.509
 stealing own swords this one that's 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.190
 Medium difficult but not impossible 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.009
 can get to steal a sword and when 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.039
 that costs Sanchez Kills but he came back in 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.200
 you got this I have the pyromaniac kit and 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.439
 it may be that honestly this one 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.110
 this is more or p for me is the most 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.780
 I like it since I return the resistance to 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.940
 any this other clip does not have this 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.030
 does not have fire resistance you do not have 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.720
 you are jogging tooth the others are this there 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.800
 archer and one is so by faith but the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.349
 arsonist if this one since only so 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.840
 same that already has regeneration to the fire 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.269
 and all that and it weakens two 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.280
 opponents and all that and for the vip 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.290
 which I suggest depends on the map 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.569
 also because if you're a map that does not 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.420
 you know absolutely nothing after 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.720
 choose in which tank you have strength 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.420
 of the forces of all I believe 8 I do not 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.790
 agreement but here problems that do not 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.739
 you have to get yourself does not have that 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.299
 Fire resistance is to meet 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.690
 human can both kill if it is 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.579
 very pro you can get to kill this and 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.250
 also another that I recommend is the 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.690
 hornet since by hitting the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.049
 opponent after arriving in 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.819
 penalties 90% of poison and can 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.010
 be sincerely, as you can 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.439
 get to help true there are many kits 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.239
 since it has regeneration and with the 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.269
 resistance I think to have with a glove 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.459
 burns an arsonist of force so that 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.489
 the arsonists mixing to visualization 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:22.290
 this shit and another one that they also knew 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:25.379
 which is what I like the most is the sonic 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.900
 since it has this speed 4 and can you 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.280
 get to help you move easier 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.409
 has more ability to move if 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.680
 you're moving this has a part of the 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:38.579
 nothing but if not I recommend you then 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.150
 do not put it honestly it is because 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:46.079
 with the city they will reach the swords or 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.700
 something like this can come to give this is not 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.340
 can reach the swords that are 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.989
 super cited so many but far and 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.760
 Also, I do not know if it can reach you 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.400
 win it since by the speed then you 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.909
 you can and we go fast and the last kit 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.680
 that the close suggest this is the weapon already 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.680
 which is not seen and willing to help 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.510
 also to barral swords prope and then 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.459
 containment could also have games 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.349
 won I recorded several games in the 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.470
 which the internal kit takes me to the 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:19.979
 victory is not equal people then another 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.810
 more topic I wanted to comment apart this 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.889
 theme is already from intel minecraft channel 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.860
 while but it is that this one almost 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.439
 we arrived and teeth are missing 50 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.330
 are not many but slowly 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:36.629
 improving a little more in the channel not 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.120
 be handsome in another series that is 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:42.000
 already already definitively issuing the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.400
 attention next week is ours 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.120
 and next since it would not be that I like it 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.340
 a lot and it's this watch 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.319
 kraft you know what flavor of hunger 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.740
 etcetera and well I'm nexus is a game 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:59.129
 pretty much since it counts is pvp is 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.990
 rival just like the sonar game is not 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:07.349
 similar but this one is more cost more 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.409
 I'm with more or less where I do not know 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.000
 stress x since it has a goal of 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.250
 iredes well these values already has 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.779
 played you know but saves a brief 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.270
 explanation of what the konex is 44 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:25.590
 this equipment of different color that are 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.360
 green this yellow red and blue that you 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.969
 you choose the current team you are going to choose from 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.330
 what color and what is to choose and why 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:37.310
 they're called these because it's a picture of 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.310
 how is it called 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:48.539
 this is the annex block and it's very easy 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.699
 to explain and its nexus has 64 hits if 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.080
 someone wants to get to give you then 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.419
 destroy these days well where 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.580
 answer if you get to die and goals 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.759
 destroy extra you can go doing 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.710
 pots of force being apple doing 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.289
 etcetera not like you want to go to attack 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.910
 again that you want end of I do not know is 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:11.060
 that would be the same 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.820
 the goal is not to play on excrement and 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.400
 because in 30 minutes it 's amanda of color and 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.390
 that can also very much faith 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.880
 strategy etcetera and then soon 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:25.010
 this video that you are uploading invoke 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.460
 Nothing they liked from 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.800
 there is the explanation of the kits that 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.840
 that are sure to help you as many 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.720
 people ask me the same thing and then here 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.450
 answer your questions and shrink later but 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.670
 they liked it if you like gm 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.320
