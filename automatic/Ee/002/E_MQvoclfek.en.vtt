00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.830
 It was good, we'll teach you how to make a 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.170
 substitute for the conventional egg that is 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.380
 using flaxseed will need to buy 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.650
 line without seed as much golden lack or 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.539
 tied the euro or justify pain you 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.789
 buy the quantity you want can 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.689
 buy a large quantity and save 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.550
 in the freezer 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.769
 it does not freeze then every time you 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.630
 to use you take the amount of 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.599
 coordinate you need and back to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.969
 Fizi is so I just took the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.969
 fraser mine and she continues cooking 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.230
 the only thing though is that you should not 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.450
 buy the flour ready money 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.760
 you need to do for a case that this 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.280
 Ready-made dehydrated flour 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.190
 so do not give gold island then we 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.739
 will only prepare our share of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.320
 me and do not smoke because you have not been to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.140
 his father the golden flaxseed did not 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.830
 can then use the alliance 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:09.450
 put a new egg is equivalent to a 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.430
 tablespoon of flaxseed in two 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.500
 tablespoons of water so I go 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.080
 prepare for you to see 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:24.840
 well then make a new you will 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:29.930
 use a tablespoon of flaxseed and 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.930
 two tablespoons of mineral water 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.140
 good now it's going to be like this, well liquid 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.240
 We'll leave here for 20 minutes and 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.920
 consistency will be more or less 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.439
 like it 's a thing 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.450
 Engel so a very thick jelly I 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.920
 back to show you is that 20 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.709
 minutes 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.689
 or else here gold is ready looks 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:18.760
 How hard it gets is a good thing. 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:21.640
 gelatinous and so is this 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.060
 here that will replace an egg in your 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.060
 recipe 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.010
 It's a weirdo, but then 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:34.299
 is this here you are one of those equals 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.549
 a new substitute for the common egg of 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.129
 chicken and you can use both 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.680
 recipe 12 when salt recipe it 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.930
 do not let the flavor flour as it is 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.489
 well milled flour and played a 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.950
 bit of residue 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.410
 if you like flaxseed you 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.630
 you can also use blogs left 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.060
 just right as you do to 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.239
 use the seed no flour 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.700
 to replace your o 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.739
 I hope you like it more. 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.569

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.290
 Chinese will be down here in the
