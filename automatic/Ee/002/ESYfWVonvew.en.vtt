00:00:03.530 --> 00:01:13.130 

I<00:00:45.370> mean<00:01:04.810> he's<00:01:05.810> gonna<00:01:05.960> come<00:01:06.200> right<00:01:06.350> down

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.149 

because<00:01:14.140> I<00:01:14.290> think<00:01:14.350> he<00:01:14.680> has<00:01:14.830> so<00:01:15.100> many<00:01:15.159> moods<00:01:15.580> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
because I think he has so many moods I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.469 
because I think he has so many moods I
think<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.250> way<00:01:18.369> that<00:01:18.400> he<00:01:18.640> teaches<00:01:18.850> stuff<00:01:19.270> is

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
think the way that he teaches stuff is

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.630 
think the way that he teaches stuff is
he<00:01:19.720> gives<00:01:19.960> you<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.440> couple<00:01:21.070> movies<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.460> then<00:01:21.549> he

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
he gives you a couple movies and then he

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.980 
he gives you a couple movies and then he
gives<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:21.970> counter<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.540> then<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:22.810> gives

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
gives you a counter and then you gives

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.920 
gives you a counter and then you gives
you<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.140> counter<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.680> counter<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.750> there's

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
you a counter to the counter so there's

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.920 
you a counter to the counter so there's
always<00:01:26.400> something<00:01:27.400> that<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.580> can<00:01:27.850> do<00:01:28.030> you'll

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
always something that you can do you'll

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.580 
always something that you can do you'll
never<00:01:29.170> be<00:01:29.380> out<00:01:29.409> of<00:01:29.619> options<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:31.590> teaching

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
never be out of options just teaching

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.170 
never be out of options just teaching
that<00:01:32.710> footwork<00:01:33.159> or<00:01:33.340> teaching<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.759> ability<00:01:34.090> to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
that footwork or teaching the ability to

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.240 
that footwork or teaching the ability to
stay<00:01:34.360> balanced<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:35.710> know<00:01:35.799> which<00:01:35.950> moves

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
stay balanced and you know which moves

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.969 
stay balanced and you know which moves
to<00:01:36.369> use<00:01:36.490> at<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.700> right<00:01:36.880> time<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.770> I<00:01:41.920> think

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
to use at the right time and I think

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.219 
to use at the right time and I think
watching<00:01:42.700> him<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:42.940> would<00:01:43.240> I<00:01:43.509> know<00:01:43.720> like<00:01:43.899> when<00:01:44.080> he

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
watching him I would I know like when he

00:01:44.229 --> 00:02:03.090 
watching him I would I know like when he
lets<00:01:44.409> like<00:01:44.710> right<00:01:45.250> now<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:01.920> don't<00:02:02.920> think

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
lets like right now I don't think

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.010 
lets like right now I don't think
there's<00:02:03.250> any<00:02:03.460> move<00:02:03.759> that<00:02:03.789> he<00:02:04.270> does<00:02:04.509> that<00:02:04.810> it's

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
there's any move that he does that it's

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.130 
there's any move that he does that it's
like<00:02:05.520> anyone's<00:02:06.520> like<00:02:06.729> oh<00:02:06.970> man<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.600> might<00:02:07.810> not<00:02:08.019> be

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
like anyone's like oh man I might not be

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.900 
like anyone's like oh man I might not be
able<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.319> copy<00:02:08.619> that<00:02:08.920> in<00:02:09.190> terms<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.580> doing<00:02:09.819> the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
able to copy that in terms of doing the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.240 
able to copy that in terms of doing the
footwork<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.479> think<00:02:10.750> it's<00:02:11.650> just<00:02:11.769> a<00:02:11.920> matter<00:02:12.130> of

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
footwork I think it's just a matter of

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.030 
footwork I think it's just a matter of
not<00:02:12.489> gonna<00:02:12.819> do<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:14.760> none<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:16.030> stuff<00:02:16.239> is

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
not gonna do it none of this stuff is

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.620 
not gonna do it none of this stuff is
extraordinarily<00:02:18.040> flashy<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.239> it's<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.540> a

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
extraordinarily flashy but it's just a

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.150 
extraordinarily flashy but it's just a
one<00:02:19.870> who<00:02:20.019> doesn't<00:02:20.230> how<00:02:20.530> he<00:02:20.590> does<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.070> that

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
one who doesn't how he does it that

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.370 
one who doesn't how he does it that
makes<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.700> efficient

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
makes it so efficient

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.780 
makes it so efficient
a<00:02:23.940> lot<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:27.400> only<00:02:27.520> been<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.730> couple

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
a lot of it's only been a couple

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.790 
a lot of it's only been a couple
practices<00:02:28.510> but<00:02:28.690> has<00:02:28.840> anyone<00:02:29.080> jumped<00:02:29.500> out<00:02:29.620> to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
practices but has anyone jumped out to

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.590 
practices but has anyone jumped out to
you<00:02:29.920> as<00:02:30.250> maybe<00:02:30.820> making<00:02:31.060> strides<00:02:31.300> over<00:02:31.510> the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
you as maybe making strides over the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.850 
you as maybe making strides over the
summer<00:02:31.840> or<00:02:31.930> been<00:02:32.140> impressive<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.800> in

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
summer or been impressive to you in

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.530 
summer or been impressive to you in
particular<00:02:34.890> we've<00:02:35.890> just<00:02:36.430> had<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> lot<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.030> I

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
particular we've just had a lot of I

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.510 
particular we've just had a lot of I
don't<00:02:38.500> know<00:02:38.710> we<00:02:38.830> haven't<00:02:38.950> played<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.190> much

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
don't know we haven't played that much

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.330 
don't know we haven't played that much
so<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:39.820> just<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.810> lot<00:02:41.320> of<00:02:41.350> Defense<00:02:41.860> and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
so it's just a lot of Defense and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.620 
so it's just a lot of Defense and
beating<00:02:43.060> each<00:02:43.090> other<00:02:43.330> up

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
beating each other up

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.490 
beating each other up
but<00:02:43.960> uh<00:02:43.990> I<00:02:44.640> mean<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.730> think<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:46.150> think<00:02:46.470> some<00:02:47.470> of

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
but uh I mean I think I think some of

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.200 
but uh I mean I think I think some of
the<00:02:47.590> guys<00:02:47.740> that<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:47.950> think<00:02:48.190> are<00:02:48.310> supposed<00:02:49.180> to

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
the guys that you think are supposed to

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.360 
the guys that you think are supposed to
look<00:02:49.390> good<00:02:49.570> are<00:02:49.870> looking<00:02:50.470> pretty<00:02:50.590> good

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.890 

you<00:02:54.370> know<00:02:54.489> there's<00:02:54.730> it's<00:02:55.450> really<00:02:55.689> tough<00:02:55.870> to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
you know there's it's really tough to

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.959 
you know there's it's really tough to
just<00:02:56.680> stand<00:02:57.040> out<00:02:57.189> stand<00:02:57.489> out<00:02:57.609> in<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.760> first

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969
