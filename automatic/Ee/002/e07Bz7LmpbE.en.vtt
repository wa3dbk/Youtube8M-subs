00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.360
 the disorderly occupation of urban space 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.760
 and accelerated housing growth 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.560
 hamper harmonious coexistence 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.230
 between the city and its waterways 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.390
 at the same time with development 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.790
 natural coverage of rural areas and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.580
 gradually replaced by areas of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.870
 pasture typically associated with the 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.300
 development of activities 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.629
 family farming 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.000
 these aspects, among others, weakened 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.340
 the city and its population to the risk of 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.079
 floods 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.199
 today the city is susceptible to 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.199
 floods that lead to huge losses 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.570
 materials proliferation of diseases 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.289
 of life among other problems 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.289
 for the population 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.869
 this is a permanent concern of the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.300
 government of the state of minas gerais and 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.160
 prefecture of muriaé that through 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.039
 public works department of the state 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.410
 deop mining has been carrying out 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.920
 actions for the harmonization of the 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.920
 with the waters 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.770
 to solve this problem the basins 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.200
 of the river Muriae of the Black River were 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.259
 studied and three alternatives 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.450
 of work were aimed 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.490
 the first alternative was based on the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.509
 removal of the population from the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.880
 inundation 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.340
 this alternative was discarded by 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.770
 generate significant social impact 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.630
 the second alternative was based on the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.939
 implementation of two dams to 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.840
 flood control in the Muriaé and 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.060
 black 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.100
 this alternative became unfeasible 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.770
 due to the large lake formed by 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.380
 dam of the river Muriaé about once 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.299
 and half the urban area of ​​the city 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.700
 would involve large areas of 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.530
 expropriation in the relocation of 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.530
 highways and other problems 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.730
 the third alternative represents a 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:14.120
 based hybrid solution 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.819
 of a dam on the Black River and 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.340
 actions in the macrodrainage of the river muriaé 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.590
 this was the option chosen to generate 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.650
 less social and economic impact 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.650
 environmental 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.390
 with the implementation of the 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.090
 chosen alternative will occur 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.250
 significant reduction in floods in 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.560
 city ​​of muria is reducing 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.000
 expressively the number of people 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.000
 affected by this virus 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.459
 the black river dam will be about 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.930
 nine kilometers from the meeting of 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.930
 waters of the black river with the river muriaé 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.050
 the maximum area occupied by the reservoir 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.400
 is approximately 4.8 kilometers 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.860
 squares 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.110
 this area corresponds to twice and 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.040
 half the area of ​​the lagoon of pampulha in beautiful 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.070
 horizon 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.440
 the dam will be capable of damping a 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.790
 whose probability of occurrence is 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.510
 of 1% in the rainy months of October to 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.550
 March 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.610
 the dam will operate at higher levels 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.310
 gradually emptied 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.590
 the months of April and May 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.210
 during those months and in the dry season 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.780
 extends until the month of October 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.070
 the dam will have a small lake varying 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.350
 approximately between four and five 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.709
 meters with an area of 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.780
 flooded approximately 0.3 km 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.610
 square the work will mitigate the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.980
 occurrence of future floods in the 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.030
 city ​​of death without causing great 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.610
 impact on urban dwellers 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.350
 interventions in the Muriaé River occurred 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.590
 in the section between the bridge 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.810
 neighborhood and 120 meters after the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.959
 metal walkway in the neighborhood of porto 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.600
 to an approximate extent of 5.9 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.820
 kilometers for better adaptation of the 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.950
 solutions were considered as 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.950
 for each of the five excerpts 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.250
 stretch 10 is located between the bridge 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.590
 the santana neighborhood and the br br 356 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.100
 it is a very flat region which 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.740
 was occupied in a disorderly way to 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.050
 this segment the most viable solution was 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.030
 expropriation of flood areas 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.300
 and avoiding the risk that new 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.910
 floods affect the population in 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.000
 unoccupied spaces will be created 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.600
 leisure for the population 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.840
 the stretch between the bridge of br 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.020
 356 and the br-116 bridge 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.030
 In this section the box will be enlarged in 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.370
 approximately 20 meters 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.689
 the day care center near the neighborhood 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.179
 Napoleon will be preserved 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:02.849
 bridge 2 will receive reinforcement and 

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:04.739
 extension of 12 meters and bridge 3 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.949
 will be demolished giving rise to a 

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:09.509
 footbridge in the nearby region 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.959
 to br 116 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.039
 spaces will be created for green areas 

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:15.499
 allowing more leisure area for 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.629
 the population 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:20.789
 or section 2 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:23.939
 this section is between the 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.899
 br-116 bridge and the confluence with the river 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.299
 black 

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:30.179
 in this segment the face of the river will be 

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:31.979
 extended up to 30 meters and the bed 

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:36.479
 the river and will be downgraded 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:39.569
 bridge 4 of br 116 will receive reinforcement of 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:43.219
 foundation and bridge 5 of gil moreira street 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.219
 replaced by a new 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:52.349
 or section 3 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.539
 this section is between the 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.979
 confluence of the black river and 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.679
 next to the city hall 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.379
 In this section the milk of the river will be 

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:04.939
 and a recessed trough will be extended to 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.939
 reach 35 meters 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:15.390
 jk avenue will continue to the street 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.950
 May 1 and the city hall bridge will 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.950
 receive foundation reinforcement 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:34.310
 the section 4 is comprised between the 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.530
 prefecture and approximately 120 meters 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.290
 after the metal walkway 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.350
 in this stretch is predicted lowering 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.220
 of the bed and the widening of the caldera is 35 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.889
 meters 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:49.750

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.750
 received reinforcement of foundation 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.889
 the works designed for the city of 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.630
 muriae represents a very 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:06.620
 to reduce the risk of 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.169
 inundation 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.450
 the deop with these works will be bringing 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.400
 a more positive occupation of areas 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.850
 urban areas that today are not 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.710
 quality, including creating spaces for 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.950
 green areas enabling the construction 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:24.530
 sports areas amphitheaters tracks 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.650
