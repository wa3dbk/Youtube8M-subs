problem<00:00:21.130> I<00:00:21.190> was<00:00:21.340> having<00:00:21.520> earlier<00:00:22.090> was<00:00:22.420> that

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
problem I was having earlier was that

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.010 
problem I was having earlier was that
when<00:00:23.560> I<00:00:23.590> tried<00:00:23.920> to<00:00:23.950> press<00:00:24.160> play<00:00:24.370> on<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:25.030> mod

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
when I tried to press play on the mod

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.080 
when I tried to press play on the mod
pack<00:00:26.230> whenever<00:00:26.680> I<00:00:26.770> chose<00:00:27.010> my<00:00:27.220> mod<00:00:27.400> that<00:00:27.850> i

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
pack whenever I chose my mod that i

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.900 
pack whenever I chose my mod that i
would<00:00:28.450> it<00:00:28.780> would<00:00:28.870> just<00:00:29.170> crash<00:00:29.830> and<00:00:30.130> just<00:00:30.520> go

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
would it would just crash and just go

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.440 
would it would just crash and just go
down<00:00:31.060> here<00:00:31.510> to<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:31.869> tool<00:00:32.320> bar<00:00:32.500> and<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.390> i

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
down here to the tool bar and so i

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.389 
down here to the tool bar and so i
figured<00:00:34.899> out<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.140> fix<00:00:35.379> so<00:00:35.710> first<00:00:36.160> thing<00:00:36.370> you

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
figured out the fix so first thing you

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.090 
figured out the fix so first thing you
do<00:00:36.760> is<00:00:37.059> you<00:00:37.690> go<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:37.989> your<00:00:38.200> control<00:00:38.440> panel

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
do is you go to your control panel

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.890 
do is you go to your control panel
so<00:00:39.310> this<00:00:39.910> will<00:00:40.030> look<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.270> little<00:00:40.390> bit<00:00:40.570> different

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
so this will look a little bit different

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.050 
so this will look a little bit different
off<00:00:41.079> of<00:00:43.649> Windows<00:00:44.649> 7<00:00:44.860> but<00:00:45.160> that<00:00:45.430> on<00:00:45.610> Windows<00:00:45.790> 8

type name and you have to have a
Minecraft<00:02:29.680> account<00:02:30.070> in<00:02:30.280> order<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.550> do<00:02:30.820> this<00:02:31.000> so

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
Minecraft account in order to do this so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.880 
Minecraft account in order to do this so
you<00:02:33.340> just

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.690 

there<00:02:36.190> we<00:02:36.280> go<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:37.770> don't<00:02:38.770> remember<00:02:38.890> me<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.460> then

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
there we go I don't remember me and then

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.780 
there we go I don't remember me and then
you<00:02:40.000> just<00:02:40.030> join<00:02:41.020> in<00:02:41.200> after<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.680> because<00:02:42.010> it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
you just join in after that because it

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.790 
you just join in after that because it
should<00:02:43.030> work<00:02:43.240> after<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:44.080> might<00:02:44.380> have<00:02:44.620> to

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
should work after this you might have to

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.530 
should work after this you might have to
reinstall<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.670> mod<00:02:45.880> pack<00:02:46.120> again<00:02:46.630> because<00:02:47.500> has

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
reinstall the mod pack again because has

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.350 
reinstall the mod pack again because has
all<00:02:49.540> sorts<00:02:49.810> of<00:02:49.960> stuff<00:02:50.170> then<00:02:50.440> you'll<00:02:50.680> have<00:02:50.800> to

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
all sorts of stuff then you'll have to

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.520 
all sorts of stuff then you'll have to
just<00:02:52.360> do<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> little<00:02:52.690> bit<00:02:52.840> cleaning<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.290> do<00:02:53.410> that

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
just do a little bit cleaning to do that

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.180 
just do a little bit cleaning to do that
and<00:02:54.510> then<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.960> should<00:02:56.200> load<00:02:56.410> up<00:02:56.470> just<00:02:56.830> fine<00:02:57.010> it

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
and then it should load up just fine it

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.350 
and then it should load up just fine it
takes<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.550> little<00:02:57.670> while<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.910> load<00:02:58.060> because

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
takes a little while to load because

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.699 
takes a little while to load because
it's<00:02:58.950> it's<00:02:59.950> having<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:01.030> program<00:03:01.709> reaching

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
it's it's having a program reaching

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.130 
it's it's having a program reaching
another<00:03:02.980> program<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.760> load<00:03:04.600> something<00:03:05.020> so

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
another program to load something so

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.920 
another program to load something so
that's<00:03:05.260> why<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.500> takes<00:03:05.709> so<00:03:05.890> long<00:03:06.010> it's<00:03:06.370> got<00:03:06.550> to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
that's why it takes so long it's got to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.010 
that's why it takes so long it's got to
convert<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:07.990> over<00:03:08.080> to<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.410> other<00:03:08.530> program<00:03:08.980> so

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
convert it over to the other program so

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.390 
convert it over to the other program so
it's<00:03:11.020> not<00:03:11.320> no<00:03:11.470> respawn<00:03:11.830> for<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.070> little<00:03:12.250> while

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
it's not no respawn for a little while

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.110 
it's not no respawn for a little while
and<00:03:13.050> then<00:03:14.050> after<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.890> while<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.220> should<00:03:15.670> respond

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
and then after a while it should respond

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.880 
and then after a while it should respond
and<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:16.840> should<00:03:17.020> be<00:03:17.140> ready<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.380> play<00:03:17.530> I'll<00:03:17.739> be
