00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.459
 hi to all friends of tones again 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.460
 mobile word congress 2015 now we are 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.860
 a jol stand presenting the new one 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.829
 version of the selfish operating system e 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.820
 loyola tablet product that I am now 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:28.380
 showing for the moment you can find it 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.109
 on kickstarter take part in the campaign 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.989
 of deep and have one for little more than 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.180
 200 euros or wait for the second 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.100
 quarter of the year 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.870
 then when the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.500
 they don't know the final price 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.700
 still interesting product so much for 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.510
 the design as obviously for the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.120
 software we have a 7.85 screen 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.030
 inch resolution god k then ad 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.280
 very high resolution figures are 330 pp 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.129
 rai is not as thin as you can 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.050
 see the thickness is just over 8 mm 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.550
 or a little more than the average but in short if 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.259
 you are not a maniac of design 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.149
 surely it can be good 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.330
 as you can see here we have the space 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.610
 for the sim and the usb connector for 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.280
 power and data transfer is 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.170
 that's all about the outside 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.400
 the tablet does not open the battery not 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.430
 removable 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.240
 there is no space to insert a card 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.990
 of memory 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.450
 you can choose in version 32 or 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.720
 64 gigabytes these four the camera 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.490
 here and from 8 megapixels the front one from 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.210
 5 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.220
 the interesting thing is more than design 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.649
 the hardware we still have 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.259
 a last-generation atom processor 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.299
 lard version 2.0 is obviously the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.270
 fish os we can unlock it in the way 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.250
 classic with the button can be the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.810
 lock screen 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.460
 or we can knock like this 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.549
 as do some smartphones 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.270
 android already from this home screen 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.850
 depending on the plaster it changes for example 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.299
 if we scroll from the left like this 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.160
 we have a screen with notifications 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.440
 where we have mail messages 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.709
 electronic twitter facebook and yes 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:19.470
 will draw and we can do some actions 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:21.989
 basic web search localization create 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.430
 a reminder to do ie elves always 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.870
 on the lock screen we knock two 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.580
 times 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.530
 we arrive here by sliding to the right 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.660
 let's get to what is the home page 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.019
 here we have some of the applications 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.000
 main here we go to the settings 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.180
 in this case we have known messages 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.250
 and contacts 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.230
 each of these windows to one or more 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.620
 buttons for specific actions in this 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.989
 if I go to press more here I am 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.130
 a screen where I'm already composing the 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.200
 new born with the keyboard 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.560
 that rather active answering works 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.350
 well she does not know whether to play if fis os not 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.150
 still a soir swype keyboard 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.100
 let's say with scroll then those in 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.140
 which you write without taking your finger off 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.960
 will come, but they have guaranteed it for now 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.700
 there is no scrolling down from the 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.840
 from the bottom to the side we have all the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.900
 applications 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.880
 the interesting thing about sempice os is that 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.540
 despite not having many applications 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.180
 dedicated to a virtual machine that if 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.580
 I remember correctly it is called alien dalvik 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.050
 who page and the android application 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.110
 off of this tablet should done 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.030
 allow it to run pretty well 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.700
 let's go back by scrolling one more 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.730
 time the third page is the dedicated page 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.090
 partners an advertising space in 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.200
 this case there is the deezer image though 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.150
 we can find that of another 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.970
 violet partner who decided to 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.370
 place here the announcement coap you are here 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.300
 on a system to be used especially with i 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.310
 gestures developed in that way to use 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.980
 much with the fingers a product 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.500
 interesting product to try that 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.940
 we will try to as soon as it is available 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.700
 starting from the first with passion 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.970
 true for the moment it is all thanks for 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.970
 following us
