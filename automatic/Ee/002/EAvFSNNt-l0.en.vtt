okay<00:00:02.270> one<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.300> one<00:00:03.570> finger<00:00:03.780> typically<00:00:04.470> you<00:00:04.589> can

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
okay one of one finger typically you can

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.590 
okay one of one finger typically you can
see<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.009> milk<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.940> milk<00:00:06.120> pouring<00:00:06.480> out<00:00:06.569> of

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
see the milk to the milk pouring out of

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.759 
see the milk to the milk pouring out of
there

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:20.720 

that<00:00:10.769> male<00:00:18.650> get<00:00:19.650> milks<00:00:19.949> pouring<00:00:20.279> out<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.520> there

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
that male get milks pouring out of there

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.849 
that male get milks pouring out of there
and<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.810> stir<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> milk<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.619> fish

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
and so you stir the milk with the fish

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.420 
and so you stir the milk with the fish
in<00:00:24.080> they<00:00:25.080> get<00:00:25.350> rid<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.920> female<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
in they get rid of it for the female and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.820 
in they get rid of it for the female and
she's<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:27.060> soft<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.750> see<00:00:28.410> they<00:00:28.619> come<00:00:28.769> out

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
she's really soft and see they come out

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.179 
she's really soft and see they come out
like<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> rope<00:00:29.449> and<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.109> stir<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> fish

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
like a rope and so you stir with a fish

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.100 
like a rope and so you stir with a fish
in<00:00:32.369> there<00:00:33.469> most<00:00:34.469> people<00:00:34.800> who<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.160> early

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
in there most people who do this early

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.920 
in there most people who do this early
wait<00:00:37.110> too<00:00:37.320> long<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:41.700> there's<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.570> many<00:00:42.690> eggs

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
wait too long and there's so many eggs

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.799 
wait too long and there's so many eggs
in<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:44.340> she<00:00:45.030> was<00:00:45.149> still<00:00:45.390> ready<00:00:45.600> I

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
in here now that she was still ready I

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.209 
in here now that she was still ready I
would<00:00:45.989> move<00:00:46.110> her<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.289> another<00:00:46.410> table<00:00:46.890> yes

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
would move her to another table yes

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.709 
would move her to another table yes
right<00:00:47.460> otherwise<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.660> is

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
right otherwise you have to this this is

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.450 
right otherwise you have to this this is
a<00:00:48.899> proper<00:00:49.440> density<00:00:49.620> correctly<00:00:52.129> we<00:00:53.129> do<00:00:53.280> another

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
a proper density correctly we do another

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:08.440 
a proper density correctly we do another
one

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.320 

conditioned<00:01:09.450> by<00:01:13.670> haven't<00:01:14.670> stopped<00:01:14.909> eating<00:01:15.090> in

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
conditioned by haven't stopped eating in

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.499 
conditioned by haven't stopped eating in
the<00:01:15.630> moment

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.630 

so<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.110> at<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> egg<00:01:25.619> stick<00:01:26.040> they're

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so you know at the egg stick they're

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.029 
so you know at the egg stick they're
gonna<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.390> these<00:01:27.509> are<00:01:27.660> all<00:01:27.810> stuff<00:01:28.140> say

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
gonna go and these are all stuff say

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.580 
gonna go and these are all stuff say
they're<00:01:29.399> all<00:01:29.520> stuck<00:01:29.789> already<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.690> if<00:01:31.470> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
they're all stuck already and if you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.499 
they're all stuck already and if you
look<00:01:31.770> closely<00:01:32.090> at<00:01:33.090> these<00:01:35.090> they're<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.330> too

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
look closely at these they're it's too

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.270 
look closely at these they're it's too
early<00:01:36.539> but<00:01:37.050> within<00:01:37.229> about<00:01:37.410> four<00:01:37.770> hours<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
early but within about four hours you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.120 
early but within about four hours you
get<00:01:38.429> polar<00:01:38.670> bodies<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:42.740> let's<00:01:43.740> say<00:01:43.950> they're

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
get polar bodies and let's say they're

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.090 
get polar bodies and let's say they're
pretty<00:01:44.340> damn<00:01:44.550> good<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:46.560> fact<00:01:46.800> that<00:01:46.890> they've

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
pretty damn good the fact that they've

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.899 
pretty damn good the fact that they've
all<00:01:47.310> stuck<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.880> I've<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.179> clumped<00:01:49.789> it's<00:01:50.789> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
all stuck and I've not clumped it's a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.020 
all stuck and I've not clumped it's a
good<00:01:51.090> sign<00:01:51.330> that<00:01:52.640> everybody<00:01:53.640> looked<00:01:53.819> at<00:01:53.940> it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
good sign that everybody looked at it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.639 
good sign that everybody looked at it
but<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.509> got<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.720> swirl<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.229> eggs<00:01:55.380> before

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
but you got to swirl the eggs before

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.130 
but you got to swirl the eggs before
these<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.220> before<00:01:56.550> they<00:01:56.640> start<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:57.000> attack<00:01:57.300> if

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
these but before they start to attack if

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:07.240 
these but before they start to attack if
you<00:01:58.200> don't<00:01:58.409> swirl<00:01:58.710> no<00:01:59.610> chance<00:01:59.940> of<00:02:00.239> their<00:02:00.420> clump

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.180

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you put them up box with oxygen driving

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.970 
you put them up box with oxygen driving
around<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.370> city<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.940> couple<00:02:15.860> put<00:02:16.860> them

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
around the city for a couple put them

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.790 
around the city for a couple put them
out<00:02:17.129> take<00:02:17.610> them<00:02:17.700> out<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.030> Austin<00:02:18.390> pond<00:02:18.800> okay

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.760 
out take them out the Austin pond okay
what<00:02:20.069> are<00:02:20.129> we<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> move<00:02:20.550> to
