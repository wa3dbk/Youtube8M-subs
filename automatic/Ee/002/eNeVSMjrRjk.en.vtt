 why is everyone lying here on mats and 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.250
 why did people choose a hobby 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.490

 and I had a few months ago 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.210
 your life in the social club 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.770
 the then you were still the trainer 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.479
 then the complaint was that you had another one 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.890
 bit too much fat hard anyway 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.190

 of course my mother and I don't help 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.420
 completely trained my stepfather 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.550

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.319

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.159
 getting too much it is very want one 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.810
 bit like a smoothie that you don't 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.460
 he thinks he's too fat 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.100
 well in the park you have to be critical 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.080
 I think what can you yourself also yes that 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.479
 belly sticks were tight but tight 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.329
 not tight enough yet you are string please 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.079
 that's what I mean when you hear something 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.079
 do you have to do it right 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.390
 h 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.410
 Hey 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.520
 grandma anyway you feel 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.470
 or wrong party magically 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.730
 come 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.090
 teacher is such a birthday nobody knows 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.090
 knows 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.730
 it's really just which way I go 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.030
 look everywhere I just see something that is not 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.030
 understands 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.600
 I just see you in a sea of ​​mats 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.970
 but all people go on 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.900
 it is preparation that counts 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.290
 before the match 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.209
 is that how you prepare your case 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.170
 try so much motor relax and warm 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.570
 to stay 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.459
 because cold is disastrous for your competition 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.650
 shape say was feeling or your own 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.110
 share baby yeah we just good mom oh yeah 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.500
 yes that is also with this sport you are 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.610
 actually more concerned with yourself than 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.110
 against 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.670
 say but you have no opponents but 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.320
 you fellow sportsmen say that 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.690
 also show themselves on stage wind 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.530
 your biggest opponent yourself yes that 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.180
 right there is indeed life itself what 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.720
 actually poetic you would be yes 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.739
 you will be spraying the u zone and yes we will 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.620
 go him in brown 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.590
 because if you are good at using the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.489
 definitions of the muscles that better 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.440
 be seen 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.090
 sometimes say it is in brown half 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.090
 yes yes, work had half a year 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.590
 yes yes 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.420
 lights around for a while and I really see 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.920
 the one body even bigger than the other 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.780
 is there well i think you anna a lot 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.030
 bool and things like that 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.590
 sure no absolutely it is something 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.430
 what they are openly talked about 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.900
 a bit uncomfortable anyway 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.370
 subject I don't know if he's here 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.810
 talked openly about the war 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.100
 gym itself to I'm just 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.560
 a kind of taboo 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.120
 people don't like to admit it because of it 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.200
 is a kind of cheating that is 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.600
 would ask you the question is this 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.220
 100% naturally helped 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.080
 Of course the can be just below 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.400
 heels because I use too 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.260
 dampers and left it pre workout 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.060
 so it should and just harder and the too 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.489
 can train them all off when small 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.570
 injection needle in the glasses will find him 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.430
 take 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.080
 somewhere else might not count 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.080
 just take a good workout
