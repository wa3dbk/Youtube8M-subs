could not get the audio because there
was<00:01:28.020> some<00:01:28.110> pretty<00:01:28.290> funny<00:01:28.530> live<00:01:29.400> reactions<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
was some pretty funny live reactions and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850 
was some pretty funny live reactions and
I<00:01:30.420> would<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.780> liked<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.170> put<00:01:31.380> them<00:01:31.500> into<00:01:31.710> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I would have liked to put them into a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.190 
I would have liked to put them into a
video<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.869> unfortunately<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.049> was<00:01:34.170> not

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
video but unfortunately that was not

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.649 
video but unfortunately that was not
recorded<00:01:34.680> from<00:01:34.799> Trish<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:36.360> had<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
recorded from Trish and I then had to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450 
recorded from Trish and I then had to
record<00:01:36.900> all<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.110> gameplay<00:01:37.560> from<00:01:37.619> my<00:01:38.009> Elgato

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
record all the gameplay from my Elgato

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.520 
record all the gameplay from my Elgato
and<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.360> didn't<00:01:39.630> record<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> sound<00:01:40.320> either

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and it didn't record the sound either

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
and it didn't record the sound either
I'll<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.159> figure<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.460> how<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:42.119> around

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
I'll have to figure out how I get around

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.840 
I'll have to figure out how I get around
doing<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.740> another<00:01:44.340> thing<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.820> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
doing that and another thing is that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
doing that and another thing is that
they'll<00:01:45.540> gasps<00:01:45.750> who<00:01:45.869> didn't<00:01:46.110> recall<00:01:46.409> all<00:01:46.649> of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
they'll gasps who didn't recall all of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.230 
they'll gasps who didn't recall all of
the<00:01:46.979> stream<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.250> could<00:01:47.460> only<00:01:47.549> go<00:01:47.790> back<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the stream and could only go back to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.359 
the stream and could only go back to
like<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.659> thing<00:01:49.079> only<00:01:49.350> got<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.500> final<00:01:50.070> four

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
like I thing only got the final four

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.010 
like I thing only got the final four
hours<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> stream<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.600> about<00:01:51.689> three

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
hours of the stream so it's about three

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.960 
hours of the stream so it's about three
to<00:01:52.140> four<00:01:52.290> hours<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> beginning<00:01:53.159> that's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
to four hours of the beginning that's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.550 
to four hours of the beginning that's
kind<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.329> missing<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.750> gameplay<00:01:55.229> from<00:01:55.290> that

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
kind of missing the gameplay from that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.080 
kind of missing the gameplay from that
and<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.070> especially<00:01:56.219> one<00:01:56.700> goal<00:01:56.939> with

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and that was especially one goal with

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.670 
and that was especially one goal with
Namor<00:01:57.329> which<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.990> probably<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
Namor which was probably one of the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.139 
Namor which was probably one of the
better<00:01:58.799> ghost<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.280> stream<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.729> didn't

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
better ghost of the stream that I didn't

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.120 
better ghost of the stream that I didn't
get<00:02:00.240> recorded<00:02:00.719> unfortunately<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:01.860> still

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
get recorded unfortunately but still

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.440 
get recorded unfortunately but still
there's<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> bunch<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.610> cool<00:02:02.790> goals<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.240> sold

there's a bunch of cool goals you sold

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.240 
there's a bunch of cool goals you sold

talking about and this was definitely
one<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.930> more<00:02:07.079> fun<00:02:07.380> games<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> stream

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
one of the more fun games of the stream

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.249 
one of the more fun games of the stream
I<00:02:08.429> scored<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.119> goal<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.599> into<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> second

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
half my opponent which was one

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.270

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
future maybe it could be wanted maybe

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.390 
future maybe it could be wanted maybe
two<00:03:05.700> hours<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:06.120> week<00:03:06.419> I<00:03:06.989> could<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:07.859> thinking

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
two hours a week I could I was thinking

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.770 
two hours a week I could I was thinking
it<00:03:08.579> could<00:03:08.760> be<00:03:08.849> pretty<00:03:09.030> cool<00:03:09.299> which<00:03:09.510> kind<00:03:09.720> of

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
it could be pretty cool which kind of

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.490 
it could be pretty cool which kind of
replace<00:03:10.139> and<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.680> daily<00:03:11.099> upload<00:03:11.459> with<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.760> stream

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
replace and a daily upload with a stream

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.020 
replace and a daily upload with a stream
because<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.769> not<00:03:13.889> always<00:03:14.159> i<00:03:14.340> have<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.790> time

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
because it's not always i have the time

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.869 
because it's not always i have the time
to<00:03:15.180> edit<00:03:15.329> videos<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:16.549> sometimes<00:03:17.549> it's<00:03:17.729> easy

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
to edit videos and sometimes it's easy

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.909 
to edit videos and sometimes it's easy
just<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.209> play<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.599> game<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.959> then<00:03:19.229> stream<00:03:19.739> it

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
just to play the game and then stream it

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.740 
just to play the game and then stream it
like<00:03:20.099> then<00:03:20.340> everyone<00:03:20.760> can<00:03:20.790> see<00:03:21.120> there<00:03:21.359> when

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
like then everyone can see there when

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.879 
like then everyone can see there when
they<00:03:21.870> want<00:03:22.049> to<00:03:22.169> and<00:03:22.290> they<00:03:22.319> can<00:03:22.470> go<00:03:22.590> on<00:03:22.680> for<00:03:22.859> a

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
they want to and they can go on for a

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.069 
they want to and they can go on for a
few<00:03:23.099> hours<00:03:23.159> and<00:03:23.669> i<00:03:23.729> thought<00:03:23.909> maybe<00:03:24.659> it<00:03:24.959> could

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
few hours and i thought maybe it could

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.509 
few hours and i thought maybe it could
be<00:03:25.199> a<00:03:25.229> cool<00:03:25.470> thing<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.739> do<00:03:26.010> every<00:03:26.370> Wednesday

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519
