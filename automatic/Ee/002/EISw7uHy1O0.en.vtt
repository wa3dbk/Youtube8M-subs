that<00:02:32.140> was<00:02:32.290> generally<00:02:32.739> this<00:02:33.040> right<00:02:33.250> here's<00:02:33.430> the

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
that was generally this right here's the

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.830 
that was generally this right here's the
generally<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:33.909> time<00:02:34.090> right<00:02:34.299> before<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.629> went

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
generally the time right before I went

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.770 
generally the time right before I went
to<00:02:34.930> dr.<00:02:35.230> Norman<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:36.459> basically<00:02:37.120> started<00:02:37.629> on

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
to dr. Norman and I basically started on

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.670 
to dr. Norman and I basically started on
a<00:02:37.840> drug<00:02:38.079> called<00:02:38.230> fetch<00:02:38.470> remain<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.010> topamax

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
a drug called fetch remain and topamax

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.839 
a drug called fetch remain and topamax
because<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.799> got<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.129> point<00:02:42.280> where<00:02:42.489> I<00:02:42.519> would

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
because I got to the point where I would

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.140

shower and changing clothes and that was

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.580 
shower and changing clothes and that was
probably<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.510> one<00:02:49.659> of<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.900> lowest<00:02:50.200> points<00:02:50.379> of

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
probably the one of the lowest points of

guys<00:07:07.100> on<00:07:07.340> the<00:07:07.370> flipside<00:07:08.920> the<00:07:09.920> game<00:07:10.130> also

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
guys on the flipside the game also

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.730 
guys on the flipside the game also
because<00:07:11.360> as<00:07:11.600> much<00:07:12.020> as<00:07:12.170> you<00:07:12.260> want<00:07:12.440> to<00:07:12.530> camp

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
because as much as you want to camp

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.900 
because as much as you want to camp
every<00:07:12.980> now<00:07:13.160> and<00:07:13.250> then<00:07:13.310> you<00:07:13.430> have<00:07:13.550> to<00:07:13.700> push<00:07:13.880> up

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910
