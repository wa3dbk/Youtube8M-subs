is<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.159> may<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> use<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
is going to be so you may have to use a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.820 
is going to be so you may have to use a
tube<00:01:14.939> brush<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.990> worst-case<00:01:16.409> scenario

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
tube brush and then worst-case scenario

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.310 
tube brush and then worst-case scenario
use<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> thread<00:01:17.880> tap<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.330> clean<00:01:18.840> up<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> threads

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
use a thread tap to clean up the threads

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.749 
use a thread tap to clean up the threads
now<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.159> go<00:01:20.220> ahead<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.430> put<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> hitch<00:01:20.729> up

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
now we can go ahead and put the hitch up

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.620 
now we can go ahead and put the hitch up
position

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
position

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.600 
position
now<00:01:21.990> how<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.229> hitch<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.830> tow<00:01:23.400> loop

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
now how the hitch is going to tow loop

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.249 
now how the hitch is going to tow loop
is<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
is going to be like this it's going to

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.050 
is going to be like this it's going to
use<00:01:25.520> square<00:01:26.520> block<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.450> half<00:01:27.630> inch<00:01:27.869> bolt

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
use square block and a half inch bolt

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.850 
use square block and a half inch bolt
it's<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.299> sit<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.680> tow

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it's going to sit like this in the tow

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.649 
it's going to sit like this in the tow
loop<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.430> our<00:01:32.549> hitch<00:01:32.759> will<00:01:33.119> fit<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.450> this

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
loop and then our hitch will fit on this

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.300 
loop and then our hitch will fit on this
side<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.140> tow<00:01:34.290> loop<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> we'll<00:01:34.950> use<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.189> to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
side of a tow loop and we'll use that to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.800 
side of a tow loop and we'll use that to
support<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.640> hitch<00:01:35.850> while<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.390> put<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
support the hitch while we put it the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.359 
support the hitch while we put it the
rest<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.140> fasteners<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.950> place<00:01:37.979> you'll

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
rest of the fasteners in place you'll

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.010 
rest of the fasteners in place you'll
need<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:38.640> extra<00:01:38.850> set<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> hands<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.509> help<00:01:39.750> put

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
need an extra set of hands to help put

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.859 
need an extra set of hands to help put
the<00:01:40.110> hitch<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:44.450> we're<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.600> stall<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the hitch up we're going to stall in the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.450 
the hitch up we're going to stall in the
hardware<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.380> sometimes<00:01:46.829> these<00:01:46.979> holes<00:01:47.220> won't

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
hardware now sometimes these holes won't

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.460 
hardware now sometimes these holes won't
line<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.790> perfectly<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.170> actually

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
line up perfectly but you can actually

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.710 
line up perfectly but you can actually
take<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> hitch<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.040> flex<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.610> back<00:01:50.820> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
take the hitch and flex it back and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
take the hitch and flex it back and
forth<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.220> be<00:01:53.220> able<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> position<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
forth to be able to the position you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:06.100 
forth to be able to the position you
need

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.930 

now<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.230> you<00:02:07.290> notice<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.620> this<00:02:07.710> situation<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
now if you notice in this situation the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.270 
now if you notice in this situation the
bolts<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.479> not<00:02:10.080> lining<00:02:10.440> up<00:02:10.619> front<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.070> rear

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
bolts are not lining up front to rear

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.320 
bolts are not lining up front to rear
and<00:02:11.640> again<00:02:11.850> we're<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.000> taking<00:02:12.120> a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and again we're just taking a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.780 
and again we're just taking a
screwdriver<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.220> since<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.280> hitch<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.580> still

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
screwdriver and since the hitch is still

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.920 
screwdriver and since the hitch is still
loose<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.420> move<00:02:15.900> around<00:02:16.020> as<00:02:16.350> we<00:02:16.500> need<00:02:16.680> to

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
loose we can move around as we need to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
this point we get all our hardware

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.410 
this point we get all our hardware
loosely<00:02:20.400> installed<00:02:20.730> let's<00:02:21.060> go<00:02:21.150> ahead<00:02:21.330> and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
loosely installed let's go ahead and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:48.510 
loosely installed let's go ahead and
snug<00:02:21.600> all<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.020> bolts<00:02:22.530> snug<00:02:22.860> down

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.040 

we<00:02:49.000> applied<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.210> little<00:02:49.300> bit<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.540> lubricant<00:02:49.960> to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
we applied a little bit of lubricant to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:03:02.160 
we applied a little bit of lubricant to
help<00:02:50.080> ease<00:02:50.710> and<00:02:51.010> reinstallation<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:01.170> with
