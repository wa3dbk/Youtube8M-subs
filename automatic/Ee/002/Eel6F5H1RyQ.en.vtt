and they haven't really figured out or

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.330 
and they haven't really figured out or
that's<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.379> starting<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.770> figure<00:01:01.980> out<00:01:02.160> how

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that's just starting to figure out how

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.789 
that's just starting to figure out how
to<00:01:02.370> hunt<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.510> they<00:01:03.690> compete<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.199> various

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
they get a certain level of point they

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.929 
they get a certain level of point they
advanced<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> us<00:01:10.950> called<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.250> champion<00:01:11.700> class

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
