00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.430 
believe these are a size 8 I usually
wear<00:05:21.560> and<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:21.860> half<00:05:22.040> so<00:05:22.460> they<00:05:22.610> run<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:22.850> little<00:05:23.060> big

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
wear and a half so they run a little big

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.080 
wear and a half so they run a little big
so<00:05:24.440> these<00:05:24.860> actually<00:05:24.920> fit<00:05:25.370> perfect<00:05:25.850> and<00:05:26.030> they

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
so these actually fit perfect and they

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.850 
so these actually fit perfect and they
don't<00:05:26.180> even<00:05:26.300> well<00:05:26.810> for<00:05:27.140> me<00:05:27.290> they<00:05:27.500> really<00:05:27.710> don't

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
don't even well for me they really don't

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.220 
don't even well for me they really don't
crease<00:05:28.100> like<00:05:28.280> that<00:05:28.600> but<00:05:29.600> I<00:05:29.630> try<00:05:29.840> to<00:05:29.870> keep<00:05:30.080> them

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
crease like that but I try to keep them

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.050 
crease like that but I try to keep them
really<00:05:30.620> good<00:05:30.800> condition<00:05:30.980> but<00:05:31.310> yeah<00:05:31.610> man<00:05:31.850> that

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
really good condition but yeah man that

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.210 
really good condition but yeah man that
was<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.720> first<00:05:32.930> in<00:05:33.080> my<00:05:33.110> song<00:05:33.440> first<00:05:33.920> time<00:05:34.130> I

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
was the first in my song first time I

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.830
