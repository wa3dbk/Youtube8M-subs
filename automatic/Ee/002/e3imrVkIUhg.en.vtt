hey guys we're going to take a look at

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.670 
hey guys we're going to take a look at
this<00:00:02.220> floating<00:00:02.580> raft<00:00:03.140> stationary<00:00:04.140> raft<00:00:04.410> deal

this floating raft stationary raft deal
again<00:00:05.040> here<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.580> do<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.120> quick<00:00:06.330> follow<00:00:06.690> up<00:00:06.899> on<00:00:07.080> it

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
again here I do a quick follow up on it

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.040 
again here I do a quick follow up on it
what<00:00:08.280> you're<00:00:08.429> looking<00:00:08.730> at<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.690> crack

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
what you're looking at is the crack

professor from the University of Hawaii

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.320 
professor from the University of Hawaii
who<00:00:15.839> was<00:00:15.990> doing<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> side<00:00:18.000> that

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
who was doing this this is the side that

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.380 
who was doing this this is the side that
has<00:00:18.570> no<00:00:19.230> aeration<00:00:19.890> doesn't<00:00:20.460> require<00:00:20.699> any<00:00:21.119> type

anything<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.050> looking<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.099> you

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
anything like that looking at this you

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.099 
anything like that looking at this you
can<00:00:26.760> see<00:00:26.910> my<00:00:27.060> lettuce<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.539> doing<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.869> whole<00:00:28.050> lot

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
can see my lettuce is doing a whole lot

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.660 
can see my lettuce is doing a whole lot
better<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.710> time<00:00:28.980> because<00:00:29.310> they<00:00:29.400> don't<00:00:29.609> have

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
better this time because they don't have

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.910 
better this time because they don't have
the<00:00:29.970> POC<00:00:30.179> choy<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> tatsoi<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.529> here<00:00:31.710> with

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the POC choy and the tatsoi in here with

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.299 
the POC choy and the tatsoi in here with
them<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:33.540> water<00:00:33.809> levels<00:00:34.290> are<00:00:34.380> not<00:00:34.590> rapidly

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
them so the water levels are not rapidly

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.940 
them so the water levels are not rapidly
dropping<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.000> these<00:00:36.870> things<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.380> all<00:00:37.410> able

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
dropping and these things are all able

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.280 
dropping and these things are all able
to<00:00:38.040> grow<00:00:38.280> at<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> nice<00:00:38.850> steady<00:00:39.480> pace<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
to grow at a nice steady pace and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.170 
to grow at a nice steady pace and
everything<00:00:40.800> keep<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> same<00:00:41.640> growth

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
everything keep up at the same growth

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.630 
everything keep up at the same growth
rate<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> questions<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.950> got<00:00:44.160> most<00:00:44.430> off

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
rate one of the questions I got most off

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.029 
rate one of the questions I got most off
was<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.090> reference<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.539> algae<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.800> type<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
was in reference to algae what type of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.729 
was in reference to algae what type of
algae<00:00:47.610> buildup<00:00:47.760> did<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.270> get<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:49.379> this

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
algae buildup did you get and on this

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.310 
algae buildup did you get and on this
cracky<00:00:50.550> side<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.719> see<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
cracky side you can see that the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.950 
cracky side you can see that the
styrofoam<00:00:52.890> actually<00:00:53.760> sits<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.239> top<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
styrofoam actually sits on top of the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.160 
styrofoam actually sits on top of the
lumber<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.160> makes<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.520> nice<00:00:56.730> seal<00:00:57.149> no<00:00:57.899> like

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
lumber so it makes a nice seal no like

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.830 
lumber so it makes a nice seal no like
and<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:58.890> there's<00:00:59.399> no<00:00:59.840> algae

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and get in there there's no algae

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.560 
and get in there there's no algae
problems<00:01:01.350> whatsoever<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.609> side<00:01:02.910> again

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
problems whatsoever on this side again

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.119 
problems whatsoever on this side again
you<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> was<00:01:04.680> talking<00:01:04.739> about

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
you can see what I was talking about

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.539 
you can see what I was talking about
with<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> styrofoam<00:01:06.680> actually<00:01:07.680> rests<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.220> top

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
with the styrofoam actually rests on top

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.640 
with the styrofoam actually rests on top
of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.760> frame<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.390> don't<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.930> gaps<00:01:10.409> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
of the frame so you don't have gaps in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.080 
of the frame so you don't have gaps in
there<00:01:10.860> where<00:01:11.010> you're<00:01:11.130> getting<00:01:11.369> light<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.729> to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
there where you're getting light in to

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.940 
there where you're getting light in to
it<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:13.229> think<00:01:13.409> you're<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.860> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it and I don't think you're going to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.249 
it and I don't think you're going to
have<00:01:14.100> any<00:01:14.280> algae<00:01:14.760> problems<00:01:15.180> if<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.869> water's

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
have any algae problems if the water's

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.499 
have any algae problems if the water's
not<00:01:16.439> being<00:01:16.740> exposed<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.280> light<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.240> looking

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
not being exposed to light and looking

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.830 
not being exposed to light and looking
up<00:01:18.630> under<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.790> very<00:01:21.090> consistent

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
up under here you see very consistent

root growth this lettuce is doing much

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.609 
root growth this lettuce is doing much
better<00:01:24.210> than<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.659> did<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> first<00:01:25.320> run

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
better than it did in the first run

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.800 
better than it did in the first run
because<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.220> don't<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.700> those<00:01:27.000> overly

because I don't have those overly

good<00:01:36.079> another<00:01:37.079> question<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.770> asked<00:01:38.189> was

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
good another question that was asked was

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
good another question that was asked was
can<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.360> back<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.810> top<00:01:39.990> off<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
can you go back and top off the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.850 
can you go back and top off the
reservoir<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.540> yes<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> certain

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
reservoir and yes you can to a certain

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.740 
reservoir and yes you can to a certain
extent<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> little<00:01:45.090> bit<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> time

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
extent you know a little bit at a time

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.380 
extent you know a little bit at a time
but<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.740> plant<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.250> growing<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.909> you've

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
but as this plant is growing and you've

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.179 
but as this plant is growing and you've
got<00:01:48.600> these<00:01:48.780> long<00:01:49.020> roots<00:01:49.500> right<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.159> are

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
got these long roots right here that are

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.730 
got these long roots right here that are
absorbing<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> water<00:01:51.049> nutrients<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.200> these

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
absorbing the water nutrients and these

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.139 
absorbing the water nutrients and these
little<00:01:53.040> guys<00:01:53.159> right<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.549> here<00:01:53.880> start

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
little guys right in here start

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.420 
little guys right in here start
absorbing<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> oxygen<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.829> go<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.189> fill

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
absorbing the oxygen if you go and fill

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.280 
absorbing the oxygen if you go and fill
this<00:01:56.640> entire<00:01:56.700> reservoir<00:01:57.630> back<00:01:57.869> up

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
this entire reservoir back up

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.649 
this entire reservoir back up
you<00:01:58.500> basically<00:01:58.710> drown<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.549> plant<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.119> there

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you basically drown the plant so there

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.300 
you basically drown the plant so there
is<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> way<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.770> kind<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.100> come<00:02:02.280> back

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
is a way that you can kind of come back

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.700 
is a way that you can kind of come back
in<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.909> maintain<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:04.049> know<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> minimal

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
in and maintain a you know a minimal

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.109 
in and maintain a you know a minimal
level<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> bottom<00:02:05.579> or<00:02:05.670> something<00:02:05.729> like

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
level in the bottom or something like

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.150 
level in the bottom or something like
that<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.899> for<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> most<00:02:07.259> part<00:02:07.680> what<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.979> want

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
that but for the most part what you want

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.520 
that but for the most part what you want
to<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:09.599> from<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> start<00:02:10.110> make<00:02:10.500> sure

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
to do is right from the start make sure

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.220 
to do is right from the start make sure
you<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.190> right<00:02:11.340> ratio<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.030> plants

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
you have the right ratio of plants

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.170 
you have the right ratio of plants
to<00:02:13.349> your<00:02:13.470> reservoir<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.670> don't<00:02:14.910> have<00:02:15.060> to

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
to your reservoir so you don't have to

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.330 
to your reservoir so you don't have to
worry<00:02:15.330> about<00:02:15.390> doing<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.989> now<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
worry about doing that now this is the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.850 
worry about doing that now this is the
side<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.790> actually<00:02:17.970> floats<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.620> went

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
side that actually floats and I went

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.530 
side that actually floats and I went
ahead<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.129> turned<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.790> air<00:02:20.910> pump<00:02:21.150> on<00:02:21.330> for

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
ahead and turned the air pump on for

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.420 
ahead and turned the air pump on for
just<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.810> few<00:02:21.959> minutes<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.379> you<00:02:22.769> can<00:02:23.040> see<00:02:23.220> what

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
just a few minutes and you can see what

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.970 
just a few minutes and you can see what
she<00:02:23.459> looks<00:02:23.819> like<00:02:24.030> I've<00:02:24.629> got<00:02:24.870> four<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.530> those

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
she looks like I've got four of those

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.670 
she looks like I've got four of those
4-inch<00:02:26.750> cylindrical<00:02:27.750> air<00:02:27.870> stones<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.440> here

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
4-inch cylindrical air stones in here

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.350 
4-inch cylindrical air stones in here
and<00:02:28.890> they<00:02:29.430> seem<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.760> do<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:29.880> pretty<00:02:30.090> good<00:02:30.180> job

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
and they seem to do a pretty good job

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.660 
and they seem to do a pretty good job
being<00:02:31.260> as<00:02:31.470> how<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.709> plants<00:02:32.310> are<00:02:32.459> actually

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
being as how the plants are actually

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.240 
being as how the plants are actually
floating<00:02:33.239> right<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:34.170> top<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.709> water

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
floating right on top of the water

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.430 
floating right on top of the water
you<00:02:35.670> absolutely<00:02:36.269> need<00:02:36.420> some<00:02:36.780> aeration<00:02:37.080> in

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
you absolutely need some aeration in

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.410 
you absolutely need some aeration in
this<00:02:37.590> side<00:02:37.830> now<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.459> did<00:02:38.730> get<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> little<00:02:39.120> bit<00:02:39.299> of

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
this side now I did get a little bit of

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.830 
this side now I did get a little bit of
algae<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.470> float<00:02:41.069> inside<00:02:41.510> primarily<00:02:42.510> it

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
algae on the float inside primarily it

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.660 
algae on the float inside primarily it
was<00:02:43.200> right<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.739> gaps<00:02:44.010> right<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.489> here

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
was right in the gaps right in here

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.960 
was right in the gaps right in here
where<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.879> didn't<00:02:45.209> get<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.930> tight<00:02:46.230> seal<00:02:46.530> as<00:02:46.970> you

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
where I didn't get a tight seal as you

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.550 
where I didn't get a tight seal as you
can<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.360> I've<00:02:48.630> got<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.870> little<00:02:49.019> bit<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.319> play<00:02:49.530> in

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
can see I've got a little bit of play in

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.069 
can see I've got a little bit of play in
these<00:02:50.040> rafts<00:02:50.519> they're<00:02:50.670> not<00:02:50.849> fitting<00:02:51.630> up<00:02:51.810> nice

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
these rafts they're not fitting up nice

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.960 
these rafts they're not fitting up nice
and<00:02:52.349> snug<00:02:52.590> as<00:02:52.890> far<00:02:53.099> as<00:02:53.190> around<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.549> edges<00:02:53.880> I

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
and snug as far as around the edges I

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.089 
and snug as far as around the edges I
cut<00:02:54.180> them<00:02:54.329> a<00:02:54.390> little<00:02:54.660> bit<00:02:54.780> small<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.069> see

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
cut them a little bit small you can see

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.949 
cut them a little bit small you can see
the<00:02:56.400> spacing<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.030> have<00:02:57.329> on<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.630> end<00:02:57.810> right

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
the spacing that I have on the end right

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.410 
the spacing that I have on the end right
here<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:58.799> had<00:02:59.250> done<00:02:59.430> we'll<00:03:00.030> just<00:03:00.209> come<00:03:00.390> back

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
here so I had done we'll just come back

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.990 
here so I had done we'll just come back
and<00:03:00.900> laid<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> scrap<00:03:01.860> piece<00:03:02.069> across<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.670> end<00:03:02.819> of

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
and laid a scrap piece across the end of

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.030 
and laid a scrap piece across the end of
it<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.540> block<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.810> sunlight<00:03:04.019> out<00:03:04.620> from<00:03:04.860> it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
it to block the sunlight out from it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.800 
it to block the sunlight out from it
these<00:03:05.700> are<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.000> seedlings<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.540> I'm<00:03:06.630> working

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
these are the seedlings that I'm working

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.140 
these are the seedlings that I'm working
with<00:03:07.019> today<00:03:07.230> got<00:03:07.980> some<00:03:08.220> more<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.579> Adriane<00:03:09.120> a

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
with today got some more that Adriane a

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.630 
with today got some more that Adriane a
lettuce<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.930> some<00:03:10.590> tats<00:03:10.799> oil<00:03:11.040> they're

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
lettuce and some tats oil they're

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.610 
lettuce and some tats oil they're
growing<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.030> rock<00:03:12.269> wool<00:03:12.569> cubes<00:03:12.840> see<00:03:13.500> I've

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
growing in rock wool cubes see I've

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.990 
growing in rock wool cubes see I've
already<00:03:13.769> got<00:03:13.890> pretty<00:03:14.250> good<00:03:14.310> root<00:03:14.790> growth

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
already got pretty good root growth

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.400 
already got pretty good root growth
coming<00:03:15.239> out<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.540> bottom<00:03:15.660> I'm<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.049> little<00:03:16.290> bit

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
coming out the bottom I'm a little bit

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.680 
coming out the bottom I'm a little bit
late<00:03:16.620> getting<00:03:16.650> these<00:03:17.010> things<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.639> just<00:03:18.420> break

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
late getting these things in just break

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.879 
late getting these things in just break
them<00:03:18.900> off<00:03:19.019> take<00:03:19.769> your<00:03:19.799> two-inch<00:03:20.370> net<00:03:20.639> cup<00:03:21.889> try

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
them off take your two-inch net cup try

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.229 
them off take your two-inch net cup try
to<00:03:22.950> get<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.280> roots<00:03:23.489> down<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.760> there<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.150> you

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
think just because something grew well

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.060 
think just because something grew well
in<00:04:38.060> Virginia<00:04:38.509> it<00:04:38.720> may<00:04:38.930> not<00:04:39.169> grow<00:04:39.440> well<00:04:39.680> you

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
in Virginia it may not grow well you

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.830 
in Virginia it may not grow well you
know<00:04:40.190> North<00:04:40.490> Dakota<00:04:40.910> or<00:04:41.150> New<00:04:41.270> Mexico<00:04:41.300> or

know North Dakota or New Mexico or

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.439 
know North Dakota or New Mexico or
something<00:04:42.199> like<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:42.650> but<00:04:42.860> uh<00:04:42.919> based<00:04:43.850> on<00:04:44.060> some

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
something like that but uh based on some

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.620 
something like that but uh based on some
of<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:45.410> comments<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.389> information<00:04:47.389> I

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
of the the comments and information I

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.650 
of the the comments and information I
may<00:04:48.530> have<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.860> rethink<00:04:49.009> that<00:04:49.520> bottom<00:04:50.419> line<00:04:50.600> I

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
may have to rethink that bottom line I

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.510 
may have to rethink that bottom line I
think<00:04:50.870> a<00:04:51.169> lot<00:04:51.350> of<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.650> just<00:04:51.680> comes<00:04:52.009> down<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.310> how

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
think a lot of it just comes down to how

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.600 
think a lot of it just comes down to how
good<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.270> soil<00:04:53.509> is<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:54.320> so<00:04:54.590> again<00:04:54.860> thank<00:04:55.490> you

greenhouse<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:10.419> I<00:05:11.419> was<00:05:11.600> surprised<00:05:12.020> that

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
greenhouse and I was surprised that

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.950 
greenhouse and I was surprised that
nobody<00:05:12.830> stopped<00:05:13.669> me<00:05:13.880> in<00:05:13.910> my<00:05:14.030> tracks<00:05:14.210> because

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
put together something that I think will

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.270 
put together something that I think will
suit<00:06:20.510> my<00:06:20.720> purpose<00:06:21.169> and<00:06:21.320> then<00:06:21.919> if<00:06:22.070> all<00:06:22.220> goes

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
suit my purpose and then if all goes

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.159 
suit my purpose and then if all goes
well<00:06:22.520> over<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.120> next<00:06:23.180> three<00:06:23.570> or<00:06:23.599> four<00:06:23.840> months

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
well over the next three or four months

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.570 
well over the next three or four months
and<00:06:24.260> I<00:06:24.349> get<00:06:24.560> real<00:06:24.770> comfortable<00:06:25.070> with<00:06:25.310> this

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
and I get real comfortable with this

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.610 
and I get real comfortable with this
then<00:06:26.330> it<00:06:26.510> will<00:06:26.630> make<00:06:26.780> sense<00:06:27.080> for<00:06:27.260> me<00:06:27.320> to<00:06:27.409> go

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
then it will make sense for me to go

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.430 
then it will make sense for me to go
ahead<00:06:27.770> and<00:06:28.070> maybe<00:06:28.460> build<00:06:28.699> another<00:06:29.030> greenhouse

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
ahead and maybe build another greenhouse

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.110 
ahead and maybe build another greenhouse
upscale<00:06:30.440> it<00:06:30.650> and<00:06:30.800> just<00:06:31.310> go<00:06:31.430> crazy<00:06:31.699> with<00:06:32.030> this

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
upscale it and just go crazy with this

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.560 
upscale it and just go crazy with this
stuff

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
stuff

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.719 
stuff
