00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
really think that this is a first

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.900 
really think that this is a first
because<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> end<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> day<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.730> we

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
because at the end of the day when we

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.270 
because at the end of the day when we
are<00:00:30.060> dealing<00:00:30.300> with<00:00:30.480> different<00:00:31.019> religions<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:32.280 
are dealing with different religions the

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.160 
are dealing with different religions the
main<00:00:32.520> point<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.030> about<00:00:33.270> knowledge<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.750> about

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
main point is about knowledge it's about

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.070 
main point is about knowledge it's about
able<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.650> be<00:00:35.220> reading<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> text<00:00:36.240> so<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.900> when

you<00:00:37.230> go<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.470> such<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.310> website<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.060> you<00:00:39.150> put<00:00:39.890> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you go to such a website and you put a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.490 
you go to such a website and you put a
concept<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.970> a<00:00:42.090> word<00:00:42.330> like<00:00:42.360> peace<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.200> will<00:00:43.350> be

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
concept of a word like peace you will be

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.490 
concept of a word like peace you will be
able<00:00:43.740> to<00:00:44.190> get<00:00:44.450> different<00:00:45.450> verses<00:00:45.990> coming<00:00:46.350> from

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
able to get different verses coming from

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.140 
able to get different verses coming from
different<00:00:46.860> books<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.310> this<00:00:47.490> is<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
different books and this is really the

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.260 
different books and this is really the
starting<00:00:48.570> point<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.990> knowledge<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.490> really

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
starting point of knowledge so I really

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.660 
starting point of knowledge so I really
think<00:00:51.450> that<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.810> is<00:00:52.080> an<00:00:52.770> important<00:00:53.430> one

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
think that this is an important one

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.820 
think that this is an important one
because<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.900> want<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.260> promote<00:00:55.470> mutual

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
because if we want to promote mutual

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.550 
because if we want to promote mutual
respect<00:00:56.490> we<00:00:56.790> need<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.420> promote<00:00:57.660> knowledge<00:00:58.350> of

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
respect we need to promote knowledge of

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.220 
respect we need to promote knowledge of
the<00:00:58.680> other<00:00:58.830> text<00:00:59.310> but<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.790> a<00:00:59.880> humble<00:01:00.120> way<00:01:00.540> to

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the other text but in a humble way to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.830 
the other text but in a humble way to
read<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:01.830> text<00:01:02.370> doesn't<00:01:02.880> mean<00:01:03.240> that<00:01:03.450> we<00:01:03.630> get

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
read the text doesn't mean that we get

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.599 
read the text doesn't mean that we get
it<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.289> that<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.739> know<00:01:04.859> exactly<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.460> the
