or<00:03:53.210> anything<00:03:53.390> that<00:03:53.810> I've<00:03:54.590> noticed<00:03:54.920> um<00:03:55.220> I've

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
or anything that I've noticed um I've

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.960 
or anything that I've noticed um I've
also<00:03:56.450> blow<00:03:56.960> dried<00:03:57.260> my<00:03:57.290> hair<00:03:57.650> recently<00:03:57.980> for<00:03:58.880> the

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
also blow dried my hair recently for the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.120 
also blow dried my hair recently for the
first<00:03:59.180> time<00:03:59.420> and<00:03:59.750> it<00:03:59.840> was<00:04:00.020> pretty<00:04:00.380> huge<00:04:00.830> I

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
first time and it was pretty huge I

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.330 
first time and it was pretty huge I
wasn't<00:04:01.460> expecting<00:04:01.700> it<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.210> be<00:04:02.240> that<00:04:02.620> big<00:04:03.620> but<00:04:04.310> I

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
wasn't expecting it to be that big but I

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.280 
wasn't expecting it to be that big but I
guess<00:04:04.610> I<00:04:04.700> just<00:04:04.730> shows<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.210> my<00:04:05.900> hair<00:04:06.050> has<00:04:06.170> been

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
guess I just shows that my hair has been

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.700 
guess I just shows that my hair has been
growing<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:06.800> that's<00:04:06.980> always<00:04:07.130> good<00:04:07.310> um<00:04:08.710> what

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
growing so that's always good um what

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.070 
growing so that's always good um what
else<00:04:09.860> have<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.130> done<00:04:10.570> I've<00:04:11.570> pretty<00:04:11.780> much<00:04:11.870> just
