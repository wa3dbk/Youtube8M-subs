stellar

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
stellar
so<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.479> guess<00:01:09.720> create<00:01:09.930> an<00:01:10.049> impact<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.710> heart

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
so I guess create an impact in heart

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.330 
so I guess create an impact in heart
movie<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.490> guess<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.710> I'm<00:01:13.710> sure<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.159> also

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
movie I guess so I'm sure you also

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.460 
movie I guess so I'm sure you also
notice<00:01:14.670> these<00:01:14.820> sections<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.689> then

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
notice these sections because then

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.200 
notice these sections because then
you'll<00:01:16.619> create<00:01:16.799> courts<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.549> those<00:01:17.729> stupid

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
you'll create courts and those stupid

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.969 
you'll create courts and those stupid
little<00:01:18.330> spike<00:01:18.659> things<00:01:18.960> will<00:01:19.200> start<00:01:19.380> bouncing

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
little spike things will start bouncing

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.370 
little spike things will start bouncing

okay yes it has a benefit that you know
you<00:02:31.430> need<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.700> exploit<00:02:32.269> a<00:02:32.540> certain<00:02:33.350> stage<00:02:33.650> a

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
you need to exploit a certain stage a

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.860 
you need to exploit a certain stage a
couple<00:02:35.330> stages<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:36.019> couple<00:02:36.800> yeah<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.150> then

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.620 

another<00:02:58.530> good<00:02:58.650> strategy<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.400> probably<00:03:00.090> you

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
another good strategy is probably you

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.060 
another good strategy is probably you
know<00:03:00.750> just<00:03:00.780> charging<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.410> using<00:03:01.620> plays<00:03:01.800> or<00:03:01.980> if

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
know just charging and using plays or if

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.720 
know just charging and using plays or if
you're<00:03:02.160> not<00:03:02.250> wanted<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:03.500> yeah<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:05.040> don't

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
you're not wanted to yeah but I don't

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.600 
you're not wanted to yeah but I don't
use<00:03:06.000> tornado<00:03:06.420> hold<00:03:06.660> up<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.840> want<00:03:07.080> in<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.610> video

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
use tornado hold up I want in this video

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.850 
use tornado hold up I want in this video
so<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:08.940> wanted<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.420> make<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.810> most<00:03:09.960> of<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.260> also

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
so I wanted to make the most of it also

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.390 
so I wanted to make the most of it also
tornado<00:03:11.640> hold<00:03:11.940> can<00:03:12.180> erase<00:03:12.570> shots<00:03:13.400> from

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
tornado hold can erase shots from

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.730 
tornado hold can erase shots from
enemies<00:03:16.670> let<00:03:17.670> me<00:03:17.760> die<00:03:18.090> zeros<00:03:18.630> as<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.020> like<00:03:19.380> god<00:03:19.709> I

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
enemies let me die zeros as I like god I

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.470 
enemies let me die zeros as I like god I
somehow<00:03:20.340> died<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:21.180> actual<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:23.070> we<00:03:23.280> had<00:03:23.430> yet<00:03:23.610> I

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
somehow died you actual and we had yet I

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.320 
somehow died you actual and we had yet I
think<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.780> was<00:03:25.170> rush<00:03:25.440> cycle<00:03:25.800> there<00:03:26.330> yeah

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
think that was rush cycle there yeah

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.750 
think that was rush cycle there yeah
that<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.690> rush<00:03:27.959> cycle<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.410> think<00:03:28.650> all<00:03:29.580> these

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
that is rush cycle I think all these

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.300 
that is rush cycle I think all these
random<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.420> polyps<00:03:31.110> that<00:03:31.230> aren't<00:03:31.620> any

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
random is polyps that aren't any

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.510 
random is polyps that aren't any
