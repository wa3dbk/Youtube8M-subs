hey<00:00:00.810> guys<00:00:01.469> michael<00:00:01.920> 190<00:00:02.310> again<00:00:02.550> this<00:00:03.270> would<00:00:03.449> be

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey guys michael 190 again this would be

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.780 
hey guys michael 190 again this would be
the<00:00:03.629> second<00:00:04.200> star<00:00:04.440> for<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.220> taller<00:00:05.490> trunk

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
the second star for the taller trunk

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.160 
the second star for the taller trunk
galaxy<00:00:09.320> this<00:00:10.320> one<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.639> bit<00:00:11.940> harder<00:00:12.780> than<00:00:12.809> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
galaxy this one is a bit harder than the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.000 
galaxy this one is a bit harder than the
first<00:00:13.230> because<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.460> float<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.599> it

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
first because you have to float up to it

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.160 
first because you have to float up to it
well<00:00:17.010> at<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> same<00:00:17.490> time<00:00:19.220> moving<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.460> left

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
well at the same time moving to the left

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.290 
well at the same time moving to the left
you'll<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.199> what<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.560> mean<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> second<00:00:26.300> you're

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
you'll see what I mean a second you're

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.890 
you'll see what I mean a second you're
basically<00:00:28.789> you're<00:00:29.789> either<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.449> parts

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
basically you're either up the parts

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.700 
basically you're either up the parts
where<00:00:31.199> you're<00:00:32.390> hmm<00:00:33.390> how<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.290> explain<00:00:34.500> this

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.350 

there's<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.800> part<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> level<00:00:38.640> where<00:00:38.879> you

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
there's a part of the level where you

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.650 
there's a part of the level where you
basically<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:40.260> fall<00:00:40.559> for<00:00:40.950> an<00:00:41.570> innocent<00:00:42.570> on

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
basically can fall for an innocent on

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.369 
basically can fall for an innocent on
time<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.290> still<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.680> fine

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
time and still be fine

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:56.530 
time and still be fine
it's<00:00:48.050> hmm<00:00:50.510> we'll<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.660> what<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.840> mean

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.060 

I'm<00:00:57.540> not<00:00:57.720> really<00:00:57.840> good<00:00:58.110> explained<00:00:58.590> things<00:00:58.950> on

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
I'm not really good explained things on

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:11.970 
I'm not really good explained things on
the<00:00:59.160> spot

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.940 

all<00:01:12.550> right<00:01:12.700> here<00:01:12.850> we<00:01:12.940> go

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
all right here we go

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.180 
all right here we go
coming<00:01:15.700> up<00:01:15.820> on<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.150> level<00:01:19.800> this<00:01:20.800> is<00:01:21.010> what<00:01:21.159> I

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
coming up on the level this is what I

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.230 
coming up on the level this is what I
was<00:01:21.400> talking<00:01:21.729> about

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
was talking about

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.620 
was talking about
he<00:01:22.750> basically<00:01:22.960> can<00:01:23.500> fall<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:25.270> rotate

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
he basically can fall and you rotate

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.710 
he basically can fall and you rotate
around<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.530> planet<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.100> not<00:01:27.510> worry<00:01:28.510> about

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
around the planet and not worry about

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.790 
around the planet and not worry about
dying<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.540> get<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.780> star<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.350> have<00:01:32.410> to<00:01:32.619> get

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
dying so to get the star you have to get

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.109 
dying so to get the star you have to get
that<00:01:32.950> fruit<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.420> move<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.810> left

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that fruit and move to the left

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.109 
that fruit and move to the left
okay<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.210> well<00:01:37.330> get<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.020> star<00:01:38.940> but<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.000> have

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
okay and well get the star but you have

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.780 
okay and well get the star but you have
to<00:01:40.240> do<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.530> either<00:01:41.530> in<00:01:41.800> a<00:01:41.860> way<00:01:42.009> that<00:01:42.310> propels

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
to do it either in a way that propels

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.050 
to do it either in a way that propels
you<00:01:42.970> up<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.390> or<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:45.070> could<00:01:45.340> obviously<00:01:45.460> and

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
you up to it or you could obviously and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.320 
you up to it or you could obviously and
jump<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.479> it<00:01:46.830> when<00:01:47.830> I<00:01:47.890> finally<00:01:48.160> got<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.640> star<00:01:48.910> I

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
jump to it when I finally got the star I

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.450 
jump to it when I finally got the star I
did<00:01:50.289> it<00:01:50.380> at<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.500> right<00:01:50.680> angle<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.430> right

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
did it at the right angle and the right

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:00.480 
did it at the right angle and the right
speed<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.270> just<00:01:52.630> flow<00:01:52.899> into<00:01:53.259> it<00:01:59.310> alright<00:02:00.310> this

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
speed to just flow into it alright this

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.480 
speed to just flow into it alright this
time<00:02:00.550> I<00:02:03.630> missed<00:02:04.630> just<00:02:04.780> by<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.170> few<00:02:05.259> inches<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.369> I

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
time I missed just by a few inches and I

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:20.960 
time I missed just by a few inches and I
fall

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.080 

and<00:02:21.970> for<00:02:22.150> some<00:02:22.330> reason<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:23.550> get<00:02:24.550> stuck<00:02:24.849> in<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
and for some reason I get stuck in the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:36.830 
and for some reason I get stuck in the
damn<00:02:25.330> pipe<00:02:25.569> again

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.020 

I'll<00:02:37.410> get<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.860> time<00:02:38.099> I<00:02:39.739> see<00:02:40.739> I'm<00:02:41.099> moving<00:02:41.880> to

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
I'll get this time I see I'm moving to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.640 
I'll get this time I see I'm moving to
left<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:43.760> bounced<00:02:44.760> off<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:44.970> top<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.050> hit

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
left I bounced off the top but I hit

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.980 
left I bounced off the top but I hit
star
