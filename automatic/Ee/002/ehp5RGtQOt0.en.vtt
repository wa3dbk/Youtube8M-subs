00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.749 
really know the difference between the
hybrid<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.470> regular<00:01:47.860> is<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.280> there<00:01:48.580> are

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
hybrid and the regular is that there are

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.620 
hybrid and the regular is that there are
certain<00:01:49.119> people<00:01:49.810> in<00:01:49.899> life<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.909> that<00:01:52.030> there<00:01:52.450> are

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
certain people in life is that there are

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.179 
certain people in life is that there are
more<00:01:52.780> buttons<00:01:53.110> in<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.289> back<00:01:53.409> vibrate<00:01:54.009> and

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
more buttons in the back vibrate and

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.190 
more buttons in the back vibrate and
what's<00:01:54.880> cool<00:01:55.060> about<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.299> is<00:01:55.479> also<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.140> don't

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
what's cool about it is also I don't

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.279 
what's cool about it is also I don't
know<00:01:56.470> if<00:01:56.530> this<00:01:56.710> cost<00:01:56.979> more<00:01:57.340> or<00:01:57.580> not<00:01:57.700> but<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:59.170> can

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
know if this cost more or not but we can

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.010 
know if this cost more or not but we can
get<00:01:59.500> remappable<00:02:00.189> a<00:02:00.670> remappable<00:02:01.420> scone<00:02:01.750> I

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
get remappable a remappable scone I

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.859 
get remappable a remappable scone I
think<00:02:02.259> that's<00:02:02.380> what's<00:02:02.590> called<00:02:03.360> I'm<00:02:04.360> sorry<00:02:04.689> for

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
think that's what's called I'm sorry for

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.840 
think that's what's called I'm sorry for
Ron<00:02:05.020> but<00:02:05.350> it's<00:02:06.009> basically<00:02:06.310> where<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.700> can

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
Ron but it's basically where you can

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.270 
Ron but it's basically where you can
change<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.149> buttons<00:02:07.509> on<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.659> back<00:02:07.840> and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
change the buttons on the back and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.169 
change the buttons on the back and
what's<00:02:09.280> cool<00:02:09.459> about<00:02:09.489> that<00:02:09.670> that's<00:02:09.970> what<00:02:10.090> the

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
what's cool about that that's what the

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.460 
what's cool about that that's what the
original<00:02:10.509> stuff<00:02:10.720> I'm<00:02:10.840> not<00:02:10.869> sure<00:02:11.140> if<00:02:11.230> they<00:02:11.319> add

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
original stuff I'm not sure if they add

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.330 
original stuff I'm not sure if they add
this<00:02:11.709> on<00:02:11.950> but<00:02:12.840> when<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.930> got<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:14.290> stuff<00:02:14.590> you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
this on but when I got this stuff you

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.220 
this on but when I got this stuff you
can't<00:02:15.670> change<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.060> buttons<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.989> had

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
can't change the buttons on that you had

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.470 
can't change the buttons on that you had
got<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.370> got<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.850> if<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.120> didn't<00:02:19.330> like<00:02:19.360> it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
you're kind of stuck with it so that's

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.949 
you're kind of stuck with it so that's
what's<00:02:21.850> really<00:02:21.880> cool<00:02:22.209> about<00:02:22.269> this<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.840> can

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
the strength between these two like

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.650 
the strength between these two like
obviously<00:03:24.250> there's<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.489> line<00:03:24.940> right<00:03:25.209> here<00:03:25.389> and

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
obviously there's a line right here and

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.449 
obviously there's a line right here and
right<00:03:26.139> here<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.769> change<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.190> strength

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
right here you can change the strength

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.570 
right here you can change the strength
