82-game<00:00:16.080> season<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.250> NHL<00:00:17.670> how<00:00:17.910> did<00:00:18.060> you

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
82-game season in the NHL how did you

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.670 
82-game season in the NHL how did you
how<00:00:18.600> would<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.779> assess<00:00:19.050> out<00:00:19.230> how<00:00:19.619> you

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
how would you assess out how you

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.290 
how would you assess out how you
performed<00:00:20.100> over<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> year<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.609> think<00:00:21.119> about

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
performed over the year I think about

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.210 
performed over the year I think about
pretty<00:00:21.510> well<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.900> mean<00:00:22.199> individually<00:00:22.560> i<00:00:22.949> think

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
pretty well I mean individually i think

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.679 
pretty well I mean individually i think
i<00:00:24.260> played<00:00:25.260> wall<00:00:25.560> maybe<00:00:26.480> becoming<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.599> little

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
i played wall maybe becoming a little

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.609 
i played wall maybe becoming a little
more<00:00:27.840> consistent<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> cards<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.619> and

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
more consistent is in the cards but and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.049 
more consistent is in the cards but and
i<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.949> certainly<00:00:32.130> play<00:00:32.430> better<00:00:32.700> that's<00:00:32.969> for

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
i can certainly play better that's for

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.100 
i can certainly play better that's for
sure<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.920> an<00:00:34.920> overall<00:00:35.430> i<00:00:35.460> think<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:36.059> i<00:00:36.719> will

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
sure but an overall i think it i will

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.410 
sure but an overall i think it i will
all<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.500> myself<00:00:37.620> usually<00:00:38.399> tries<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.940> 82<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
all for myself usually tries to 82 and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.810 
all for myself usually tries to 82 and
60<00:00:39.780> degrees<00:00:40.140> there<00:00:40.770> now<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> conscious<00:00:41.370> thought

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
60 degrees there now a conscious thought

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.069 
60 degrees there now a conscious thought
that<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.030> got<00:00:42.180> looking<00:00:42.480> back<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.930> guys

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
that you got looking back as you guys

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.389 
that you got looking back as you guys
thought<00:00:43.500> yet<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.980> had<00:00:44.160> something

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
thought yet you had something

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.660 
thought yet you had something
accomplished<00:00:45.000> by<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.450> point<00:00:45.660> oh<00:00:46.219> I<00:00:47.219> wouldn't

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
accomplished by that point oh I wouldn't

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.520 
accomplished by that point oh I wouldn't
say<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.360> mean<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:48.870> forgotten<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
say that I mean it was just forgotten to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.959 
say that I mean it was just forgotten to
a<00:00:49.590> slide<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.129> couldn't<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.430> out<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
a slide that we couldn't get out of and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.150 
a slide that we couldn't get out of and
you<00:00:51.899> know<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.079> dug<00:00:52.260> ourselves<00:00:52.289> too<00:00:52.829> deep<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
you know we dug ourselves too deep a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.619 
you know we dug ourselves too deep a
hole<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.489> climb<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> mean<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
hole to climb out of so I mean not that

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.680 
hole to climb out of so I mean not that
was<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> bottom<00:00:55.410> line<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:57.600> know

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
was just the bottom line and you know

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.810 
was just the bottom line and you know
it's<00:00:57.840> hard<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.109> think<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.520> know<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> few

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
it's hard to think that you know a few

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.689 
it's hard to think that you know a few
weeks<00:01:00.030> ago<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.329> were<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.500> 89<00:01:02.370> from<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
weeks ago we were you know 89 from the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.030 
weeks ago we were you know 89 from the
league<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:03.600> ur<00:01:03.629> towards<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> bottom<00:01:04.710> so

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
league and now ur towards the bottom so

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.719 
league and now ur towards the bottom so
I<00:01:05.070> mean<00:01:05.250> that's<00:01:05.280> pretty<00:01:05.580> drastic<00:01:05.760> slide<00:01:06.360> but

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
I mean that's pretty drastic slide but

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
I mean that's pretty drastic slide but
we<00:01:08.729> played<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.540> well<00:01:09.689> at<00:01:09.990> points<00:01:10.770> this

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
we played really well at points this

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.020 
we played really well at points this
year<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.369> mean<00:01:11.549> that's<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> be

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
year but I mean that's going to be

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.730 
year but I mean that's going to be
something<00:01:12.659> focus<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.200> next<00:01:13.350> year's<00:01:13.470> that

consistency because of that do you have
to<00:01:15.720> prepare<00:01:16.080> yourself<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.619> changes<00:01:17.009> whether

League to go on some pretty deep runs

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.520 
League to go on some pretty deep runs
and<00:02:10.910> that's<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.870> best<00:02:12.050> time<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.230> year<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.440> be

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
and that's the best time of year to be

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.949 
and that's the best time of year to be
playing<00:02:13.069> hockey's<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.670> spring<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.870> know

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
playing hockey's in the spring you know

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.100 
playing hockey's in the spring you know
it's<00:02:15.080> nice<00:02:15.230> outside<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:17.630> know<00:02:17.690> but<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:17.959> is

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
it's nice outside you know but this is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.449 
it's nice outside you know but this is
something<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.470> we<00:02:18.620> can<00:02:18.769> take<00:02:18.920> definitely<00:02:19.370> as

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
something that we can take definitely as

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.350 
something that we can take definitely as
an<00:02:19.550> experience<00:02:20.060> where<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.660> younger<00:02:20.989> team<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.620> I

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
an experience where a younger team so I

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.300 
an experience where a younger team so I
personally<00:02:23.360> really<00:02:23.720> think<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:25.100> it's<00:02:25.220> going

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
personally really think that it's going

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.920 
personally really think that it's going
to<00:02:25.400> benefit<00:02:25.730> us<00:02:25.850> in<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.030> long<00:02:26.120> run<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.780> it

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
to benefit us in the long run is it

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.420 
to benefit us in the long run is it
tough<00:02:27.080> in<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.470> second<00:02:27.830> on<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.980> second<00:02:28.310> line

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
tough in the second on the second line

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.830 
tough in the second on the second line
you<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.940> Joffrey<00:02:29.209> played<00:02:29.420> an<00:02:29.540> awful<00:02:29.780> lot

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
you and Joffrey played an awful lot

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.840 
you and Joffrey played an awful lot
together<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.380> at<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:30.980> same<00:02:31.130> time<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.640> was

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
together and at the same time it was

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.610 
together and at the same time it was
tough<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.360> find<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.780> consistent<00:02:33.050> partner<00:02:33.440> where

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
tough to find a consistent partner where

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.660 
tough to find a consistent partner where
that<00:02:33.709> David<00:02:33.950> was<00:02:34.069> in<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.340> out<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.580> lineup

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
that David was in and out of the lineup

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.220 
that David was in and out of the lineup
in<00:02:34.970> different<00:02:35.269> times<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.630> use<00:02:35.750> mason<00:02:36.019> at

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
in different times you use mason at

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.140 
in different times you use mason at
different<00:02:36.500> times<00:02:36.709> will<00:02:37.580> that<00:02:37.730> be<00:02:37.760> helpful

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
different times will that be helpful

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.970 
different times will that be helpful
whoever<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:39.080> play<00:02:39.350> with<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.620> same<00:02:39.800> two

guys more often oh absolutely i mean

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.650 
guys more often oh absolutely i mean
that's<00:02:43.430> how<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.670> generate<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.630> most

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
that's how you generate the most

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.229 
that's how you generate the most
chemistry<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.590> no<00:02:45.950> no<00:02:46.850> we're<00:02:47.030> guys

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
chemistry and no no we're guys

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.390 
chemistry and no no we're guys
underlying<00:02:47.720> i'm<00:02:47.810> going<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:47.989> be<00:02:48.110> so<00:02:48.470> i<00:02:48.739> think

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
underlying i'm going to be so i think

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.740 
underlying i'm going to be so i think
that<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:49.670> was<00:02:49.970> really<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.239> difficult

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
that that was really the difficult

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.420 
that that was really the difficult
challenge<00:02:51.170> for<00:02:51.350> us<00:02:51.410> this<00:02:51.620> year<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:52.070> having

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
challenge for us this year is having

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.190 
challenge for us this year is having
guys<00:02:52.610> come<00:02:52.940> into<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.420> lineup<00:02:53.600> obviously<00:02:54.079> it's

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
guys come into the lineup obviously it's

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.440 
guys come into the lineup obviously it's
no<00:02:54.290> excuse<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.980> every<00:02:55.790> team's<00:02:56.000> got<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.299> deal

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
no excuse and every team's got to deal

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.789 
no excuse and every team's got to deal
with<00:02:56.480> then<00:02:56.780> we<00:02:56.930> should<00:02:57.170> be<00:02:57.200> able<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.530> find<00:02:57.680> a

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
with then we should be able to find a

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.100 
with then we should be able to find a
way<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:57.950> cope<00:02:58.220> but<00:02:58.720> no<00:02:59.720> one<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.930> have

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
way to cope but no one you have

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.130 
way to cope but no one you have
different<00:03:00.380> guys<00:03:00.650> no<00:03:01.610> pop<00:03:01.820> in<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.060> lineup<00:03:02.540> moving

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
different guys no pop in a lineup moving

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.930 
different guys no pop in a lineup moving
up<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.350> down<00:03:03.440> lines<00:03:03.799> it's<00:03:04.250> hard<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.579> find<00:03:04.790> that

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
up and down lines it's hard to find that

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.479 
up and down lines it's hard to find that
rhythm<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.570> consistency<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.620> know

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
rhythm and that consistency you know

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.120 
rhythm and that consistency you know
with<00:03:07.610> certain<00:03:07.880> players
