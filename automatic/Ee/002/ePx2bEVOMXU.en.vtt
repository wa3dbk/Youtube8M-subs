00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 aristide filters I hope you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.270
 be fine then today it's 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.639
 besides collaborations with my 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.639
 girlfriend of empty chair at waist 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.880
 then more than a style even decided 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.190
 to make a collaboration 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.160
 So it's a mid cap that we will 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.539
 do and I also did seven feet of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.279
 hairstyle steep for the little story 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.199
 pure style and mellow knowledge of 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.650
 piles high schools so we did the class of 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.750
 1st set but gave up loss of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.610
 view and on youtube we know not recognized 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.469
 right away it took a friend of 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.170
 place nor tag together a photo facebook 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.790
 so that we realize in fact 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.920
 French has been around for a long time 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.930
 I invite you to check the chain of 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.570
 peace saw an internship you put the link in 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.219
 the info bar has made itself 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.200
 too funny videos to go very 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.059
 very funny so you're not going 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.699
 to bore with her to ethics and her 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.719
 chain there are five videos 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.640
 collaboration then you have to know that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.160
 generally I wore rhythm enough 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.960
 so simple in the video it will be 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.859
 also before the Nazi caps so 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.650
 here I let you watch the video 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.270
 and your opinions are welcome I will 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.840
 start with rising that I 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.930
 am going to use the most meaningful corrector 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.400
 to hide the tasks depigmentation 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.229
 that I can have on the faces 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.600
 in fact these are tasks every time 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.220
 that I have a button that disappears into me 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.479
 leaving a task that takes a little bit of 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.170
 time before fading 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.960
 so here I take what we win for 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.090
 cover that task and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.700
 the second correctors which is clearer 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.130
 him l use as collateral I 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.020
 take a bit of material I put it there 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.810
 under the eye while tapping 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.430
 to divide the material 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.080
 stamped I do the same on the other side 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.280
 do I like to do it 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.430
 put some material su carry 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.810
 question of giving a little more relief 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.929
 to mount I will use this powder 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.119
 compact of schemes to unify amount 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.170
 so avoid there being any demarcation 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.360
 between places where I put 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.250
 collector them as I have not 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.860
 put and therefore also to illuminate the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.500
 face 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.500
 then we go too I go very 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.930
 but it's also that I've already 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.640
 the worry is enough provided so I I 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.660
 simply retrace by following the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.810
 traditional malsaucy 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.220
 and I use these pencils associates from 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.110
 mac that is the brown one and that's right 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.310
 it's a bit expensive it's been two years 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.090
 that I use it may be time that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.329
 I'm already thinking of replacing it with a 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.310
 other 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:50.329
 pencil them for the moment that's the one 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.799
 that I 'm fine with them 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.200
 eyes I will use blushes to 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.670
 eyelids from mac mainly the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.670
 white and burgundy so I take a 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.200
 flat brush I draw from the plan I 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.750
 will apply on the entire eyelid 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.329
 mobile 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.400
 I take this burgundy color that 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.650
 I'm applying on the outer part of my 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.370
 eyelid moving up to the level of the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:20.239
 pupil and I'm well blurred mix 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.040
 all with a big brush with a 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.850
 people in the hair so we lose or save 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.459
 now fled with a personal end I 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.340
 am going to take walleye I apply it in 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.980
 the hollow a complexion of my eye for 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.920
 give 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.510
 more light my look and for finished 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.549
 flow with my daughter I still take the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.790
 golden I'm going to apply it at the level of the 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.909
 also breaks yesterday to bring also 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.560
 more light guys there I am my 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.519
 look to give him more presence 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.040
 with black pencil from slick and the 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.049
 finished by pic mascara which is mascara 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.160
 3d from mac that also allows 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:02.069
 to enlarge the look that's what I like 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.140
 the moment so we will go to the air I 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.629
 will hydrate my lips with this 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.489
 plumper lip balm of lomÃ© place 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.579
 but do not know it's speaking boumhalef 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.829
 well it's doing his job very well and I 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.049
 will draw my lips with this 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.310
 mac pencil I will put in the 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.930
 info bar information 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.720
 concerning products for those who 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.130
 are interesting then I'm going 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.500
 apply this lipstick the scheme 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.270
 who actually is or not that means that 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.530
 I realized that for my 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.190
 but as I have almost only 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.070
 mac products 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.620
 so maybe I need to start 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.639
 test something else power but at the same 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.470
 time having to use the marks 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.210
 I had tested something else already that did not 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.800
 did not work as well as these 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.440
 but here I am still going to try 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.900
 diversify all that 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.610
 the result is a neutral make-up 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.500
 and we will go to the hairstyle 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.500
 here I ask vanilla I was leaving 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.150
 not a little brown and to style them I 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.800
 just brought back a small 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.650
 portion of hair on the side as 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:13.939
 these he wants to put penalties for 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:16.159
 secure to salt that world's for 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:20.360
 pack my bags to use the podium 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:22.069
 Bansi Nkol home african pride and 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.500
 it was my second time used 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:29.120
 so far they think it's okay 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.810
 defines me pretty well the tastes here is the 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:44.569
 result 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:46.189
 hairstyle and make up that's it's the end 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.979
 of the video I hope you have 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:51.080
 appreciated the death of Ali because 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.569
 it's my historical premium rate up and I 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.200
 know that I'm seen clumsy in everything 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:59.110
 case so 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.970

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.680
 say very soon forget the 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.550
 women to go watch the chain of 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.460
 pepinster
