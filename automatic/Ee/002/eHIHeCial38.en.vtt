for you today so of course every gate
film<00:00:06.839> has<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.350> lot<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.620> plot<00:00:08.040> twists<00:00:08.580> or<00:00:08.760> one<00:00:09.540> or

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
film has a lot of plot twists or one or

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.540 
film has a lot of plot twists or one or
two<00:00:10.019> great<00:00:10.440> plot<00:00:10.740> twists<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:11.340> i<00:00:11.400> was<00:00:11.490> thinking

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
two great plot twists but i was thinking

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.789 
two great plot twists but i was thinking
really<00:00:12.120> about<00:00:12.360> what<00:00:12.750> Batman<00:00:13.110> V<00:00:13.230> Superman<00:00:13.259> can

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
really about what Batman V Superman can

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.289 
really about what Batman V Superman can
do<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.099> really<00:00:14.250> differentiate<00:00:14.670> itself<00:00:15.150> from

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
do to really differentiate itself from

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.290 
do to really differentiate itself from
the<00:00:16.279> text<00:00:17.279> particularly<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> Dark<00:00:18.150> Knight

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
the text particularly the Dark Knight

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.880 
the text particularly the Dark Knight
Returns<00:00:18.390> which<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.080> appears<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.470> be<00:00:19.619> drawing

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
Returns which it appears to be drawing

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.830 
Returns which it appears to be drawing
from<00:00:20.160> quite<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> bit<00:00:20.850> what<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.449> came<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
from quite a bit what I came to the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.570 
from quite a bit what I came to the
conclusion<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.890> there<00:00:23.039> really<00:00:23.070> isn't

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
conclusion of is that there really isn't

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.580 
conclusion of is that there really isn't
a<00:00:23.609> whole<00:00:23.640> ton<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.720> they<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:25.019> do<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.289> terms<00:00:25.320> of

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
a whole ton that they can do in terms of

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.099 
a whole ton that they can do in terms of
variety<00:00:26.099> from<00:00:26.699> previous<00:00:27.240> iterations<00:00:27.779> such<00:00:27.990> as

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
variety from previous iterations such as

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.929 
variety from previous iterations such as
the<00:00:28.199> dark<00:00:28.349> knight<00:00:28.500> returns<00:00:28.650> if<00:00:29.429> think<00:00:29.789> about

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the dark knight returns if think about

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.669 
the dark knight returns if think about
it<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.150> well<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.660> these<00:00:30.900> characters<00:00:31.500> are

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
it as well is that these characters are

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.500 
it as well is that these characters are
going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.279> broadcasted<00:00:33.030> throughout<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
going to be broadcasted throughout the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.920 
going to be broadcasted throughout the
rest<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.050> wave<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.440> DCC<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.910> films<00:00:36.450> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
rest of this wave of DCC you films so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.900 
rest of this wave of DCC you films so
that<00:00:37.110> all<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.440> way<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:37.860> into<00:00:38.100> 2019<00:00:38.730> with

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
that all the way up into 2019 with

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
that all the way up into 2019 with
Justice<00:00:39.180> League<00:00:39.360> Two<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.809> beyond<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
Justice League Two and beyond with the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.069 
Justice League Two and beyond with the
Batman<00:00:41.370> standalone<00:00:42.210> film<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.719> presumably

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
Batman standalone film and presumably

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.959 
Batman standalone film and presumably
Superman<00:00:43.739> might<00:00:43.920> get<00:00:44.160> another<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.789> well

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
Superman might get another one as well

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.330 
Superman might get another one as well
maybe<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.390> trilogy<00:00:45.780> who<00:00:46.020> knows<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.950> either<00:00:47.129> way

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
maybe a trilogy who knows but either way

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.680 
maybe a trilogy who knows but either way
Batman's<00:00:47.730> definitely<00:00:48.090> getting<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> standalone

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
Batman's definitely getting a standalone

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.360 
Batman's definitely getting a standalone
film<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.410> today<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.649> thought<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.980> would<00:00:50.039> lay<00:00:50.250> out

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
film so today I thought it would lay out

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.010 
film so today I thought it would lay out
really<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.670> only<00:00:50.940> logical<00:00:51.270> way<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.960> can

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
really the only logical way that I can

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200 
really the only logical way that I can
see<00:00:52.379> batman<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.949> superman<00:00:52.980> ending<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.940> also

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
see batman be superman ending and also

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.240 
see batman be superman ending and also
the<00:00:54.449> big<00:00:54.629> steps<00:00:55.079> along<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.410> way<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the big steps along the way not just the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.430 
the big steps along the way not just the
very<00:00:56.370> very<00:00:56.699> end<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.390> also<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.870> major<00:00:58.109> plot

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
very very end but also the major plot

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.889 
very very end but also the major plot
points<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.129> happen<00:00:59.609> along<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.940> way<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.780> if

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
points that happen along the way but if

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.270 
points that happen along the way but if
you<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:00.989> about<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.260> because<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.980> film

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you think about it because of this film

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
you think about it because of this film
leads<00:01:02.640> into<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> next<00:01:03.030> wave<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.690> DCC<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
leads into the next wave of the DCC you

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.190 
leads into the next wave of the DCC you
know<00:01:05.309> characters<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.299> die<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> only

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
know characters can really die the only

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
know characters can really die the only
characters<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.890> i<00:01:07.950> could<00:01:08.310> deem<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.909> be

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
characters that i could deem to be

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.090 
characters that i could deem to be
somewhat<00:01:09.810> unsafe<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.530> i<00:01:10.619> actually<00:01:10.770> would

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
somewhat unsafe and i actually would

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.530 
somewhat unsafe and i actually would
predict<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.520> alfred<00:01:11.909> could<00:01:12.090> potentially

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
predict that alfred could potentially

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.789 
predict that alfred could potentially
die<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.960> film<00:01:13.229> i<00:01:13.350> would<00:01:13.590> not<00:01:13.740> be

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
die in this film i would not be

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.590 
die in this film i would not be
surprised<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.460> Alfred<00:01:14.790> died<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.330> film

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
surprised if Alfred died in this film

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
surprised if Alfred died in this film
and<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.259> Batman<00:01:16.560> standalone<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.729> could

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and the Batman standalone that could

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.880 
and the Batman standalone that could
feed<00:01:17.909> into<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.810> well<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.320> would<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.740> be

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
feed into that as well I would not be

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.070 
feed into that as well I would not be
surprised<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.570> fact<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:22.020> am

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
surprised at all and in fact I am

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.990 
surprised at all and in fact I am
predicting<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.040> Alfred<00:01:23.460> will<00:01:23.580> die<00:01:23.759> that's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
predicting that Alfred will die that's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.670 
predicting that Alfred will die that's
just<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.330> personal<00:01:24.600> thought<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.380> reason

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
just my personal thought and the reason

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.200 
just my personal thought and the reason
i<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> no<00:01:26.700> other<00:01:26.850> batman

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
i think that is that a no other batman

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.460 
i think that is that a no other batman
film<00:01:27.390> would<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.630> kill<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> character<00:01:28.350> like

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
film would you kill a character like

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.260 
film would you kill a character like

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
suppose they don't have to kill anyone

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.230 
suppose they don't have to kill anyone
but<00:02:05.009> I'm<00:02:05.189> predicting<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.759> Alfred<00:02:06.090> dies

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
but I'm predicting that Alfred dies

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.999 
but I'm predicting that Alfred dies
that's<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.899> me<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.469> thinking<00:02:07.710> about<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
that's just me so thinking about the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.440 
that's just me so thinking about the
fighting<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.399> think<00:02:08.580> there's<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.000> be<00:02:09.030> two

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
fighting I think there's going to be two

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.869 
fighting I think there's going to be two
main<00:02:09.869> fights<00:02:10.229> between<00:02:10.619> Batman<00:02:11.160> Superman<00:02:11.400> kind

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
main fights between Batman Superman kind

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.309 
main fights between Batman Superman kind
of<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> same<00:02:12.239> layout<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.870> film

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
of the same layout of a film

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.660 
of the same layout of a film
The<00:02:13.530> Dark<00:02:13.739> Knight<00:02:13.769> Rises<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.400> have<00:02:14.549> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
The Dark Knight Rises you have the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.610 
The Dark Knight Rises you have the
initial<00:02:15.090> fight<00:02:15.269> where<00:02:15.540> maybe<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.959> winner<00:02:16.319> is

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
initial fight where maybe a winner is

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.890 
initial fight where maybe a winner is
somewhat<00:02:17.099> declared<00:02:17.549> or<00:02:17.760> whatever<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:18.780> then

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
somewhat declared or whatever and then

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.270 
somewhat declared or whatever and then
the<00:02:18.989> second<00:02:19.319> one<00:02:19.349> has<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> different<00:02:20.069> outcome

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
the second one has a different outcome

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.160 
the second one has a different outcome
and<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> think<00:02:20.999> that<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> first<00:02:21.510> one<00:02:21.959> is

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
and I think that the first one is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.629 
and I think that the first one is
different<00:02:22.590> because<00:02:22.889> we<00:02:23.010> saw<00:02:23.189> in<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.310> reveal

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:23.639 
different because we saw in the reveal

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.190 
different because we saw in the reveal
trailer<00:02:23.999> you<00:02:24.120> know<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.359> one<00:02:24.540> where<00:02:24.749> Batman's

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
trailer you know the one where Batman's

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.020 
trailer you know the one where Batman's
like<00:02:25.409> do<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.620> bleed<00:02:25.889> if<00:02:26.129> not<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.430> will<00:02:26.579> boba

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
like do you bleed if not you will boba

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.309 
like do you bleed if not you will boba
that<00:02:27.359> actually<00:02:27.599> looks<00:02:27.749> like<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> different

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
that actually looks like a different

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.780 
that actually looks like a different
setting<00:02:28.560> from<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.129> fight<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.489> occurs

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
setting from the fight that occurs

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.599 
setting from the fight that occurs
second<00:02:30.659> in<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.989> actual<00:02:31.500> trailer<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.189> also

second in the actual trailer and also

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.339 
second in the actual trailer and also
you<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.060> scene<00:02:33.450> where<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.810> batwing<00:02:34.170> is

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
you have the scene where the batwing is

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.559 
you have the scene where the batwing is
flying<00:02:34.799> in<00:02:34.980> between<00:02:35.310> over<00:02:35.639> the<00:02:35.730> bay<00:02:35.879> and<00:02:36.120> of

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
flying in between over the bay and of

cities<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.629> film<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.019> they're<00:02:40.139> closer

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
cities in this film so they're closer

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.280 
cities in this film so they're closer
like<00:02:40.709> San<00:02:41.430> Diego<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.299> Los<00:02:42.540> Angeles<00:02:42.989> or

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
like San Diego and like Los Angeles or

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.659 
like San Diego and like Los Angeles or

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:44.669 
something they made the comparison at

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.339 
something they made the comparison at
comic-con<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.299> they're<00:02:45.689> very<00:02:45.900> close<00:02:46.079> together

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.599 
and the bat wings like flying in between
both<00:02:49.139> of<00:02:49.200> these<00:02:49.409> cities<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.829> that<00:02:50.340> actually

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
both of these cities and that actually

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.909 
both of these cities and that actually
appears<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.389> be<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.510> different<00:02:52.109> fight<00:02:52.379> because

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
appears to be a different fight because

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.679 
appears to be a different fight because
it's<00:02:53.280> not<00:02:53.430> raining<00:02:53.699> and<00:02:53.909> that<00:02:54.060> scene<00:02:54.299> in<00:02:54.599> the

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
it's not raining and that scene in the

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.809 
it's not raining and that scene in the
first<00:02:54.959> scene<00:02:55.199> it<00:02:55.349> is<00:02:55.500> raining<00:02:55.829> so<00:02:56.400> my

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
first scene it is raining so my

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.490 
first scene it is raining so my
prediction<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.599> that<00:02:57.659> they<00:02:57.900> actually<00:02:57.930> fight

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
prediction is that they actually fight

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.890 
prediction is that they actually fight
twice<00:02:58.889> and<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.639> resolved<00:02:59.969> that<00:03:00.269> way<00:03:00.419> however

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
twice and it's resolved that way however

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.629 
twice and it's resolved that way however
in<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.260> second<00:03:01.620> film<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.010> ultimately<00:03:02.400> there

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
in the second film and ultimately there

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.339 
in the second film and ultimately there
will<00:03:02.669> be<00:03:02.939> no<00:03:03.060> conclusive<00:03:03.449> winner<00:03:03.870> there's<00:03:04.139> no

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
will be no conclusive winner there's no

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.020 
will be no conclusive winner there's no
way<00:03:04.469> that<00:03:04.620> one<00:03:04.799> person<00:03:05.189> can<00:03:05.310> win<00:03:05.519> over<00:03:05.549> another

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
way that one person can win over another

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.369 
way that one person can win over another
and<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.359> reason<00:03:06.659> is<00:03:06.780> they<00:03:06.900> have<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.199> make<00:03:07.349> up

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
and the reason is they have to make up

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.129 
and the reason is they have to make up
at<00:03:07.650> one<00:03:07.829> point<00:03:08.040> now<00:03:08.669> Lex<00:03:09.209> Luthor<00:03:09.659> there's<00:03:10.049> a

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
at one point now Lex Luthor there's a

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.360 
at one point now Lex Luthor there's a
lot<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.290> controversy<00:03:10.829> over<00:03:10.859> Lex<00:03:11.159> Luthor

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
lot of controversy over Lex Luthor

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.129 
lot of controversy over Lex Luthor
because<00:03:11.609> in<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.909> trailer<00:03:12.299> he<00:03:12.449> has<00:03:12.629> hair<00:03:12.930> and

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
because in the trailer he has hair and

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.289 
because in the trailer he has hair and
then<00:03:13.409> in<00:03:13.560> many<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:13.919> the<00:03:14.219> pictures<00:03:15.030> like

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
then in many of the pictures like

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.360 
then in many of the pictures like
promotional<00:03:15.900> pictures<00:03:16.049> for<00:03:16.439> the<00:03:16.500> film<00:03:16.769> he<00:03:17.219> is

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
promotional pictures for the film he is

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.399 
promotional pictures for the film he is
bald<00:03:17.699> as<00:03:17.970> he<00:03:18.239> isn't<00:03:18.509> every<00:03:18.989> comic<00:03:19.290> book

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
bald as he isn't every comic book

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.780 
bald as he isn't every comic book
iteration<00:03:19.889> and<00:03:20.040> how<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.310> character

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
iteration and how the character

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.330 
iteration and how the character
traditionally<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.389> depicted<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.560> there<00:03:23.099> has

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
traditionally is depicted so there has

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.460 
traditionally is depicted so there has
to<00:03:23.370> be<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.609> point<00:03:23.879> where<00:03:24.120> he<00:03:24.269> goes<00:03:24.479> from<00:03:24.780> hair<00:03:25.139> to

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
to be a point where he goes from hair to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.559 
to be a point where he goes from hair to
no<00:03:25.739> hair<00:03:25.979> and<00:03:26.159> I<00:03:26.549> think<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:26.939> point<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.359> kind

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
no hair and I think that point is kind

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.879 
no hair and I think that point is kind
of<00:03:27.659> like<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.870> best<00:03:28.229> comparison<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.680> can<00:03:28.799> think

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
of like the best comparison I can think

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.469 
of like the best comparison I can think
of<00:03:28.979> is<00:03:29.040> like<00:03:29.220> Darth<00:03:29.549> Vader<00:03:29.909> putting<00:03:30.299> on<00:03:30.389> the

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
of is like Darth Vader putting on the

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.330 
of is like Darth Vader putting on the
mask<00:03:30.629> or<00:03:30.930> whatever<00:03:31.319> this<00:03:31.680> it's<00:03:31.979> kind<00:03:32.129> of<00:03:32.220> like

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
mask or whatever this it's kind of like

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.819 
mask or whatever this it's kind of like
the<00:03:32.459> transformation<00:03:33.150> from<00:03:33.389> good<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.169> evil<00:03:34.199> and

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
the transformation from good to evil and

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.170 
the transformation from good to evil and
he's<00:03:35.040> not<00:03:35.189> good<00:03:35.519> at<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.759> beginning<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.120> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
he's not good at the beginning of the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.390 
he's not good at the beginning of the
film<00:03:36.359> by<00:03:36.479> no<00:03:36.599> means<00:03:36.780> but<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.169> the<00:03:37.409> good<00:03:37.590> in<00:03:38.189> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
film by no means but and the good in the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.740 
film by no means but and the good in the
trailer<00:03:38.699> he<00:03:38.819> seems<00:03:39.030> kind<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.329> like<00:03:39.479> playful

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
trailer he seems kind of like playful

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.259 
trailer he seems kind of like playful
and<00:03:40.259> I<00:03:40.290> don't<00:03:40.799> know<00:03:40.919> I<00:03:41.099> feel<00:03:41.549> like<00:03:41.699> when<00:03:42.060> he

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
and I don't know I feel like when he

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.210 
and I don't know I feel like when he
goes<00:03:42.449> bald<00:03:42.720> that's<00:03:42.930> when<00:03:43.259> Lex<00:03:43.560> Luthor<00:03:43.859> really

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
goes bald that's when Lex Luthor really

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.649 
goes bald that's when Lex Luthor really
comes<00:03:44.430> out<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:44.669> he<00:03:44.819> actually<00:03:45.000> turns<00:03:45.329> into<00:03:45.479> the

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
comes out and he actually turns into the

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.899 
comes out and he actually turns into the
villain<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.169> the<00:03:46.319> film<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.859> course<00:03:47.549> every<00:03:47.759> good

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
villain of the film of course every good

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.610 
villain of the film of course every good
film<00:03:48.120> has<00:03:48.329> an<00:03:48.419> antagonist<00:03:49.019> this<00:03:49.139> will<00:03:49.290> be<00:03:49.379> no

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
film has an antagonist this will be no

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.499 
film has an antagonist this will be no
different<00:03:50.069> Batman<00:03:50.579> or<00:03:50.819> Superman<00:03:51.030> are

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:51.509 
different Batman or Superman are

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.050 
different Batman or Superman are
antagonists<00:03:52.379> in<00:03:52.470> this<00:03:52.650> film<00:03:52.919> Lex<00:03:53.459> Luthor<00:03:53.879> is

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
antagonists in this film Lex Luthor is

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.300 
antagonists in this film Lex Luthor is
the<00:03:54.479> antagonist<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:55.829> think<00:03:56.040> what<00:03:56.159> you're

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
the antagonist and I think what you're

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.649 
the antagonist and I think what you're
going<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.549> realize<00:03:56.669> is<00:03:56.969> that<00:03:57.120> there's<00:03:57.449> going

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
going to realize is that there's going

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.449 
going to realize is that there's going
to<00:03:57.750> be<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.870> point<00:03:58.079> in<00:03:58.229> the<00:03:58.379> film<00:03:58.560> where<00:03:58.919> after

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
to be a point in the film where after

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.920 
to be a point in the film where after
maybe<00:03:59.639> the<00:03:59.879> second<00:04:00.239> fight<00:04:00.419> where<00:04:00.719> they

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
maybe the second fight where they

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.129 
maybe the second fight where they
resolve<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:02.069> they<00:04:02.430> kind<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.150> fat<00:04:03.509> team<00:04:03.810> up<00:04:03.989> and

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
resolve and they kind of fat team up and

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:05.479 
resolve and they kind of fat team up and
they<00:04:04.319> may<00:04:04.439> not<00:04:04.590> be<00:04:04.680> on<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.859> best<00:04:05.009> terms<00:04:05.099> like

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
they may not be on the best terms like

kind of plays out generally because the

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.710 
kind of plays out generally because the
premise<00:06:06.669> of<00:06:06.759> the<00:06:06.849> film<00:06:07.060> not<00:06:07.300> because<00:06:07.539> it's

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
premise of the film not because it's

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.899 
premise of the film not because it's
boring<00:06:07.990> but<00:06:08.349> just<00:06:08.860> because<00:06:09.009> tax<00:06:09.430> nighter<00:06:09.669> the

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
director is so limited to what he can do

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.379 
director is so limited to what he can do
with<00:06:11.919> the<00:06:12.190> film<00:06:12.430> and<00:06:12.669> what<00:06:12.909> directions<00:06:13.330> you

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389
