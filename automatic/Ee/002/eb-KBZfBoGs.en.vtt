only has about 1500 milliamp hours and
some<00:01:29.340> change<00:01:29.570> in<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.869> side<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
some change in the side of it so the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.819 
some change in the side of it so the
fact<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.210> gives<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.570> additional

designed<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.170> charging<00:02:01.770> unit<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:02.850> have

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
designed to be the charging unit we have

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.940 
designed to be the charging unit we have
a<00:02:03.000> place<00:02:03.240> where<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.600> plug<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
a place where we can plug this in to the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.449 
a place where we can plug this in to the
micro<00:02:05.310> USB<00:02:05.759> port<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.960> then<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.920> course<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
micro USB port and then of course it

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.029 
micro USB port and then of course it
will<00:02:08.610> charge<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.720> space<00:02:10.200> once<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> pull<00:02:10.920> this

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
will charge the space once you pull this

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.400 
will charge the space once you pull this
into<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.760> laptop<00:02:12.360> or<00:02:12.629> computer

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
into like a laptop or computer

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.100 
into like a laptop or computer
whatever<00:02:14.040> once<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.670> there<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:16.050> it

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
whatever once you can do there so it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.320 
whatever once you can do there so it
sits<00:02:16.320> amidst<00:02:16.620> material<00:02:17.010> side<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.370> got<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.610> use

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
sits amidst material side we got it use

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.120 
sits amidst material side we got it use
your<00:02:18.480> manual<00:02:18.840> they<00:02:19.020> give<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.320> there<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.710> then

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
your manual they give you there and then

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.890 
your manual they give you there and then
of<00:02:20.220> course<00:02:20.250> we've<00:02:20.970> got<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.180> case<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.840> of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
of course we've got the case in and of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.780 
of course we've got the case in and of
itself<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.590> looks<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.880> has<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:25.790> pull-off

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
itself and looks like it has a pull-off

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.720 
itself and looks like it has a pull-off
outer<00:02:27.300> area<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.500> will<00:02:28.830> take<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.160> hold<00:02:29.280> the

lays flat over here we have the power

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.480 
lays flat over here we have the power
element<00:02:36.810> function<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.070> can<00:02:38.220> see<00:02:38.400> we

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
element function of it you can see we

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.730 
element function of it you can see we
have<00:02:38.520> four<00:02:39.360> lights<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.840> take<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.320> show<00:02:40.560> us

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
have four lights that take and show us

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.770 
have four lights that take and show us
that<00:02:41.280> how<00:02:41.490> much<00:02:41.640> charge<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.030> left<00:02:42.270> in<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.600> and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
that how much charge is left in here and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.780 
that how much charge is left in here and
there's<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.200> little<00:02:43.410> too<00:02:43.710> capacitive<00:02:44.610> buttons

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
there's a little too capacitive buttons

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.290 
there's a little too capacitive buttons
there<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.260> course<00:02:46.470> those<00:02:46.860> will<00:02:47.130> lay<00:02:48.000> on

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
there and of course those will lay on

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.060 
there and of course those will lay on
this<00:02:48.600> thing<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.080> there's<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.710> little<00:02:49.800> bit<00:02:50.010> of

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
this thing and there's a little bit of

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.610 
this thing and there's a little bit of
magnetism<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:51.150> them<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.050> that's<00:02:52.230> really<00:02:52.350> good

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
magnetism to them so that's really good

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.500 
magnetism to them so that's really good
because<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:53.040> will<00:02:53.160> hold<00:02:53.670> your<00:02:53.880> phone<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.240> place

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
because it will hold your phone in place

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.690 
because it will hold your phone in place
so<00:02:55.260> very<00:02:55.590> good<00:02:55.710> that<00:02:55.890> way<00:02:55.980> we're<00:02:56.310> gonna<00:02:56.460> do<00:02:56.550> is

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
so very good that way we're gonna do is

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.370 
so very good that way we're gonna do is
test<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.060> out<00:02:57.180> come<00:02:57.450> back<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.840> tell<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.260> what

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
test it out come back and tell you what

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.010 
test it out come back and tell you what
we<00:02:58.470> really<00:02:58.710> think<00:02:59.150> okay<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.210> we've<00:03:00.570> got<00:03:00.810> the
