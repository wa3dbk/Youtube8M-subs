excellent excellent user coverage or you

excellent excellent user coverage or you
know<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:22.740> drop<00:01:22.979> their<00:01:23.130> defensive<00:01:23.549> end

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
know if they drop their defensive end

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.460

into<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> purple<00:01:24.299> zone<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> man<00:01:24.900> coverage<00:01:25.290> I

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
into a purple zone out of man coverage I

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.719 
into a purple zone out of man coverage I
suppose<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.950> would<00:01:26.070> probably<00:01:26.400> slow<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.700> down

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
suppose that would probably slow it down

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.810 
suppose that would probably slow it down
some<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:27.509> um<00:01:28.369> defensive<00:01:29.369> ends<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.610> pretty

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
some but um defensive ends are pretty

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
some but um defensive ends are pretty
slow<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.049> definitely<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.439> wait<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
slow so you can definitely just wait a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.810 
slow so you can definitely just wait a
second<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.430> still<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.509> completion<00:01:34.820> so

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
second and still get the completion so

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.060 
second and still get the completion so
like<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.060> said<00:01:36.240> guys<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> he<00:01:36.600> books<00:01:36.810> free<00:01:37.079> just

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and just you know take a look when the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.770 
and just you know take a look when the
when<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.610> defenders<00:01:48.090> pressed<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
when the defenders pressed up on the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.940 
when the defenders pressed up on the
receiver<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:49.860> an

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
receiver like that I like to do an

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.389 
receiver like that I like to do an
outside<00:01:50.280> slant<00:01:50.670> instead<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:53.189> route

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
outside slant instead of the out route

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.469 
outside slant instead of the out route
because<00:01:53.759> they<00:01:53.909> seem<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.210> get<00:01:54.299> better

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
because they seem to get better

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.249 
because they seem to get better
separation<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.509> we'll<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.810> again<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
separation so here we'll do it again and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.209 
separation so here we'll do it again and
this<00:01:58.380> time<00:01:58.439> I'll<00:01:58.770> show<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.189> guys

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
the safeties rotate don't even bother

the safeties rotate don't even bother
making<00:03:37.829> adjustments<00:03:38.489> just<00:03:38.519> snap<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.030> ball

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
making adjustments just snap the ball

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.250 
making adjustments just snap the ball
and<00:03:39.329> get<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.540> out<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.780> one<00:03:39.870> of<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.049> slot

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
and get it out to one of the slot

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.259 
and get it out to one of the slot
receivers<00:03:40.680> as<00:03:40.799> quick<00:03:41.010> as<00:03:41.130> possible<00:03:41.269> you're

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
receivers as quick as possible you're

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.240 
receivers as quick as possible you're
gonna<00:03:42.390> pick<00:03:42.660> up<00:03:42.780> at<00:03:43.019> minimum<00:03:43.590> like<00:03:43.859> three

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
gonna pick up at minimum like three

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.690 
gonna pick up at minimum like three
yards<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:45.200> at<00:03:46.200> maximum<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.310> know<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.430> lot<00:03:47.670> of

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
yards and at maximum you know a lot of

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.979 
yards and at maximum you know a lot of
yards<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.239> get<00:03:48.359> something<00:03:48.630> like<00:03:48.720> that

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
yards if you get something like that

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.220 
yards if you get something like that
where<00:03:49.230> they<00:03:49.320> seal<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.709> corner<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.750> it's<00:03:51.989> just

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
where they seal the corner so it's just

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.690 
where they seal the corner so it's just
I<00:03:52.350> mean<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.590> makes<00:03:52.739> more<00:03:52.920> sense<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.579> know

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
I mean it makes more sense to you know

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.330

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
not even bother with the adjustments at

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.360 
not even bother with the adjustments at
that<00:03:56.519> point<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.140> just<00:03:58.140> go<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.290> town<00:03:58.410> but<00:03:59.190> keep

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
that point and just go to town but keep

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.550 
that point and just go to town but keep

in mind you have to see both number one
at<00:04:01.859> least<00:04:02.280> one<00:04:02.640> slot<00:04:03.000> receiver<00:04:03.359> has<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.750> be

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
at least one slot receiver has to be

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.349 
at least one slot receiver has to be
uncovered<00:04:04.170> number<00:04:05.160> two<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.700> have<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.940> see<00:04:06.239> the

uncovered number two you have to see the

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.479 
uncovered number two you have to see the
safeties<00:04:06.750> rotate<00:04:07.200> that's<00:04:07.920> gonna<00:04:08.070> let<00:04:08.310> you

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
safeties rotate that's gonna let you

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.819 
safeties rotate that's gonna let you
know<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:09.000> it's<00:04:09.120> cover<00:04:09.329> three<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.650> just

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
know that it's cover three and you just

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.640 
know that it's cover three and you just
get<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.130> out<00:04:11.220> there<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:12.290> know<00:04:13.290> hope<00:04:13.470> for

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
get it out there and you know hope for

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.080 
get it out there and you know hope for
the<00:04:13.709> best<00:04:13.890> but<00:04:14.400> you're<00:04:14.609> definitely<00:04:14.790> gonna

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
the best but you're definitely gonna

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.870 
the best but you're definitely gonna
least<00:04:15.329> pick<00:04:15.510> something<00:04:15.930> up<00:04:16.519> this<00:04:17.519> time<00:04:17.760> we're

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
least pick something up this time we're

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.340 
least pick something up this time we're
gonna<00:04:17.940> switch<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:18.630> up<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.840> like<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:19.019> nickel

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
gonna switch it up to like a nickel

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.930 
gonna switch it up to like a nickel
cover<00:04:19.560> three<00:04:19.859> or<00:04:19.979> something<00:04:20.190> something<00:04:20.549> you

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
cover three or something something you

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.099 
cover three or something something you
know<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.060> little<00:04:21.239> bit<00:04:21.299> more<00:04:21.419> defensive<00:04:21.750> backs

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
know a little bit more defensive backs

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.159 
know a little bit more defensive backs
on<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.320> field<00:04:23.599> see<00:04:24.599> they<00:04:24.720> have<00:04:24.810> safeties

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
on the field see they have safeties

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.170 
on the field see they have safeties
rotate<00:04:25.530> down<00:04:25.680> so<00:04:25.919> now<00:04:26.039> they're<00:04:26.159> both<00:04:26.280> covered

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
rotate down so now they're both covered

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.280 
rotate down so now they're both covered
so<00:04:27.419> now<00:04:27.570> we're<00:04:27.720> gonna<00:04:27.780> go<00:04:28.050> with<00:04:28.139> the

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
so now we're gonna go with the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.770 
so now we're gonna go with the
adjustments<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:28.979> streak<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.970> smart<00:04:30.600> router

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
adjustments to streak the smart router

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.750 
adjustments to streak the smart router
out<00:04:31.050> route<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.620> then<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.830> drag<00:04:32.100> route<00:04:32.340> motion

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
out route and then the drag route motion

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.629 
out route and then the drag route motion
Dover<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:34.110> then<00:04:34.229> you<00:04:34.470> know<00:04:34.590> against<00:04:35.100> zone<00:04:35.460> we

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
Dover and then you know against zone we

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.280 
Dover and then you know against zone we
always<00:04:35.880> put<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.180> guy<00:04:36.330> on<00:04:36.449> an<00:04:36.570> inside<00:04:36.960> in

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
always put that guy on an inside in

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.430 
always put that guy on an inside in
route<00:04:38.270> here<00:04:39.270> your<00:04:39.419> read<00:04:39.630> is<00:04:39.780> gonna<00:04:39.960> be<00:04:40.169> that

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
route here your read is gonna be that

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.530 
route here your read is gonna be that
deep<00:04:40.710> out<00:04:40.919> though<00:04:41.190> because<00:04:41.910> it's<00:04:42.060> just<00:04:42.300> I<00:04:42.419> mean

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
deep out though because it's just I mean

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.530 
deep out though because it's just I mean
it's<00:04:42.690> gonna<00:04:42.810> get<00:04:43.080> so<00:04:43.440> much<00:04:43.740> separation<00:04:44.610> so

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
it's gonna get so much separation so

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.360 
it's gonna get so much separation so
much<00:04:45.750> separation<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.530> if<00:04:46.650> they<00:04:46.770> do<00:04:46.830> start<00:04:47.250> to

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
much separation and if they do start to

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.670 
much separation and if they do start to
you<00:04:47.610> know<00:04:47.699> pull<00:04:48.000> purples<00:04:48.449> on<00:04:48.600> to<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.229> you

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
you know pull purples on to it and you

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.200 
you know pull purples on to it and you
start<00:04:49.860> looking<00:04:50.100> down<00:04:50.370> that<00:04:50.580> way<00:04:50.760> and<00:04:50.940> seeing

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
start looking down that way and seeing

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.370 
start looking down that way and seeing
something<00:04:51.449> that<00:04:51.720> doesn't<00:04:51.990> look<00:04:52.110> quite<00:04:52.290> right

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
something that doesn't look quite right

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.950 
something that doesn't look quite right
if<00:04:53.130> they<00:04:53.760> put<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.000> purple<00:04:54.360> on<00:04:54.449> the<00:04:54.570> field<00:04:54.810> that

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
if they put a purple on the field that

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.360 
if they put a purple on the field that
means<00:04:55.110> they<00:04:55.320> took<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.530> hook<00:04:55.770> zone<00:04:56.010> off<00:04:56.190> the

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
means they took a hook zone off the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.570 
means they took a hook zone off the
field<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.419> can<00:04:58.020> easily<00:04:58.590> you<00:04:59.040> know<00:04:59.160> dump<00:04:59.460> it

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
field so you can easily you know dump it

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.510 
field so you can easily you know dump it
down<00:04:59.760> to<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.560> shorter<00:05:01.889> in<00:05:02.039> route<00:05:02.250> if

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
down to the the shorter in route if

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.870 
down to the the shorter in route if
necessary<00:05:03.330> but<00:05:04.169> ideally<00:05:04.889> what<00:05:05.250> we<00:05:05.400> want<00:05:05.580> is<00:05:05.789> we

you<00:05:34.650> cover<00:05:34.950> for<00:05:35.250> cover<00:05:35.580> 4<00:05:35.820> is<00:05:35.940> actually<00:05:36.090> very

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
you cover for cover 4 is actually very

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.320 
you cover for cover 4 is actually very
similar<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.139> the<00:05:37.229> cover<00:05:37.440> 3<00:05:37.940> actually<00:05:38.940> will<00:05:39.210> go

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
similar to the cover 3 actually will go

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.560 
similar to the cover 3 actually will go
dime<00:05:39.599> with<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.229> cover<00:05:40.410> 4<00:05:40.770> just<00:05:41.669> to<00:05:41.970> you<00:05:42.539> know

dime with the cover 4 just to you know

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.690 
dime with the cover 4 just to you know
give<00:05:42.840> it<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:42.960> little<00:05:43.139> bit<00:05:43.320> more<00:05:43.530> of<00:05:43.680> a<00:05:43.889> a<00:05:44.099> pass

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
give it a little bit more of a a pass

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.129 
give it a little bit more of a a pass
coverage<00:05:45.229> look<00:05:47.360> but<00:05:48.360> it's<00:05:48.479> very<00:05:48.630> similar<00:05:48.930> to

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
coverage look but it's very similar to

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.260 
coverage look but it's very similar to
the<00:05:49.229> cover<00:05:49.440> 3<00:05:49.830> basically<00:05:50.639> your<00:05:50.789> read<00:05:50.970> is<00:05:51.120> gonna

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
the cover 3 basically your read is gonna

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.640 
the cover 3 basically your read is gonna
be<00:05:51.450> that<00:05:51.570> deep<00:05:51.810> out<00:05:52.940> for<00:05:53.940> some<00:05:54.180> reason<00:05:54.750> I<00:05:55.020> mean

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
be that deep out for some reason I mean

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.950 
be that deep out for some reason I mean
Purple's<00:05:56.280> with<00:05:56.520> no<00:05:56.669> flat<00:05:56.970> zones<00:05:57.270> don't<00:05:57.690> seem

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
Purple's with no flat zones don't seem

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.500 
Purple's with no flat zones don't seem
to<00:05:58.080> cover<00:05:58.320> it<00:05:58.729> because<00:05:59.729> the<00:06:00.060> purple<00:06:00.360> route

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
to cover it because the purple route

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.750 
to cover it because the purple route
falls<00:06:01.229> so<00:06:01.380> he<00:06:01.620> was<00:06:01.740> wide<00:06:01.860> open<00:06:01.949> there<00:06:02.280> it<00:06:02.610> was<00:06:02.729> a

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
falls so he was wide open there it was a

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.040 
falls so he was wide open there it was a
bad<00:06:02.910> throw

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
bad throw

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.080

purple<00:06:05.039> zones<00:06:05.250> for<00:06:05.520> some<00:06:05.699> reason<00:06:06.000> when

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
purple zones for some reason when

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.029 
purple zones for some reason when
there's<00:06:06.240> no<00:06:06.389> flat<00:06:06.660> zones<00:06:06.930> on<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.139> field<00:06:07.410> they

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
there's no flat zones on the field they

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.939 
there's no flat zones on the field they
tend<00:06:08.400> to<00:06:08.460> take<00:06:08.699> the<00:06:08.880> shorter<00:06:09.270> route<00:06:09.449> so<00:06:10.410> rather

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
tend to take the shorter route so rather

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:12.860 
tend to take the shorter route so rather
than<00:06:11.220> dropping<00:06:11.490> back<00:06:11.849> over<00:06:12.210> top<00:06:12.389> of<00:06:12.539> that<00:06:12.630> deep

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
than dropping back over top of that deep

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.810 
than dropping back over top of that deep
out<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.440> purple<00:06:13.800> zone<00:06:13.949> is<00:06:14.160> actually<00:06:14.490> coming

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
out the purple zone is actually coming

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.620 
out the purple zone is actually coming
up<00:06:14.940> on<00:06:15.150> top<00:06:15.389> of<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:16.020> flat<00:06:16.260> route<00:06:16.639> which<00:06:17.639> leaves

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
up on top of the flat route which leaves

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.020 
up on top of the flat route which leaves
us<00:06:18.840> able<00:06:19.260> to<00:06:19.770> hit<00:06:20.190> that<00:06:20.370> deep<00:06:20.580> route<00:06:20.820> against

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
us able to hit that deep route against

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.140 
us able to hit that deep route against
cover<00:06:21.300> 4<00:06:21.599> as<00:06:21.750> well<00:06:21.930> so<00:06:22.889> in<00:06:23.220> cover<00:06:23.430> 4<00:06:23.760> I<00:06:23.789> mean

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
cover 4 as well so in cover 4 I mean

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.390 
cover 4 as well so in cover 4 I mean
very<00:06:24.330> rarely<00:06:24.479> will<00:06:24.990> you<00:06:25.020> see<00:06:25.139> flat<00:06:25.919> zones<00:06:26.220> and

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
very rarely will you see flat zones and

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.219 
very rarely will you see flat zones and
cover<00:06:26.669> 4<00:06:26.970> if<00:06:27.240> you<00:06:27.270> do<00:06:27.599> they're<00:06:27.810> coming<00:06:28.110> from

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
cover 4 if you do they're coming from

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.920 
cover 4 if you do they're coming from
the<00:06:28.380> defensive<00:06:28.800> end<00:06:29.010> and<00:06:29.479> they're<00:06:30.479> just<00:06:30.720> not

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
the defensive end and they're just not

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.260 
the defensive end and they're just not
gonna<00:06:31.199> be<00:06:31.440> there<00:06:31.650> in<00:06:31.740> time<00:06:31.949> to<00:06:32.580> really<00:06:33.030> make

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
gonna be there in time to really make

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.690 
gonna be there in time to really make
much<00:06:33.660> of<00:06:33.690> a<00:06:33.900> difference<00:06:34.229> anyway<00:06:34.650> with<00:06:35.400> this

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
much of a difference anyway with this

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.130 
much of a difference anyway with this
this<00:06:36.330> concept<00:06:36.599> so<00:06:37.760> you<00:06:38.760> can<00:06:39.060> see<00:06:39.240> purple<00:06:39.990> zone

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
this concept so you can see purple zone

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.610 
this concept so you can see purple zone
doesn't

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
doesn't

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.650

anything that that flat route by the

anything that that flat route by the
inside<00:06:43.169> receiver<00:06:43.590> just<00:06:43.710> completely<00:06:44.220> negates

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
inside receiver just completely negates

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.540 
inside receiver just completely negates
the<00:06:44.850> purple<00:06:45.240> and<00:06:45.770> you<00:06:46.770> got<00:06:46.919> a<00:06:46.949> big<00:06:47.160> game<00:06:47.310> there

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
the purple and you got a big game there

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.540 
the purple and you got a big game there
against<00:06:47.760> cover<00:06:47.970> four<00:06:48.240> as<00:06:48.360> well<00:06:49.130> now<00:06:50.130> in<00:06:50.430> the

three down linemen look which you know I

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.800 
three down linemen look which you know I
mean<00:06:54.810> it's<00:06:54.960> pretty<00:06:55.139> popular<00:06:55.729> to<00:06:56.729> to<00:06:57.510> try<00:06:57.750> to

drop down to that halfback dive and
you're<00:07:17.160> quick<00:07:17.340> audibles<00:07:17.820> and<00:07:18.030> just<00:07:18.870> motion

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 
you're quick audibles and just motion

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.480 
you're quick audibles and just motion
the<00:07:19.289> receiver<00:07:19.620> to<00:07:19.770> the<00:07:19.860> gap<00:07:20.039> you're<00:07:20.190> running

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
the receiver to the gap you're running

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.930 
the receiver to the gap you're running
to<00:07:20.669> and<00:07:20.940> bust<00:07:21.660> it<00:07:21.840> up<00:07:21.900> in<00:07:22.110> there<00:07:22.490> if<00:07:23.490> you're

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
to and bust it up in there if you're

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.000 
to and bust it up in there if you're
real<00:07:24.240> insistent<00:07:24.960> on<00:07:25.110> throwing<00:07:25.590> against<00:07:25.919> a

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.010 
real insistent on throwing against a

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.980 
real insistent on throwing against a
three-man<00:07:26.370> line<00:07:26.580> which<00:07:26.940> I<00:07:27.150> highly<00:07:27.539> recommend

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990 
three-man line which I highly recommend

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.290 
three-man line which I highly recommend
you<00:07:28.080> just<00:07:28.260> pound<00:07:28.500> the<00:07:28.650> rock<00:07:28.770> against<00:07:29.250> it<00:07:29.370> I

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 
you just pound the rock against it I

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.930 
you just pound the rock against it I
like<00:07:30.930> to<00:07:30.960> throw<00:07:31.320> the<00:07:31.560> in<00:07:31.710> route<00:07:31.919> and<00:07:32.190> the

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
like to throw the in route and the

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.340 
like to throw the in route and the
reason<00:07:33.270> for<00:07:33.479> that<00:07:33.539> is<00:07:33.900> because<00:07:34.020> there's

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:34.350 
reason for that is because there's

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.439 
reason for that is because there's
usually<00:07:34.560> way<00:07:35.039> too<00:07:35.100> much<00:07:35.460> going<00:07:35.789> on<00:07:35.910> in<00:07:35.970> the<00:07:36.210> max

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:36.449 
usually way too much going on in the max

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:38.890 
usually way too much going on in the max
coverage<00:07:36.690> defense<00:07:37.229> on<00:07:37.410> the<00:07:37.500> right<00:07:37.680> side<00:07:37.949> to

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:38.900 
coverage defense on the right side to

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.390 
coverage defense on the right side to
spend<00:07:39.900> the<00:07:40.050> time<00:07:40.320> to<00:07:40.710> look<00:07:40.889> for<00:07:41.190> the<00:07:41.280> open

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 
spend the time to look for the open

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.659 
spend the time to look for the open
receiver<00:07:41.940> so<00:07:42.900> rather<00:07:43.350> than<00:07:43.590> do<00:07:43.770> that<00:07:43.979> I<00:07:44.220> just<00:07:44.250> I

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:44.669 
receiver so rather than do that I just I

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:46.430 
receiver so rather than do that I just I
know<00:07:44.729> when<00:07:45.090> you<00:07:45.360> know<00:07:45.479> the<00:07:45.570> defenses<00:07:46.050> go<00:07:46.080> max

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 
know when you know the defenses go max

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.379 
know when you know the defenses go max
coverage<00:07:46.710> the<00:07:47.190> weakness<00:07:47.550> is<00:07:47.729> short<00:07:48.120> middle

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:48.389 
coverage the weakness is short middle

and<00:07:48.680> I<00:07:49.680> like<00:07:49.860> to<00:07:50.010> you<00:07:50.220> know<00:07:50.280> get<00:07:50.520> it<00:07:50.669> into<00:07:50.849> that

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940

and<00:07:53.669> hitting<00:07:53.940> the<00:07:54.060> deep<00:07:54.210> out<00:07:54.419> but<00:07:54.750> I<00:07:54.900> mean<00:07:55.050> it

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.110
