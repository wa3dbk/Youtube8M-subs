00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
this so you have to learn this major

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.949 
this so you have to learn this major
scale<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.260> if<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.709> moon<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.370> one<00:03:14.269> step<00:03:14.540> up<00:03:14.720> it

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
scale and if you moon a one step up it

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.710 
scale and if you moon a one step up it
becomes<00:03:15.230> C<00:03:15.470> sharp<00:03:15.769> scale<00:03:16.069> I<00:03:16.480> play<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.599> same

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
becomes C sharp scale I play the same

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.410 
becomes C sharp scale I play the same

major scale a sharp major scale B major
scale<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.760> then<00:03:34.819> again<00:03:35.269> C<00:03:35.480> major<00:03:35.660> scale<00:03:35.840> so

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
scale and then again C major scale so

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.090 
scale and then again C major scale so
you'll<00:03:36.799> be<00:03:37.010> getting<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.930> 12<00:03:38.930> scales<00:03:39.410> 12<00:03:39.829> major

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
you'll be getting the 12 scales 12 major

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.539 
you'll be getting the 12 scales 12 major
scales<00:03:40.549> if<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:41.000> learn<00:03:41.239> one<00:03:41.450> major<00:03:42.049> scale<00:03:42.549> if

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
scales if you learn one major scale if

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.520 
scales if you learn one major scale if
you<00:03:43.609> learn<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.209> one<00:03:44.389> C<00:03:44.720> major<00:03:44.959> scale<00:03:45.200> that<00:03:45.440> is

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
you learn the one C major scale that is

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.650 
you learn the one C major scale that is
on<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.769> fifth<00:03:45.950> fret<00:03:46.220> ok<00:03:47.150> this<00:03:47.299> is<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.480> fifth
