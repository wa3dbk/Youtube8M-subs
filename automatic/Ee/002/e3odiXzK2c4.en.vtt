00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
about ten minutes the line has not grown

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.769 
about ten minutes the line has not grown
it's<00:00:17.789> about<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> same<00:00:18.240> as<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.480> was<00:00:18.600> when<00:00:18.690> we

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
it's about the same as it was when we

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.050 
it's about the same as it was when we
got<00:00:18.960> here<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.189> took<00:00:20.279> about<00:00:20.400> ten<00:00:20.670> minutes<00:00:20.939> if

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
got here so it took about ten minutes if

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.460 
got here so it took about ten minutes if
you<00:00:21.119> got<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.390> rope<00:00:21.510> drop<00:00:21.660> take<00:00:21.990> about<00:00:22.260> ten

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
you got it rope drop take about ten

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.130 
you got it rope drop take about ten
minutes<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.800> get<00:00:22.949> one<00:00:23.570> except<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:24.930> for

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
minutes to get one except that it's for

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.640 
minutes to get one except that it's for
3:30<00:00:25.939> so<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.930> means<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> lot<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> people<00:00:28.560> have

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
3:30 so that means a lot of people have

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.830 
3:30 so that means a lot of people have
already<00:00:28.830> gotten<00:00:29.099> now<00:00:29.880> they<00:00:30.060> did<00:00:30.240> require<00:00:30.630> us
