00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
so and there you go so you have six

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.250 
so and there you go so you have six
different<00:03:00.550> pieces<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.390> then<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.870> mix<00:03:02.080> them

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
different pieces and then you mix them

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.750 
different pieces and then you mix them
all<00:03:02.350> up<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.830> try<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.220> put<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.400> back<00:03:03.489> together

all up and try to put it back together
so<00:03:04.150> let's<00:03:04.300> see<00:03:04.390> we<00:03:04.480> can<00:03:04.600> do<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:04.989> we<00:03:05.080> plug

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
so let's see we can do that so we plug

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.780 
so let's see we can do that so we plug
this<00:03:05.500> together<00:03:05.800> just<00:03:06.040> like<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.610> we<00:03:06.670> got

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
this together just like so so we got

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.600 
this together just like so so we got
those<00:03:07.000> two<00:03:07.180> pieces<00:03:07.600> then<00:03:08.500> let's<00:03:08.920> see<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.489> have

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
those two pieces then let's see you have

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.490 
those two pieces then let's see you have
this<00:03:09.880> piece<00:03:10.180> here<00:03:10.540> which<00:03:10.660> slides<00:03:10.989> on<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.380> end

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
this piece here which slides on the end

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.880 
this piece here which slides on the end
here<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.750> let's<00:03:13.750> see<00:03:14.080> we<00:03:14.260> get<00:03:14.380> this<00:03:14.590> right

through<00:03:53.440> let's<00:03:54.220> see<00:03:54.430> we<00:03:54.549> could<00:03:54.730> do<00:03:54.880> this<00:03:55.120> here

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
through let's see we could do this here

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.069 
through let's see we could do this here
and<00:03:56.190> once<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.310> get<00:03:57.459> ups<00:03:57.730> get<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.630> all<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.989> way

and once you get ups get it all the way
around<00:03:59.410> here<00:03:59.910> this<00:04:00.910> is<00:04:01.060> actually<00:04:01.420> kind<00:04:01.630> of

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
around here this is actually kind of

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.140 
around here this is actually kind of
tricky<00:04:01.930> gotta<00:04:02.739> get<00:04:02.890> it<00:04:02.980> just<00:04:03.280> right<00:04:03.489> there<00:04:04.030> we

tricky gotta get it just right there we
go<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.570> then<00:04:05.079> you<00:04:05.170> get<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.440> drop<00:04:05.650> in<00:04:05.799> the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
go and then you get it to drop in the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.729 
go and then you get it to drop in the
end<00:04:06.040> very<00:04:06.760> awesome<00:04:07.510> last<00:04:07.840> up<00:04:08.049> at<00:04:08.170> number<00:04:08.350> 6<00:04:08.590> is

end very awesome last up at number 6 is

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.920 
end very awesome last up at number 6 is
the<00:04:08.950> Sherman<00:04:09.459> Flyer<00:04:09.820> so<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.209> can<00:04:10.329> see<00:04:10.450> Sherman

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
the Sherman Flyer so you can see Sherman

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.539 
the Sherman Flyer so you can see Sherman
in<00:04:11.019> there<00:04:11.170> hanging<00:04:11.470> out<00:04:11.739> get<00:04:12.040> ready<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.340> take

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
in there hanging out get ready to take

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.580 
in there hanging out get ready to take
off<00:04:12.790> and<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.510> comes<00:04:13.690> with<00:04:13.870> five<00:04:14.260> different

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
off and it comes with five different

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.650 
off and it comes with five different
pieces<00:04:14.890> so<00:04:15.549> I<00:04:15.880> recommend<00:04:16.329> putting<00:04:16.570> it

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
pieces so I recommend putting it

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.150 
pieces so I recommend putting it
together<00:04:16.780> just<00:04:16.989> like<00:04:17.470> so<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.650> take<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.039> two

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
together just like so you take the two

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.310 
together just like so you take the two
wings<00:04:18.400> place<00:04:18.850> them<00:04:19.030> together<00:04:19.150> just<00:04:19.570> like<00:04:19.810> so

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
wings place them together just like so

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.430 
wings place them together just like so
get<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.010> tabbed<00:04:21.280> on<00:04:21.549> just<00:04:22.539> like<00:04:22.900> this<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.320> then

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
get it tabbed on just like this and then

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.469 
get it tabbed on just like this and then
take<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:23.890> piece<00:04:24.190> right<00:04:24.520> here<00:04:24.580> has<00:04:24.970> a<00:04:25.240> little

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
take this piece right here has a little

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.700 
take this piece right here has a little
pegs<00:04:25.780> in<00:04:25.960> there<00:04:26.110> fits

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
pegs in there fits

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.120 
pegs in there fits
writing<00:04:26.889> these<00:04:26.979> holes<00:04:27.310> just<00:04:27.750> like<00:04:28.750> so<00:04:29.470> get

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
writing these holes just like so get

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.010 
writing these holes just like so get
them<00:04:30.220> popped<00:04:30.460> in<00:04:30.669> there<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.509> then<00:04:31.630> you<00:04:31.900> can

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
them popped in there and then you can
