00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and locks in using a locking mechanism

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.529 
and locks in using a locking mechanism
yeah<00:01:49.679> okay<00:01:50.679> and<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.539> awful

yeah okay and this is the awful
mechanism<00:01:53.289> for<00:01:53.439> just<00:01:54.069> undoing<00:01:54.549> it<00:01:56.039> so<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
mechanism for just undoing it so you

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.889 
mechanism for just undoing it so you
press<00:01:58.659> that<00:01:58.929> in<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.470> clipping<00:01:59.799> dose<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.720> to

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
press that in the clipping dose so to

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.539 
press that in the clipping dose so to
get<00:02:02.079> it<00:02:02.229> on<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:03.130> simply<00:02:03.520> slide<00:02:04.030> your<00:02:04.920> bag<00:02:05.920> down

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
on your handlebar I'm not sure that's

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.300 
on your handlebar I'm not sure that's
going<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.260> be<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> safest<00:02:23.680> thing<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.130> world

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
going to be the safest thing the world

but this piece around the side here is
you'll<00:02:29.260> notice<00:02:29.440> very<00:02:29.829> rigid<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.930> think<00:02:32.349> with

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
you'll notice very rigid so I think with

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.240 
you'll notice very rigid so I think with
this<00:02:32.620> clip<00:02:33.010> we<00:02:33.910> are<00:02:33.940> some<00:02:34.239> rigid<00:02:35.069> plastic<00:02:36.069> here

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
this clip we are some rigid plastic here

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.630 
this clip we are some rigid plastic here
it<00:02:37.150> looks<00:02:37.299> pretty<00:02:37.599> strong<00:02:37.930> let's<00:02:38.440> face<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.650> it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
it looks pretty strong let's face it it

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.190 
it looks pretty strong let's face it it
saves<00:02:40.000> hunted<00:02:40.329> by<00:02:40.450> upon<00:02:40.720> you
