00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
weird episodes but I think that was

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.880 
weird episodes but I think that was
going<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.210> be<00:01:40.300> a<00:01:40.360> spin-off<00:01:40.690> where<00:01:41.020> they<00:01:41.140> had<00:01:41.350> a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
going to be a spin-off where they had a

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.320 
going to be a spin-off where they had a
multiracial<00:01:44.460> family<00:01:45.460> hope<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:46.090> was<00:01:46.180> just

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
multiracial family hope that was just

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.390 
multiracial family hope that was just
one<00:01:46.540> I<00:01:46.810> remember<00:01:47.110> that<00:01:47.200> but<00:01:47.380> other<00:01:47.980> than<00:01:48.310> that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
one I remember that but other than that

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.210 
one I remember that but other than that
I<00:01:48.550> had<00:01:49.060> never<00:01:49.330> seen<00:01:49.810> it<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.380> was<00:01:50.770> so

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
I had never seen it and it was so

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.460 
I had never seen it and it was so
alarming<00:01:52.000> so<00:01:52.120> I<00:01:52.150> think<00:01:52.270> ever<00:01:52.630> since<00:01:52.780> then<00:01:53.230> I've

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
alarming so I think ever since then I've

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.890 
alarming so I think ever since then I've
always<00:01:53.710> been<00:01:53.890> very<00:01:54.070> conscious<00:01:54.940> of<00:01:55.180> race<00:01:55.870> and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
always been very conscious of race and

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.850 
always been very conscious of race and
very<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:58.330> may<00:01:58.480> be<00:01:58.540> politicised<00:01:59.140> against<00:01:59.680> my

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
very you may be politicised against my

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.240 
very you may be politicised against my
will<00:02:00.280> because<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:01.030> that
