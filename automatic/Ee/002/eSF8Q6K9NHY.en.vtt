00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
this for the future because more

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.729 
this for the future because more
spectator<00:02:07.270> friends<00:02:07.539> yeah<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.080> mean<00:02:08.410> it's<00:02:08.470> fine

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
spectator friends yeah I mean it's fine

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.320 
spectator friends yeah I mean it's fine
if<00:02:08.950> it's<00:02:09.100> more<00:02:09.250> spectator<00:02:09.729> friendly<00:02:10.119> but<00:02:10.269> at

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
if it's more spectator friendly but at

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.979 
if it's more spectator friendly but at
least<00:02:10.390> make<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:11.190> at<00:02:12.190> least<00:02:12.280> close<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.790> now<00:02:13.150> 45<00:02:13.690> 2

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
least make it at least close to now 45 2

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.600 
least make it at least close to now 45 2
which<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.230> good

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
which is good

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.150 
which is good
targeted<00:02:17.600> time<00:02:17.870> is<00:02:18.320> pretty<00:02:19.010> bad

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
targeted time is pretty bad

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.390 
targeted time is pretty bad
miscalculation<00:02:20.120> limits<00:02:20.450> our<00:02:20.890> 20<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.070> yeah<00:02:22.370> I

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
miscalculation limits our 20 and yeah I

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.760 
miscalculation limits our 20 and yeah I
think<00:02:22.550> it's<00:02:22.730> great<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.210> have<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.320> around<00:02:24.530> so

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
think it's great to have it around so

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.700 
think it's great to have it around so
it's<00:02:24.920> victor<00:02:25.220> agencies<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.730> few<00:02:25.970> more<00:02:26.410> k<00:02:27.410> times

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
it's victor agencies a few more k times

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.960 
it's victor agencies a few more k times
but<00:02:28.010> i<00:02:28.040> think<00:02:28.250> they<00:02:28.340> need<00:02:28.490> to<00:02:28.520> put<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.850> little

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
but i think they need to put it a little

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.470 
but i think they need to put it a little
bit<00:02:29.120> more<00:02:29.300> effort<00:02:29.480> into<00:02:30.700> making<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.270> little

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
bit more effort into making it a little

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.470 
bit more effort into making it a little
more<00:02:32.630> off-road<00:02:32.960> so<00:02:33.650> much<00:02:33.800> on<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.010> daemon<00:02:34.480> talk

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
more off-road so much on the daemon talk

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.690 
more off-road so much on the daemon talk
a<00:02:35.510> little<00:02:35.630> bit<00:02:35.810> about<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.110> sprint<00:02:36.520> looks<00:02:37.520> like

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
a little bit about the sprint looks like

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.100

the new the new element Dooley and I'm

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.309 
the new the new element Dooley and I'm
assuming<00:04:03.180> does<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:03.720> mean<00:04:03.870> just<00:04:04.050> going<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.230> be

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
assuming does this mean just going to be

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.600 
assuming does this mean just going to be
that's<00:04:04.560> become<00:04:04.860> pretty<00:04:05.040> much<00:04:05.130> for<00:04:05.280> primary

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
that's become pretty much for primary

bike<00:04:05.760> now<00:04:05.940> yeah<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.720> think<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.320> I<00:04:07.350> mean<00:04:07.590> this

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
bike now yeah I think so I mean this

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.180 
bike now yeah I think so I mean this
course<00:04:08.610> was<00:04:08.820> exactly<00:04:09.330> suited<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:10.530> do<00:04:10.770> Lee<00:04:10.950> but

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190
