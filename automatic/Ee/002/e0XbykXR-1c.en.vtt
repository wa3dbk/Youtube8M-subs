I'm<00:02:04.510> trying<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.960> do<00:02:05.260> is<00:02:05.500> get<00:02:05.770> at<00:02:06.010> least<00:02:06.040> four<00:02:07.410> to

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
I'm trying to do is get at least four to

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.260 
I'm trying to do is get at least four to
fit<00:02:08.679> in<00:02:08.890> there

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.350 

and<00:02:16.780> if<00:02:17.320> you<00:02:17.500> can't<00:02:17.860> get<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.340> floor<00:02:18.640> then<00:02:19.060> it's

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
and if you can't get the floor then it's

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.750 
and if you can't get the floor then it's
okay<00:02:19.810> because<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.530> might<00:02:20.680> be<00:02:20.740> off<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.490> side

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
okay because it might be off to the side

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.490 
okay because it might be off to the side
and<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.810> wouldn't<00:02:23.110> see<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.350> anyway<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.630> there

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
and you wouldn't see it anyway so there

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.800 
and you wouldn't see it anyway so there
we<00:02:26.680> go<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:27.480> these<00:02:28.480> are<00:02:28.780> my<00:02:28.950> Tiger<00:02:29.950> tracks
