00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.050 
that's where that's at right now so and
then<00:02:00.880> yeah<00:02:01.720> issue<00:02:02.280> recording<00:02:03.280> with<00:02:03.489> Mario<00:02:03.849> is

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
then yeah issue recording with Mario is

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.880 
then yeah issue recording with Mario is
really<00:02:04.420> hard<00:02:04.659> because<00:02:04.720> Jansen<00:02:05.349> works<00:02:05.560> like

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
really hard because Jansen works like

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.410 
really hard because Jansen works like
pretty<00:02:06.069> much<00:02:06.159> every<00:02:06.399> day<00:02:06.520> from<00:02:06.700> 2<00:02:06.849> to<00:02:06.880> 11<00:02:07.000> and

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
pretty much every day from 2 to 11 and

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.949 
pretty much every day from 2 to 11 and
we<00:02:07.509> can't<00:02:07.750> try<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.590> get<00:02:08.769> a<00:02:08.799> hold<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.069> him<00:02:09.190> so

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
we can't try to get a hold of him so

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.589 
we can't try to get a hold of him so
it's<00:02:10.959> hard<00:02:11.079> to<00:02:11.400> do<00:02:12.400> for<00:02:12.730> player<00:02:12.910> LPS<00:02:13.299> because

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
it's hard to do for player LPS because

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.069 
it's hard to do for player LPS because
everyone<00:02:13.930> needs<00:02:14.079> to<00:02:14.260> be<00:02:15.660> available<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.840> it's

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
everyone needs to be available and it's

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.479 
everyone needs to be available and it's
hard<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.349> do<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:18.040> um<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.950> guys<00:02:21.069> let<00:02:21.400> us

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
hard to do that so um you guys let us

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.940 
hard to do that so um you guys let us
know<00:02:21.640> what<00:02:21.879> well<00:02:22.810> actually<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.650> can't<00:02:23.860> really

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
know what well actually you can't really

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.199

let<00:02:24.160> us<00:02:24.280> know<00:02:24.430> what<00:02:24.610> we<00:02:24.730> should<00:02:24.910> do<00:02:25.000> about<00:02:25.030> that

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
let us know what we should do about that

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.850 
let us know what we should do about that
but<00:02:25.660> I'm<00:02:26.049> just<00:02:26.200> letting<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.500> know<00:02:26.560> that

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
but I'm just letting you know that

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.770 
but I'm just letting you know that

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579

much but Tyler and Jansen are kind of

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:56.800 
much but Tyler and Jansen are kind of
lightweight<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.300> that's<00:03:56.450> why<00:03:56.569> they<00:03:56.690> are<00:03:56.780> being

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
lightweight so that's why they are being

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.240 
lightweight so that's why they are being
