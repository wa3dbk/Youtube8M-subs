00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
mode yahoo I is like the half cylinder

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.240 
mode yahoo I is like the half cylinder
that<00:01:08.980> sticks<00:01:09.490> up<00:01:09.670> above<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.360> screw<00:01:10.750> and<00:01:11.250> this

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
that sticks up above the screw and this

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.700 
that sticks up above the screw and this
doesn't<00:01:12.460> have<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.990> plus<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.260> core<00:01:17.530> is

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
prove you about the center's see if we

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.199 
prove you about the center's see if we
can<00:02:58.230> get<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.409> cap<00:02:58.650> off<00:03:00.290> on<00:03:01.290> liking<00:03:01.769> website<00:03:02.430> it's

can get a cap off on liking website it's

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.130 
can get a cap off on liking website it's
like<00:03:03.359> the<00:03:03.480> same<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.069> centerpiece<00:03:05.760> cap<00:03:06.269> is

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
like the same and the centerpiece cap is

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.220 
like the same and the centerpiece cap is
like<00:03:07.319> pronged<00:03:08.599> see<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.870> has<00:03:10.049> like<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.409> X

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.860 

that<00:03:14.830> adds<00:03:15.099> a<00:03:15.310> little<00:03:15.459> prongs<00:03:15.849> so<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.569> sticks
