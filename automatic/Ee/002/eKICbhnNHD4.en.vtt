application I think 9 millimeter is a
much<00:00:55.949> better<00:00:56.280> first<00:00:57.239> person<00:00:57.600> shooter

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
this game is more actually a story mode

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.810 
this game is more actually a story mode
than<00:01:07.290> gameplay<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.950> has<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> lot<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> really

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
than gameplay it has a lot of really

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.730 
than gameplay it has a lot of really
good<00:01:09.030> story<00:01:09.330> mode<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:10.409> I'm<00:01:10.530> just

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
good story mode on it but I'm just

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.929 
good story mode on it but I'm just
wondering<00:01:11.070> where<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> gameplay<00:01:11.610> is

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
wondering where all the gameplay is

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.539 
wondering where all the gameplay is
because<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.510> always<00:01:12.720> short<00:01:13.170> gameplay<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
because it's always short gameplay and a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.690 
because it's always short gameplay and a
lot<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.939> story<00:01:15.390> mode<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.979> will<00:01:17.490> be

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
lot of story mode in here so I will be

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.850 
lot of story mode in here so I will be
honest<00:01:18.090> story<00:01:18.689> mode<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.960> pretty<00:01:19.140> nice<00:01:19.320> you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
honest story mode is pretty nice you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.649 
honest story mode is pretty nice you
know<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.220> all<00:01:20.340> makes<00:01:20.369> sense<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
know it all makes sense you can be up to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.660 
know it all makes sense you can be up to
3<00:01:22.080> characters<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.680> believe<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.159> are<00:01:23.250> 7

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
3 characters I believe there are 7

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.940 
3 characters I believe there are 7
levels<00:01:23.820> I've<00:01:24.689> been<00:01:24.990> through<00:01:25.290> three<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.710> them<00:01:25.860> I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
levels I've been through three of them I

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
levels I've been through three of them I
believe<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.880> didn't<00:01:27.240> save<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:27.930> some

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
believe and it didn't save it for some

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.840 
believe and it didn't save it for some
reason<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.890> pretty<00:01:29.070> easy<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.520> kill<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
reason it's pretty easy to kill the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
reason it's pretty easy to kill the
people<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.960> usually<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.530> or<00:01:31.560> two<00:01:31.770> shots

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
people it's usually one or two shots

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.190 
people it's usually one or two shots
with<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> pistol<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.119> machine<00:01:33.509> gun<00:01:33.780> doesn't

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
with the pistol and machine gun doesn't

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
with the pistol and machine gun doesn't
take<00:01:34.380> much<00:01:34.650> when<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.460> jumping<00:01:35.700> off<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> rail

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
take much when you're jumping off a rail

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.270 
take much when you're jumping off a rail
like<00:01:36.689> now<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.350> they<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> thing<00:01:38.100> where

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
like now and they have the thing where

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.530 
like now and they have the thing where
you<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> slide<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.909> down<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
you have to slide it down like they do a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.240 
you have to slide it down like they do a
lot<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.049> off<00:01:40.229> games<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.979> actually

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
lot of going off games they actually

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.980 
lot of going off games they actually
have<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> button<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> press<00:01:42.150> instead<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
have a button that you press instead and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.420 
have a button that you press instead and
then<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.409> slide<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.770> down<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.340> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
then you just slide it down so it's a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.580 
then you just slide it down so it's a
lot<00:01:44.640> easier<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.960> view<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
lot easier to do now I view that as a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.109 
lot easier to do now I view that as a
downside<00:01:47.070> because<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.490> made<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> game<00:01:47.759> like

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
downside because you made the game like

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.910 
downside because you made the game like
9<00:01:48.509> millimeter<00:01:48.990> when<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.439> were<00:01:49.530> hanging<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:49.860> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
9 millimeter when you were hanging on a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.310 
9 millimeter when you were hanging on a
railing<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.579> sled<00:01:50.939> through<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.930> slid

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
railing and you sled through if you slid

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.109 
railing and you sled through if you slid
it<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.530> little<00:01:52.740> off<00:01:52.890> track<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.579> would<00:01:53.909> actually

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it a little off track it would actually

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.539 
it a little off track it would actually
miss<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.720> make<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.960> fall<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.920> said<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
miss and make you fall like I said if it

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
miss and make you fall like I said if it
takes<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.820> couple<00:01:57.000> kills<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.780> kill<00:01:58.079> B<00:01:58.229> person

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
takes a couple kills to kill B person

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.870 
takes a couple kills to kill B person
one<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.280> things<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> don't<00:01:59.729> like

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
one of the things that I don't like

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.100 
one of the things that I don't like
about<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> controls<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:00.960> don't

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
about the controls is that they don't

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.289 
about the controls is that they don't
always<00:02:01.290> respond<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.100> your<00:02:02.280> touch<00:02:02.610> you'll<00:02:03.149> see

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
always respond to your touch you'll see

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.030 
always respond to your touch you'll see
this<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.659> little<00:02:03.869> bit<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> first-person

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
this in a little bit of first-person

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.980 
this in a little bit of first-person
combat<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.030> show<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.630> later<00:02:06.810> in

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
combat that I show you a little later in

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.570 
combat that I show you a little later in
this<00:02:07.079> game<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.590> punching<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.220> stuff<00:02:08.429> like

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
this game with punching and stuff like

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.150 
this game with punching and stuff like
that<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.090> which<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:10.050> will<00:02:10.200> possibly<00:02:10.920> hit<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
that in which I will possibly hit the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.360 
that in which I will possibly hit the
button

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
button

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.640 
button
slowly<00:02:13.120> not<00:02:13.390> exactly<00:02:13.750> fast<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.409> it<00:02:14.500> won't

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
slowly not exactly fast and it won't

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.979 
slowly not exactly fast and it won't
respond<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.129> all<00:02:15.370> those<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.000> then<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.480> shooting

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
respond to all those and then a shooting

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.080 
respond to all those and then a shooting
on<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.140> other<00:02:17.349> hand<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.830> cannot<00:02:18.159> run<00:02:18.519> or<00:02:18.849> walk

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
on the other hand you cannot run or walk

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.670 
on the other hand you cannot run or walk

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
a lot of stuff now here's that first

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.869 
a lot of stuff now here's that first
hand<00:02:41.890> combat<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.519> was<00:02:42.640> talking<00:02:42.760> about

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
hand combat that I was talking about

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.940 
hand combat that I was talking about
with<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.120> punching<00:02:43.569> all<00:02:43.959> punch<00:02:44.379> and<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.769> won't

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
with the punching all punch and it won't

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.039 
with the punching all punch and it won't
exactly<00:02:45.310> respond<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.239> it's<00:02:46.420> actually<00:02:46.690> fairly

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
exactly respond and it's actually fairly

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.479 
exactly respond and it's actually fairly
easy<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.620> fight<00:02:47.799> these<00:02:47.980> people<00:02:48.370> though

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
easy to fight these people though

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.479 
easy to fight these people though
because<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.510> mean<00:02:49.780> they<00:02:50.049> die<00:02:50.230> quickly<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:51.010> you

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
because I mean they die quickly and you

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.210 
because I mean they die quickly and you
have<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:52.180> lot<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.450> life<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:53.379> really<00:02:53.500> easy

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.559 

similar<00:02:57.220> interactions<00:02:57.760> like<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.000> said<00:02:58.299> here

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
similar interactions like I said here

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.259 
similar interactions like I said here
opening<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.170> door<00:02:59.230> pretty<00:02:59.920> easy<00:03:00.250> going<00:03:01.060> down

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269

up<00:03:27.579> to<00:03:27.609> three<00:03:27.880> characters<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.419> believe<00:03:28.630> seven

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
up to three characters I believe seven

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.140 
up to three characters I believe seven
levels<00:03:29.290> going<00:03:30.040> through<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.639> shooting<00:03:31.000> these

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
levels going through and shooting these

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.180 
levels going through and shooting these
people<00:03:31.480> that's<00:03:32.049> something<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.799> kind<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.010> hate

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
people that's something I kind of hate

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.909 
people that's something I kind of hate
you<00:03:33.519> have<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:34.389> takes<00:03:34.599> like<00:03:34.750> two<00:03:34.959> bullets<00:03:35.169> to

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
you have it takes like two bullets to

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.370 
you have it takes like two bullets to
take<00:03:35.950> them<00:03:36.220> down<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.849> it's<00:03:37.660> really<00:03:37.900> simple<00:03:38.079> to

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
take them down and it's really simple to

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.110 
take them down and it's really simple to
do<00:03:38.530> but<00:03:38.829> it<00:03:39.099> does<00:03:39.250> kind<00:03:39.489> of<00:03:39.519> get<00:03:39.609> annoying<00:03:39.880> when

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
do but it does kind of get annoying when

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.640 
do but it does kind of get annoying when
you're<00:03:40.239> running<00:03:40.450> towards<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.019> person<00:03:41.440> and

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
you're running towards the person and

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.580 
you're running towards the person and
wherever<00:03:42.639> you<00:03:42.880> shoot<00:03:43.359> you<00:03:43.630> have<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:44.019> stop<00:03:44.319> in

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
wherever you shoot you have to stop in

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.190 
wherever you shoot you have to stop in
order<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:45.099> shoot<00:03:45.340> which<00:03:45.519> kind<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.849> sucks<00:03:46.200> and

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
order to shoot which kind of sucks and

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.319 
order to shoot which kind of sucks and
it<00:03:47.410> seems<00:03:47.620> like<00:03:47.859> a<00:03:47.889> fairly<00:03:48.130> easy<00:03:48.400> game<00:03:48.700> even<00:03:49.120> on

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
it seems like a fairly easy game even on

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.809 
it seems like a fairly easy game even on
heart<00:03:49.690> which<00:03:50.230> is<00:03:50.260> kind<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.590> odd<00:03:50.829> for<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.579> game

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
heart which is kind of odd for a game

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.960 
heart which is kind of odd for a game
loft<00:03:52.030> game<00:03:52.269> 9-millimeter<00:03:53.079> it's<00:03:53.739> hard<00:03:54.160> on<00:03:54.459> easy

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
loft game 9-millimeter it's hard on easy

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.030 
loft game 9-millimeter it's hard on easy
you<00:03:55.419> can<00:03:55.569> lay<00:03:55.690> 9-millimeter<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.410> hard<00:03:56.709> and

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
you can lay 9-millimeter and hard and

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.699 
you can lay 9-millimeter and hard and
offer<00:03:57.310> an<00:03:57.639> amazing<00:03:58.150> competition<00:03:59.049> but<00:03:59.560> with

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
offer an amazing competition but with

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:00.479 
offer an amazing competition but with
silent<00:04:00.129> ops

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
silent ops

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.220 
silent ops
it's<00:04:00.730> kind<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:01.000> an<00:04:01.120> easier<00:04:01.450> game<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.079> I<00:04:02.169> don't

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
it's kind of an easier game and I don't

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.589 
it's kind of an easier game and I don't
feel<00:04:02.530> like<00:04:02.680> Gameloft<00:04:03.160> put<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.940> same<00:04:04.209> amount

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
feel like Gameloft put the same amount

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.000 
feel like Gameloft put the same amount
of<00:04:04.660> time<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:05.109> they<00:04:05.200> would<00:04:05.379> if<00:04:05.530> any<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.889> their

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
of time that they would if any of their

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.949 
of time that they would if any of their
other<00:04:06.040> games<00:04:06.250> within<00:04:06.760> silent<00:04:07.599> ops

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
other games within silent ops

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.720 
other games within silent ops
I<00:04:08.109> was<00:04:08.530> really<00:04:08.680> looking<00:04:08.859> towards<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.549> game

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
I was really looking towards of the game

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.520 
I was really looking towards of the game
but<00:04:10.329> now<00:04:10.480> I<00:04:10.510> understand<00:04:11.079> why<00:04:11.199> it<00:04:11.260> was<00:04:11.410> the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
but now I understand why it was the

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.710 
but now I understand why it was the
three-star<00:04:11.949> rating<00:04:12.129> on<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.489> AppStore<00:04:12.849> I<00:04:13.299> have

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
three-star rating on the AppStore I have

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.740 
three-star rating on the AppStore I have
to<00:04:13.900> say<00:04:14.139> the<00:04:14.530> graphics<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:16.060> story<00:04:16.479> mode

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
to say the graphics and the story mode

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.319 
to say the graphics and the story mode
they're<00:04:17.229> great<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.919> all<00:04:18.099> makes<00:04:18.340> sense<00:04:18.699> but

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
they're great it all makes sense but

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.640 
they're great it all makes sense but
when<00:04:19.479> it<00:04:19.570> comes<00:04:19.780> comes<00:04:20.200> time<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.530> control

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
when it comes comes time to control

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.380 
when it comes comes time to control
controls<00:04:22.160> have<00:04:22.460> a<00:04:22.490> lot<00:04:22.670> to<00:04:22.850> do<00:04:22.970> with<00:04:23.060> all<00:04:23.240> the

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
controls have a lot to do with all the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.930 
controls have a lot to do with all the
gameplay<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.110> that<00:04:24.710> is<00:04:24.890> this<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.550> key<00:04:25.790> to

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
gameplay and that is this the the key to

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.610 
gameplay and that is this the the key to
the<00:04:26.000> gameplay<00:04:26.450> if<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:27.020> don't<00:04:27.200> have<00:04:27.410> good

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
the gameplay if you don't have good

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.770 
the gameplay if you don't have good
controls<00:04:28.190> it's<00:04:28.760> hard<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.150> go<00:04:29.240> through<00:04:29.270> and

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
controls it's hard to go through and

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.260 
controls it's hard to go through and
play<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.020> game<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.680> in<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:31.610> case<00:04:31.910> the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
play the game and in this case the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.140 
play the game and in this case the
controls<00:04:32.720> are<00:04:33.020> not<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.530> be<00:04:33.710> greatest<00:04:34.150> they

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
controls are not to be greatest they

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:43.320 
controls are not to be greatest they
aren't<00:04:35.300> exactly<00:04:35.390> responsive<00:04:36.380> to<00:04:36.650> your<00:04:36.860> touch

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.760 

also<00:04:44.330> some<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:44.960> story<00:04:45.230> mode<00:04:45.410> doesn't

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
also some of the story mode doesn't

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.740 
also some of the story mode doesn't
exactly<00:04:46.010> make<00:04:46.250> sense<00:04:46.550> where<00:04:46.820> as<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:47.360> guys<00:04:47.510> saw

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
exactly make sense where as you guys saw

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.200 
exactly make sense where as you guys saw
those<00:04:47.990> two<00:04:48.170> guys<00:04:48.320> came<00:04:48.680> in<00:04:48.920> one<00:04:49.430> guy<00:04:49.610> stomped
