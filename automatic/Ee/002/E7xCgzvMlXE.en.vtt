anything major is gonna happen really

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.140 
anything major is gonna happen really
there<00:00:45.470> hasn't<00:00:45.589> been<00:00:45.769> much<00:00:46.040> talk<00:00:46.339> of<00:00:46.640> it<00:00:46.850> I

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
there hasn't been much talk of it I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.549 
there hasn't been much talk of it I
don't<00:00:47.750> think<00:00:47.780> anything<00:00:48.110> big<00:00:48.290> is<00:00:48.379> going<00:00:48.470> to

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
don't think anything big is going to

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.770 
don't think anything big is going to
happen<00:00:48.829> because<00:00:48.949> we<00:00:49.129> had<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.780> 50th

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
happen because we had the 50th

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.420 
happen because we had the 50th
anniversary<00:00:50.900> not<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:51.440> long<00:00:51.589> ago<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.129> that<00:00:52.370> was

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
anniversary not so long ago and that was

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.569 
anniversary not so long ago and that was
obviously<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:53.030> big<00:00:53.180> one<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:53.600> think<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:55.190> BBC

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
obviously the big one I think the BBC

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.670 
obviously the big one I think the BBC
might<00:00:55.790> do<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:55.970> little<00:00:56.180> something<00:00:56.659> but<00:00:56.809> I<00:00:57.079> don't

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
might do a little something but I don't

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.840 
might do a little something but I don't
think<00:00:57.800> there'll<00:00:57.920> be<00:00:57.980> anything<00:00:58.190> massive<00:00:58.579> going

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
think there'll be anything massive going

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.209 
think there'll be anything massive going
on<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.090> be<00:00:59.180> honest<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.629> think<00:01:00.469> it's<00:01:00.859> going<00:01:01.039> to<00:01:01.129> be

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
on to be honest I think it's going to be

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.060 
on to be honest I think it's going to be
business<00:01:01.399> as<00:01:01.699> usual<00:01:01.760> guys<00:01:02.449> I<00:01:03.170> think<00:01:03.620> it'd<00:01:04.009> be

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
business as usual guys I think it'd be

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.049 
business as usual guys I think it'd be
quite<00:01:04.280> nice<00:01:04.399> to<00:01:04.519> see<00:01:04.670> another<00:01:04.879> episode

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059

similar<00:01:05.660> to<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.869> day<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.200> doctor<00:01:06.640> I'm<00:01:07.640> not

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
similar to the day of a doctor I'm not

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:08.800 
similar to the day of a doctor I'm not
sure<00:01:07.910> if<00:01:07.970> they<00:01:08.030> will<00:01:08.060> do<00:01:08.330> that<00:01:08.479> but<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:08.720> would

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
sure if they will do that but it would

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.109 
sure if they will do that but it would
be<00:01:08.899> nice<00:01:09.050> to<00:01:09.080> see<00:01:09.380> I'm<00:01:10.130> not<00:01:10.310> too<00:01:10.520> sure<00:01:10.820> really

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.160 
they have been really quiet about it and

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.260 
bring Eccleston back for a see a single
scene<00:01:57.219> though<00:01:58.219> that's<00:01:58.430> not<00:01:58.670> likely<00:01:58.939> to<00:01:59.090> happen

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
scene though that's not likely to happen

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.910 
scene though that's not likely to happen
I<00:01:59.780> think<00:01:59.869> maybe<00:02:00.259> a<00:02:00.409> bit<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:01.390> 9<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.689> 10<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:03.409> think

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
I think maybe a bit of 9 in 10 I think

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.069 
I think maybe a bit of 9 in 10 I think
we<00:02:04.159> have<00:02:04.250> enough<00:02:04.640> 9<00:02:04.880> yeah<00:02:05.119> I<00:02:05.149> agree<00:02:05.270> there<00:02:05.689> we

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
we have enough 9 yeah I agree there we

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.959 
we have enough 9 yeah I agree there we
need<00:02:06.229> more<00:02:06.380> 9<00:02:06.649> we<00:02:06.920> need<00:02:07.100> more<00:02:07.189> 5<00:02:07.460> alive

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
need more 9 we need more 5 alive

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.550 
need more 9 we need more 5 alive
what<00:02:08.149> would<00:02:08.299> the<00:02:08.450> two<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.840> do<00:02:09.079> if<00:02:09.350> you're

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
what would the two of you do if you're
