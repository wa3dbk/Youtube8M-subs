 there are very few copies or is that 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.740
 these animals are so smart they have

 human whatever the case what 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.660
 true is that the last 12 years do not

 scientists believe that they could exist

 some but they assure that the future of 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.960
 this species is very dark 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.990

 whale sharks of 15 and 20 meters of 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.569
