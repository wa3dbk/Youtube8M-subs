00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
better than mine so she spent days on

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.050 
better than mine so she spent days on
hers<00:02:23.819> I'm<00:02:24.090> spending<00:02:24.780> hours<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.140> mine<00:02:25.849> but<00:02:26.849> I'm

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
hers I'm spending hours on mine but I'm

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.449 
hers I'm spending hours on mine but I'm
using<00:02:27.330> hot<00:02:27.690> press<00:02:28.050> watercolor<00:02:28.099> paper<00:02:29.099> for<00:02:29.400> one

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
using hot press watercolor paper for one

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.400 
using hot press watercolor paper for one
of<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.670> first<00:02:29.879> times<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.629> Fabriano<00:02:31.080> x'

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
of the first times this is Fabriano x'

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.490 
of the first times this is Fabriano x'
hot<00:02:32.400> press<00:02:33.170> 140-pound

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
hot press 140-pound

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.789 
hot press 140-pound
and<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:35.540> hadn't<00:02:36.540> really<00:02:36.750> used<00:02:37.049> it<00:02:37.260> for<00:02:37.530> much

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
and I hadn't really used it for much

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.610 
and I hadn't really used it for much
because<00:02:38.370> hot<00:02:38.790> press<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.720> paint<00:02:40.170> kind<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.440> sits

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
because hot press the paint kind of sits

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.009 
because hot press the paint kind of sits
on<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.860> surface<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.610> paper<00:02:41.819> more<00:02:42.269> rather

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
on the surface of the paper more rather

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.220 
on the surface of the paper more rather
than<00:02:43.170> soaking<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.069> you<00:02:44.129> do<00:02:44.370> light<00:02:44.730> washes

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
than soaking in so you do light washes

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.410 
than soaking in so you do light washes
one<00:02:46.230> over<00:02:46.470> top<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.920> other<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.420> fits

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
one over top of the other that fits

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.270

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.080 
those things that is ingrained knowledge
in<00:03:24.450> my<00:03:24.690> Copic<00:03:25.079> style<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.340> wanted<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.910> bring

in my Copic style that I wanted to bring
into<00:03:27.269> watercolor<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.870> Hedge<00:03:27.989> felt<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.500> was

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
into watercolor and Hedge felt that was

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.440 
into watercolor and Hedge felt that was
not<00:03:28.769> appropriate<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:29.459> all<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.940> sudden<00:03:30.239> I

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
not appropriate but all of a sudden I

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.259 
not appropriate but all of a sudden I
realized<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.440> it's<00:03:31.620> okay<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.489> other

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
realized that it's okay that other

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.569 
realized that it's okay that other
people<00:03:33.599> are<00:03:33.810> really<00:03:33.959> good<00:03:34.230> at<00:03:34.349> it<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.620> they<00:03:35.519> do

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
people are really good at it and they do

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.020 
people are really good at it and they do
the<00:03:35.940> same<00:03:36.180> thing<00:03:37.069> so<00:03:38.069> I<00:03:38.099> started<00:03:38.489> adding<00:03:38.639> some

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
the same thing so I started adding some

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.059 
the same thing so I started adding some
of<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.150> purple<00:03:39.540> detail<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.109> my<00:03:40.290> petal<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.950> it

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
of that purple detail in my petal and it

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.430 
of that purple detail in my petal and it
was<00:03:41.310> bleeding<00:03:41.639> because<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.900> paper<00:03:43.049> was<00:03:43.260> still

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
was bleeding because the paper was still

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.830 
was bleeding because the paper was still
very<00:03:43.620> wet<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.040> while<00:03:44.220> it's<00:03:44.400> drying<00:03:44.730> I'll<00:03:45.060> treat

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
very wet so while it's drying I'll treat

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.000 
very wet so while it's drying I'll treat
you<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.139> seeing<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.500> little<00:03:46.650> bit<00:03:46.739> of<00:03:46.859> that

the kind of detail that that she did in
hers<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.280> book<00:03:53.579> but<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.599> am<00:03:54.959> adding<00:03:55.380> a

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
hers in the book but I am adding a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.409 
hers in the book but I am adding a
little<00:03:55.590> bit<00:03:55.709> more<00:03:55.799> roundness<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:56.970> center

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
little bit more roundness to that center

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.220 
little bit more roundness to that center
section<00:03:57.690> by<00:03:58.650> working<00:03:59.310> in<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.700> shadows<00:03:59.910> I<00:04:00.450> can

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
section by working in the shadows I can

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.960 
section by working in the shadows I can
do<00:04:01.349> a<00:04:01.380> wash<00:04:01.709> over<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.160> whole<00:04:02.340> thing<00:04:02.370> but<00:04:02.910> I

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
do a wash over the whole thing but I

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.569 
do a wash over the whole thing but I
wanted<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.359> allow<00:04:04.109> some<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.500> those<00:04:04.709> those

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
wanted to allow some of those those

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.780 
wanted to allow some of those those
highlight<00:04:06.060> spots<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:07.530> retain<00:04:08.430> their

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
highlight spots to retain their

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.059 
highlight spots to retain their
lightness<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:09.599> just<00:04:10.139> put<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.590> shading

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
lightness and just put the shading

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.970 
lightness and just put the shading
transitions<00:04:11.730> into<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.690> shadows<00:04:13.169> so<00:04:13.919> I'm

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
transitions into the shadows so I'm

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.060 
transitions into the shadows so I'm
starting<00:04:14.430> by<00:04:14.609> using<00:04:14.639> a<00:04:15.209> darker<00:04:15.599> Brown<00:04:16.070> for

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
starting by using a darker Brown for

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.979 
starting by using a darker Brown for
some<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.519> them<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:17.910> then<00:04:18.090> I'm<00:04:18.389> filling<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
some of them and then I'm filling in the

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.810 
some of them and then I'm filling in the
others<00:04:19.320> with<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.739> lighter<00:04:20.070> brown<00:04:20.310> that's<00:04:20.609> going

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
others with a lighter brown that's going

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.240 
others with a lighter brown that's going
to<00:04:20.880> give<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.150> an<00:04:21.269> overall<00:04:21.419> roundness<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:23.130> the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
to give it an overall roundness to the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.860 
to give it an overall roundness to the
shape<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.760> inner<00:04:23.940> part<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.599> flower

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
shape of that inner part of the flower

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.140 
shape of that inner part of the flower
and<00:04:26.190> then<00:04:27.190> I'm<00:04:27.310> going<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.490> add<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:27.639> little<00:04:28.000> more

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
and then I'm going to add a little more

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.460 
and then I'm going to add a little more
detail<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.780> in<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:31.020> little<00:04:32.020> portion<00:04:32.350> around

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
detail to in the little portion around

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.020 
detail to in the little portion around
that<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.980> portion<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.310> surrounds<00:04:33.850> it<00:04:33.940> I

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
that the portion that surrounds it I

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.879 
that the portion that surrounds it I
don't<00:04:34.180> know<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.540> proper<00:04:34.990> flower<00:04:35.320> names<00:04:35.590> but

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
don't know the proper flower names but

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.980 
don't know the proper flower names but
I'm<00:04:36.550> going<00:04:36.699> to<00:04:36.760> add<00:04:36.850> more<00:04:37.060> detail<00:04:37.419> to<00:04:37.600> that<00:04:37.750> but

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
I'm going to add more detail to that but

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.810 
I'm going to add more detail to that but
I<00:04:38.020> thought<00:04:38.169> I<00:04:38.229> would<00:04:38.350> talk<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.130> little<00:04:39.430> bit<00:04:39.580> more

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
I thought I would talk a little bit more

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.090 
I thought I would talk a little bit more
about<00:04:40.090> my<00:04:40.270> conversation<00:04:41.050> with<00:04:41.080> Anna<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:41.830> her

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
about her book I emailed her and asked

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.070 
about her book I emailed her and asked
her<00:04:45.190> if<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.729> could<00:04:45.910> use<00:04:46.120> some<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:46.990> her

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
her if I could use some of her

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.760 
her if I could use some of her
terminology<00:04:47.830> going<00:04:48.160> forward<00:04:48.550> as<00:04:48.699> I<00:04:48.729> teach<00:04:49.180> and

that<00:04:50.770> sort<00:04:51.040> of<00:04:51.070> thing<00:04:51.220> because<00:04:51.370> in<00:04:51.880> her<00:04:52.120> book

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360

she talks about a variety of ways to

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.730 
she talks about a variety of ways to
discuss<00:04:57.810> mixing<00:04:58.810> a<00:04:58.900> certain<00:04:59.229> amount<00:04:59.440> of<00:04:59.500> water

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740

water do you have in your brush when you

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.440 
water do you have in your brush when you
do<00:05:05.410> that<00:05:05.530> how<00:05:05.710> much<00:05:05.830> water<00:05:06.130> do<00:05:06.280> you<00:05:06.340> have<00:05:06.490> on

do that how much water do you have on

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.360 
do that how much water do you have on
your<00:05:07.660> brush<00:05:07.870> versus<00:05:08.350> how<00:05:08.500> much<00:05:08.650> paint<00:05:09.010> what's

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
your brush versus how much paint what's

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.820 
your brush versus how much paint what's
the<00:05:09.520> proportion<00:05:09.700> and<00:05:10.389> it's<00:05:11.080> not<00:05:11.320> a<00:05:11.350> science

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
the proportion and it's not a science

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.820 
the proportion and it's not a science
remember<00:05:12.250> this<00:05:12.370> is<00:05:12.550> art<00:05:12.820> but<00:05:13.750> she<00:05:14.020> has<00:05:14.200> a<00:05:14.410> chart

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
remember this is art but she has a chart

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.430 
remember this is art but she has a chart
in<00:05:15.190> one<00:05:15.580> of<00:05:15.729> the<00:05:15.910> pages<00:05:16.540> of<00:05:16.810> her<00:05:16.960> book<00:05:16.990> that

in one of the pages of her book that

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.390 
in one of the pages of her book that
talks<00:05:18.130> about<00:05:18.510> going<00:05:19.510> from<00:05:19.720> a<00:05:19.990> watery<00:05:20.380> you<00:05:20.740> know

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
talks about going from a watery you know

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.279 
talks about going from a watery you know
primarily<00:05:21.669> water<00:05:22.360> with<00:05:22.660> just<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.990> little<00:05:23.200> bit

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
primarily water with just a little bit

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.300 
primarily water with just a little bit
of<00:05:23.350> color<00:05:23.590> type<00:05:24.430> of<00:05:24.610> wash<00:05:24.820> to<00:05:25.720> a<00:05:26.139> creamy<00:05:26.949> and

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
of color type of wash to a creamy and

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.480 
of color type of wash to a creamy and
creamy<00:05:27.970> has<00:05:28.449> more<00:05:28.750> paint<00:05:29.020> in<00:05:29.320> it<00:05:29.470> and<00:05:29.710> it's

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
creamy has more paint in it and it's

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.980 
creamy has more paint in it and it's
thicker<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:32.560> will<00:05:33.280> as<00:05:33.580> I<00:05:34.030> start<00:05:34.360> working

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
thicker and I will as I start working

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.230 
thicker and I will as I start working
with<00:05:35.169> that<00:05:35.350> system<00:05:35.770> more<00:05:36.039> I'm<00:05:36.520> going<00:05:36.970> to<00:05:37.060> start

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
with that system more I'm going to start

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.960 
with that system more I'm going to start
using<00:05:37.450> that<00:05:37.660> in<00:05:38.169> what<00:05:39.160> I'm<00:05:39.250> talking<00:05:39.639> about<00:05:39.669> so

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
using that in what I'm talking about so

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.670 
using that in what I'm talking about so
I'll<00:05:40.360> probably<00:05:40.510> have<00:05:40.720> a<00:05:40.810> video<00:05:41.080> talking<00:05:41.470> just

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
I'll probably have a video talking just

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.740 
I'll probably have a video talking just
about<00:05:41.889> that<00:05:42.370> coming<00:05:42.970> up<00:05:43.150> summertime<00:05:43.599> in<00:05:43.720> the

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
about that coming up summertime in the

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.379 
about that coming up summertime in the
future<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.289> maybe<00:05:45.250> I'll<00:05:45.430> do<00:05:45.550> a<00:05:45.580> class<00:05:45.880> on<00:05:46.150> it

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
future and maybe I'll do a class on it

future and maybe I'll do a class on it
on<00:05:46.570> my<00:05:46.720> blog<00:05:47.020> we'll<00:05:47.349> see<00:05:47.530> how<00:05:47.680> that<00:05:47.740> goes

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
on my blog we'll see how that goes

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.210 
on my blog we'll see how that goes
but<00:05:48.820> I'm<00:05:49.120> going<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.169> be<00:05:50.289> experimenting<00:05:51.070> with

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
but I'm going to be experimenting with

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.790 
but I'm going to be experimenting with
what<00:05:51.460> those<00:05:51.760> different<00:05:52.360> levels<00:05:52.780> of<00:05:52.990> the

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
what those different levels of the

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.710 
what those different levels of the
amount<00:05:54.099> of<00:05:54.250> watercolor<00:05:54.760> versus<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.450> amount

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
amount of watercolor versus the amount

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.010 
amount of watercolor versus the amount
of<00:05:55.870> water<00:05:56.820> makes<00:05:57.820> something<00:05:58.180> work<00:05:58.570> or<00:05:58.870> not

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
of water makes something work or not

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.100 
of water makes something work or not
work<00:05:59.080> and<00:06:00.419> honest'<00:06:01.419> says<00:06:01.539> she<00:06:01.720> got<00:06:01.840> that<00:06:02.050> from

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
work and honest' says she got that from

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.960 
work and honest' says she got that from
one<00:06:02.380> of<00:06:02.470> her<00:06:02.560> students<00:06:02.950> that<00:06:03.130> terminology<00:06:03.729> so

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
one of her students that terminology so

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.450 
one of her students that terminology so
she's<00:06:04.840> told<00:06:05.200> me<00:06:05.289> that<00:06:05.500> I'm<00:06:05.620> will<00:06:05.860> able<00:06:06.220> to

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.360 
she's told me that I'm will able to
share<00:06:07.060> that<00:06:07.300> with<00:06:07.510> you<00:06:07.750> and<00:06:08.020> I<00:06:08.770> will<00:06:08.950> do<00:06:09.039> it<00:06:09.190> as

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
I get more understanding what it is now

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
up my card without telling me so I

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.270 
up my card without telling me so I
skipped<00:06:18.760> over<00:06:18.910> to<00:06:19.240> my<00:06:19.389> iPhone<00:06:19.570> and<00:06:20.320> started

skipped over to my iPhone and started
painting<00:06:21.490> some<00:06:21.729> of<00:06:21.820> the<00:06:21.880> water<00:06:22.060> drops<00:06:22.360> I<00:06:22.660> had

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
painting some of the water drops I had

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.190 
painting some of the water drops I had
taken<00:06:23.590> off<00:06:23.830> the<00:06:24.220> green<00:06:24.820> masking<00:06:25.720> fluid<00:06:25.840> that<00:06:26.169> I

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
taken off the green masking fluid that I

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.779 
taken off the green masking fluid that I
had<00:06:26.349> put<00:06:26.500> on<00:06:26.650> the<00:06:26.770> water<00:06:26.950> drops<00:06:27.220> to<00:06:27.430> keep<00:06:27.610> them

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
had put on the water drops to keep them

white<00:06:28.000> while<00:06:28.330> I<00:06:28.360> painted<00:06:28.780> and<00:06:29.070> I'm<00:06:30.070> just

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
white while I painted and I'm just

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.089 
white while I painted and I'm just
adding<00:06:30.539> a<00:06:31.539> little<00:06:31.630> bit<00:06:32.169> of<00:06:32.260> paint<00:06:32.530> and<00:06:32.800> I'm

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
adding a little bit of paint and I'm

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.540 
adding a little bit of paint and I'm
leaving<00:06:33.370> a<00:06:33.700> c-shape<00:06:34.570> of<00:06:34.840> white<00:06:35.590> around<00:06:36.280> one

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
leaving a c-shape of white around one

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.459 
leaving a c-shape of white around one
side<00:06:36.820> of<00:06:36.969> the<00:06:37.030> drop<00:06:37.240> I<00:06:37.510> don't<00:06:37.930> know<00:06:38.080> if<00:06:38.200> this<00:06:38.349> is

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469 
side of the drop I don't know if this is

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:39.119 
side of the drop I don't know if this is
how<00:06:38.620> you<00:06:38.680> do<00:06:38.860> what

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:39.129 
how you do what

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:41.249 
how you do what
drops<00:06:39.339> I<00:06:39.580> was<00:06:39.819> just<00:06:39.999> messing<00:06:40.449> around<00:06:40.509> so<00:06:41.020> I

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:41.259 
drops I was just messing around so I

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.589 
drops I was just messing around so I
have<00:06:41.770> more<00:06:41.949> studies<00:06:42.489> of<00:06:42.729> water<00:06:42.939> drops<00:06:43.239> to<00:06:43.449> do

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
have more studies of water drops to do

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.049 
have more studies of water drops to do
in<00:06:43.869> the<00:06:43.959> future<00:06:44.319> I'm<00:06:45.159> adding<00:06:45.639> a<00:06:45.699> little<00:06:45.879> bit<00:06:45.999> of

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:46.059 
in the future I'm adding a little bit of

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:48.659 
in the future I'm adding a little bit of
a<00:06:46.119> shadow<00:06:46.389> underneath<00:06:47.080> of<00:06:47.439> each<00:06:48.369> of<00:06:48.580> the

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:48.669 
a shadow underneath of each of the

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.109 
a shadow underneath of each of the
petals<00:06:48.879> or<00:06:49.419> each<00:06:49.989> of<00:06:50.169> the<00:06:50.259> water<00:06:50.529> drops<00:06:50.830> on<00:06:51.219> the

00:06:52.109 --> 00:06:52.119 
petals or each of the water drops on the

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:54.749 
petals or each of the water drops on the
petal<00:06:52.449> so<00:06:53.289> that<00:06:53.499> those<00:06:53.800> will<00:06:53.979> pop<00:06:54.219> a<00:06:54.459> little

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 
petal so that those will pop a little

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.799 
petal so that those will pop a little
bit<00:06:54.909> more<00:06:54.969> than<00:06:55.629> they<00:06:55.809> are<00:06:55.839> and<00:06:57.330> I'm<00:06:58.330> going<00:06:58.779> to

00:06:58.799 --> 00:06:58.809 
bit more than they are and I'm going to

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:01.079 
bit more than they are and I'm going to
call<00:06:59.050> this<00:06:59.259> painting<00:06:59.739> done<00:07:00.009> even<00:07:00.639> though<00:07:00.789> it's

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:01.089 
call this painting done even though it's
