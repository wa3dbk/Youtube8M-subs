00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.040
 hello together number the grill 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.850
 today there is the t3 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.990
 fridays jack daniel's burger as 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.699
 own interpretation or as copy calls 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.570
 it as you want 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.500
 and that's what he looks like when we're done 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.449
 Of course we start with the hamburger 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.529
 band these books as usual yourself 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.969
 That 's not even a recipe 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.200
 complicated if you are my past 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.460
 It looks like there will be videos at some point 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.219
 also get explained in detail today 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.000
 slightly more visitors therefore falls 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.140
 Crowd of citizens a bit bigger and there 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.140
 we are already finished 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.490
 and of course there are those too 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.620
 Matching amount of hamburger pittis 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.610
 this is pure ground beef with salt 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.820
 and pepper mixed but the centerpiece 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.310
 this citizen until the glaze that one 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.590
 grace from jack daniel's and many 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.680
 other ingredients and we start with 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.470
 a complete garlic head at the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.770
 We cut off the top of the lid so that 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.710
 We almost from each garlic clove a 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.350
 part of it has been partially uncovered 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.440
 then we take a cast aluminum banner 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.420
 In this case, I have some olive oil 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.840
 with pure made one sees I have times 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.190
 what is removed from the paper at the side 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.650
 a little more olive oil on top 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.420
 that 's by no means 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.440
 dries out and then some aluminum foil 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:46.430
 good over it and then the whole with good 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.610
 180 to 200 degrees for an hour in the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.610
 oven 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.040
 so then we come to the rest of the sauce we 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.810
 start with some olive oil and a good 3 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.810
 tablespoons finely chopped onions 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.479
 then we delete the whole with one 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.649
 half cup of soya so i'll say that 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.020
 amount down 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.030
 if the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.980
 record description of the video with 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.629
 then you might have to meet exactly 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.030
 after a few minutes 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.700
 with the soy sauce onions 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.480
 he will give the sauces 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:34.060
 and the other components 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.060
 This track pineapple juice and water 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.790
 then there is another one in the sauce 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.209
 not to neglect 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.280
 add brown sugar to it 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.430
 that at the end of a very operational 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.799
 has consistency 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.909
 that's how it is all the time 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.250
 to boil 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:00.250
 In the ideal case, if I have something bigger 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.640
 pot and then it is still a little too cool 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.829
 to let 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.109
 Let's look at how our garlic 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.310
 head looks yes at the bottom corner 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.769
 something black might have something 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.849
 less heat done 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.370
 the goal is that you end up with that 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.650
 black removes that is not so 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.700
 just as you see and then you 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.200
 I have it with one in the back 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.239
 garlic clove sometimes made 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.310
 the paste fit the soft garlic 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.599
 takes and that still with 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.340
 but you can see that too 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.310
 relatively quickly make the charred from 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.730
 can pull off immediately 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.230
 but the muddy barely matschie 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.340
 something in it 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.340
 pretty easy 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.650
 so you will notice the headscarf 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.140
 Now we give the crew keys 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.540
 So do it and then come 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.420
 a decent shot jack daniels 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.519
 to a ski I usually like 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.799
 but he does not advertise good ones 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.959
 goal shot after about three to four 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.230
 tablespoon is and who the quantity then the 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.660
 the same amount of the juice also 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:13.079
 and a good shot 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:16.090
 cayenne and then the sauce 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:19.040
 The amount is a lot 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.930
 one could halve ingredients 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.080
 about two hours 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.690
 reduce is only half 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.650
 until a third of it has over and if 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.800
 If you let it cool then it will be you 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.919
 kind and hard and that the goal in the end 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.910
 it should look like that almost black 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:43.729
 tasting is so much sender 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.410
 I can say that is not worth it 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.230
 that's just scary, by the way 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.160
 a small part 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.310
 intention is yes then the citizen Pettys 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.190
 green 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.230
 In that case I want to accommodate you 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.380
 direct heat on the Lusthaus of 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.420
 monolith in and at the amount depending on 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.250
 how much are those after that 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.600
 detector stone indirectly he pulled 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.580
 sees that he leaves the citizens nevertheless 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.850
 gracefully and give the cheese over it 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.750
 By the way a bit bacon is too 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.750
 standard a recipe 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.770
 yes that with the cheese still melt and 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.970
 then it is already getting dark 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.380
 therefore high time to build the citizen 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.880
 we start with a decent one 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:34.670
 teaspoons per side and below and 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.510
 pass the jack daniels place 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.180
 the burger train 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.130
 you can banish the citizens the bun 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.990
 Of course, to barbecue or toast if you 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.940
 that would also like to refrain from substance 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.720
 they are very solid that you need 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.310
 but not her husband noticed 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.720
 that it is very sticky very nice 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.720
 the bad luck 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.080
 yes then comes by default a little salad 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.080
 with the burger 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:05.920
 patty with cheese here you can polonaise 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.920
 take in the fire 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.139
 because there is 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.510
 turn two small ones 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.480
 think 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.700
 a slice of tomato 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.230
 red onion 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.970
 there would now be 2 against 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.710
 Slices on it include the ones I have 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.640
 but in the eagerness of the fight then 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:29.070
 to forget 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:30.480
 yes that's the tg fridays citizen 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.500
 This burger chain exists in the rest 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.960
 not at all in Germany 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.310
 the idea made me think of them back then 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.520
 thank you very much in the place white and 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.390
 is meant funny 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.720
 We'll also look again 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.340
 looks to have been cut through 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.760
 always something not to be the same 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.760
 better again 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:51.150
 the next branch of it is I think 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.580
 he likes it or in vienna or somehow 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.710
 something if that sometime in 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.059
 germany must necessarily times 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.879
 there are many other cool ones here 

00:06:57.059 --> 00:07:01.529
 citizen yes, there i am 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:04.110
 of course, thank you again for seeing 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:06.149
 However, the last pictures visited too 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:11.099
 my curls bathing come to point or 

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:13.229
 fanpages interviews and facebook I am 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:15.469
 a lot of fun when refilling once 

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:15.469
 short
