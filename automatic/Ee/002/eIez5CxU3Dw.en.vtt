00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.139
 from this picture of a village 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.700
 near carpentras we will make a 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.090
 watercolor starting with the sky in 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.270
 first wetting by putting blue 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.660
 cobalt a bit of overseas slightly 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.900
 purplish a little yellow of naples on 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.140
 the bottom and I leave diffused and the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.140
 color 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.560
 for vegetation at the bottom of the village I 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.630
 begins with molded some areas I 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:06.990
 place various towards various of ringgold 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:11.950
 cobalt blue as well as bad 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.850
 permanent mixed with pink a little bit of 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.830
 Green bladder or English green 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.700
 the whole thing is to get to mix the 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:27.640
 colors on the paper and not on the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:32.740
 palette of small time keys in 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.100
 time to harmonize and others 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.430
 color keys to reinforce 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.430
 flakes 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.860
 we 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.030
 I take care of the harmony of the hues 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.970
 trying to be close enough to the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.000
 photo a little bit of salt for 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:15.190
 effects then I attack myself 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.190
 colors of the castle and the village 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.270
 being young NAPLES the pace 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.620
 back even from the land of his news 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:34.510
 and I leave that some facade 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:38.080
 oriented right side almost white a 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.580
 little salt gesture homps some facades 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.580
 to have whiteness 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:01.290
 the hill left side with more blue 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.290
 olive green the least sunny 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.650
 a little salt a little buffering 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.950
 on the right the hill a little more bluish 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.730
 cobalt blue or ultramarine a little to violate 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.730
 a little green 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:44.100
 and I also have some salt for 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:46.560
 texture effects I place a little bit 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.590
 the vegetation above the ruins of the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.590
 castle 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.470
 the second part of the work consists of 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:12.890
 place the roofs with a little red 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.890
 Indian or faded red venice 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.420
 this allows you to see more 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.420
 the village 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.530
 I strengthen a little cliff 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.310
 and the ruins of the castle with more 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.310
 burned his land 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.670
 we 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:05.060
 I accentuate the shadows with a slight gray 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.060
 purplish blue 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.860
 or 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.549
 the bell tower that I bring out 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.549
 more 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:36.000
 some greenery tasks based on 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.000
 English green glass vessy ringgold 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.570
 who will intrude between the houses 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:51.490
 to give a more bucolic side and 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.490
 nice to all 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.430
 we 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:18.660
 I'm starting to place some areas of 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.660
 contrast in the foliage 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:37.280
 and I voluntarily deleted the big 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:40.960
 so close to the left to put two 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.960
 smaller ones instead 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:57.069
 cypresses so starting with the 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:07:03.759
 green gold and then olive green and 

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:06.759
 for the darker side is blue 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:11.669
 sweet indigo glass of peril hate for 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.669
 have a serious visual impact 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.640
 they will help structure the whole 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.640
 of the landscape 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.050
 we 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:53.220
 then I can finish the watercolor in 

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:58.060
 going into the details of the houses 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:08:01.770
 with the windows the branches and 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.770
 then the watercolor is over
