the feeders the feeders not being

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.360 
the feeders the feeders not being
touched<00:03:54.000> since<00:03:54.269> Tuesday's<00:03:55.100> luckily<00:03:56.100> came

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
touched since Tuesday's luckily came

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.080 
touched since Tuesday's luckily came
just<00:03:57.000> right<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.739> sat<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.920> waited<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.880> just

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
just right and sat and waited and just

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.319 
just right and sat and waited and just
hit<00:04:00.269> it<00:04:00.389> just<00:04:00.630> through<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.850> side<00:04:02.850> of<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.090> neck

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
hit it just through the side of the neck

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.420 
hit it just through the side of the neck
there<00:04:03.569> I<00:04:03.930> think<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.560> pellets<00:04:04.859> going<00:04:05.069> into<00:04:05.310> the
