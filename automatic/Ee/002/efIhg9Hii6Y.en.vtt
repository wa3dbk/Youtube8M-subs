fire<00:01:23.580> engine<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.240> believe<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.439> today<00:01:26.400> that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
fire engine I believe that a today that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.380 
fire engine I believe that a today that
there<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.150> only<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:28.520> three<00:01:29.520> transformers

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
there is only I think three transformers

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
there is only I think three transformers
that<00:01:30.840> were<00:01:30.930> made<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.259> fire<00:01:31.500> engines<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.100> one

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that were made in fire engines and one

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
that were made in fire engines and one
of<00:01:32.520> them<00:01:32.640> was<00:01:32.790> Prime<00:01:33.180> i<00:01:33.210> believe<00:01:33.869> i<00:01:34.140> can

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
of them was Prime i believe i can

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.990 
of them was Prime i believe i can
remember<00:01:34.920> which<00:01:35.189> one<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:35.549> i<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:35.909> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
little Autobot symbol here you rub off

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.219 
little Autobot symbol here you rub off
you<00:01:59.729> know<00:01:59.880> yeah<00:02:00.060> still<00:02:00.630> works<00:02:00.899> pretty<00:02:01.110> good

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you know yeah still works pretty good

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.289 
you know yeah still works pretty good
after<00:02:01.710> shoot<00:02:02.450> 24<00:02:03.450> 25<00:02:04.140> years<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:06.119> that

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
after shoot 24 25 years and it's that

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.839 
after shoot 24 25 years and it's that
ain't<00:02:06.479> bad<00:02:06.979> it<00:02:07.979> was<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.489> start<00:02:08.700> on

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
ain't bad it was it's going to start on

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.990 
ain't bad it was it's going to start on
the<00:02:08.940> transformation

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
the transformation

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.930 
the transformation
so<00:02:11.890> first<00:02:12.890> off<00:02:13.100> what<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.280> want<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.550> do<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.910> you
