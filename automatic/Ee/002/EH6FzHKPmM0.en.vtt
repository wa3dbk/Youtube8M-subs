00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690 

the<00:00:00.120> reason<00:00:00.719> that<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:01.140> carriers<00:00:01.680> lock<00:00:02.490> this

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
the reason that the carriers lock this

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.570 
the reason that the carriers lock this
down<00:00:02.909> obviously<00:00:03.179> it<00:00:03.629> is<00:00:03.810> uh<00:00:04.100> so<00:00:05.100> that<00:00:05.279> it

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
down obviously it is uh so that it

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.190 
down obviously it is uh so that it
prevents<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.270> from<00:00:06.299> doing<00:00:06.600> something<00:00:06.750> like

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
prevents you from doing something like

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.900 
prevents you from doing something like
that<00:00:07.440> right<00:00:07.710> what<00:00:07.980> would<00:00:08.099> happen<00:00:08.490> if<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
that right what would happen if the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.740 
that right what would happen if the
dialer<00:00:09.150> disappearing<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.170> steel<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:11.099> tin

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
dialer disappearing this steel and tin

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.230 
dialer disappearing this steel and tin
alloy<00:00:12.750> or<00:00:13.440> something<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.490> pretty<00:00:14.790> flexible

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
alloy or something it is pretty flexible

able<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.300> because<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> carriers<00:00:55.350> like

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
able to it is because the carriers like

to lock this down and that would really
be<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.890> tragic<00:00:59.760> for<00:01:00.000> me<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:00.390> i<00:01:00.420> really

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

cheap two cents to send out and it is
free<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.159> receive<00:01:20.659> but<00:01:21.659> instead<00:01:22.110> they<00:01:22.320> would

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
free to receive but instead they would

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.499 
free to receive but instead they would

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
pretty much the whole country has jumped

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.850 
pretty much the whole country has jumped
on<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.330> reason<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.320> carriers

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
on that the reason that the carriers

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.270 
on that the reason that the carriers
lock<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.880> down<00:01:30.090> obviously<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.990> uh<00:01:31.280> so

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
lock this down obviously it is uh so

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.770 
lock this down obviously it is uh so
that<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.759> prevents<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.420> from<00:01:33.450> doing

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that it prevents you from doing

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.270 
that it prevents you from doing
something<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.619> right<00:01:34.799> what<00:01:35.159> would

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
something like that right what would

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.060 
something like that right what would
happen<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> dialer<00:01:36.329> disappeared<00:01:37.170> all<00:01:37.799> you

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
happen if the dialer disappeared all you

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.830 
happen if the dialer disappeared all you
would<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.090> add<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.329> back<00:01:39.600> in

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
would have to do is just add it back in

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.800 
would have to do is just add it back in
from<00:01:40.049> your<00:01:40.200> abs<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.850> there<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.970> go<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.689> know

specifically<00:02:23.280> sprint<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.970> verizon's<00:02:24.510> had

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.680 
specifically sprint and verizon's had
verizon<00:02:25.410> have<00:02:26.370> decided<00:02:26.880> not<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.209> go<00:02:27.390> with<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
verizon have decided not to go with the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.330 
verizon have decided not to go with the
wireless<00:02:27.900> charging<00:02:28.440> pins<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:28.890> some<00:02:29.040> reason

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
wireless charging pins for some reason

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.729 
wireless charging pins for some reason
maybe<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.670> was<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:29.940> they<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> cdma

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
maybe it was because they have a cdma

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.970 
maybe it was because they have a cdma
antenna<00:02:32.099> that<00:02:32.340> they<00:02:32.550> need<00:02:32.760> for<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.959> know<00:02:34.080> they

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
antenna that they need for you know they

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.680 
antenna that they need for you know they
need<00:02:35.160> by<00:02:35.370> qualcomm<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.060> there<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.420> somehow

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
need by qualcomm in there and somehow

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.800 
need by qualcomm in there and somehow
that<00:02:36.810> conflicted<00:02:37.620> i'm<00:02:37.739> not<00:02:37.920> sure<00:02:38.220> but<00:02:38.810> anyway

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that conflicted i'm not sure but anyway

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.839 
that conflicted i'm not sure but anyway
so<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.860> next<00:02:40.890> thing<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.280> wants<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.550> show<00:02:41.790> you

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
so the next thing I wants to show you

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.570 
so the next thing I wants to show you
obviously<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> TV<00:02:42.900> antenna<00:02:43.190> right<00:02:44.190> on<00:02:44.370> the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
obviously is a TV antenna right on the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.410 
obviously is a TV antenna right on the
TV<00:02:45.120> antenna<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:46.380> i<00:02:46.500> had<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.799> guess<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.610> some

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
TV antenna if i had to guess it is some

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.190 
TV antenna if i had to guess it is some
kind<00:02:48.569> of<00:02:48.600> stainless<00:02:49.110> steel<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:50.010> tin<00:02:50.750> alloy<00:02:51.750> or

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
kind of stainless steel and tin alloy or

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.979 
kind of stainless steel and tin alloy or
something<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.459> pretty<00:02:53.760> flexible<00:02:54.209> at<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
something it is pretty flexible at the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.380 
something it is pretty flexible at the
corner<00:02:55.319> here<00:02:55.560> but<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.610> also<00:02:56.819> very<00:02:56.970> durable

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
corner here but it is also very durable

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.559 
corner here but it is also very durable
but<00:02:58.319> i<00:02:58.380> actually<00:02:58.620> never<00:02:59.160> use<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.730> because<00:03:00.360> i

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
but i actually never use it because i

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.789 
but i actually never use it because i
always<00:03:01.200> have<00:03:01.530> something<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.489> stream<00:03:02.959> so<00:03:03.959> but

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
always have something to stream so but

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.740 
always have something to stream so but
