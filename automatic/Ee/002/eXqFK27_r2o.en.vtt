00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.160

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.960
 of change these days it turns out that 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.810
 been circulating a lot for equipment 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.449
 youtube with american girls and I hope 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.460
 you like it and then let's start I'm going to 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.570
 take my powder of viso this I'm going to 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.570
 apply with a brush 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.200
 do not 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.850
 I'm going to put together this angular brush 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:54.620
 scale and from this mix palette I 'm not going to 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.620
 take a little color 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.000
 just to define them 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:18.230
 1 and to do the outline of not being 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.230
 applying with the rosette that includes 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.840
 and control not only using the tip 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.840
 of the brush 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 i 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.930
 the contours of the nose 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.570
 is using the first of him 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.690
 and from the same couple with whom we draw 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.659
 The eyebrow use this light pink tone a 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.880
 no salmon really low satin 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.880
 and apply it in all my steps 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.140
 and with another point I'm going to take a bit of 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.140
 very clear 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.370
 fade a little here 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.980
 a little more 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.850
 Take some coffee for your eyebrows 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.410
 Y 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.410
 and a lot 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.620
 I'm going to take a combination between this 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.379
 matte white and this very clear coffee with 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.840
 light flashes is slightly sphinx 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.310
 and I'm going to paint it here in the arch of the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.440
 eyebrows let's call it a little 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.900
 with the angular thinking I'm going to take the 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.610
 black shadow and I'm going to spend all the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.610
 top eyeliner 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.270
 to 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.540
 the love 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.150
 with the brown shadow 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.379
 I'm going to delineate only half of the 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.379
 line of the lower lashes 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.040
 and with the sponge applicator I'm going to 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.910
 to warn while I'm going to take 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.450
 a spoon 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.450
 all right 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.920
 counting from the root 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.920
 eyelashes without pulling so as not to tear 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.020
 and of mascara I will be using tea 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.800
 of prose 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.440
 4 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.280
 a plica of my upper lashes and 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.280
 in the lower 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.930
 and finally to use this 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.930
 mix blogs 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.420
 as well as girls with this terminal 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.760
 try to adjust the products as 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.549
 that I could budget that we had to 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.650
 it was 300 pesos or less if they look for 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.509
 some products met a double or 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.880
 up to triple function as was the case 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.460
 this palette that helped me to 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.280
 delineate my eyebrows delineate my eye and 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.570
 also to make up my eyelids is 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.820
 question of throwing some coconut to 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.460
 the things and really that if you can 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.259
 occupy less quantity of products for 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.050
 that you see a good look a good 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.830
 result I hope you liked it and more 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.830
 we see in the next
