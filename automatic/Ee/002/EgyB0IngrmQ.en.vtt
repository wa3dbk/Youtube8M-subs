00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the other rock was hampering my rock my

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.830 
the other rock was hampering my rock my
button<00:02:01.860> place<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.340> ability<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.969> didn't<00:02:03.689> run

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
button place and ability I didn't run

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.330 
button place and ability I didn't run
out<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> water<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> didn't<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.040> show<00:02:05.310> you
