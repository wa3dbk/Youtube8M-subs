but you always have to do that so I
thought<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.640> know<00:01:41.820> axles<00:01:42.420> would<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.720> good<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
thought you know axles would be good to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.020 
thought you know axles would be good to
have<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.979> hand<00:01:44.009> um<00:01:46.040> so<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.399> where<00:01:47.610> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
have on hand um so this is where it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.109 
have on hand um so this is where it
comes<00:01:48.299> down<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.780> color<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.530> shape<00:01:50.119> well

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
just put both of them in there because

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.929 
just put both of them in there because
axles<00:01:54.299> has<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.720> many<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.369> even

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
think that these do work good this is an

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.310 
think that these do work good this is an
opinion<00:06:07.060> out<00:06:07.210> of<00:06:07.360> fact<00:06:07.690> the<00:06:07.930> only<00:06:07.990> thing

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
opinion out of fact the only thing

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.320 
opinion out of fact the only thing
that's<00:06:08.500> a<00:06:08.590> fact<00:06:08.919> is<00:06:09.159> that<00:06:09.190> the<00:06:09.460> professionals

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330
