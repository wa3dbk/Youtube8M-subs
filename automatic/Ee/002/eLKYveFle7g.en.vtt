this<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.050> wrong<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.709> have<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.010> chain<00:02:33.250> in

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
this is wrong and you have to chain in

this is wrong and you have to chain in
and<00:02:33.610> then<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.970> find<00:02:34.270> a<00:02:34.390> way<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.570> do<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.959> all

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
and then you find a way to do it all

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.830 
and then you find a way to do it all
right<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.920> think<00:02:36.280> it's<00:02:36.400> really<00:02:37.150> important<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
right I think it's really important the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.780 
right I think it's really important the
creeps<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.380> think<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.489> of<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.670> more

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
creeps I think it's one of the more

have
you<00:03:00.610> have<00:03:00.940> your<00:03:01.180> work<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.840> see<00:03:02.200> other<00:03:02.380> people

you have your work and see other people
work<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.340> everything<00:03:03.550> on<00:03:03.850> how<00:03:04.030> they<00:03:04.210> exactly

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
work and everything on how they exactly

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.380 
work and everything on how they exactly
the<00:03:05.230> same<00:03:05.440> thing<00:03:05.710> that<00:03:05.740> you<00:03:05.920> do<00:03:06.280> they<00:03:06.970> present

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
the same thing that you do they present

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.510 
the same thing that you do they present
a<00:03:07.450> different<00:03:07.630> way<00:03:07.990> so<00:03:08.050> they<00:03:08.620> they<00:03:09.310> show

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
a different way so they they show

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.900 
a different way so they they show
different<00:03:09.940> things<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.450> it's<00:03:10.990> pretty<00:03:11.700> good<00:03:12.700> to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
different things and it's pretty good to

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.660 
different things and it's pretty good to
have<00:03:13.090> like<00:03:13.360> kind<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:13.990> arm<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.520> created<00:03:15.520> from

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
have like kind of arm is created from

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.870 
have like kind of arm is created from
different<00:03:16.240> things<00:03:16.860> so<00:03:17.860> I<00:03:18.160> think<00:03:18.460> it's<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.730> very

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
different things so I think it's a very

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.660 
different things so I think it's a very
important<00:03:19.420> swell
