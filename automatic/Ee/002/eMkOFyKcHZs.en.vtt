the game design I'll start the beginning
event<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:17.490> story<00:00:17.699> as<00:00:17.820> I've<00:00:17.940> been<00:00:17.970> told<00:00:18.210> there

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
event the story as I've been told there

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.529 
event the story as I've been told there
was<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.109> large<00:00:19.910> essentially<00:00:20.910> an<00:00:20.970> action<00:00:21.359> figure

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
was a large essentially an action figure

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.710 
was a large essentially an action figure
concept<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.619> came<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> company<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.720> I

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
concept that came to the company and I

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.599 
concept that came to the company and I
think<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.140> had<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.380> hand<00:00:25.590> crank<00:00:25.920> open<00:00:26.130> from

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
think you had to hand crank open from

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.160 
think you had to hand crank open from
the<00:00:26.730> round<00:00:26.910> shape<00:00:27.090> into<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> action<00:00:27.900> figures

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the round shape into the action figures

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.759 
the round shape into the action figures
over<00:00:29.130> time<00:00:29.519> as<00:00:29.939> more<00:00:30.199> engineers<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.410> creative

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
over time as more engineers and creative

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.260 
over time as more engineers and creative
people<00:00:31.890> got<00:00:32.099> involved<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.940> essentially

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
people got involved it essentially

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.910

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
hand-cranked open to a small thing which

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
hand-cranked open to a small thing which
is<00:00:37.860> now<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> modern<00:00:38.579> bak<00:00:38.790> gonna<00:00:39.030> see
