00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
looks like it's this same setup for this

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.650 
looks like it's this same setup for this
you<00:00:38.760> know<00:00:38.850> they're<00:00:38.969> gonna<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.239> dollar<00:00:39.420> each

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
you know they're gonna be a dollar each

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.420 
you know they're gonna be a dollar each
and<00:00:40.050> get<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> couple<00:00:40.620> cards<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.040> them<00:00:41.160> every

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
and get a couple cards in them every

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.700 
and get a couple cards in them every
time<00:00:41.579> star<00:00:41.940> foils<00:00:42.360> return<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.989> looks<00:00:43.200> like<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
time star foils return it looks like and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
time star foils return it looks like and
with<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.270> some<00:00:45.420> info<00:00:45.719> saying

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
with this that we have some info saying

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.680 
with this that we have some info saying
that<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.379> guess<00:00:46.860> Mobius<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.690> polymerization

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that I guess Mobius a polymerization

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.950 
that I guess Mobius a polymerization
gem-knight<00:00:49.140> fusion<00:00:49.320> XA<00:00:50.129> versoza<00:00:50.489> and

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
gem-knight fusion XA versoza and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.049 
gem-knight fusion XA versoza and
constellar<00:00:51.960> ugly<00:00:52.379> d<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.129> yeah<00:00:53.850> that's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
constellar ugly d so yeah that's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.000 
constellar ugly d so yeah that's
supposedly<00:00:54.840> what's<00:00:55.079> giving<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.649> far<00:00:55.860> we

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
supposedly what's giving this so far we

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.080 
supposedly what's giving this so far we
don't<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.280> full<00:00:56.430> card<00:00:56.610> list<00:00:56.850> yet

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
don't have a full card list yet

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.139 
don't have a full card list yet
obviously<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:59.010> hoping<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.030> will

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
obviously but I'm hoping that this will

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.790 
obviously but I'm hoping that this will
be<00:01:00.300> good<00:01:00.539> i<00:01:00.780> evidently<00:01:00.989> we're<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> have

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
be good i evidently we're going to have

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.920 
be good i evidently we're going to have
raid<00:01:01.980> rafters<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.699> my<00:01:02.850> pals<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.390> super<00:01:03.780> heavy

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
raid rafters for my pals and super heavy

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.590 
raid rafters for my pals and super heavy
samurais<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:04.860> well<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.880> i'm<00:01:06.150> hoping

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
samurais and this as well so i'm hoping

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.969 
samurais and this as well so i'm hoping
that<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.350> something<00:01:07.710> good<00:01:07.920> in

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that there will be something good in

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.410 
that there will be something good in
this<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.610> even<00:01:08.729> supposed<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.119> contain

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
this and it's even supposed to contain

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
this and it's even supposed to contain
legend<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> blue-eyes<00:01:10.080> White<00:01:10.470> Dragon<00:01:10.890> cards

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
legend a blue-eyes White Dragon cards

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.420 
legend a blue-eyes White Dragon cards
all<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> way<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> head<00:01:11.939> narsil<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.200> could<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
all the way to head narsil so could the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.039 
all the way to head narsil so could the
wobble<00:01:14.729> chain<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.689> mean<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:15.990> it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
wobble chain be in this I mean if it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.600 
wobble chain be in this I mean if it
didn't<00:01:16.200> happen<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.500> premium<00:01:16.799> gold<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.549> so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
didn't happen in premium gold that's so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.410 
didn't happen in premium gold that's so
I'm<00:01:17.670> kind<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> wondering<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.270> would<00:01:18.360> be

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I'm kind of wondering that would be

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.550 
I'm kind of wondering that would be
something<00:01:18.570> they<00:01:18.720> could<00:01:18.840> save<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.200> back<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
something they could save this back and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.539 
something they could save this back and
I<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.830> hope<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.400> I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
I really hope they do that because I

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.370 
I really hope they do that because I
like<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.850> idea<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.240> these<00:01:21.390> packs<00:01:21.630> they<00:01:22.170> just

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
like the idea of these packs they just

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.080 
like the idea of these packs they just
never<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:23.100> had<00:01:23.430> good<00:01:23.580> reprints<00:01:24.030> I

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
never have really had good reprints I

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.700 
never have really had good reprints I
mean<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.689> only<00:01:24.780> good<00:01:25.200> reprint<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.590> can

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
mean the only good reprint I can

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.260 
mean the only good reprint I can
remember<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.070> all<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.430> them<00:01:26.549> even<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:27.030> card

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
remember from all of them even was card

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.710 
remember from all of them even was card
cardi<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.220> that's<00:01:29.220> pretty<00:01:29.610> much<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.360> I'm

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
cardi and that's pretty much it so I'm

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.210 
cardi and that's pretty much it so I'm
hoping<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.079> will<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.009> mean

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
hoping that will be in there and I mean

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.890 
hoping that will be in there and I mean
they<00:01:32.400> could<00:01:32.640> even<00:01:32.790> have<00:01:33.119> auto<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.540> spindle
