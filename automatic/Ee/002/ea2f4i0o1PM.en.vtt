00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.870 
coat of rust-oleum on it as you can see
I<00:00:22.230> mean<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:22.650> not<00:00:22.800> perfect

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
runs and things like that because I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.479 
runs and things like that because I
painted<00:00:29.369> some<00:00:29.429> pretty<00:00:29.730> thick<00:00:29.970> coats<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:31.489> by
