00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
person to review this unit so maybe they

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.029 
person to review this unit so maybe they
took<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:43.990> out<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.170> threw<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.649> away<00:01:44.710> or

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
fingerprints on it which I always hate

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.580 
fingerprints on it which I always hate
let's<00:01:52.359> go<00:01:52.450> ahead<00:01:52.539> and<00:01:52.719> see<00:01:52.869> what<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:54.159> is<00:01:54.219> like

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
let's go ahead and see what this is like

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.190 
let's go ahead and see what this is like
clean<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:56.770> off<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:56.950> little<00:01:57.159> bit<00:01:58.590> okay<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
clean that off a little bit okay so the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.700 
clean that off a little bit okay so the
specs<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:02.649> this<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:03.009> 2<00:02:03.189> gigabytes<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:04.060> RAM<00:02:04.710> 3

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
specs of this is 2 gigabytes of RAM 3

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.810 
specs of this is 2 gigabytes of RAM 3
I'm<00:02:05.799> thinking<00:02:06.130> about<00:02:06.219> hard<00:02:06.520> drive<00:02:06.789> a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
I'm thinking about hard drive a

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.499 
I'm thinking about hard drive a
dual-core<00:02:07.509> 1.6<00:02:08.440> Atom<00:02:09.129> processor<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:10.330> have<00:02:10.360> a

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
dual-core 1.6 Atom processor you have a

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.649 
dual-core 1.6 Atom processor you have a
vision<00:02:11.050> AMD<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.980> also<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.060> course<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.450> have
