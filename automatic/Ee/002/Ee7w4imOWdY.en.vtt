00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.640
 this time in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.850
 answer the question that I have been asked 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.240
 very often that is about what 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.550
 It is better if we wet our sponge to 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.240
 apply our paint or wet our 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.189
 painting good because in my case the majority 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.710
 of the times what I do is with a 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.589
 designer spray like this 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.000
 that really throws water in a very 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.300
 finite 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.700
 what I do is not perfectly well 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:42.610
 sponge with about 4 or 5 stars and 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:48.760
 I share the water in this way 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:51.210
 and then already on my painting a 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.210
 sponge 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.899
 about four or five times 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.990
 the painting looks very good and then 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.799
 he applied it on the skin 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.120
 and look, it looks very nice and very 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.400
 parejito ay I do not know if you reach to see 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.650
 I will use this other type of color 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.450
 so that it shows more 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.700
 because it was very clear 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.060
 and with the light of the camera you do not notice 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.060
 much 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.150
 well look at now from these of the 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.150
 dark colors 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.080
 Let's see if it shows 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.930
 and apply and look is perfectly 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.930
 all right 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.719
 there is 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.940
 and good 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.270
 it's a way even more to me was it 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.000
 makes it cleaner because if we get wet 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.100
 directly the paint sometimes the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.929
 colors mix a little when 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.790
 we are using colors that 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:18.220
 they come already that different and good 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.470
 it makes me that it's even up to 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.370
 little bit more hygienic to wet our 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.430
 sponge and good then 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.010
 and this is the way I do it 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.780
 I hope they work and have responded to 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.319
 your question and see you in the next 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.319
 tutorial
