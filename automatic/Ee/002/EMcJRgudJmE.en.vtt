soon<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.619> once<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
soon as you can once you have the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.550 
soon as you can once you have the
council<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.450> down<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.840> throw<00:01:52.020> down<00:01:52.259> two

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
council going down you throw down two

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.859 
council going down you throw down two
more<00:01:52.710> gateways<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:55.560> course<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.869> warp

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
more gateways of course you have warp

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.870 
more gateways of course you have warp
gate<00:01:57.990> research<00:01:58.320> coming<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:59.399> soon<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.790> you

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
gate research coming in as soon as you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.800 
gate research coming in as soon as you
possibly<00:02:00.240> can

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.719 

and<00:02:03.810> put<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> fourth<00:02:04.950> gateway<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.520> well

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
and put it on a fourth gateway as well

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.770 
and put it on a fourth gateway as well
you<00:02:05.880> don't<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> throw<00:02:06.390> down<00:02:06.509> four

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
you don't have to throw down four

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.510 
you don't have to throw down four
gateways<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:08.009> three<00:02:08.310> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
gateways you can do it with three and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.820 
gateways you can do it with three and
it's<00:02:08.640> probably<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.569> efficient<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.709> if

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
it's probably just as efficient but if

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.530 
it's probably just as efficient but if
my<00:02:11.039> night<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.459> macro<00:02:11.790> slips<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.209> little<00:02:12.239> bit

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
my night the macro slips a little bit

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.120 
my night the macro slips a little bit
you<00:02:12.660> miss<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> couple<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.590> seconds<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.069> the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
you miss a couple of seconds of the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.470 
you miss a couple of seconds of the
cooldown<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.730> want<00:02:14.880> be<00:02:14.940> able<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.150> burn<00:02:15.300> those

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
cooldown you want be able to burn those

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.570 
cooldown you want be able to burn those
extra<00:02:15.720> resources<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.890> figure<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> fourth

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
extra resources so I figure a fourth

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.790 
extra resources so I figure a fourth
gate<00:02:17.819> isn't<00:02:18.030> completely<00:02:18.510> out<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.690> line<00:02:18.930> you

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
gate isn't completely out of line you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.040 
gate isn't completely out of line you
want<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.190> about<00:02:20.400> 16<00:02:20.940> probes<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.630> minerals

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
want to have about 16 probes on minerals

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.490 
want to have about 16 probes on minerals
and<00:02:22.260> about<00:02:22.410> six<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:24.150> gas<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:25.230> you're<00:02:25.380> going

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
and about six on the gas so you're going

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.870 
and about six on the gas so you're going
to<00:02:25.560> want<00:02:26.090> total<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.390> twenty<00:02:28.050> four<00:02:28.530> twenty<00:02:29.280> two

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
to want total of twenty four twenty two

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.150 
to want total of twenty four twenty two
probes<00:02:30.239> total<00:02:32.930> but<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.380> think<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.769> have<00:02:34.920> that

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
probes total but I think I have that

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.570 
probes total but I think I have that
right<00:02:35.489> now<00:02:35.790> yeah<00:02:37.130> that's<00:02:38.130> where<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.340> want<00:02:38.519> to

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
right now yeah that's where you want to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.300 
right now yeah that's where you want to
stop<00:02:39.390> because<00:02:39.600> at<00:02:39.900> 16<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.709> minerals<00:02:41.069> and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
stop because at 16 on the minerals and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.830 
stop because at 16 on the minerals and
six<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.760> gas<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.330> are<00:02:42.390> at<00:02:42.600> maximum

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
six on the gas you are at maximum

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.770 
six on the gas you are at maximum
efficiency<00:02:43.489> but<00:02:44.489> once<00:02:44.670> blink<00:02:45.000> finishes<00:02:45.450> warp

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
efficiency but once blink finishes warp

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.180 
efficiency but once blink finishes warp
gates<00:02:45.989> should<00:02:46.140> finish<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.590> warp<00:02:46.799> in<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.980> round

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
gates should finish you warp in a round

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.610 
gates should finish you warp in a round
of<00:02:47.340> stalkers<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.780> push<00:02:48.959> out<00:02:49.170> his

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
of stalkers then you push out his

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.110 
of stalkers then you push out his
Overlord<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.100> getting<00:02:50.370> close<00:02:50.640> he<00:02:50.819> hasn't

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
Overlord is getting close he hasn't

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.190 
Overlord is getting close he hasn't
spotted<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.569> yet<00:02:51.600> he<00:02:51.810> doesn't<00:02:51.989> know<00:02:52.049> what<00:02:52.110> I'm

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
spotted it yet he doesn't know what I'm

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.610 
spotted it yet he doesn't know what I'm
doing<00:02:52.470> yet<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:53.580> he<00:02:53.700> hasn't<00:02:53.730> done<00:02:54.209> anything

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
doing yet so he hasn't done anything

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.039 
doing yet so he hasn't done anything
overwhelmingly<00:02:55.620> weird<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:57.750> move<00:02:57.930> out

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
overwhelmingly weird and I move out

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.390 
overwhelmingly weird and I move out
around<00:02:58.319> seven<00:02:58.590> minutes<00:02:58.980> with<00:02:59.069> my<00:02:59.190> stalker

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
around seven minutes with my stalker

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.880 
around seven minutes with my stalker
force<00:02:59.720> now<00:03:00.720> at<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:00.959> point<00:03:01.049> he<00:03:01.380> knows<00:03:01.530> what's

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
force now at this point he knows what's

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.059 
force now at this point he knows what's
up<00:03:02.069> I<00:03:02.340> think<00:03:02.670> he<00:03:02.880> finally<00:03:03.480> sees<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:04.080> we<00:03:04.769> look<00:03:04.950> at

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
up I think he finally sees it we look at

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.199 
up I think he finally sees it we look at
his<00:03:05.220> perspective<00:03:05.819> yeah<00:03:06.060> he<00:03:06.239> sees<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.980> archive

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
his perspective yeah he sees the archive

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.690 
his perspective yeah he sees the archive
Council<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:09.329> he<00:03:09.450> knows<00:03:09.630> what's<00:03:09.840> coming

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
Council so he knows what's coming

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.349 
Council so he knows what's coming
unfortunate<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.760> not<00:03:11.910> much<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.150> can<00:03:12.269> do<00:03:12.329> to

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
unfortunate is not much you can do to

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.090 
unfortunate is not much you can do to
prevent<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.810> he<00:03:12.959> has<00:03:13.109> speedlings<00:03:13.739> he<00:03:13.950> has<00:03:14.070> a

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
prevent it he has speedlings he has a

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.370 
prevent it he has speedlings he has a
couple<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.430> crawlers<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.180> think<00:03:16.049> he<00:03:16.109> has<00:03:16.170> one

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
couple of crawlers I think he has one

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.110 
couple of crawlers I think he has one
crawler<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.739> he's<00:03:16.859> getting<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.250> more

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
crawler and he's getting a more

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.400 
crawler and he's getting a more
speedlings<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.570> think<00:03:18.690> he's<00:03:18.780> getting<00:03:18.840> roaches

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
speedlings I think he's getting roaches

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.449 
speedlings I think he's getting roaches
sick<00:03:19.739> production<00:03:20.930> yeah<00:03:22.340> visit<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
sick production yeah visit in the

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.380 
sick production yeah visit in the
positioning<00:03:23.940> here<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.120> actually<00:03:24.359> very

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
positioning here is actually very

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.780 
positioning here is actually very
important<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.620> works<00:03:25.890> best<00:03:26.160> on<00:03:26.310> maps<00:03:26.549> like

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
important this works best on maps like

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.370 
important this works best on maps like
this<00:03:27.030> because<00:03:27.239> this<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.900> very<00:03:27.989> micro

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
this because this is a very micro

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.410 
this because this is a very micro
intensive<00:03:28.799> strategy<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.760> want<00:03:29.910> your<00:03:30.000> pile<00:03:30.269> on

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
intensive strategy you want your pile on

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.849 
intensive strategy you want your pile on
to<00:03:30.540> be<00:03:30.630> on<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.780> low<00:03:30.930> ground<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.530> can<00:03:31.680> warp

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
to be on the low ground so you can warp

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.400 
to be on the low ground so you can warp
onto<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.220> high<00:03:32.340> ground<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:33.239> want<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:34.260> can

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
onto the high ground you want you can

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.020 
onto the high ground you want you can
all<00:03:34.500> use<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> spray<00:03:35.010> on<00:03:35.040> maps<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.609> have<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.819> low

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
all use a spray on maps that have a low

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.370 
all use a spray on maps that have a low

the<00:03:38.069> reason<00:03:38.430> for<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:39.739> blink<00:03:40.739> the

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
the reason for that is you blink the

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.380 
the reason for that is you blink the
stalkers<00:03:41.220> as<00:03:41.340> they're<00:03:41.519> being<00:03:41.640> damaged<00:03:42.060> one<00:03:42.239> by

stalkers as they're being damaged one by

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
one onto the low ground so they can

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.569 
one onto the low ground so they can
regenerate<00:03:44.730> their<00:03:45.000> shields<00:03:46.130> if<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.310> can't

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
regenerate their shields if you can't

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:48.979 
regenerate their shields if you can't
blink<00:03:47.819> onto<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.180> low<00:03:48.299> ground<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.630> strategy

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
blink onto the low ground the strategy

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.720 
blink onto the low ground the strategy
is<00:03:49.019> much<00:03:49.380> less<00:03:49.620> effective<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.340> doesn't<00:03:50.579> work

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730

it's pretty much game over that's not
really<00:06:02.380> much<00:06:02.470> else<00:06:02.530> you<00:06:02.740> can<00:06:02.830> do<00:06:03.010> at<00:06:03.130> this

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
really much else you can do at this

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.370 
really much else you can do at this

the<00:06:07.750> second<00:06:08.080> hatch<00:06:08.340> what<00:06:09.340> exactly<00:06:09.640> I'm<00:06:09.700> a<00:06:09.760> free

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
the second hatch what exactly I'm a free

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.550 
the second hatch what exactly I'm a free
source<00:06:10.120> to<00:06:10.300> support<00:06:10.630> two<00:06:10.750> hats<00:06:10.930> producing<00:06:11.470> off

one base unless it's constant zerglings
and<00:06:14.290> those<00:06:14.380> are<00:06:14.500> easy<00:06:14.530> to<00:06:14.800> kill<00:06:14.950> with<00:06:15.130> stalkers

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.010 

and<00:06:20.250> keep<00:06:20.550> blinking<00:06:20.730> back<00:06:21.060> don't<00:06:21.480> ever<00:06:21.750> stop

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
and keep blinking back don't ever stop

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.000 
and keep blinking back don't ever stop
blinking<00:06:22.230> because<00:06:22.560> you<00:06:22.650> think<00:06:22.830> you've<00:06:22.980> won

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
blinking because you think you've won

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.980 
blinking because you think you've won
because<00:06:23.400> when<00:06:24.120> you<00:06:24.210> do<00:06:24.360> that<00:06:24.540> you<00:06:24.690> lose<00:06:24.720> all

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
because when you do that you lose all

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.540 
because when you do that you lose all
your<00:06:25.050> stalkers<00:06:25.530> then<00:06:25.680> you<00:06:25.770> lose<00:06:25.920> the<00:06:25.950> game<00:06:26.100> I

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
your stalkers then you lose the game I

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.600 
your stalkers then you lose the game I
mean<00:06:27.240> if<00:06:27.390> this<00:06:27.510> stalker<00:06:27.810> army<00:06:28.140> goes<00:06:28.260> down

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
mean if this stalker army goes down

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.220 
mean if this stalker army goes down
you're<00:06:29.610> done<00:06:29.790> because<00:06:30.390> you<00:06:30.660> only<00:06:30.780> have<00:06:31.020> one

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
you're done because you only have one

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:38.119 
you're done because you only have one
base<00:06:31.440> with<00:06:31.650> minimal<00:06:31.980> workers<00:06:32.310> on

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:38.129 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:39.469 

all<00:06:38.639> right<00:06:38.789> here<00:06:38.939> you<00:06:39.029> can<00:06:39.179> see<00:06:39.300> there's

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
all right here you can see there's

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:40.850 
all right here you can see there's
nothing<00:06:39.749> you<00:06:39.809> can<00:06:39.899> do<00:06:39.989> the<00:06:40.080> food<00:06:40.229> differential

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
nothing you can do the food differential

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:47.060 
nothing you can do the food differential
itself<00:06:41.189> is<00:06:41.309> like<00:06:41.580> 20<00:06:41.969> this<00:06:42.149> point<00:06:42.419> by<00:06:42.509> itself

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.650 

he<00:06:47.670> does<00:06:47.880> stay<00:06:48.090> in<00:06:48.180> the<00:06:48.270> game<00:06:48.420> for<00:06:48.570> a<00:06:48.600> little

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
he does stay in the game for a little

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.330 
he does stay in the game for a little
bit<00:06:48.810> longer<00:06:49.050> but<00:06:49.350> I<00:06:49.410> think<00:06:49.710> he's<00:06:49.860> just<00:06:50.100> being

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
bit longer but I think he's just being

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.280 
bit longer but I think he's just being
stubborn<00:06:50.640> at<00:06:50.880> this<00:06:51.000> point<00:06:51.240> I<00:06:51.510> don't<00:06:51.960> know<00:06:52.110> why

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
stubborn at this point I don't know why

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.190 
stubborn at this point I don't know why
choose<00:06:52.890> to<00:06:53.040> stay<00:06:53.420> but<00:06:54.420> the<00:06:54.540> strategy<00:06:54.750> does

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
choose to stay but the strategy does

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.020 
choose to stay but the strategy does
beat<00:06:55.500> very<00:06:55.860> good<00:06:56.100> players<00:06:56.370> as<00:06:56.550> well<00:06:56.580> I<00:06:56.970> know

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
beat very good players as well I know

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.280 
beat very good players as well I know
eyes<00:06:57.300> are<00:06:57.480> lost<00:06:57.690> to<00:06:57.960> it<00:06:59.750> he's<00:07:00.750> the<00:07:00.900> most<00:07:01.020> famous

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
eyes are lost to it he's the most famous

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.050 
eyes are lost to it he's the most famous
example<00:07:01.860> the<00:07:01.950> players<00:07:02.160> loftus<00:07:02.640> I<00:07:02.760> can<00:07:02.880> think

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
example the players loftus I can think

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.870 
example the players loftus I can think
of<00:07:03.740> but<00:07:04.740> I'm<00:07:04.980> sure<00:07:05.190> there<00:07:05.340> have<00:07:05.430> been<00:07:05.520> many

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
of but I'm sure there have been many

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.260 
of but I'm sure there have been many

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
others including mr. right here it's not

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.630 
others including mr. right here it's not
overly<00:07:09.570> hard<00:07:09.870> to<00:07:09.990> execute<00:07:10.260> and<00:07:10.620> on<00:07:11.160> some<00:07:11.460> maps

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.640 
overly hard to execute and on some maps

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.960 
overly hard to execute and on some maps
like<00:07:11.910> this<00:07:12.120> it<00:07:12.600> is<00:07:12.780> extremely<00:07:13.140> powerful<00:07:13.440> I

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:13.970
