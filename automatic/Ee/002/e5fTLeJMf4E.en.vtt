idea is that creative behavior requires

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.869 
idea is that creative behavior requires
you<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> break<00:00:37.500> rules<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.160> create<00:00:38.520> something

you to break rules to create something

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.819 
you to break rules to create something
you<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.480> think<00:00:39.840> outside<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.590> normal

for being part of the study the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.700 
for being part of the study the
researchers<00:01:15.119> also<00:01:15.150> allowed<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.110> report

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
their own scores on the honor system so

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.510 
their own scores on the honor system so
they<00:01:19.259> could<00:01:19.320> say<00:01:19.560> they<00:01:19.710> got<00:01:19.830> whatever<00:01:20.220> score

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
they wanted but the researchers were

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
they wanted but the researchers were
also<00:01:22.350> secretly<00:01:22.830> tracking<00:01:23.189> their<00:01:23.520> progress<00:01:23.549> so

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
also secretly tracking their progress so

finally the participants were given some

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
finally the participants were given some

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
possible that dishonesty is so

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.569 
possible that dishonesty is so
widespread<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.930> society<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:37.799> by<00:01:38.189> acting

widespread in society because by acting

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.130 
widespread in society because by acting
dishonest<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.119> become<00:01:39.390> more<00:01:39.600> creative<00:01:39.840> which
