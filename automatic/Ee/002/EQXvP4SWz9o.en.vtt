00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:17.670
 and mann a18 is one of the few difference 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.440
 is in the process 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.640

 1 gigabyte capacity farther 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.910
 the main difference in the cameras is still 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.400
 lies in the alarm she is written to us 18 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.010

 megapixel on batl s09 8 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.670

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.630
 consider both the phone a little closer 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.630
