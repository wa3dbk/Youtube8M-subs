00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
barrel then I taped it on the end of the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.160 
barrel then I taped it on the end of the
gas<00:02:58.840> mask<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.500> look<00:02:59.680> connected<00:03:00.310> also<00:03:01.300> tape<00:03:02.020> the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
gas mask to look connected also tape the

gas mask to look connected also tape the
barrel<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.830> mask<00:03:03.100> from<00:03:03.490> the<00:03:03.550> back<00:03:04.050> make

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
barrel on the mask from the back make

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.530 
barrel on the mask from the back make
the<00:03:05.260> barrel<00:03:05.590> look<00:03:05.770> a<00:03:05.950> little<00:03:06.340> tilted<00:03:06.819> now<00:03:07.480> you

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
the barrel look a little tilted now you

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.010 
the barrel look a little tilted now you
do<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.230> same<00:03:08.440> thing<00:03:08.709> on<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.100> other<00:03:09.130> side<00:03:09.340> and

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
do the same thing on the other side and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.809 
do the same thing on the other side and
now<00:03:11.020> we<00:03:11.080> are<00:03:11.410> going<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.709> make<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:11.980> smaller<00:03:12.430> tube

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
now we are going to make a smaller tube

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.150 
now we are going to make a smaller tube
to<00:03:13.000> put<00:03:13.209> on<00:03:13.390> top<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.959> barrel<00:03:16.590> now<00:03:17.590> glue<00:03:18.010> it

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
to put on top of the barrel now glue it

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.430 
to put on top of the barrel now glue it
and<00:03:18.400> tape<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.850> on<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.270> repeat<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.170> on<00:03:20.380> the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
and tape it on and repeat it on the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.130 
and tape it on and repeat it on the
other<00:03:20.620> side<00:03:20.860> now<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.910> barrels<00:03:22.510> are<00:03:22.660> kind<00:03:22.930> of

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
other side now the barrels are kind of

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.960 
other side now the barrels are kind of
leaning<00:03:23.709> forward<00:03:23.739> too<00:03:24.340> much<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.850> doesn't

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
leaning forward too much and it doesn't

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.130 
leaning forward too much and it doesn't
look<00:03:25.269> right<00:03:25.540> anymore

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
look right anymore

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.320 
look right anymore
instead<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:27.010> cutting<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.459> off<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:27.910> doing<00:03:28.090> it

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
instead of cutting it off and doing it

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.990 
instead of cutting it off and doing it
over<00:03:28.570> again<00:03:28.780> cut<00:03:29.709> only<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.160> part<00:03:30.550> where<00:03:30.850> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
over again cut only the part where the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.380 
over again cut only the part where the
barrel<00:03:31.390> clings<00:03:31.690> on<00:03:32.730> then<00:03:33.730> push<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.180> back<00:03:34.360> a

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
barrel clings on then push it back a

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.840 
barrel clings on then push it back a
little<00:03:34.540> bit<00:03:34.930> then<00:03:35.680> tape<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.400> way

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
little bit then tape it that way

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.699 
little bit then tape it that way
from<00:03:37.030> behind<00:03:39.630> now<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:40.959> you<00:03:41.019> can<00:03:41.440> actually

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.130 
from behind now so you can actually
breathe<00:03:42.310> through<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.819> mask<00:03:43.030> cut<00:03:43.569> open<00:03:43.989> the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
breathe through the mask cut open the

both<00:04:19.389> sides<00:04:19.959> and<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.980> kind<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.370> made<00:04:21.549> a<00:04:21.579> v<00:04:21.910> cut

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
both sides and I kind of made a v cut

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.850 
both sides and I kind of made a v cut
here<00:04:22.540> and<00:04:22.750> drew<00:04:23.680> some<00:04:23.740> details<00:04:24.460> around<00:04:24.820> as<00:04:25.860> you
