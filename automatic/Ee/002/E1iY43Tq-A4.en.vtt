and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230 
and
she's<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.800> let<00:01:35.250> me<00:01:35.340> go<00:01:35.430> out<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.670> sides<00:01:35.880> let<00:01:36.150> me

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
she's not let me go out the sides let me

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.970 
she's not let me go out the sides let me
go<00:01:36.300> get<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.480> bigger<00:01:36.690> size<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.470> that's<00:01:37.710> actually

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
go get a bigger size but that's actually

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.650 
go get a bigger size but that's actually
if<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.370> start<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:38.880> after<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.360> while

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
if they start it up after a while

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.910 
if they start it up after a while
and<00:01:39.960> I've<00:01:40.050> had<00:01:40.230> some<00:01:40.410> parents<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.770> I've

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and I've had some parents that I've

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.500 
and I've had some parents that I've
ended<00:01:41.160> up<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.490> being<00:01:41.640> able<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.940> wear<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.330> and

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
ended up not being able to wear this and

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.090 
ended up not being able to wear this and
they<00:01:42.600> were<00:01:42.660> just<00:01:42.930> too<00:01:43.110> big<00:01:43.290> after<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
they were just too big after all and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.470 
they were just too big after all and
it's<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.400> true<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.910> that's<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.300> area

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
it's so true because that's the area

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.630 
it's so true because that's the area
where<00:01:45.990> your<00:01:46.440> tension<00:01:46.830> point<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.250> yeah<00:01:47.580> that's

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
where your tension point is yeah that's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.070 
where your tension point is yeah that's
where<00:01:47.910> you<00:01:48.000> move<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.390> most<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:48.900> why

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
where you move the most so that's why

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.840 
where you move the most so that's why
it's<00:01:49.260> so<00:01:49.410> important<00:01:49.800> to<00:01:49.860> make<00:01:50.430> sure<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.790> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it's so important to make sure it's a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.180 
it's so important to make sure it's a
little<00:01:51.090> bit<00:01:51.210> snug<00:01:51.390> around<00:01:51.540> there<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.500> because

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
little bit snug around there now because

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.830 
little bit snug around there now because
the<00:01:53.430> key<00:01:53.580> thing<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.030> isn't<00:01:54.300> snug<00:01:54.660> enough

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the key thing is it isn't snug enough

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.720 
the key thing is it isn't snug enough
what<00:01:55.350> will<00:01:55.500> happen<00:01:55.830> is<00:01:56.010> so<00:01:56.160> stretch

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
what will happen is so stretch

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.190 
what will happen is so stretch
yeah<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.120> therefore<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:57.630> pocket<00:01:58.050> will

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
yeah and therefore the pocket will

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.650 
yeah and therefore the pocket will
actually<00:01:58.590> go<00:01:58.860> lower<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.700> another<00:02:00.210> thing<00:02:00.480> well

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
actually go lower and another thing well

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.780 
actually go lower and another thing well
it<00:02:00.930> causes<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.620> be<00:02:01.980> a<00:02:02.010> little<00:02:02.280> bit<00:02:02.400> more<00:02:02.520> say

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
it causes it to be a little bit more say

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.450 
it causes it to be a little bit more say
you're<00:02:03.120> looking<00:02:03.480> and<00:02:03.810> it'll<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.260> more<00:02:04.830> flying

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
you're looking and it'll be more flying

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.520 
you're looking and it'll be more flying
out<00:02:05.730> with<00:02:05.910> right<00:02:06.120> eye<00:02:06.150> area<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.080> so<00:02:07.320> what

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
out with right eye area do so so what

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.050 
out with right eye area do so so what
about<00:02:07.650> at<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.010> ugly<00:02:08.130> kind<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.700> different

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
about at the ugly kind of different

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.730 
about at the ugly kind of different
shapes<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.540> there<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> certain<00:02:09.990> style<00:02:10.470> or
