California<00:00:17.680> color<00:00:17.860> mm-hmm<00:00:18.400> which<00:00:18.940> means<00:00:19.240> this

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
California color mm-hmm which means this

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.960 
California color mm-hmm which means this
is<00:00:19.539> a<00:00:19.690> real<00:00:20.199> good<00:00:20.560> sign<00:00:20.800> that<00:00:20.859> it's<00:00:21.250> probably<00:00:21.760> a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
is a real good sign that it's probably a

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.060 
is a real good sign that it's probably a
particular<00:00:22.570> grape<00:00:22.779> varietal<00:00:23.260> there<00:00:23.890> are<00:00:23.980> only

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
particular grape varietal there are only

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.189 
particular grape varietal there are only
so<00:00:24.310> many<00:00:24.369> bridles<00:00:25.000> that<00:00:25.240> are<00:00:25.359> light<00:00:25.570> like<00:00:26.019> this

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
so many bridles that are light like this

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.790 
so many bridles that are light like this
in<00:00:26.320> color<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:28.050> also<00:00:29.050> have<00:00:29.260> that<00:00:29.289> sort<00:00:29.529> of

with blind tasting is that you know it's
the<00:00:52.930> way<00:00:53.050> to<00:00:53.079> a<00:00:53.500> truth<00:00:54.160> it's<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:55.120> great<00:00:55.360> way<00:00:55.539> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the way to a truth it's a great way to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.639 
the way to a truth it's a great way to
objectively<00:00:56.890> analyze<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.879> structure<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:59.050> 10

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
objectively analyze the structure the 10

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.209 
objectively analyze the structure the 10
and<00:00:59.860> the<00:00:59.980> acid<00:01:00.430> body<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:01.600> alcohol<00:01:01.930> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and the acid body and the alcohol and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.279 
and the acid body and the alcohol and
some<00:01:03.219> nosey<00:01:03.520> taste<00:01:03.850> descriptors<00:01:04.360> but<00:01:04.629> takes<00:01:05.229> a

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
some nosey taste descriptors but takes a

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:06.899 
some nosey taste descriptors but takes a
lot<00:01:05.470> more<00:01:05.649> time<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:05.979> really<00:01:06.130> find<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.520> soul<00:01:06.729> of

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
lot more time to really find the soul of

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.000 
lot more time to really find the soul of
a<00:01:07.000> wine<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.330> can't<00:01:07.510> do<00:01:07.659> that<00:01:07.810> in<00:01:07.960> just<00:01:08.110> 30

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
a wine you can't do that in just 30

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.179 
a wine you can't do that in just 30
seconds<00:01:09.490> very<00:01:09.880> profound<00:01:10.479> and<00:01:10.840> poetic<00:01:11.320> bill

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
seconds very profound and poetic bill

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.120 
seconds very profound and poetic bill
yeah<00:01:12.670> I<00:01:12.700> was<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:13.030> was<00:01:13.240> about<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.540> cry<00:01:13.689> but

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
concentrating on this so I'm starting to

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.030 
concentrating on this so I'm starting to
get<00:01:16.689> a<00:01:16.750> little<00:01:16.869> bit<00:01:17.049> more<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.560> aromatics

bit more a little more rose you know
truffle<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.770> dusty<00:01:23.770> tannin

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
truffle the dusty tannin

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.940 
truffle the dusty tannin
nice<00:01:25.119> you've<00:01:25.390> already<00:01:25.540> made<00:01:25.810> your<00:01:25.960> choice<00:01:26.020> I'm

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
nice you've already made your choice I'm

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.310 
nice you've already made your choice I'm
saying<00:01:27.310> maybe<00:01:27.520> Italy<00:01:27.970> yeah<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.630> wine<00:01:28.990> has<00:01:29.170> two

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
saying maybe Italy yeah the wine has two

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.050 
saying maybe Italy yeah the wine has two
options<00:01:29.470> for<00:01:29.860> me<00:01:29.979> it's<00:01:30.130> it's<00:01:30.250> Sangiovese<00:01:30.790> or

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
options for me it's it's Sangiovese or

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.179 
options for me it's it's Sangiovese or
nebula<00:01:31.450> I<00:01:31.750> think<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.590> comes<00:01:32.740> down<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.100> the

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
nebula I think it comes down to the

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.520 
nebula I think it comes down to the
tannic<00:01:33.490> structure<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:34.210> acid<00:01:34.840> on<00:01:35.049> this<00:01:35.229> is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
tannic structure the acid on this is

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.219 
tannic structure the acid on this is
pretty<00:01:35.890> hot<00:01:36.130> it's<00:01:36.340> pretty<00:01:36.990> intense

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
pretty hot it's pretty intense

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.140 
pretty hot it's pretty intense
it<00:01:38.290> has<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.829> that<00:01:39.189> almost<00:01:39.400> like<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.729> Pinot

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
it has that that almost like a Pinot

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.020 
it has that that almost like a Pinot
type<00:01:40.860> amplitude<00:01:41.860> in<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.100> mouth<00:01:42.280> as<00:01:42.670> opposed

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
type amplitude in the mouth as opposed

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.380 
type amplitude in the mouth as opposed
to<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.390> more<00:01:43.900> linear<00:01:44.909> Sangiovese<00:01:45.909> oh<00:01:46.210> it's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
to that more linear Sangiovese oh it's

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.539 
to that more linear Sangiovese oh it's
leaving<00:01:46.630> more<00:01:46.960> sort<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.350> nebula<00:01:47.979> yeah<00:01:48.220> I<00:01:48.250> hate

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
leaving more sort of nebula yeah I hate

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.039 
leaving more sort of nebula yeah I hate
to<00:01:48.579> agree<00:01:48.759> with<00:01:48.970> you<00:01:49.090> that's<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.360> problem<00:01:49.390> yeah

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
to agree with you that's a problem yeah

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.080
