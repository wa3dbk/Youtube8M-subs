00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.339
 well I present a circuit that 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.219
 normally it is used a lot in the 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.559
 real life the houses the houses where 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.660
 we all live that is the point of light 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.690
 computed 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.770
 does not turn on and one point of the 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:23.470
 lamp from two different places 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.370
 typical of the houses as he comments to the 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.980
 beginning in the bedrooms corridors 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.590
 great salons good with what we do 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.650
 with this practice is to bring this 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.950
 installation that the students and all 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.200
 we are very used to using 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.230
 unconsciously so that they see the 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.140
 simplicity that this circuit itself has 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.340
 well accompanied also by a take 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.579
 simple current so for the 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.010
 student also do internships with 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.410
 experiments for example measure of 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.710
 tension another particularity of this 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.350
 circuit is that it's going to work with 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.850
 domestic current the current 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.710
 usual 220 volts 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.360
 therefore when you go to try the 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.909
 exercise then you have to have a little 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.490
 of care with the student because no 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.530
 we are talking about the practice that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.360
 usually done with a bulb with a 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.940
 small battery of 9 volts villita 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.420
 with that proviso 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 a simple practice that can be done 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.980
 on a board and for example 50 x 50 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.860
 of agglomerate centimeter centimeter and 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.420
 Average thickness 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.340
 good a flexible cable that normally 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.790
 the electrical installation is used two 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.610
 computers surface one lamp 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.400
 of 40 watt filament for example a 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.150
 lampholder surface one socket 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.159
 also external current and a small box 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.890
 of connection 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.749
 so that the students here inside it 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.960
 do for the connections 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:05.670
 corresponding as in real life in 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.530
 the connection boxes of the registry 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.869
 calls too so normally 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.310
 we find all the houses and for 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.569
 latest 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.219
 It is accompanied by one of a 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.230
 some elements of a gravel for 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:24.480
 hold the wiring and also a 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.819
 connection strip that allows us to 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.469
 we a lengthener carry the 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.250
 current to an electrical outlet 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.829
 close good then the plug as 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.840
 we said before good this is simple 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.730
 since it is typical of the entrance of 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.709
 a hallway we light the light coming out of the 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.079
 hallway we turn off what there is a point of 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.749
 light like everything with two good computers 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.829
 as we have also commented on the take 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.709
 of current and student can 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.540
 take advantage then to do practices with 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.150
 the poly meter a normal polymeter 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.220
 digital we put alternating current 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.500
 as the values ​​we know that the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.120
 House values are 220 volts 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.830
 the value of d 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.310
 200 falls short then 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.750
 we choose the value of 750 volts 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.560
 or good because we take 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.040
 the corresponding measure 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.040
 how to see 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.890
 you already know that it is usually difficult for 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.210
 There are 220 volts accurate in the network 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.830
 there is what serves in what is called 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.670
 a fall in tensions with the values 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.350
 of the voltage are approximately 220 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.120
 volts but it's very difficult to be 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:50.420
 exact exact 220 to see 219 218 225 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.950
 226 in affordable values ​​so that 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.810
 different household appliances 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.010
 different lamps and elements 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.550
 electric, as it does not suffer any 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.550
 deterioration 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.160
 we are talking about values totally 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.710
 assumable by the good installation 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.070
 nothing simple practices to do it 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.460
 for example in age groups or students 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.370
 in a second of that 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.440
 advantaged or why not also in a 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.210
 third of that 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.210
 a greeting and even another
