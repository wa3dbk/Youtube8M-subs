00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.660 
then we're going to slide 3 2 2 3 2 2
and<00:02:09.490> then<00:02:10.090> 2<00:02:10.360> 5<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:14.350> really<00:02:14.800> he's<00:02:14.950> not<00:02:14.980> sliding

same<00:04:44.220> Cloyd<00:04:44.550> sequence<00:04:45.060> we're<00:04:45.270> going<00:04:45.540> from<00:04:46.080> the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
same Cloyd sequence we're going from the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.890 
same Cloyd sequence we're going from the
12<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.430> 7th<00:04:47.940> -<00:04:48.270> 5<00:04:48.300> 7<00:04:48.900> 10<00:04:49.440> 12<00:04:49.740> ok<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.900> with

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
12 to the 7th - 5 7 10 12 ok and with

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.630 
12 to the 7th - 5 7 10 12 ok and with
most<00:04:52.110> slide<00:04:52.410> guitar<00:04:52.830> you<00:04:53.010> can<00:04:53.040> play<00:04:53.340> three

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
most slide guitar you can play three

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.090 
most slide guitar you can play three
notes<00:04:53.880> up<00:04:54.120> or<00:04:54.360> down<00:04:54.540> from<00:04:54.840> your<00:04:54.990> main<00:04:55.200> chord<00:04:55.620> so

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
notes up or down from your main chord so

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.580 
notes up or down from your main chord so
in<00:04:56.460> this<00:04:56.880> case<00:04:57.150> he's<00:04:57.360> going<00:04:57.510> back<00:04:57.840> one<00:04:58.170> note

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
in this case he's going back one note

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.950 
in this case he's going back one note
alright<00:04:59.430> so<00:04:59.910> we're<00:05:00.090> going<00:05:00.180> to<00:05:00.270> take<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.690> first

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
alright so we're going to take the first

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.870 
alright so we're going to take the first
string<00:05:01.290> slide<00:05:02.010> back<00:05:02.340> from<00:05:02.760> 12<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.510> 11<00:05:04.880> then

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
string slide back from 12 to 11 then

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.550 
string slide back from 12 to 11 then
we're<00:05:06.060> going<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.240> hit<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.600> second<00:05:07.080> string<00:05:07.380> at

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
we're going to hit the second string at

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.850 
we're going to hit the second string at
11<00:05:08.370> start<00:05:08.790> sliding<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.540> up<00:05:09.720> but<00:05:10.380> when<00:05:10.530> we<00:05:10.650> get

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
11 start sliding it up but when we get

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.950 
11 start sliding it up but when we get
to<00:05:11.010> 12<00:05:11.370> we're<00:05:11.850> going<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.030> hit<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.660> first

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
to 12 we're going to hit the first

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.110 
to 12 we're going to hit the first
string<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.590> while<00:05:14.130> we<00:05:14.250> hit<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.520> first<00:05:14.700> string

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
string and while we hit the first string

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.270 
string and while we hit the first string
we<00:05:15.360> want<00:05:15.540> that<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.930> mute<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.350> second<00:05:16.890> so<00:05:17.160> it

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
we want that to mute the second so it

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.189 
we want that to mute the second so it
should<00:05:17.550> sound<00:05:17.850> like<00:05:17.970> this

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.649 

it's<00:05:23.949> it's<00:05:24.249> almost<00:05:24.729> like<00:05:24.969> you're<00:05:25.240> stopping

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
it's it's almost like you're stopping

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:31.499 
it's it's almost like you're stopping
there<00:05:27.360> that's<00:05:28.360> second<00:05:28.930> string<00:05:30.210> then<00:05:31.210> we<00:05:31.300> just

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
there that's second string then we just

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.839 
there that's second string then we just
do<00:05:31.629> that<00:05:31.749> at<00:05:31.930> seven<00:05:33.599> five<00:05:35.580> then<00:05:36.580> we<00:05:36.610> go<00:05:36.819> to

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
do that at seven five then we go to

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:56.550 
do that at seven five then we go to
seven<00:05:37.389> ah<00:05:39.599> then<00:05:40.599> repeat<00:05:55.110> that's<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.319> first

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
seven ah then repeat that's the first

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.860 
seven ah then repeat that's the first
part<00:05:56.830> he<00:05:56.919> does<00:05:57.099> four<00:05:57.550> of<00:05:57.759> those<00:05:57.879> so<00:05:58.569> for<00:05:58.719> this

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
part he does four of those so for this

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.050 
part he does four of those so for this
next<00:05:59.110> part<00:05:59.199> of<00:05:59.469> zoomed<00:05:59.740> in<00:05:59.919> a<00:06:00.039> little<00:06:00.279> bit<00:06:00.460> um

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
next part of zoomed in a little bit um

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.360 
next part of zoomed in a little bit um
this<00:06:01.509> is<00:06:01.689> what<00:06:02.020> I<00:06:02.050> consider<00:06:02.169> the<00:06:02.650> second<00:06:03.039> four

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
this is what I consider the second four

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:13.529 
this is what I consider the second four
of<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.789> solo<00:06:04.089> it<00:06:04.569> should<00:06:04.839> sound<00:06:05.080> like<00:06:05.229> this<00:06:12.539> so

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
of the solo it should sound like this so

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.029 
of the solo it should sound like this so
what<00:06:13.659> he's<00:06:13.839> doing<00:06:13.990> he's<00:06:14.229> starting<00:06:14.620> out<00:06:14.710> first

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
what he's doing he's starting out first

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.980 
what he's doing he's starting out first
string<00:06:15.370> sliding<00:06:15.879> twelve<00:06:16.180> to<00:06:16.389> eleven<00:06:16.419> just

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
string sliding twelve to eleven just

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.959 
string sliding twelve to eleven just
like<00:06:17.199> we<00:06:17.349> did<00:06:17.589> and<00:06:17.860> then<00:06:18.069> hitting<00:06:18.430> the<00:06:18.520> second

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 
like we did and then hitting the second

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:22.170 
like we did and then hitting the second
string<00:06:19.240> eleven<00:06:20.339> once<00:06:21.339> we<00:06:21.550> get<00:06:21.699> to<00:06:21.879> twelve

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
string eleven once we get to twelve

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.239 
string eleven once we get to twelve
we're<00:06:22.389> going<00:06:22.509> to<00:06:22.569> hit<00:06:22.719> that<00:06:22.749> first<00:06:23.650> string<00:06:24.009> and

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:24.249 
we're going to hit that first string and

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:34.679 
we're going to hit that first string and
slide<00:06:24.400> it<00:06:24.669> up<00:06:24.819> to<00:06:24.969> seventeen<00:06:33.029> so<00:06:34.029> it's<00:06:34.360> kind<00:06:34.629> of

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:34.689 
slide it up to seventeen so it's kind of

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:39.749 
slide it up to seventeen so it's kind of
hard<00:06:34.810> to<00:06:34.930> show<00:06:35.259> but<00:06:38.219> then<00:06:39.219> what<00:06:39.370> we<00:06:39.490> do<00:06:39.639> is

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 
hard to show but then what we do is

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:42.749 
hard to show but then what we do is
we're<00:06:39.879> going<00:06:39.969> to<00:06:40.029> slide<00:06:40.710> 12<00:06:41.710> to<00:06:42.099> eleven<00:06:42.490> again

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:42.759 
we're going to slide 12 to eleven again

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.269 
we're going to slide 12 to eleven again
and<00:06:43.029> then<00:06:43.300> take<00:06:43.539> that<00:06:43.719> second<00:06:44.259> string<00:06:44.620> slide

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:45.279 
and then take that second string slide

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:54.869 
and then take that second string slide
up<00:06:45.550> to<00:06:45.789> twelve<00:06:46.180> and<00:06:46.539> then<00:06:46.990> back<00:06:47.259> to<00:06:49.740> ten<00:06:53.339> so<00:06:54.339> all

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:54.879 
up to twelve and then back to ten so all

00:06:54.879 --> 00:07:01.379 
up to twelve and then back to ten so all
together<00:06:55.120> the<00:06:55.449> first<00:06:55.659> two<00:06:55.899> parts<00:07:00.389> alright

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
together the first two parts alright

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:03.269 
together the first two parts alright
we're<00:07:01.599> going<00:07:01.689> to<00:07:01.749> do<00:07:01.899> the<00:07:02.020> first<00:07:02.289> half<00:07:02.589> of<00:07:03.159> the

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:03.279 
we're going to do the first half of the

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:05.619 
we're going to do the first half of the
first<00:07:03.460> part<00:07:03.819> again

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:05.629 
first part again

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:10.490 
first part again
then<00:07:06.629> we<00:07:06.750> can<00:07:06.960> slide<00:07:07.879> 15-second<00:07:08.879> 15<00:07:09.660> first<00:07:10.110> and

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
then we can slide 15-second 15 first and

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.920 
then we can slide 15-second 15 first and
then<00:07:10.710> 17<00:07:13.250> another<00:07:14.250> way<00:07:14.490> is<00:07:14.729> first<00:07:15.030> string<00:07:15.449> 12

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
then 17 another way is first string 12

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:22.339 
then 17 another way is first string 12
15<00:07:16.800> 17<00:07:19.610> but<00:07:20.610> I<00:07:20.789> think<00:07:21.150> he's<00:07:21.300> using<00:07:21.509> 17<00:07:22.139> in<00:07:22.319> a

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:22.349 
15 17 but I think he's using 17 in a

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:28.700 
15 17 but I think he's using 17 in a
second<00:07:24.259> so<00:07:25.259> you<00:07:25.409> want<00:07:25.560> to<00:07:25.650> slide<00:07:25.889> in<00:07:27.530> 1615<00:07:28.560> I'm

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.710 
second so you want to slide in 1615 I'm

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:37.790 
second so you want to slide in 1615 I'm
sorry<00:07:28.949> 14<00:07:29.370> to<00:07:29.460> 15<00:07:31.220> and<00:07:32.220> then<00:07:32.639> 15<00:07:33.120> to<00:07:33.240> 17<00:07:36.710> so<00:07:37.710> he

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 
sorry 14 to 15 and then 15 to 17 so he

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:48.559 
sorry 14 to 15 and then 15 to 17 so he
does<00:07:37.979> those<00:07:38.250> four<00:07:38.669> times<00:07:46.789> all<00:07:47.789> right<00:07:48.060> so<00:07:48.360> that

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:48.569 
does those four times all right so that

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:49.850 
does those four times all right so that
should<00:07:48.870> help<00:07:48.900> you<00:07:49.199> get<00:07:49.349> through<00:07:49.590> it
