00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:14.969
 [Music] 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.600
 good morning welcome thank you for 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.100
 visit us at the bite office 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.369
 name is hernán chapitel I am the 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.890
 in charge of the brand in the country and good 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.450
 recently inaugurated office service 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.250
 so good technician I'm going to start 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.650
 show a little bit a tour as 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.650
 we are going to see the office of the rm 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.630
 welcome to this area office 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.710
 and here we have the heart of the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.200
 technical service the heart of reason 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.050
 of being are offices in this case 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.449
 we have the first sector do this is the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.329
 testing sector there you can see is the 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.650
 pre and post testing sector ie 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.690
 when it comes to the woods first 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.510
 it is you here is some error 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.760
 software or something easy to solve here 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.290
 is solved and also in the part of 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.330
 post when we already did a repair 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.800
 deeper the Polish mother returns to 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.010
 this sector to do the final testing and 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.750
 deliver to the customer 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.080
 in this part we can see anything 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 the connections with the headquarters in 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.280
 taiwan that is to say we have a novel network 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.900
 here the network no vélez here internal lópez 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.060
 for testing and there we have an intranet 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.800
 on that computer on which we are 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.720
 connected 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.030
 in which we are connected with taipei 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.770
 for what is any missing from 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.020
 component is when repairing the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.940
 component automatically the technicians 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.740
 they load into the system on the intranet and it goes 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.720
 generating an order then once 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.160
 every 15 days or so an order comes out 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.430
 from taiwan to replace the 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.350
 Missing components 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.640
 well this is the part that is in macas 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.650
 in the storage part where 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.650
 are the mothers for to repair 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.120
 here we have what is storage of 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.070
 very very small components I'm going to 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.440
 show some 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.150
 [Music] 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.950
 is the storage part of the 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.890
 smaller components of everything 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.490
 this 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.500
 He knows everything that chips are that 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.510
 its size 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.640
 the need to store and differentiate 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.740
 each one for the resistance by the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.390
 amperage they have so good this 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.040
 is a very sensitive part there is no 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.050
 wrong because at first glance they are 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.000
 all very similar let's see now the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.760
 which is part d 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.280
 and so the sea board surpassed this for this 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.020
 this sector that is the testing part is 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.580
 say the word made decisively does not 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.320
 can solve with glass or with 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.180
 a software goring we went to the 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.740
 part of component change that is 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.650
 a whole room that is with a 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.370
 specific temperature then what 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.370
 we have separate 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.440
 good 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.760
 is that what we have here 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.540
 storage and repairs ok let's 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.780
 pay 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.780
 [Applause] 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.480
 all right 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.390
 this would be the secret of why no 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.860
 So far no repairer or service 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.990
 mother technician can repair anything by 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.700
 100% is for this machine that is here 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.040
 that we say in the changers 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.590
 of chipset this machine what it does is 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.170
 changes warms the mother to a 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.880
 exact temperature according to the model 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.680
 we have to load on the screen in the 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.940
 system we have to load here that 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.940
 model of mother by let's go to 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.120
 in mother's model we will separate it ok 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.620
 then you load what model more water 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.930
 it's the mother board it gets but I show 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.159
 [Applause] 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.590
 the chip is put inside this changer 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.090
 it warms up and has all the 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.459
 components the technician at your disposal 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.659
 to change without doing anything manual this 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.040
 it does everything automatic 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.450
 for example the most critical component of 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.909
 change that which is below the heatsink 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.930
 that I here loosen it, which is the 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.609
 chipset of the major 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.739
 this is the component where no 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.180
 technical service can you here at 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.620
 Argentina change when they reach this 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.260
 part already directly the mother board what 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.519
 strip in this case is not necessary because 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.670
 we already have the changer the chipset 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.010
 correct then 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.750
 this simply 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.370
 it ensures that the malware is 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.530
 Warms to the temperature according to 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.829
 model does not produce one burns nothing not 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.720
 no track is burned and this one remains as 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.729
 factory, that is, there are no traces of 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.229
 that was arranged in a manual way like 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.630
 right good once this happens 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.160
 sector that is the one that warms and loosens 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.139
 all the components change the 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.300
 component that we want to pass on to 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.550
 next sector that is the one of soldier this 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.070
 what is wave welding we are going to 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.220
 see if it can be seen on camera you see that 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.330
 tremble that's strange at 2500 degrees 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.460
 okay 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.599
 it is not a common stranger is not a stranger 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.400
 that can be bought at any 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.509
 neighborhood hardware store is a stranger that 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.240
 has a concentration of lead 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:52.270
 special for this type of components 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.180
 then the greatest 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.540
 weld by wave solder weld all 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.280
 what are the components from below 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.160
 [Music] 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.230
 after it passes this sector 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.490
 once you release here what happens is the 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.600
 drying sector once you've 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.600
 soldier we put here 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.569
 with a dryer 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:18.960
 We directly dry the components 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.639
 and it's all the mother has repaired ok 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.900
 that only these tubes that many me 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.000
 they ask good these tubes are this 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.979
 smoke extractors that extractors of 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.449
 what they do recycles them in the air if 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.600
 We are in a closed sector and the good 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.699
 technicians this air that expel tin 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.680
 it's toxic so good with this 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.590
 smoke extract where they work are 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.449
 constantly sucking smoke like that 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.830
 how good we do not have any problem in 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.449
 what are you quality control like 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.919
 the health of the engineers who work 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:51.020
 here or after we have here these 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.509
 are the others the secrets of why 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.280
 this one can be repaired 100% the wood is 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.970
 because we have the components to the 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.979
 ideal temperature and humidity for each 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.900
 component in this case we're going to 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:06.630
 show them here we have saved 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.800
 in this case we have these are chipset 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.800
 of intel because 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.489
 as you can see because they are in these 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.529
 sachets that would seem the best a 

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:17.029
 little uncomfortable that they see here this 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:19.669
 dotted this because it's a machine that 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:21.499
 is a tape then in the factory this 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.389
 makes a machine that I know to a 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:25.489
 much faster speed then that 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.050
 tape takes the processors and goes 

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:29.239
 placing of course for Argentina what 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.979
 what they do is they cut us some 

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:32.629
 components like to send us but 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.680
 this is really giant rolls of 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.509
 nausea components 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.590
 then here the component put the 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.410
 hand here they will see that there is a 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:43.699
 temperature that in this case 28 degrees 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.699
 with 20 percent humidity 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.569
 and also in this same room we keep 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.909
 some components that do not need 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:53.860
 they are both components that what 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:55.180
 we call critics and they can be at 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.550
 air at room temperature that is not 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.289
 problem as for example are the 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.569
 memory sockets you already have some 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:04.169
 memory sockets 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:04.169
 we have 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.530
 to place microprocessors in this 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.890
 case is a socket for the processor to 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.890
 m3 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.010
 what are you going we have 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.729
 everything can be changed as you will see here 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.740
 we have usb connectors from fijense 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:25.199
 that is usb connectors all everything everything is 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.050
 they will change well we want to thank the 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:30.000
 giuseppe community for visiting us 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.560
 be welcome and let's keep 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.690
 aware of breakfast workouts 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.030
 of work that we do so good 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.460
 three years guarantee was in Argentina to 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.980
 from now on do not doubt it we are with 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:52.110
 your 

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:52.110
