couldn't<00:04:15.170> sleep<00:04:15.590> bad<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.910> this<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.509> this

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
couldn't sleep bad to this and this

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.930 
couldn't sleep bad to this and this
would<00:04:18.019> be<00:04:18.199> you<00:04:19.039> know<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.280> beat

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:33.140 

-<00:04:24.960> conscience<00:04:25.960> no<00:04:26.349> way<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.159> well

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:41.350 

difference<00:04:36.000> inside

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.330 

so<00:04:42.360> that<00:04:42.510> goes<00:04:42.690> twice<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.680> then<00:04:43.950> we've<00:04:44.130> got

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
so that goes twice and then we've got

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.580 
so that goes twice and then we've got
the<00:04:44.550> chorus<00:04:45.540> coming<00:04:45.930> in<00:04:46.050> so<00:04:48.380> should<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.410> move

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
the chorus coming in so should I move

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.700 
the chorus coming in so should I move
