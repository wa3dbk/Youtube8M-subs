illumination the gothic hand is another

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.360 
illumination the gothic hand is another
one<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.320> those<00:00:46.500> hands<00:00:46.860> sometimes<00:00:47.039> it's

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
one of those hands sometimes it's

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.529 
one of those hands sometimes it's
referred<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.270> black<00:00:48.750> letter<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:51.149> type

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
referred to as as black letter and type

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.270 
referred to as as black letter and type
it<00:00:51.719> would<00:00:51.870> be<00:00:51.989> referred<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:52.710> black<00:00:52.980> letter

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
it would be referred to as black letter

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.990 
it would be referred to as black letter
and<00:00:54.020> that<00:00:55.020> terminology<00:00:55.860> comes<00:00:56.370> from<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> fact

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and that terminology comes from the fact

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.139 
and that terminology comes from the fact
that<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.329> letters<00:00:57.629> were<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.020> densely<00:00:59.149> created

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
that the letters were so densely created

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.209 
that the letters were so densely created
so<00:01:00.390> densely<00:01:00.809> drawn<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.710> whole<00:01:01.890> look<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
so densely drawn that the whole look of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.860 
so densely drawn that the whole look of
the<00:01:02.309> page<00:01:02.550> actually<00:01:02.879> started<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.690> like

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the page actually started to be like

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:16.789 
the page actually started to be like
black<00:01:04.280> so

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.529 

again<00:01:17.799> what<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.250> have<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:18.729> letter<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.119> is

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
again what you have is a letter that is

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.300 
again what you have is a letter that is
kind<00:01:19.869> of<00:01:19.930> squinched<00:01:20.380> this<00:01:20.530> way<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.009> squinch

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
kind of squinched this way and squinch

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.249 
kind of squinched this way and squinch
this<00:01:21.549> and<00:01:21.789> pull<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.360> way<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:25.869> lots<00:01:26.110> and

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
this and pull that way and with lots and

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.870 
this and pull that way and with lots and
lots<00:01:26.350> of<00:01:26.560> angles<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:27.369> know<00:01:27.490> what<00:01:27.670> it's

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
lots of angles and you know what it's

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.120 
lots of angles and you know what it's
it's<00:01:28.179> a<00:01:28.270> pretty<00:01:28.479> easy<00:01:28.679> letter<00:01:29.679> to<00:01:29.920> draw

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
it's a pretty easy letter to draw

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.889 
it's a pretty easy letter to draw
compared<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.850> Roman<00:01:31.179> for<00:01:31.329> example<00:01:31.750> and

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
compared to the Roman for example and

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.899 
compared to the Roman for example and
yes<00:01:32.079> we<00:01:32.289> are<00:01:32.409> now<00:01:32.590> at<00:01:33.250> a<00:01:33.310> point<00:01:33.460> in<00:01:33.729> history

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
yes we are now at a point in history

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.969 
yes we are now at a point in history
when<00:01:34.240> we<00:01:34.390> have<00:01:34.539> very<00:01:34.810> distinct<00:01:35.470> upper<00:01:35.860> and

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
when we have very distinct upper and

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.660 
when we have very distinct upper and
lower<00:01:36.100> case<00:01:36.399> letters<00:01:36.990> only<00:01:37.990> we<00:01:38.259> call<00:01:38.469> them

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
lower case letters only we call them

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.190 
lower case letters only we call them
majuscule<00:01:39.670> in<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.000> nosc<00:01:40.179> you'll<00:01:40.450> get<00:01:41.079> to

majuscule in the nosc you'll get to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.620 
majuscule in the nosc you'll get to
about<00:01:41.409> here<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.549> then<00:01:43.030> you've<00:01:43.149> got<00:01:43.329> to<00:01:43.420> pull

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
about here and then you've got to pull

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.820 
about here and then you've got to pull
over<00:01:44.880> come<00:01:45.880> down<00:01:46.149> and<00:01:47.459> then<00:01:48.459> down<00:01:48.670> this<00:01:48.939> way

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
over come down and then down this way

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.749 
over come down and then down this way
the<00:01:50.830> counter<00:01:51.369> should<00:01:52.149> be<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.689> same<00:01:52.899> width<00:01:53.200> as

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the counter should be the same width as
