 10-0 face this summer of one of his suitcases this summer for the beach because 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.080
 that frankly they are a little nerdy they are not bad ah not terrible 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.260
 but then not at all what we watch 3D movies in relief Sunday is 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.069
 3d and thank you for being there for this 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.469
 of setif so 2009 here in berlin in august all technologies are 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.530
 Presented and strongly the big piece anyway Jerome 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.680
 it's television 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.680
 then telly the screens of all display technologies 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.960
 with 3d television with green technologies have compared their 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.220
 moms today with 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.379
 screens that connect to the internet ecology is also a good 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.379
 obviously well even 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.310
 discover the future technologies of display with franchise tv lcd regza 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.310
 these disappointments dvd recorder hd 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.830
 the 3ds is to stay emotionally it's the participation c 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.190
 advice but completely the image so actually builders like lg 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.300
 we were developing 3d it starts with a reality and in the world 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.740
 today selligent so pauli that TV has recently posted stops 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.070
 that you have to have content to put in 3d too 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.580
 there is also work that is done in partnership with heuliez the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.210
 content providers today be it 'other' dvd channels 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.400
 now is coming but especially 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.859
 had lamented 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:25.420
 blue-ray dvd of course 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.880
 but skye 12 while earth so is actually going off from the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.079
 end of the year of october 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.080
 8 hours 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.240
 2 signals in 3d with broadcasts mainly articulated around 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.810
 canned and films otherwise for the 3d signal will be 8 euros eur capacities 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.840
 ranging from prime listening then broadcast 3d shows and relief 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.410
 on the low TV channels so the English we are lucky that they go the 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.970
 see you soon 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.780
 but in France it's for when 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.310
 in France program broadcasters 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.509
 is actively preparing for these new types of image-consuming content 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.319
 born in account 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.549
 however, we will have this provision from June 2 before the second 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.220
 semester 2010 at the price level% 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.440
 e I think we're still here 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.210
 it's a little too early internet stage of development to really see 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.210
 the impact learned that it can have on a final project 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.359
 the star technologies of these games of this type since access to help from the east 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.189
 which therefore allows energy savings 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.169
 so consistent compared to the old technology lcd but it 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.870
 also allows a better picture quality alain triaud 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.260
 to explain the dawn precisely how one can gain in quality 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.569
 image with this exalead technology 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.709
 very simply instead of illuminating the screen with fluorescent tubes the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.320
 current technology we replace it's a part 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.790
 small clans called state aids and in fact we change the surface 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.570
 which is behind the screen by a thousand little LED lights that 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.380
 allow to illuminate the screen area area by area so it's more 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.150
 accurate and we get to better control the colors and contrast so we have 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.380
 homework that are blacker the clear phases that are clearer so 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.509
 the picture is no longer 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:00.049
 the natural the diode is much more powerful and therefore happens to produce 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.039
 whites have a lot more white 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.619
 in the opposite direction it's a lot faster we have homework 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.619
 much further so we actually have a picture contrast 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:09.749
 existing and which gives 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:10.989
 1 relief 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.949
 never won 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.379
 so today when we go to a department store that we want to afford 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.740
 a flat screen TV what are our main motivations to buy 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.859
 first criterion design 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.819
 to the afpa of surprises the second criterion 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:24.899
 the environment 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:28.799
 any notion of recycling consumption the third criterion the 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:29.959
 image quality 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.529
 the fourth criterion the mark 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:35.529
 m and the fifth criterion the sound 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.739
 the company is not a marker of the bossat barbecues congo for the 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.629
 to enlist is much more serious than that it is a remote control for 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.629
 discuss advanced remote control on large and medium 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:04:00.569
 here it is here it is in the defense of the Roma with the remote control 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.730
 the little trick on recovery and there you have access to a lawyer known for his 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.950
 love in the manner of the wiimote from nintendo to the console wii 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:26.029
 it's actually a lot more time since according to him the second 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.039
 television about the role of an internet platform of this daily the 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.629
 kick off content 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:34.899
 for that also the role to meet directly hit is the content that 

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.789
 wants pc and TV years 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.809
 so today it's really percent a global interaction between the 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.949
 TV and any office installation at home 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.190
 what is it because a small video control 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.670
 who will allow me to dispatch all my may 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.590
 but the favorite movies if I'm here I have several televisions the 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.980
 house that's it so today it only works for percent in 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.759
 may the goal on next year actually 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.250
 it is able to broadcast two different signals between a second TV so 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.490
 7 inch thumbs and the main TV thanks to the double tuner donate 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.180
 itself a signal directly TV on a tone more pc than we can what we 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.270
 will be able in europe and the water to access directly is once again 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.029
 pictures of the videos that will be on the hard drive what I was looking at a 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.020
 movie for example on the screen the aquila time for him 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.789
 today we are disappointed its wifi version so we are on the capabilities of 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.740
 25 meters cars after the Finistere either I will not be in a hurry or managed at 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.749
 term what today we can not do it 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:30.749
 by the double tuner of the TV 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.680
 television today also connect to the internet that wants to 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.270
 to say that you will be able to surf from your couch 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.310
 on your telly thanks to vote 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.320
 benoît lelièvre seiler this is a reality it's a shame it's the 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.759
 reality and especially our products 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:45.680
 the kid 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.110
 today with a simple remote control you have access to a 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.240
 what site 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.910
 on the web but it's not easy to get back on the internet with a 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.850
 remote control 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.530
 we still get rare to take pleasure in going on the web on his 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.279
 TV 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.169
 he is already quite expensive heart 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.400
 we can select the favorite sites and it is possible to access a cd to 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.240
 sole have accessed bullish 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.440
 companies that have been reworked so that they can 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.710
 have access very simple way from the remote control and for them 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.970
 French citizens are ready to rework their 6% for them there 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.110
 works on your screens 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.199
 we already have special agreements with about thirty sites 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.320
 who are most frequently visited 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.460
 so that this can give their nap suitable for everything to 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.919
 achievable manipulation of a TV remote control 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.710
 why did you make me and your glasses 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.870
 but because of that it's the big peculiarity of attracting 3d is 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.640
 that today it is ridiculous on the scene when we see nothing in all 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.869
 case we see any trouble 

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:42.479
 but it's true that if the facts still enough enough 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:43.669
 secession 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.669
