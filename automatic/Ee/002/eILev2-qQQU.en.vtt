Mayweather<00:01:08.620> I'm<00:01:09.620> wondering<00:01:10.340> how<00:01:11.060> far<00:01:11.450> we

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660

might<00:01:11.900> be<00:01:12.080> off<00:01:12.290> this<00:01:12.620> time<00:01:12.920> maybe<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.520> judges

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
might be off this time maybe the judges

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.520 
might be off this time maybe the judges
would<00:01:14.120> go<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.479> other<00:01:14.510> way<00:01:14.979> well<00:01:15.979> I<00:01:16.600> uh<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:18.200> think

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
would go the other way well I uh I think

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.990 
would go the other way well I uh I think
this<00:01:18.770> may<00:01:18.950> have<00:01:18.979> been<00:01:19.190> an<00:01:19.280> easier<00:01:19.580> fight<00:01:19.820> to

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
this may have been an easier fight to

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.730 
this may have been an easier fight to
score<00:01:20.330> than<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.600> last<00:01:20.930> one

the<00:01:39.659> way<00:01:39.899> it's<00:01:40.200> supposed<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.920> be
