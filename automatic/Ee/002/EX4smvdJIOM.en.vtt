the<00:00:13.920> fact<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.340> 2012<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.719> data<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.109> 2012<00:00:16.619> is

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the fact that 2012 the data in 2012 is

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.370 
the fact that 2012 the data in 2012 is
close<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.520> 2014<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.539> completely<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
close to 2014 is completely a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.920 
close to 2014 is completely a
coincidence<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.510> up-and-coming<00:00:21.510> solar

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
coincidence this up-and-coming solar

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.290 
coincidence this up-and-coming solar
cycles<00:00:22.439> roughly<00:00:22.859> 2014<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.150> really

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
cycles roughly 2014 it's not really

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.089 
cycles roughly 2014 it's not really
going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.750> significantly<00:00:25.380> different<00:00:25.439> than

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
going to be significantly different than

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.310 
going to be significantly different than
the<00:00:26.789> next<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> next<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> then

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the next one then the next one and then

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.669 
the next one then the next one and then
the<00:00:28.439> previous<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:30.420> Sun<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.529> call

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the previous one the Sun is what we call

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.799 
the previous one the Sun is what we call
an<00:00:31.769> active<00:00:32.099> star<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.700> hit<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> cycle<00:00:33.719> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
an active star and hit as a cycle of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.069 
an active star and hit as a cycle of
activity<00:00:34.350> over<00:00:34.980> 11<00:00:35.460> years<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:36.000> go<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.750> higher

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
activity over 11 years we go to higher

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.530 
activity over 11 years we go to higher
activity<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.040> back<00:00:38.550> down<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.000> lower<00:00:39.180> activity

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
activity and back down to lower activity

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.350 
activity and back down to lower activity
and<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.170> 11<00:00:40.920> years<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.640> fairly<00:00:42.000> steady

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and so this 11 years is fairly steady

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360 
and so this 11 years is fairly steady
and<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.960> been<00:00:43.140> happening<00:00:43.320> through<00:00:43.890> time<00:00:44.129> as

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and it's been happening through time as

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.270 
and it's been happening through time as
far<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.820> tell<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.620> we<00:00:46.620> always<00:00:46.920> have

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
far as we can tell and we always have

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
far as we can tell and we always have
solar<00:00:47.730> flares<00:00:48.020> sometimes<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.230> big<00:00:49.440> ones

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
solar flares sometimes we have big ones

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.860 
solar flares sometimes we have big ones
sometimes<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.280> small<00:00:50.640> ones<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:51.329> live<00:00:51.570> on

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
sometimes we have small ones we live on

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.110 
sometimes we have small ones we live on
a<00:00:51.899> planet<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:53.160> thick<00:00:53.460> atmosphere

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
a planet with a very thick atmosphere

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.920 
a planet with a very thick atmosphere
and<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.320> atmosphere<00:00:55.949> stops<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and so that atmosphere stops all of the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.470 
and so that atmosphere stops all of the
harmful<00:00:58.440> radiation<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.730> produced<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.420> a

years we see that the effect is not

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.640 
years we see that the effect is not

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
general the effects are minimal if we

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.850 
general the effects are minimal if we
have<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.210> big<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.470> very

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
have a really big one you can have very

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.670 
have a really big one you can have very
strong<00:01:29.159> Aurora<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.290> affect

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
strong Aurora but then you can affect

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
strong Aurora but then you can affect
satellites<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.970> power<00:01:33.540> grids<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.229> these

satellites and power grids and so these

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350
