 good thing is that I really like science and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.490
 I spend my books studying what 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.750
 more I like about science is the 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.220
 universe and has helped many children by 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.740
 that's what he praises me 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.630

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.120
 It's our turn to go to science class 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.980
 to 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.950

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.699
 collar ok wrong to me a kid pulled him out 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.879
 the necklace you believe and more children came 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.630
 They touching base and began to play 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.990
 pass the grace necklace to each other 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.840
 pitt my plan was to make like I was 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.740
 playing with them to be able to recover 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.220
 the necklace to grace and then return it 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.350
 but before I could recover it 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:30.180

 click 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.000
 let's go over the basics of the 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.970
 science how the universe was born to see 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.169
 show and what if you explain them 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.169
 [Music] 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:40.310
 [Music] 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.310
 with the universe always existed 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:50.170
 Wrong Miss Zoey 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:54.370
 is that is that I forget I do not know what I 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.820
 happens that I remember it good instead of 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.820
 sit down 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.940
 to see they say I know if they know the answer 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.110
 I go forward 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.110
 [Music] 

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.278
 [Music] 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:28.750
 according to the theory of evolution and 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:33.310
 big bang 14 billion years ago a 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.120
 atom of nothingness expanded and exploded and 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.430
 the universe was born but when everything was born 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:45.660
 it was well compressed and started to 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.060
 expand to this day 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.690
 this is what the school wants 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.990
 teach you but I think everything is a 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.020
 great lie that everyone believes what 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.560
 want 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.560
 [Music] 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.090

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.630

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.070

 I look at her, she pulls my face 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.590
 anyway because he does not believe in the 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:00.259
 bec payne you do not realize it is 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:06.139
 impossible that nothing exploded and was born 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:09.590
 everything who made nothing makes me god or 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:13.819
