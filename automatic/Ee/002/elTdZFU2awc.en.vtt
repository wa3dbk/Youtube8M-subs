00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.139
 we are so many friends 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.270
 very good to all gentilicios in a 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:15.920
 new minecraft tutorial of how 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:19.310
 make a chest with password or an oven 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.510
 and hey it's pretty simple and it's ready 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.510
 a command blog of these 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.040
 these and a command is easy and simple and 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.470
 the best thing is that we are not very cool 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.760
 since you can use it is pretty cool 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.900
 I searched for it, good, I searched for tricks 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.900
 for the new snapshots 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:49.330
 and I found this trick that I think 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:51.400
 One pass is the best of things 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.160
 added in these last ones in these 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.600
 Last snapshots not in accordance with 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:02.070
 it worked from the 14 w 0 I do not know what I know 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.420
 from that worked and good 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.580
 let's start again the first thing is that in 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.950
 this with a chest of these creates one of 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.939
 these blocks 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.990
 one more thing does not work in in wagons 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.830
 since it detects the block rather 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.100
 it detects this block rather than this 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:26.740
 and well this ruled out the take us 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.740
 nor with ovens 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.250
 neither with ovens 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.920
 but well this is the east 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.430
 and this does not work since this one does not have 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.430
 key 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.530
 and this copper copper and floquet 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.170
 what happens but because the past does not 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.630
 I understand and this is the simple incentive 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.329
 command now who bars blog data 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.329
 this one that gets weird is invited weird 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.850
 look 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.850
 loc 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.420
 loc 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.819
 and the circuit is the reverse I do not know how 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.170
 it is done 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.170
 I had to copy on the internet 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:26.380
 for example the password of this chest of 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.380
 here next is going to be key that is 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.610
 all they have to do is 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.610
 write this command put the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.770
 password and here we will be able to open it 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.290
 although we trigger it and what happens with 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.940
 this the only thing that changes is that what 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.000
 it is key living room 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.010
 the password is key block data and 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.950
 these things so that it detects the block 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:00.810
 that is on top of him like this and good 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.310
 It also works for ovens 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.069
 so I'm very cool not so 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.030
 they're going to put in I do not know if it's going to 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.030
 work for example in 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.260
 for example there are these things in 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.500
 servers I do not think it would be very good 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.720
 because where to get those things 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.930
 and as follows 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.740
 and they can falsify the key and 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:34.690
 also another on youtube and several 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.520
 searched on the internet and it has already happened to me 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.440
 here 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.350
 these things for example have 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.020
 different names key and hello 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.910
 how are you 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.740
 and to open this copper I can not open it 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.950
 and with the reminder that here the password 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.280
 the password was a key, so here 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.710
 is the key can not open because 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.590
 have a space as you can see here 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.240
 It has a space but if we remove it and 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.980
 we say it nothing more with this for example 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.659
 that has no space 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.450
 and now we can open and we have here 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.810
 all the diamonds your last week 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.360
 but complete you know me great and can 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.930
 be with any item for example that 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.930
 let's change a key car 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.180
 can open 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.530
 but for example if you change the room 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.530
 of is instead of key is going to be 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.270
 hi hello how are you 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.840
 we activate the command 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.090
 and this we change it by hello how are you 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.090
 without this thing 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.870
 You will not know me if it's okay 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.060
 because this is the same hello password 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.500
 how are you hello how are you 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.530

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.910
 very short tutorial and this good world 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.100

 stay here and good people this has been 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.600
 how to make a chest with passwords and 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.210
 motorcycles I will leave the command here but 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.400
 here already here remember between the log 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.680
 between the two dots and the thing is 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.600
 I found this 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.320
 for the password it can not be 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.320
 password 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.550

 or whatever 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.280
