00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.000
 did you know that whole foods 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.880
 they are faithful allies of our health 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 at door a first quantity of fibers 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.139
 mineral salts and water-soluble vitamins 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.630
 of group b which means that over 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.480
 to increase the feeling of satiety and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.760
 whole foods improve motility 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.859
 intestinal but it is not all that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.630
 it seems that the usual consumption of these 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.640
 whole foods placed in some way 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.039
 help prevent the risk of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.480
 important diseases such as 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.759
 colorectal cancer 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.920
 so let's take care of the properties of 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.530
 fiber we prepare fresh pasta together 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.260
 integral with our hands for 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.590
 prepare rica 4 portions of pasta 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.760
 fresh wholemeal are required 180 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.890
 grams of whole wheat flour 70 mm 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.420
 of water 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:57.750
 one whole egg 40 grams of semolina 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.940
 re-milled with durum wheat and 20 grams of 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.280
 oat bran 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.830
 let's start with the preparation is a lot 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.119
 simple practically reflects that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.430
 what we saw for the preparation 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.159
 of fresh classic egg pasta 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.700
 but what changes is the choice of the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.210
 ingredients and also the proportions 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.490
 we use whole wheat flour then 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.780
 we enrich in fiber that with scan 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.170
 oat 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.360
 but I also need a little more 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.330
 substantial of gluten we say and the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.220
 gluten is found inside the 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.869
 re-milled durum wheat semolina that does not 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.690
 will also serve to give a little nerves 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.770
 to the final dough we mix the 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.140
 powders in general fresh pasta yes 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.729
 prepare on the mind with the eggs, however, I 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.409
 to reduce the share of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.780
 cholesterol what I thought of doing 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.640
 to dismiss a single man 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:58.560
 here it is and then to knead it all 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:03.210
 with water and we work first with the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.099
 wooden spoon then we are hand 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.770
 working the dough by hand 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.229
 we got the classic consistency 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.000
 of fresh pasta before spreading it 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.560
 but I advise you to leave it 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.230
 rest for half an hour like a sheet of 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.680
 transparent film 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.080
 so that you are not here the surface 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.819
 after half an hour of rest 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.970
 we can then spread it because 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.930
 let it rest because it's easier 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.410
 work it easier to lay it down love it 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:40.519
 let's sport the plan with flour 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:44.150
 integral if possible let's float for 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:53.989
 well pilat and then with a nice rolling pin 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:56.530
 we begin to roll it out we laid out the 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.019
 pasta not too thin and now 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.590
 we can realize all the formats that 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.230
 we want 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.250
 I now propose butterflies to you 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:10.040
 how do we hope the pasta before a 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.640
 strips clearly the dough is not 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.769
 regular 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.769
 content of 3 cm strips 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.130
 we have therefore obtained strips 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.319
 3 cm thick and then we have air here 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.109
 italy that you can then cut to 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.359
 realize for example the maltagliati here 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.480
 now I told you I wanted to achieve 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:40.220
 of the butterflies how do we take one 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:44.030
 strip and try to translate all 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.150
 the strip two centimeters away 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.470
 ok i 'll show you some 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:56.500
 now let's put a thumb in the middle of the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.500
 rectangle with the other hand we tighten 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.730
 and so the butterfly is formed 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.910
 let's proceed in this way with another 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.910
 pasta 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.800
 here guys I set before they have 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.600
 made a lot of butterflies not found 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.820
 that this format is particularly 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.280
 inviting and then you saw it is a lot 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.790
 the preparation of this is also simple 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.160
 recipe 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.510
 now I continue with my work you 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.880
 don't take my next one 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.360
 video recipe on whole wheat pasta with i 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.360
 pepperoni
