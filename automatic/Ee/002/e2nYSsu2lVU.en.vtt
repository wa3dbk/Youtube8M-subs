00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and they would go we started with mirror

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
and they would go we started with mirror
work<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:44.700> look<00:01:44.850> at<00:01:44.970> themselves<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.240 
work and they look at themselves in the
mirror<00:01:45.480> and<00:01:45.720> see<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.110> moves<00:01:46.380> created<00:01:47.100> what

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
mirror and see what moves created what

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.270 
mirror and see what moves created what
reactions<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.440> that<00:01:49.440> that's<00:01:49.830> how<00:01:50.010> it<00:01:50.159> all
