00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 What's up kids today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.800
 a little thing that is around here the crab 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.019
 mysterious 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.759
 and we can see it 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.099
 I just realized that I have a 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.540
 crab would come in some rock or 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.039
 something when you buy it fixed 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.350
 how funny 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.650
 there you have it 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.420
 that you have the crab to focus on 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.660
 front but it 's super scary so 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.660
 what I see 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.190
 and in nothing and it is also camouflaged 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.190
 see how it is 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.530
 the truth is funny 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.300
 I already say some rock would come in some 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.690
 egg or in some coral that I should have 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.690
 to buy 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.989
 out there he's going to get 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.130
 let's see if they turn around 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.130
 and we give it a little better 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.470
 it's a bit société and it could be a 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.470
 blue crab or something pretty 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.600
 I do not know but the truth 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.180
 here there have already been few fire worms 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.930
 that there is a crab I imagine 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.030
 what will he eat? 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.440
 eat the same food practically 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.180
 that the new mandarin and I'm almost 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.960
 certainly bear eat crabs 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.820
 crabs eat to use it fire 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.049
 I do not know I did not test or see him 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:36.570
 eat it but if the crab has grown 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.570
 here inside the aquarium is healthy 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.940
 you can do we're going to pay the fence and 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.770
 that's because he finds food and will be 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.770
 eating live food probably 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.909
 and we have him 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.070
 the radio is that at first glance you do not see it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.470
 is that it camouflages saw very well with the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.610
 rocks without a pretty perfect camouflage 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.170
 plus it is surrounded by seaweed 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.510
 when it's bigger, they appreciate the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.250
 careful because if we see them they are in the 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.070
 quiet background and it's likely that they 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.370
 hit a small we have seen with the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.370
 tweezers 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.310
 that's why I like the sea ​​and not the sea 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.610
 and not every day that you get up is something 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.410
 new is new life 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.590
 and it's very interesting, I think that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.150
 those of aguadulce when I get up not 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.920
 I'm going to see them however the sailors 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.920
 always always always before 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.630
 lie down and always before lifting me 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.280
 I'm going to see the marine aquariums because 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.140
 I tell you that always there is some 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.140
 surprise a neuron that splits a 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.880
 new before 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.530
 is not a new wing so it's that 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.970
 anything already evaporates and the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.790
 crab has gotten behind the rock 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.860
 good because it will keep going up 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.210
 I really do I recommend you 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.970
 have a sailor 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.980
 you do not need anything in particular to see if 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.440
 I'm super careless but I'm the one 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.740
 sea ​​and not realize that not yet 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.870
 change the water I do not do anything I do not know 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.370
 I see it even better than water 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.660
 sweet that yes the auto computer is 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.580
 obligatory to see what looks for there is a 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.020
 little piece of food 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.410
 maybe we'll see how it will be with the 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.410
 crab 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.570
 let's be scared to have an aquarium 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.390
 marine that is not as complicated as 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.130
 It seems 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.470
 the problem is the same as all 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.460
 aquariums once you go on vacation to 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.350
 see what you do with the aquarium 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.820
 well let's do a little review if 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.800
 you also notice a little rock 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.290
 of the anemones before I was in the 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.600
 corner more than anything because the other 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.790
 week is from here I was like very 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.070
 boxed in the glass and I say to see if 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.900
 will not survive with the separation of 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.879
 tube 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.260
 and that's why the truth was welcome 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.620
 that looks great is a pretty color 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.629
 nice it shows that they are still not very 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.580
 very clever you remember that these are 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.670
 some animated bubbles can be thrown away 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.159
 several months so to put they will install 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.160
 for prawns and zaida eat the food of the 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:03.070
 crab 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.470
 others said for several months 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.930
 they look like they're going to 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.490
 die then because the separation is 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.760
 quite traumatic even if it was the 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.250
 natural 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.980
 and well let's see the cactus well 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.030
 you have the beautiful ones that are because 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.030
 they are totally open 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.919
 it will be the sakura team that are 3 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.450
 let's go around here better than I think 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.950
 that you can get to see better though 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.080
 there is algae there is an area where there is 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.090
 algae for example is 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.069
 if we have them to see if they do a little 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.069
 more the eagles are still here 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.949
 be there 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:50.529
 and well, the rasta are the same here 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.179
 that several politicians are already leaving 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:54.929
 let's look for an area where there is no 

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:54.929
 seaweed right there 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:58.079
 there are the dreadlocks 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.770
 and nothing said is very good aquarium 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.330
 and then the colors always marinated is 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.400
 that has some colors and is where is 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.699
 my student finishes like it is not a 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.590
 pretty good light to highlight the 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.090
 colors of the corals 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.220
 but good 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.230
 which is quite good, I hope that 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.280
 you liked the crab that is no longer 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.020
 is out there hid 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.120
 because of this alcohol there is but no longer 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.030
 is 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.470
 and nothing looks good let's see a course 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.520
 in the fire that right here is one is 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.800
 pretty big and 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.550
 so you can see it right there you have the 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.550
 fire worm 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.020
 comfortable and I took little going on tour and 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.090
 few then look around has seen another 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.580
 fire worm that is by 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.039
 out there is the other abuser 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.689
 I did not bother to remove it and the truth is not 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.589
 I see here that they are bothering a lot 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.589
 good guys 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.930
 pressed
