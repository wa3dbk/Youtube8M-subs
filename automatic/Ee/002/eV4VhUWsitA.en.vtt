version right that's just for
demonstrating<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:52.030> device<00:03:52.330> is<00:03:52.570> the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
demonstrating the that the device is the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.590 
demonstrating the that the device is the
both<00:03:52.900> devices<00:03:53.320> are<00:03:53.650> communicating<00:03:54.610> in<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.850> so

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
both devices are communicating in it so

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.330 
both devices are communicating in it so
actually<00:03:55.690> when<00:03:56.290> i<00:03:56.380> click<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:56.710> button<00:03:57.040> it

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
that's that's a crash button but maybe

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.699 
that's that's a crash button but maybe
maybe<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:06.910> program<00:04:07.360> maybe<00:04:07.570> just<00:04:08.050> this

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
maybe this program maybe just this

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.199 
maybe this program maybe just this
program<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.280> do<00:04:09.430> something<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:09.970> it's<00:04:10.150> not

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209
