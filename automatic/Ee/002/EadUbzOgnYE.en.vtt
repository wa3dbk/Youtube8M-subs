00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
container full a day and we'll probably

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.869 
container full a day and we'll probably
have<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.379> buy<00:02:10.619> food<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.039> them<00:02:11.190> next<00:02:11.489> week<00:02:11.670> or

have to buy food for them next week or

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.110 
have to buy food for them next week or

maybe later this week their water is

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.030 
maybe later this week their water is
still<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> challenge<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.260> keep<00:02:16.410> clean<00:02:16.770> they

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
still a challenge to keep clean they

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.640 
still a challenge to keep clean they
make<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> mess<00:02:17.459> in<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:18.840> also<00:02:18.989> tends<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.470> get

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
make a mess in it it also tends to get

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.920 
make a mess in it it also tends to get
hot<00:02:19.890> when<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.160> heat<00:02:20.430> lamp<00:02:20.459> was<00:02:20.940> lower<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.900> you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
hot when a heat lamp was lower so you

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.979 
hot when a heat lamp was lower so you
want<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.349> watch<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:24.450> week<00:02:24.750> they're

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
want to watch that this week they're

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.880 
want to watch that this week they're
back<00:02:25.170> should<00:02:25.470> be<00:02:25.530> around<00:02:26.129> 70

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
back should be around 70

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.490 
back should be around 70
80<00:02:27.460> degrees<00:02:27.940> so<00:02:28.840> we're<00:02:28.960> gonna<00:02:29.050> make<00:02:29.230> sure<00:02:29.470> that

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
80 degrees so we're gonna make sure that

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.400 
80 degrees so we're gonna make sure that
we<00:02:30.370> keep<00:02:30.850> lowering<00:02:31.090> at<00:02:31.420> five<00:02:31.660> degrees<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:32.110> week

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
we keep lowering at five degrees a week

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.890 
we keep lowering at five degrees a week
and<00:02:32.860> week<00:02:33.670> one<00:02:33.880> we<00:02:34.030> started<00:02:34.360> out<00:02:34.450> at<00:02:34.600> ninety

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
and week one we started out at ninety

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.700 
and week one we started out at ninety
five<00:02:35.050> degrees

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
five degrees
