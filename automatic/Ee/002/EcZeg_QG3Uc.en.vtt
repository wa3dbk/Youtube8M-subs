00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello everyone with you slide and this is the fourth 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.030
 release of the transfer work on the bugs in 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.790
 in this fight i play amx 50b 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.889
 I played on the map of the fishing bay for 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.900
 upper rep and I start a fight with the fact that 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.420
 I analyze the opponent's setup how we 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.600
 see the opponents have a platoon of three 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.760
 very good tyazh two hundredths of 4 and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.300
 besides, the enemy is only one 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.849
 art-sau 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.099
 I decide to drive these 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.529
 bushes that you see right now and right away 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.410
 I'm starting to discharge the drum belt 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.630
 fourth and then lucky but after 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.550
 the first shot lightened me therefore 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.110
 I immediately began to roll back 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.940
 that is, pay attention I'm not 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.280
 hits the drum and only then 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.100
 I would drive off then from both and 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.800
 100 and possibly Egypt pt 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.870
 and so I managed to catch on and only 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.570
 only art for 350 units 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.360
 failed to overturn principle for starters 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.960
 very good exchange, I gave 1200 damage 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.300
 got 350 also defused the enemy 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.180
 Arta she for example not svanshot 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.189
 one of my allies here i'm trying 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.619
 drive left again but suddenly 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.479
 flash what was for me in general 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.610
 pretty awesome and understand that 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.670
 so re out is not worth it because 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.229
 what can i get i make a decision 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.320
 you are even a little to the right because here 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.360
 St1 is on but I am starting to drive 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 forced to shoot without vodka in this 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.400
 The moment was not lucky and the projectile flew exactly 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.590
 from the weather you need two shells left I 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.020
 I see that the T-34 is generally wrong and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.240
 you can shoot him two shells 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.689
 go straight into it small 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.150
 set on fire but suddenly I get at 1100 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.540
 units of strength and that seems to be 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.060
 Jagdpanzer E100 struck me of course in 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.130
 the very edge of the tower but that does not negate that 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.130
 that I already have only 600 20 units 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.810
 strength and this is my biggest mistake 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.119
 in this is my 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.700
 here I understand what is in general not 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.159
 only 10 left we are still fighting 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.320
 absolutely did not win and nothing else 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.930
 clear and I have very little hp and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.569
 you need to play very carefully so I 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.130
 I play completely from the bushes with the second 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.770
 lines principle like 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.840
 need to play on and we have achieved from b not 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.450
 climb forward 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.430
 on the left glows and honeycombs I understand that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.490
 most likely I should somehow 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.600
 try to target them because 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.120
 on top of the panzar place to shoot is not 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.490
 it seems possible leave two 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.140
 projectile though perhaps it was worth to go to cade 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.390
 at this moment because the backache is not 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.440
 for a long time yet and only 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.940
 I'm leaving now for recharge for 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.030
 my recharge nothing interesting 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.890
 was happening but by the time of my charge I 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.080
 trying to find a chamber on e100 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.760
 I understand that he stands behind the house but 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.200
 it is likely that the backache is still 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:56.430
 There is and yes here it is here it is this E100 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.840
 something hiding me from him something not 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.730
 lets neither shoot him 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.490
 and yet I manage to find him 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.310
 some backache though and fails 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.590
 punch him again go to recharge and 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.840
 after 25 seconds, I hope that someone 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.290
 I will highlight this e100 and I will issue in 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.810
 him, the second drum e100 again in the light 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.310
 and you need to carefully target it because 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.950
 what i remember there is some kind of bar 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.750
 prevented me from shooting him in a hurry with 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.970
 shots and get u at once on the screen 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.970
 but all the rest punch 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.960
 recharge and calmly finish off weston 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.490
 I am left with 3 shells, I understand that 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.050
 most likely the opponents will be now 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.950
 crush the city and need them somehow 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.840
 support 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.150
 it starts to play very aggressively 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.300
 e100 expander appears to me 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.520
 backache and on the assumption that I am lit 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.980
 I shoot with him almost on the go 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.380
 getting it is not very difficult due to 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.450
 the fact that he has huge sides and start 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.790
 move away from art to 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.850
 reduce the chance of getting in arts 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.220
 don't forget me look at the mini-card in 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.020
 this time on the square one more glow 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.400
 2n 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.110
 waffentrager e100 and waffentrager pz 4 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.730
 so I understand that they are not in the city 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.400
 This means that you can choose one thing. 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.459
 either go to the alley on the first line 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.950
 either go to town i decide to go to 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.370
 the city and yet to push the opponents on 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.370
 this flank 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.830
 on the way, I accidentally met 50 four 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.370
 so how to choose it if it is so 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.880
 mistaken driving into the city and see what 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.840
 there e100 out of 4 st-1 each hop total 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.840
 just one shot of mine 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.630
 I did not go to recharge because 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.650
 saw that they have very little hp and just 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.950
 just coming up 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.220
 and punch first st1 and then zboard 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:01.090
 even it was especially possible not to target from 4 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.980
 here I was lucky art shot from 8 what 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.720
 saved my life of health and 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:10.030
 opportunity to shoot at others 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:13.510
 the enemy on the left is lit up art and I 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.890
 for starters i'm trying to target everything but 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.560
 The first time this can not be done and 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.540
 Only with 2 projectile I finish the fifth horde 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.150
 frag into my piggy bank and i'm off on 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.670
 reloading on opponents alone 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:30.600
 cardboard tanks i ship the drum armor 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.600
 tales, and now I will kill them quietly 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.229
 suddenly flashes from 85 and I'm on 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.590
 full speed 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.970
 I take on avtopotsel and take them typical 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:47.340
 accuracy for m x 50 b 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:51.599
 nothing much left waffentrager pz 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:55.349
 4 right t71 I initially planned 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:58.009
 shoot 171 but the waffentur is much 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.990
 more interesting and ballet 71 finished off and 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.509
 I give the last shell exactly to him 7 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.580
 frags pretty good fight but at the same time 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.919
 mistakes could not be avoided let's 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.750
 consider them together for sure many 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.060
 immediately remembered how and the beginning 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.130
 fight for me shot mouth and felt 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.080
 This is for an error, but I am for an error. 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.940
 I read because the enemy had only 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.580
 only one art and I made a decision 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.009
 play aggressive and take a little risk and 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.199
 in principle, my risk was justified because 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:29.009
 that I have exchanged my money well enough 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:31.020
 pc but my second departure was already very 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.360
 wrong firstly i could get from 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.060
 art and secondly I got on 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.729
 1100 here is the e100 dagger 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.199
 so high it was not necessary to leave after 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.750
 this damage I started playing 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:43.740
 much more accurate and in general errors 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.590
 more in this fight 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.229
 practically did not do it all 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.210
 I hope you liked this video if 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.340
