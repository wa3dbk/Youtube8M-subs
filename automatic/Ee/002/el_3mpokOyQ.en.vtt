00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
you don't need this much you can make a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.659 
you don't need this much you can make a
lot<00:00:30.960> less<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> make<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.070> all<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.279> one

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
lot less but if you make it all in one

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.459 
lot less but if you make it all in one
gigantic<00:00:33.210> group<00:00:33.630> you'll<00:00:33.809> never<00:00:34.020> need<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> make

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
gigantic group you'll never need to make

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.510 
gigantic group you'll never need to make
it<00:00:34.590> again<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.860> that's<00:00:35.100> what's<00:00:35.280> kind<00:00:35.460> of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it again and that's what's kind of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.319 
it again and that's what's kind of
awesome<00:00:35.820> about<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
awesome about it

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.319 
awesome about it
so<00:00:37.399> obviously<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.640> isn't<00:00:39.030> very<00:00:39.149> much

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
so obviously this isn't very much

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.000 
so obviously this isn't very much
nutrition<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> tadpoles<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.800> do

that I forgot to mention before you put
all<00:02:07.400> your<00:02:07.430> lettuce<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:07.940> make<00:02:08.119> sure<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.780> try

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
all your lettuce and make sure you try

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.110 
all your lettuce and make sure you try
to<00:02:09.170> pick<00:02:09.560> out<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.740> really<00:02:10.160> really<00:02:10.789> white

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
to pick out the really really white

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.150 
to pick out the really really white
crunchy<00:02:11.840> stuff<00:02:12.050> because<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.530> tadpoles<00:02:13.040> will

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
crunchy stuff because the tadpoles will

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.490 
crunchy stuff because the tadpoles will
not<00:02:13.580> eat<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.030> or<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:14.840> might<00:02:15.020> sit<00:02:15.260> in<00:02:15.350> there<00:02:15.470> a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
not eat it or it might sit in there a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.810

last<00:04:17.500> quite<00:04:17.739> as<00:04:17.980> long<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.430> much<00:04:18.549> less<00:04:18.910> boiling

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
last quite as long and much less boiling

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.200 
last quite as long and much less boiling
so<00:04:19.750> be<00:04:19.840> careful<00:04:20.200> with<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.820> anyways<00:04:22.090> you

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
so be careful with that so anyways you

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.600 
so be careful with that so anyways you
can<00:04:22.360> make<00:04:22.540> any<00:04:22.780> size<00:04:23.170> you<00:04:23.500> want<00:04:23.530> I<00:04:23.920> have<00:04:24.340> pretty

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
can make any size you want I have pretty

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.610 
can make any size you want I have pretty
big<00:04:24.880> tadpoles<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:26.020> have<00:04:26.200> a<00:04:26.230> lot<00:04:26.590> of

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
big tadpoles and I have a lot of

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.340 
big tadpoles and I have a lot of
capsules<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.400> are<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.670> small<00:04:28.090> ones<00:04:28.420> so<00:04:29.050> I

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
capsules that are the small ones so I

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.190 
capsules that are the small ones so I
make<00:04:29.710> reasonably<00:04:30.370> big<00:04:30.730> sized<00:04:31.060> cubes<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:32.110> know

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
make reasonably big sized cubes you know

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.560 
make reasonably big sized cubes you know
right<00:04:32.440> around<00:04:32.650> that<00:04:33.400> size<00:04:33.700> or<00:04:33.730> so<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.300> doesn't

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
right around that size or so it doesn't

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.660 
right around that size or so it doesn't
need<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:34.750> be<00:04:34.810> perfect<00:04:35.080> but<00:04:35.890> right<00:04:36.220> around<00:04:36.430> that

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
need to be perfect but right around that

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.250 
need to be perfect but right around that
size<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.210> you<00:04:37.300> can<00:04:37.330> just<00:04:37.570> put<00:04:37.720> them<00:04:37.810> kind<00:04:38.230> of

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
size and you can just put them kind of

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.990 
size and you can just put them kind of
in<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.440> corners<00:04:38.770> over<00:04:38.920> here<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.520> if<00:04:39.790> you<00:04:39.880> want

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
in the corners over here and if you want

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.270 
in the corners over here and if you want
to<00:04:40.090> zoom<00:04:40.240> in<00:04:40.600> you<00:04:40.840> on<00:04:41.050> this<00:04:41.170> still<00:04:44.040> do<00:04:45.040> it<00:04:45.190> as

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
to zoom in you on this still do it as

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.220 
to zoom in you on this still do it as
fast<00:04:45.730> or<00:04:45.910> as<00:04:46.000> slow<00:04:46.060> as<00:04:46.419> you<00:04:46.450> want<00:04:46.570> whatever

so<00:05:23.380> we<00:05:23.650> just<00:05:23.860> made<00:05:24.130> 32<00:05:24.790> unless<00:05:25.330> I<00:05:25.540> made<00:05:25.750> some

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
so we just made 32 unless I made some

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.770 
so we just made 32 unless I made some
really<00:05:26.229> bad<00:05:26.350> math<00:05:26.770> mistakes<00:05:27.370> little<00:05:28.150> cubes<00:05:28.810> of

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
really bad math mistakes little cubes of

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.340 
really bad math mistakes little cubes of
less<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:32.110> that<00:05:33.330> we<00:05:34.330> will<00:05:34.510> pop<00:05:34.930> in<00:05:35.139> the<00:05:35.199> freezer

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
less and that we will pop in the freezer

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:43.059 
less and that we will pop in the freezer
really<00:05:35.740> quick

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:45.950 

for<00:05:44.069> about<00:05:44.159> one<00:05:44.520> hour<00:05:44.599> as<00:05:45.599> soon<00:05:45.749> as<00:05:45.869> you're

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
done pop them in a little baggie or

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.369 
done pop them in a little baggie or
something<00:05:47.819> and<00:05:47.939> you<00:05:48.029> got<00:05:48.059> 32<00:05:48.659> days<00:05:48.839> worth<00:05:49.139> of

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:49.379 
something and you got 32 days worth of

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.529 
something and you got 32 days worth of
tab<00:05:49.679> for<00:05:49.949> food<00:05:50.189> or<00:05:50.429> about<00:05:50.669> a<00:05:50.699> month<00:05:50.999> if<00:05:51.360> you

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
tab for food or about a month if you

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.659 
tab for food or about a month if you
have<00:05:51.629> two<00:05:51.809> tanks<00:05:52.050> probably<00:05:52.740> only<00:05:52.889> about<00:05:53.129> 16

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
have two tanks probably only about 16

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.449 
have two tanks probably only about 16
days<00:05:53.939> I<00:05:54.209> feed<00:05:54.959> my<00:05:55.139> tadpoles<00:05:55.679> every<00:05:55.919> single<00:05:56.279> day

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:56.459 
days I feed my tadpoles every single day

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:59.989 
days I feed my tadpoles every single day
and<00:05:56.849> I<00:05:57.860> think<00:05:58.860> you<00:05:59.129> should<00:05:59.369> feed<00:05:59.610> yours<00:05:59.789> every

00:05:59.989 --> 00:05:59.999 
and I think you should feed yours every

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:01.579 
and I think you should feed yours every
single<00:06:00.300> day<00:06:00.419> but<00:06:00.479> if<00:06:00.689> you<00:06:00.779> have<00:06:00.929> too<00:06:01.169> much<00:06:01.349> food

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:01.589 
single day but if you have too much food

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:03.980 
single day but if you have too much food
leftover<00:06:02.219> every<00:06:02.490> single<00:06:02.789> day<00:06:02.939> that<00:06:03.449> is<00:06:03.659> a<00:06:03.689> bad

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
leftover every single day that is a bad

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.299 
leftover every single day that is a bad
thing<00:06:04.139> so<00:06:04.199> make<00:06:04.469> sure<00:06:04.499> your<00:06:04.740> tadpoles<00:06:05.189> are

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:05.309 
thing so make sure your tadpoles are

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:07.040 
thing so make sure your tadpoles are

is<00:06:35.399> fairly<00:06:35.789> dirty<00:06:35.999> that<00:06:36.360> this<00:06:36.659> is<00:06:36.749> usually

00:06:36.859 --> 00:06:36.869 
is fairly dirty that this is usually

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:38.989 
is fairly dirty that this is usually
where<00:06:37.139> I<00:06:37.199> leave<00:06:37.409> leave<00:06:38.099> their<00:06:38.309> food<00:06:38.490> and<00:06:38.729> then

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:38.999 
where I leave leave their food and then

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:40.309 
where I leave leave their food and then
they<00:06:39.149> kind<00:06:39.419> of<00:06:39.449> poop<00:06:39.629> a<00:06:39.719> lot<00:06:39.809> over<00:06:39.990> here<00:06:40.139> I

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 
they kind of poop a lot over here I

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.540 
they kind of poop a lot over here I
really<00:06:40.830> wish<00:06:40.949> there<00:06:40.979> was<00:06:41.159> a<00:06:41.219> better<00:06:41.339> way<00:06:41.519> to

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
really wish there was a better way to

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.339 
really wish there was a better way to
clean<00:06:41.879> up<00:06:41.999> it<00:06:42.119> sadly<00:06:42.330> there<00:06:42.569> isn't<00:06:42.869> if<00:06:43.080> I<00:06:43.169> got<00:06:43.319> a

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:43.349 
clean up it sadly there isn't if I got a

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.489 
clean up it sadly there isn't if I got a
filter<00:06:43.589> it<00:06:44.069> would<00:06:44.610> suck<00:06:45.539> up<00:06:45.749> the<00:06:45.869> chapel's<00:06:46.289> and

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:46.499 
filter it would suck up the chapel's and

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:48.649 
filter it would suck up the chapel's and
probably<00:06:46.949> kill<00:06:47.309> them<00:06:47.490> so<00:06:47.939> I<00:06:47.969> do<00:06:48.180> have<00:06:48.360> another

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:48.659 
probably kill them so I do have another

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.119 
probably kill them so I do have another
little<00:06:49.050> mini<00:06:49.259> filter<00:06:49.589> over<00:06:49.709> there<00:06:49.830> that<00:06:49.949> helps

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:50.129 
little mini filter over there that helps

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:51.290 
little mini filter over there that helps
out<00:06:50.219> a<00:06:50.249> little<00:06:50.369> bit<00:06:50.580> beyond<00:06:50.789> like<00:06:50.909> it's<00:06:51.149> not

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
out a little bit beyond like it's not

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.699 
out a little bit beyond like it's not
perfect<00:06:51.749> also<00:06:52.199> one<00:06:52.319> other<00:06:52.349> thing<00:06:52.589> I'm<00:06:52.680> going

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:52.709 
perfect also one other thing I'm going

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:54.409 
perfect also one other thing I'm going
to<00:06:52.889> point<00:06:53.039> out<00:06:53.249> is<00:06:53.430> the<00:06:53.490> fact<00:06:53.669> that<00:06:53.849> if<00:06:54.119> you

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
to point out is the fact that if you

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.119 
to point out is the fact that if you
don't<00:06:54.659> get<00:06:54.809> rid<00:06:54.959> of<00:06:54.990> those<00:06:55.110> big<00:06:55.379> crunchy<00:06:55.889> white

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:56.129 
don't get rid of those big crunchy white

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:58.219 
don't get rid of those big crunchy white
pieces<00:06:56.369> they<00:06:56.699> will<00:06:56.939> not<00:06:57.149> eat<00:06:57.360> it<00:06:57.509> readily<00:06:58.110> they

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
pieces they will not eat it readily they

00:06:58.229 --> 00:06:59.420 
pieces they will not eat it readily they
will<00:06:58.379> eat<00:06:58.529> it<00:06:58.619> eventually<00:06:58.889> if<00:06:59.279> they're

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
will eat it eventually if they're

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.339 
will eat it eventually if they're
starved<00:06:59.819> or<00:06:59.939> something<00:07:00.240> but<00:07:00.719> they<00:07:00.839> just<00:07:01.050> don't

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:01.349 
starved or something but they just don't

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:04.009
