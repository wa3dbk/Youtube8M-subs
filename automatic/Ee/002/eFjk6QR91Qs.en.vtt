a telltale sign of hair extensions is

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.150 
a telltale sign of hair extensions is
the<00:00:12.490> bad<00:00:12.790> extension<00:00:13.570> haircut<00:00:14.019> this<00:00:14.830> haircut

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
the bad extension haircut this haircut

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.310 
the bad extension haircut this haircut
is<00:00:15.549> a<00:00:15.580> result<00:00:16.030> of<00:00:16.209> a<00:00:16.270> common<00:00:16.660> mistake<00:00:17.080> that

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
is a result of a common mistake that

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.220 
is a result of a common mistake that
mistake<00:00:18.070> happens<00:00:18.610> when<00:00:19.270> the<00:00:19.420> extensions<00:00:19.990> are

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
mistake happens when the extensions are

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.250 
mistake happens when the extensions are
pulled<00:00:20.560> out<00:00:20.830> and<00:00:21.190> then<00:00:21.910> cut<00:00:22.510> as<00:00:22.780> if<00:00:23.080> they<00:00:23.200> were

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
pulled out and then cut as if they were

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.250 
pulled out and then cut as if they were
normally<00:00:23.830> grown<00:00:24.100> hair<00:00:24.460> in<00:00:25.150> order<00:00:25.630> to<00:00:25.780> erase

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
normally grown hair in order to erase

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.050 
normally grown hair in order to erase
this<00:00:26.530> mistake<00:00:26.980> we're<00:00:27.430> going<00:00:27.610> to<00:00:27.700> use<00:00:27.850> some

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
this mistake we're going to use some

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.270 
this mistake we're going to use some
common<00:00:28.270> blending<00:00:28.930> techniques<00:00:29.440> let's<00:00:30.010> take<00:00:30.250> a

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.280 
common blending techniques let's take a

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.639 
common blending techniques let's take a
look<00:00:30.520> at<00:00:30.670> how<00:00:30.760> that's<00:00:30.970> done<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:32.079> first<00:00:32.379> step

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
look at how that's done the first step

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.439 
look at how that's done the first step
in<00:00:32.920> correcting<00:00:33.370> this<00:00:33.489> is<00:00:33.699> to<00:00:34.089> split<00:00:34.359> the

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
in correcting this is to split the

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.540 
in correcting this is to split the
difference<00:00:34.690> between<00:00:35.199> your<00:00:35.739> shortest<00:00:36.250> and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
difference between your shortest and

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.400 
difference between your shortest and
your<00:00:36.760> longest<00:00:37.149> layer<00:00:37.359> so<00:00:38.109> we're<00:00:38.260> going<00:00:38.350> to

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
your longest layer so we're going to

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.410 
your longest layer so we're going to
come<00:00:38.710> in

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
come in

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040 
come in
using<00:00:40.420> our<00:00:40.510> razor<00:00:40.719> tool<00:00:41.019> and<00:00:42.059> take<00:00:43.059> off<00:00:43.329> the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
using our razor tool and take off the

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.009 
using our razor tool and take off the
bulky<00:00:44.530> ends<00:00:48.120> unfortunately<00:00:49.120> there<00:00:49.449> is<00:00:49.570> no<00:00:49.809> way

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
bulky ends unfortunately there is no way

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.399 
bulky ends unfortunately there is no way
to<00:00:50.350> salvage<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:51.100> length<00:00:51.399> on<00:00:51.670> these<00:00:51.850> pieces

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
to salvage the length on these pieces

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.110 
to salvage the length on these pieces
because<00:00:53.409> there's<00:00:53.620> no<00:00:53.829> way<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.280> add<00:00:54.609> in<00:00:54.819> layers

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
because there's no way to add in layers

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.239 
because there's no way to add in layers
from<00:00:55.600> this<00:00:55.749> short<00:00:55.989> point<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.710> this<00:00:56.829> longest

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
from this short point to this longest

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:09.140 
from this short point to this longest
point

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.180 

now<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.930> we've<00:01:10.050> got<00:01:10.230> that<00:01:10.410> bulk<00:01:10.710> removed

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
now that we've got that bulk removed

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.460 
now that we've got that bulk removed
we're<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> switch<00:01:12.510> over<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.290> some

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
we're going to switch over and do some

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.680 
we're going to switch over and do some
point<00:01:13.680> cutting<00:01:16.490> for<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.670> we're<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
point cutting for this we're going to

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.560 
point cutting for this we're going to
have<00:01:18.870> our<00:01:19.340> client<00:01:20.340> put<00:01:20.700> their<00:01:20.850> head<00:01:21.030> all<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
have our client put their head all the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.290 
have our client put their head all the
way<00:01:21.600> forward<00:01:22.070> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.580> expose<00:01:23.970> your

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
way forward this is going to expose your

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:39.260 
way forward this is going to expose your
longest<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.080> shortest<00:01:25.140> points

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.230 

come<00:01:39.899> down<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> ends<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.939> we're<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.179> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
come down to the ends and we're going to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.690 
come down to the ends and we're going to
cut<00:01:42.509> up<00:01:42.719> and<00:01:42.929> soften<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.560> line

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.679 

while<00:01:50.700> we're<00:01:50.850> doing<00:01:50.969> our<00:01:51.149> point<00:01:51.479> cutting

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
while we're doing our point cutting

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
while we're doing our point cutting
we're<00:01:52.229> also<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.799> straighten<00:01:53.369> out<00:01:53.490> any

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
we're also going to straighten out any

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.219 
we're also going to straighten out any
jagged<00:01:54.539> edges<00:01:54.719> from<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.350> haircut<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:58.020> side

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
jagged edges from that haircut this side

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.130 
jagged edges from that haircut this side
had<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.710> bit<00:01:58.890> more<00:01:59.039> length<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> we're

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
had a little bit more length so we're

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.510 
had a little bit more length so we're
just<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> take<00:02:01.649> care<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.340> this

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
just going to take care of that in this

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.279 
just going to take care of that in this
step<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.880> well

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.410 

once<00:02:10.220> you've<00:02:10.369> corrected<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:10.909> bottom<00:02:11.239> line

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
once you've corrected that bottom line

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.970 
once you've corrected that bottom line
with<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.840> hair<00:02:11.989> all<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.110> way<00:02:12.170> forward<00:02:12.470> go

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
with the hair all the way forward go

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.080 
with the hair all the way forward go
ahead<00:02:13.189> and<00:02:13.310> have<00:02:13.400> your<00:02:13.519> client<00:02:13.819> lean<00:02:13.970> your

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
ahead and have your client lean your

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.130 
ahead and have your client lean your
head<00:02:14.209> all<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.360> way<00:02:14.420> back<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:14.959> going<00:02:15.049> to

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
head all the way back and it's going to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.649 
head all the way back and it's going to
change<00:02:15.439> the<00:02:15.769> shape<00:02:15.799> of<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.189> bottom<00:02:16.489> line

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
change the shape of that bottom line

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.399 
change the shape of that bottom line
we're<00:02:17.659> going<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.840> pick<00:02:18.019> up<00:02:18.170> all<00:02:18.349> that<00:02:18.860> hair<00:02:19.099> and

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
we're going to pick up all that hair and

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.589 
we're going to pick up all that hair and
do<00:02:21.409> some<00:02:22.280> more<00:02:22.430> point<00:02:22.670> cutting<00:02:22.909> on<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.239> ends

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
do some more point cutting on the ends

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:40.730 
do some more point cutting on the ends
just<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.989> soften<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.500> out

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.990 

once<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:41.920> feel<00:02:42.070> like<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.520> reasonable

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
once you feel like you have a reasonable

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.060 
once you feel like you have a reasonable
taper<00:02:43.240> there<00:02:43.480> go<00:02:43.780> ahead<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.050> have<00:02:44.170> them<00:02:44.320> be

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
taper there go ahead and have them be

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.240 
taper there go ahead and have them be
upright<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.780> last<00:02:47.020> step<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.740> correct

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
upright and the last step is to correct

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.890 
upright and the last step is to correct
these<00:02:48.460> layers<00:02:48.790> because<00:02:49.300> we<00:02:49.420> still<00:02:49.660> have<00:02:49.870> some

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
these layers because we still have some

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.410 
these layers because we still have some
pretty<00:02:50.230> harsh<00:02:50.620> lines<00:02:51.160> from<00:02:51.640> our<00:02:51.790> upper<00:02:52.120> layers

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
pretty harsh lines from our upper layers

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.170 
pretty harsh lines from our upper layers
see<00:02:53.320> that's<00:02:53.530> right<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.160> there<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.000> next

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
see that's right in there so the next

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.360 
see that's right in there so the next
step<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.780> correct<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.290> by<00:02:56.740> razor<00:02:57.040> cutting

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
step is to correct that by razor cutting

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.440 
step is to correct that by razor cutting
that<00:02:57.580> out<00:03:01.230> take<00:03:02.230> our<00:03:02.410> razor<00:03:02.560> tool<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:04.330> we're

that out take our razor tool and we're

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.200 
that out take our razor tool and we're
going<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:04.600> work<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.960> little<00:03:05.080> bit<00:03:05.230> at<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.470> time

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
going to work a little bit at a time

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.440 
going to work a little bit at a time
find<00:03:07.210> that<00:03:07.330> line<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.900> just<00:03:08.740> cut<00:03:09.030> right<00:03:10.030> into

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
find that line and just cut right into

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.140 
find that line and just cut right into
it<00:03:10.600> and<00:03:10.750> taper<00:03:11.110> off<00:03:11.320> that<00:03:11.560> point<00:03:14.940> once<00:03:15.940> you've

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
it and taper off that point once you've

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.000 
it and taper off that point once you've
worked<00:03:16.390> in<00:03:16.540> these<00:03:16.660> upper<00:03:17.020> layers<00:03:17.260> your<00:03:17.650> ends

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
worked in these upper layers your ends

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.400 
worked in these upper layers your ends
should<00:03:18.190> be<00:03:18.310> fairly<00:03:18.550> tapered<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:20.020> is<00:03:20.170> all

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
should be fairly tapered this is all

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.650 
should be fairly tapered this is all
going<00:03:20.800> to<00:03:20.890> go<00:03:21.100> by<00:03:21.280> feel<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.880> make<00:03:22.150> sure<00:03:22.420> that

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660
