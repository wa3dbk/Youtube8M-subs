help<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.960> lot<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.860> was<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.159> worth<00:01:26.369> it

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
help a lot and it was really worth it

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.149 
help a lot and it was really worth it
because<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.909> leveled<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.540> torment<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.710> we

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
because we leveled on torment for and we

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.679 
because we leveled on torment for and we
were<00:01:29.250> still<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> level<00:01:29.820> 60<00:01:30.090> gear<00:01:30.360> by<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.540> time<00:01:30.659> I

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
were still a level 60 gear by the time I

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.600 
were still a level 60 gear by the time I
got<00:01:30.840> two<00:01:30.960> mouths<00:01:31.140> al<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.250> were<00:01:32.369> getting

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
got two mouths al so we were getting

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.069 
got two mouths al so we were getting
wrecked<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.150> any<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> us<00:01:33.659> were<00:01:33.750> getting<00:01:33.960> two

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
wrecked like any of us were getting two

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.960 
wrecked like any of us were getting two
or<00:01:34.229> three<00:01:34.409> shots<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.640> defensive

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
or three shots and so the defensive

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.190 
or three shots and so the defensive
really<00:01:36.180> helped<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.450> i'll<00:01:36.600> show<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> build

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
really helped so i'll show you the build

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.359 
really helped so i'll show you the build
and<00:01:37.470> i'll<00:01:37.590> show<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.799> what<00:01:37.979> things<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.250> might

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and i'll show you what things you might

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.440 
and i'll show you what things you might
want<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.640> change<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.180> little<00:01:39.270> too

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
want to change if it's a little too

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.910 
want to change if it's a little too
defensive<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> want<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:40.799> more

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
defensive or if you want to go more

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.370 
defensive or if you want to go more
single<00:01:41.280> target<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> build<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.110> really

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
single target so the build is really

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.249 
single target so the build is really
relying<00:01:43.829> mostly<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.390> combination<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.110> i

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
relying mostly on this combination as i

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.530 
relying mostly on this combination as i
said<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.590> mirror<00:01:46.890> image<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.399> slow<00:01:48.060> time<00:01:48.329> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
said with mirror image and slow time so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.090 
said with mirror image and slow time so
mirror<00:01:48.780> images<00:01:49.229> seem<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> cast<00:01:49.740> pretty<00:01:49.979> much

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
mirror images seem to cast pretty much

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.460 
mirror images seem to cast pretty much
any<00:01:50.430> spells<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.329> equipped<00:01:51.899> at<00:01:52.079> that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
any spells you have equipped at that

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.870 
any spells you have equipped at that
time<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.100> certain<00:01:53.399> spells<00:01:53.640> they'll

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
time but certain spells they'll

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.910 
time but certain spells they'll
prioritize<00:01:54.540> over<00:01:55.110> others<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.799> those

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
prioritize over others and one of those

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.100 
prioritize over others and one of those
spells<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.369> slow<00:01:57.000> time<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.899> slow

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
spells is slow time so if you have slow

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.929 
spells is slow time so if you have slow
time<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.469> they'll<00:01:58.979> cast<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.490> pretty<00:01:59.759> much

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
time on they'll cast it pretty much

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.520 
time on they'll cast it pretty much
immediately<00:02:00.240> after<00:02:00.869> your<00:02:00.990> casting<00:02:01.380> your

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
immediately after your casting your

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.620 
immediately after your casting your
mirror<00:02:01.770> images<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.369> works<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.729> any<00:02:02.969> mirror

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
mirror images and it works on any mirror

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.270 
mirror images and it works on any mirror
images<00:02:04.049> ruined<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.350> i<00:02:04.409> was<00:02:04.590> using<00:02:04.740> duplicates

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
images ruined so i was using duplicates

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.310 
images ruined so i was using duplicates
so<00:02:05.430> i<00:02:05.549> get<00:02:05.759> four<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.090> them<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.960> you'll<00:02:07.170> see

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
so i get four of them and as you'll see

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.809 
so i get four of them and as you'll see
as<00:02:07.350> I'm<00:02:07.500> playing<00:02:07.710> when<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> cast<00:02:08.280> duplicates

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
as I'm playing when I cast duplicates

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.639 
as I'm playing when I cast duplicates
for<00:02:09.390> slow<00:02:09.660> times<00:02:09.869> usually<00:02:10.050> go<00:02:10.289> up<00:02:10.319> almost

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
for slow times usually go up almost

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.530 
for slow times usually go up almost
right<00:02:11.069> away<00:02:11.099> now<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.849> slow<00:02:12.120> times<00:02:12.360> don't

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
right away now the slow times don't

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.750 
right away now the slow times don't
stack<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:13.020> each<00:02:13.110> other<00:02:13.290> but<00:02:13.470> this

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
stack with each other but this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.270 
stack with each other but this
rune<00:02:14.090> point<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.989> no<00:02:15.170> return<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.830> really<00:02:16.129> good

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
rune point of no return is really good

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.710 
rune point of no return is really good
for<00:02:16.400> Ivan<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.640> lot<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.909> slow<00:02:17.060> times<00:02:17.299> it<00:02:17.480> makes<00:02:17.569> it

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
for Ivan a lot of slow times it makes it

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.500 
for Ivan a lot of slow times it makes it
so<00:02:17.900> when<00:02:18.140> an<00:02:18.379> enemy<00:02:18.590> leaves<00:02:19.010> or<00:02:19.370> enters<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
so when an enemy leaves or enters the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.080 
so when an enemy leaves or enters the
slow<00:02:20.720> time<00:02:20.900> bubble<00:02:21.230> they<00:02:21.650> get<00:02:21.920> stunned<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.909> so

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
slow time bubble they get stunned and so

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.580 
slow time bubble they get stunned and so
with<00:02:23.269> my<00:02:23.510> slow<00:02:23.780> time<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.290> for<00:02:24.439> mayor

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
with my slow time and the for mayor

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.979 
with my slow time and the for mayor
images<00:02:24.950> that's<00:02:25.340> five<00:02:25.640> slow<00:02:26.000> times<00:02:26.299> any<00:02:26.659> enemy

Lee<00:02:27.110> grant<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.439> going<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.650> get<00:02:27.709> stunned<00:02:28.010> now<00:02:28.340> we

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
Lee grant is going to get stunned now we

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.699 
Lee grant is going to get stunned now we
did<00:02:28.730> test<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.030> little<00:02:29.239> bit<00:02:29.329> if<00:02:29.480> they<00:02:30.019> enter<00:02:30.379> a

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
did test a little bit if they enter a

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.530 
did test a little bit if they enter a
slow<00:02:31.129> time<00:02:31.370> they<00:02:31.549> will<00:02:31.670> get<00:02:31.790> stunned<00:02:32.060> if<00:02:32.269> they

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
slow time they will get stunned if they

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.119 
slow time they will get stunned if they
leave<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.930> after<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.379> they<00:02:33.560> won't<00:02:33.739> so<00:02:33.950> in

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
leave it after that they won't so in

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.710 
leave it after that they won't so in
other<00:02:34.220> words<00:02:34.430> each<00:02:34.790> enemy<00:02:35.090> can<00:02:35.329> only<00:02:35.480> get

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
other words each enemy can only get

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.500 
other words each enemy can only get
stunned<00:02:36.079> by<00:02:36.349> each<00:02:36.620> slow<00:02:37.040> time<00:02:37.340> bubble<00:02:37.730> once

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
stunned by each slow time bubble once

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.080 
stunned by each slow time bubble once
and<00:02:39.079> we<00:02:39.290> also<00:02:39.470> tested<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.010> with<00:02:40.159> teleport<00:02:40.909> and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
and we also tested it with teleport and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.270 
and we also tested it with teleport and
fracture<00:02:41.900> which<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.409> teleport<00:02:42.859> ruin<00:02:43.159> that

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
fracture which is the teleport ruin that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.610 
fracture which is the teleport ruin that
allows<00:02:43.519> you<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.790> summon<00:02:44.209> two<00:02:44.480> mirror<00:02:45.319> images

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
allows you to summon two mirror images

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.080 
allows you to summon two mirror images
when<00:02:45.769> you<00:02:45.859> teleport<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.640> one<00:02:46.790> does<00:02:46.940> not

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
when you teleport and that one does not

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.000 
when you teleport and that one does not
work<00:02:47.299> they<00:02:47.480> will<00:02:47.659> still<00:02:47.900> make<00:02:48.109> the<00:02:48.799> bubbles

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
work they will still make the bubbles

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.800 
work they will still make the bubbles
but<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.760> doesn't<00:02:50.000> stun<00:02:50.269> anyone<00:02:50.599> so<00:02:50.750> I'm

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
but it doesn't stun anyone so I'm

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.119 
but it doesn't stun anyone so I'm
guessing<00:02:50.959> it's<00:02:51.170> just<00:02:51.290> not<00:02:51.409> getting<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.680> ruin

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
guessing it's just not getting the ruin

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.009 
guessing it's just not getting the ruin
effect<00:02:52.430> tried<00:02:53.180> some<00:02:53.389> of<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.510> other<00:02:53.629> slow<00:02:53.810> time

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
effect tried some of the other slow time

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.240 
effect tried some of the other slow time
ruins<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:54.319> that<00:02:54.440> seems<00:02:54.650> work<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.920> best<00:02:55.069> and

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
ruins but that seems work the best and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.920 
ruins but that seems work the best and
you<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.400> just<00:02:55.489> get<00:02:55.609> a<00:02:55.639> lot<00:02:55.879> of<00:02:55.909> stuns<00:02:56.329> up<00:02:56.540> if

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
you can just get a lot of stuns up if

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.360 
you can just get a lot of stuns up if
you<00:02:57.049> cast<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.349> little<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.709> them<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.040> won't<00:02:58.099> stun

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
you cast a little on them it won't stun

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.680 
you cast a little on them it won't stun
them<00:02:58.489> but<00:02:58.670> your<00:02:58.790> cast<00:02:58.940> bubble<00:02:59.239> on<00:02:59.389> the<00:02:59.420> edge<00:02:59.659> of

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
them but your cast bubble on the edge of

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.270 
them but your cast bubble on the edge of
them<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.019> will<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.440> once<00:03:00.859> you<00:03:00.920> have<00:03:01.010> lots<00:03:01.190> of

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
them it will and once you have lots of

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.500 
them it will and once you have lots of
bubbles<00:03:01.430> up<00:03:01.670> as<00:03:01.849> soon<00:03:01.970> as<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.120> enemy<00:03:02.239> start

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
bubbles up as soon as the enemy start

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.270 
bubbles up as soon as the enemy start
moving<00:03:02.750> they<00:03:02.870> just<00:03:03.049> get<00:03:03.170> stunned<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.739> so<00:03:04.220> to

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
moving they just get stunned and so to

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.699 
moving they just get stunned and so to
top<00:03:05.060> that<00:03:05.299> off<00:03:05.359> to<00:03:05.780> add<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.290> mirror<00:03:06.470> image

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
on harder difficulties which is where I

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.270 
on harder difficulties which is where I
think<00:03:12.319> you<00:03:12.379> would<00:03:12.470> use<00:03:12.680> this<00:03:12.829> build<00:03:13.069> I<00:03:13.159> don't

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
think you would use this build I don't

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.229

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
think it's billed to be worth it on

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.000 
think it's billed to be worth it on
lower<00:03:14.420> difficulties<00:03:14.989> I<00:03:15.170> lose<00:03:15.650> this<00:03:15.769> is<00:03:15.889> really

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
lower difficulties I lose this is really

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.319 
lower difficulties I lose this is really
nice<00:03:16.190> you're<00:03:16.430> getting<00:03:16.579> hit<00:03:16.700> for<00:03:17.090> fifteen

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
nice you're getting hit for fifteen

percent of your damage all the time

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.080 
percent of your damage all the time
which<00:03:18.620> means<00:03:18.829> you're<00:03:18.949> constantly<00:03:19.310> restoring

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
which means you're constantly restoring

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.759

bind that's of course to combo with
paralysis<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.739> can<00:03:36.859> get<00:03:36.949> a<00:03:37.010> few<00:03:37.310> extra<00:03:37.370> stuns

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
friend intrepid called a weird word or

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.330 
friend intrepid called a weird word or
word<00:03:44.569> ward<00:03:44.900> have<00:03:45.109> you<00:03:45.199> pronounce<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.680> but<00:03:46.010> it

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
word ward have you pronounce it but it

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.470 
word ward have you pronounce it but it
does<00:03:46.549> pretty<00:03:46.790> much<00:03:46.879> the<00:03:47.030> same<00:03:47.180> thing<00:03:47.239> as

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
does pretty much the same thing as

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.640 
does pretty much the same thing as
paralysis<00:03:47.690> there's<00:03:48.049> another<00:03:48.199> thirteen

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
paralysis there's another thirteen

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.930 
paralysis there's another thirteen
percent<00:03:48.919> chance<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.340> think<00:03:49.519> that<00:03:49.639> can<00:03:49.730> roll<00:03:49.910> up

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
percent chance I think that can roll up

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.270 
percent chance I think that can roll up
to<00:03:50.209> fifteen<00:03:50.569> percent<00:03:50.840> I<00:03:51.079> just<00:03:51.500> dumped<00:03:51.680> for<00:03:51.859> 1.5

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
to fifteen percent I just dumped for 1.5

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.949 
to fifteen percent I just dumped for 1.5
seconds<00:03:52.519> so<00:03:52.609> it's<00:03:52.699> pretty<00:03:52.790> much<00:03:52.970> doubling<00:03:53.780> up

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
seconds so it's pretty much doubling up

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.599 
seconds so it's pretty much doubling up
on<00:03:54.079> paralysis<00:03:54.889> with<00:03:55.099> that<00:03:55.280> which<00:03:55.430> means

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
on paralysis with that which means

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.159 
on paralysis with that which means
you're<00:03:55.849> just<00:03:56.180> stunning<00:03:56.629> a<00:03:56.780> lot<00:03:56.989> with

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
you're just stunning a lot with

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:58.449 
you're just stunning a lot with
lightning<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.739> chose<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.220> lightning

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
lightning and I chose to lightning

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.149 
lightning and I chose to lightning

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
to be a good addition to your group you

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.730 
to be a good addition to your group you
might<00:05:17.660> want<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:17.870> try<00:05:18.020> out<00:05:18.200> this<00:05:18.380> bill<00:05:18.620> you

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
might want to try out this bill you

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.110 
might want to try out this bill you
could<00:05:18.860> try<00:05:19.010> some<00:05:19.160> variations<00:05:19.729> of<00:05:19.880> course

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
could try some variations of course

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.810 
could try some variations of course
energy<00:05:20.720> armor<00:05:20.930> could<00:05:21.530> be<00:05:21.680> a<00:05:21.710> more<00:05:22.220> offensive

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
energy armor could be a more offensive

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.880 
energy armor could be a more offensive
buff<00:05:23.060> teleport<00:05:23.930> any<00:05:24.200> of<00:05:24.380> those<00:05:24.440> other<00:05:24.620> rooms

buff teleport any of those other rooms

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.219 
buff teleport any of those other rooms
would<00:05:25.040> work<00:05:25.250> fine<00:05:25.550> I<00:05:26.330> think<00:05:26.780> duplicates<00:05:27.139> is

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
would work fine I think duplicates is

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.450 
would work fine I think duplicates is
probably<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.590> way<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.710> go<00:05:27.830> with<00:05:27.979> this<00:05:28.040> combo

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
probably the way to go with this combo

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.070 
probably the way to go with this combo
and<00:05:28.639> we<00:05:28.700> didn't<00:05:28.850> find<00:05:29.000> any<00:05:29.120> slow<00:05:29.300> time<00:05:29.479> rooms

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
and we didn't find any slow time rooms

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.810 
and we didn't find any slow time rooms
that<00:05:30.229> worked<00:05:30.440> well<00:05:30.590> but<00:05:31.370> of<00:05:31.460> course<00:05:31.640> you<00:05:31.669> could
