00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 It's personal talk that Felipe is very 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.279
 supreme and today I want to bring to 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 you a summary and also impressions of the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.320
 sony and brazil game presentation 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.450
 show 2013 a fully featured 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.880
 returned to Brazil and in Latin America 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.480
 general that rolled that day 24 of October 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.689
 at 8 o'clock it had 30 of the most was inclusive 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.430
 that's why I 'm going, I 'm going to go ahead 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.650
 for you who expected more 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.070
 explanations on the price of four thousand 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.340
 playstation 4 real has run out a bit 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.230
 disappointed 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.450
 nor was it spoken directly or 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.550
 indirectly on price quotas 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.710
 goshawks, you just said that you're going 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.590
 strengthen the long-term commitment 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.780
 here with Brazil but it's because of it 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.829
 We can say that Sony abandoned 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.200
 Brazil, I think it's quite the opposite. 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.600
 I think her lecture showed a 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.340
 great commitment here with the public 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.360
 Brazilian and with the public of America 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.460
 latina 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.879
 first of all a new collection of 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.039
 favorites to 79 real favorites are 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.410
 those games a little bit older 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.660
 usually does not drop the price or 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.760
 those stores always keep 200 reais in the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.860
 three years ago because it is then the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.530
 sony is further expanding its 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.890
 her favorites to lower the price for 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.250
 79 reais and make them even more 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.990
 accessible 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.630
 something else is quite interesting from the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.780
 conference was the announcement between sony 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.520
 and the ayrton senna institute to improve 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.500
 and give more opportunities for 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 brazilian children 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.340
 then this ad will appear at first 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.710
 a little cryptic 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.479
 But then when you said it was great 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.820
 tourism 6 more pro end of the presentation 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.820
 was a little clearer because we 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.829
 Let's have a limited edition kit of the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.259
 ayrton sena that will have the playstation 3 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.960

 special that will see with 24 cars 25 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.229
 cars a virtual money there and the cool one is 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.090
 good part of that money, right? 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.579
 of everton sena and everything else will be 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.610
 dedicated to the ayrton senna institute 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.170
 will help Brazilian children 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.880
 about playstation vita 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.119
 a sony talk a little bit about the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.300

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.700

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.240
 This is one of the most awaited games for 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.110

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.240

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.390

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.750
 playstation vita then played on another 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.640
 played in the other for his own good 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.950
 interesting and took advantage of 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.430
 announce that Senac will also be 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.500

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.020

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.330

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.680
 that this is a major focus of the company 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.270
 now on 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.310
 then in this presentation she too 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.040
 spoke of independent games but was 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.500
 interesting thing she did is a conversation 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.390
 nearest and latin america where 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.870

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.960
 For example, there are 66 numbers 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.400
 young collaborators in latin america 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.020
 being that 19 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.720
 Only here in Brazil do you have to have 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.270
 a demonstration of the game well that is 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.250
 Argentine studio to talk about the 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.840
 support from most of these games 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.120
 that she wants to increase 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.300
 even more in the coming years 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.940

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.430
 time we saw subtitles in 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.130
 Portuguese but I did not see any dubbing 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.230

 dubbed subtitles - and all that 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.710
 For me it shows is an effort of her in 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.949
 bring these games over here 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.990

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.009
 who sneaked in the middle of that week 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.360
 sony had not mentioned anything else 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.150
 in this presentation she said that it was a 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.569
 software in the last two days of 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.000
 launching the basil in the translated 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.130
 letter and that said that today 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.449
 officially then service was released 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.729
 here in brazil in argentina and chile 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.440
 gamers will have all the benefits or 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.020
 that we have on other platforms 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.110
 the other countries have, for example, 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.370
 cloud storage has fun games 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.930
 has many discounts and has 18 titles 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.789
 free games it seems that they only wake up 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.090
 thing seems like a good time to 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:15.940
 subscribe to a psn plus and take advantage of these 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.860
 games that are free he confirmed 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.229
 also the price of 99 reais per year plus 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.289
 we already knew that because of the 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.759
 of the stone by sneaking into the 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.680
 last days 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.300
 in the end he gave up a month of grace 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.949
 for the guys from the company who were 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.830
 present there plus or minus one 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:35.530
 half a little gift in comparison to 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.909
 The first case this gave you is to 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.380
 person to the people who went to 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.820
 presentation of the part and plans 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.949
 first fall in a typical year of the 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.800
 whole auditorium so now it was just one 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.990
 even the Brazilians for the 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.039
 Brazilian press to test this new psn 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.080
 plus 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.030
 So that's what she said then she's going 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.949
 strengthen the long-term commitment 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.680
 here in Brazil i think it left 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.750
 understood that she will probably 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.580
 want to lower this price 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.030
 playstation frame she already said no 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.610
 is happy to sell and we are going to 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.680
 to follow up more interviews should 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.020
 have more and during the bgs some sites 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.449
 they will do it and I will clear up updating 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.430

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.229
