00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.150
 all great and so decided to write such 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.570
 vidos because some folk 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.950
 craftsmen made their own mod for 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.520
 watch dogs yes it is of course unofficial 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.710
 patch and no official fix 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.980
 general this mod created by folk 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.920
 craftsmen is what the mod is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.730
 what they wrote they improved 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.170
 graphics 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.450
 texture I do not know how it is visible or not, I 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.540
 honestly not particularly noticed maybe 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.090
 maybe the car was not realistic 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.320
 I know the most noticeable of course this 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.890
 book 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.920
 Well, those who are connected with cameras knows 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.469
 You see, everything is blurring when we run 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.010
 the blur moves away what they wrote what 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.219
 they improved the water don't know how much it is 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:08.670
 seen now let's see at all these 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:13.650
 Improvements, I did not particularly notice the input mode 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:18.439
 values ​​of 0.6 maybe 1.0 will be 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.439
 more interesting let's go in the year 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:26.140
 without knowing the water how water can become darker 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.170
 Yes, because before that she was like 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:39.340
 dirt so let's go out somehow 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:42.479
 dude how not to get out so get wet slegontsa 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.079
 In general, this mod is only visible on 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.719
 sharpness that everything is blurred let's 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.439
 let's go to my car of course have this 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:56.049
 fashion is and cons how without them by the way 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:00.819
 it will link you can download the description 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:05.469
 there we will archive us two files these two 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:07.119
 I've found rushes into the game folder you Affairs 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.849
 installed steam games 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:15.670
 watch dogs and folder will be written there 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:17.500
 called data win64 there throw these 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.470
 two files and everything will be nishtyak 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:26.190
 let's sit down so that's about 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:29.780
 With regards to the minuses when the light from the headlights 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.090
 who is there any such ribbed shadows 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:38.000
 yes of course I said 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:41.720
 than there somehow ribbit shadow see everything 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:50.450
 yesterday saw a ride and today something 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:54.680
 no their children not knowing something is not a 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.350
 By the way about the pancake, I did not notice shorter from 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.680
 headlights appeared shadow earlier before 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.600
 was not it 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.570
 of course she is not so realistic it 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:11.110
 should be but still not bad 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.110
 let's take a ride 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.130
 were weird today something of these bugs 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.090
 not 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.040
 hair is 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.040
 and car shadows are normal 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.820
 cool cool 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.620
 In general, if you want to put this here 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.769
 put everything just elementary and I 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.769
 will show 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:49.300
 yes really acquisition 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:53.110
 cool so in general we go out the parameters 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.110
 video quality and 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.060
 and and need to put a depth of field and 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.790
 then you will have it right then 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.239
 you will be blurred background let's show 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.690
 For example , I'll go out now all 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.690
 blurry 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.349
 we'll see 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:22.160
 so okay now everything is blurry we go in 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:25.730
 video quality settings and select 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.150
 depth of field turn off apply but 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.550
 Immediately you can see what has changed and dramatically such 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:37.710
 no 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.710
 Well, from the headlights remains the shadow all see 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.600
 Well here please see from the party by 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.660
 my not 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.350
 eat and no eat listen 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.480
 fine 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.050
 just maybe someone is not unusual 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.420
 play when everything is so dirty but not 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.600
 we don't like it 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.600
 principle, so you apply the rules 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.479
 look 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.479
 yes, everything is blurry again 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:19.440

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:23.690

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.690
