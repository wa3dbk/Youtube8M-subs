00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.090 
style of way I'm gonna build it um so
there's<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.170> momma<00:01:55.170> backs<00:01:55.409> pro<00:01:56.060> for<00:01:57.060> pole

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
there's that so momma backs pro for pole

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.830 
there's that so momma backs pro for pole
it<00:01:59.100> even<00:01:59.310> says<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.790> more<00:01:59.969> torque<00:02:00.240> right<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.630> it

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it even says for more torque right on it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.179 
it even says for more torque right on it
so<00:02:02.509> bullet<00:02:03.509> gear<00:02:03.930> still<00:02:04.320> didn't<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.680> yet<00:02:04.920> I

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
so bullet gear still didn't get it yet I

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.639 
so bullet gear still didn't get it yet I
don't<00:02:05.549> know<00:02:05.610> what<00:02:05.729> happened<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.689> maybe<00:02:07.049> they

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
don't know what happened but maybe they

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.139 
don't know what happened but maybe they
just<00:02:07.680> forgot<00:02:07.890> about<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.550> didn't<00:02:08.789> come<00:02:08.940> see

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
just forgot about it and didn't come see

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.930 
just forgot about it and didn't come see
it<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.450> I'll<00:02:09.780> call<00:02:10.020> today<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.410> ask<00:02:10.530> about

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
it so I'll call today and ask about

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.240 
it so I'll call today and ask about
that<00:02:11.290> wheelie<00:02:12.290> bar<00:02:12.610> motor<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:15.110> new<00:02:15.290> radio

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
that wheelie bar motor and the new radio

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.430 
that wheelie bar motor and the new radio
and<00:02:16.490> receiver

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
and receiver

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.050 
and receiver
um<00:02:18.440> fourth<00:02:18.950> thing<00:02:19.250> oh<00:02:19.580> yeah

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
um fourth thing oh yeah

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.260 
um fourth thing oh yeah
tires<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.170> finally<00:02:21.980> got<00:02:22.130> new<00:02:22.460> anacondas<00:02:23.060> I

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
tires so I finally got new anacondas I

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.390 
tires so I finally got new anacondas I
found<00:02:24.200> out<00:02:24.350> last<00:02:24.500> time<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.830> actually<00:02:25.070> bought

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
found out last time I actually bought

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.340 
found out last time I actually bought
front<00:02:25.820> ones

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
front ones

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.420 
front ones
so<00:02:27.350> these<00:02:27.620> wouldn't<00:02:27.890> stick<00:02:28.130> out<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.310> bit

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
so these wouldn't stick out a bit

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.070 
so these wouldn't stick out a bit
further<00:02:28.730> than<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.570> last<00:02:29.780> ones<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:32.080> it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
further than the last ones so it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.600 
further than the last ones so it
actually<00:02:33.200> runs<00:02:33.440> pretty<00:02:33.710> good<00:02:33.830> with<00:02:34.070> them<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
actually runs pretty good with them the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.310 
actually runs pretty good with them the
motor<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.420> motor<00:02:35.630> surprisingly

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
motor is that this motor surprisingly

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.230 
motor is that this motor surprisingly
isn't<00:02:36.680> as<00:02:36.800> fast<00:02:37.070> as<00:02:38.000> my<00:02:38.300> tack<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:40.240> it's

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
isn't as fast as my tack on but it's

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.640 
isn't as fast as my tack on but it's
about<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.570> for<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:41.780> video<00:02:41.900> guys<00:02:42.080> just<00:02:42.470> wanted
