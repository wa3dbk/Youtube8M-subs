thing and I'm more like let's see how

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.900 
thing and I'm more like let's see how
much<00:02:31.440> bug<00:02:31.710> buzzle<00:02:32.130> doing<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.490> didn't<00:02:32.730> do<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.820> lot

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
much bug buzzle doing it didn't do a lot

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.660 
much bug buzzle doing it didn't do a lot
so<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.240> goes<00:02:33.390> for<00:02:33.540> leech<00:02:33.750> seed<00:02:33.990> right<00:02:34.350> now<00:02:34.500> I

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
so it goes for leech seed right now I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.430 
so it goes for leech seed right now I
already<00:02:35.670> figured<00:02:35.970> out<00:02:36.210> they<00:02:36.420> probably<00:02:36.750> does

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
already figured out they probably does

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.810 
already figured out they probably does

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
not have a bullet seed or power whip so

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.390 
not have a bullet seed or power whip so
I'm<00:02:42.000> safe<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.540> stay<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.710> also<00:02:43.980> realize
