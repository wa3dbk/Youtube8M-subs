00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:14.110
 collectible cards with the album me 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.740
 I've started a bit longer 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:21.720
 I wanted to collect again 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.090
 36 brought absolutely knocked already and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:30.670
 are more likely to do more duplicate 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:37.929
 new one has the mouse i already have it 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:42.879
 Unwrapped makes it sombre gloomy prison 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:44.589
 break cougar and train will be her too 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:51.159
 still a sort or 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:56.589
 the duplicate then sort out the 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:01:09.100
 trigger happy world robot puzzle game 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:15.340
 is a runner's life conjures stone ring 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.450
 puzzle and the live chat away at one 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.500
 I'm not so sure yet 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:30.970
 sure but I think I have 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:34.140
 It's completely double that 's how we do it 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:41.580
 first the character cards here 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.580
 then comes to the conclusion brussels 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:56.930
 I also have that twice too 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.620
 I also have dortmund about the manager 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:12.980
 then at doubles trigger happy 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:17.830
 because I'm not so lazy happy now 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.830
 doubly twice as well away 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:31.820
 double checked 64 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:04:28.919
 three cards on the subject of dementia too 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:04:36.570
 two more and one more father 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:49.640
 son even doubled 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:49.640
 Sort paper extra longer here 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.880
 pack 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:01.760
 where I can double the sorting 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:04.260
 you do not buy because amazon or 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:10.320
 any writable shops online 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:13.950
 I think I had some jumps 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.440
 i like the character cards at 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.500
 the figures are thought but there 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.640
 There was no folder or through the 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.150
 I could fill it with rows now 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.150
 lay here 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:39.780
 I already have some doubles and have 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.770
 sometimes exchanged card against 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.420
 But in the end I do not have card 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.620
 even because I only spa then 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.620
 but had twice 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.020
 somehow wants to have a card or 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.060
 needs because also collects differently 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.620
 So write my pm or write 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:16.250
 write down below if he swap 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.830
 would like to write a few down pushers 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.580
 So I give the cards for free I 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.960
 have for it really no use if 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.500
 one she just needs or she just needs 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.140
 So nice and just wants to have 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.610
 write 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:36.710
 rm then address 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:40.310
 I send you wish to make it yet 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.980
 a list in the infobox then from the 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.660
 duplicate cards by numbers and can 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.700
 you choose then so I enter 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.820
 even twice as triple 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.700
 four times simply double 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:56.570
 some even just then you have to 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:58.310
 then we'll look at the map 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:02.570
 if that's popular or so I know it 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:06.490
 yes, I just did not want to 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.490
 I did not see that writing 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:33.040
 so there is still stuff somewhere 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:39.560
 Still has room as I said I give 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:41.990
 Just write off airport and then 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.270
 I'll send you to maybe you just 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:49.640
 really do not know any connection for 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:54.430
 These duplicate cards have left so that 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.430
 first of all until next time
