there's our third time going to the CI
finals<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.920> just<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:18.170> can't<00:00:19.170> describe

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
finals but it just you can't describe

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.470 
finals but it just you can't describe
the<00:00:19.529> feeling<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:20.130> doesn't<00:00:20.400> just<00:00:20.850> get<00:00:21.119> old<00:00:21.240> for

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
the feeling it doesn't just get old for

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.390 
the feeling it doesn't just get old for
sure<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.500> haven't<00:00:22.800> won<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.039> yet<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.310> I'm

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
sure and we haven't won it yet so I'm

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.250 
sure and we haven't won it yet so I'm
hoping<00:00:23.670> third<00:00:23.880> time's<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.210> charm<00:00:24.240> earlier<00:00:25.199> in
