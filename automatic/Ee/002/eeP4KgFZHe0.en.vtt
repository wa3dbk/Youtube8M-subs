 clean air is completely unsuitable 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.760
 for breathing 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.660
 we don't live without water here 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.500
 under the fins 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.220
 fish not

 elite not 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.850
 hello, let's break the verse first 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.250
 then with the first part and so the verse I 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.559
 Now just play at a slow pace and 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.350
 then for those who do not understand 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.649
 I will explain in detail exactly how it should be 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.649
 play 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.600
 so hold the index finger 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.060
 second string on the first fret further 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.060
 pull the fifth and first together 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.070
 then play the second 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.370
 then play 3 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.840
 further we press the third finger with the middle finger 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.130
 string on the second fret and play and and 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.220
 it turns out it turns out like this 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.220
 part 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.570
 then hold the fifth finger with the ring finger. 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.700
 string on the third fret and little finger 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.110
 we clamp the fourth string on the third 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.979
 fret 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.979
 playing 5 4 3 4 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:08.670
 connect the first second part again 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.500
 further raise all fingers except 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.880
 middle unnamed fingers pinch on 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.050
 third fret second string 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.170
 forefinger clamp on the second fret 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.000
 the fifth string play the fifth and first 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.980
 together 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.410
 gave the second 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.840
 the third 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.640
 and then swap your index finger 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.030
 first string 3 strings 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.500
 let the other fingers go 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.500
 it turns out such a movement 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.120
 connect our three parts 1 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.410
 2 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.410
 3 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.780
 after we stayed on this 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.630
 positions we pinch the middle finger fifth 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.480
 string on the second fret and nameless 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.209
 finger fourth string also on the second 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:27.070
 fret generally we get it chord 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:29.820
 e and we play 5 4 3 4 connect the third and 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.820
 fourth part 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:50.480
 now connect all parts 1 2 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:55.250
 3 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.250
 fourth and re 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.700
 the chorus is played in principle on the same 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.500
 chords now i'm at a slow pace 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.190
 I'll play it later in more detail 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.190
 analyze 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.240
 at 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.610
 and so at first we have a chord am. 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.889
 when we played the verse we set it 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.770
 not the full version ie the index 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.080
 finger we clamp the second string on 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.650
 first fret is now nameless 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.280
 clamp the third string on the second fret and 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.990
 on the same second fret middle finger 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.830
 clamps 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.509
 fourth string sixth string does not sound 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.110
 we play from 5 strings and we play such 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.110
 rhythmic pattern 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:13.780
 so we do it 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.330
 blow down a small pause another blow 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.879
 down and then goes sbivka that is, we 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:24.849
 play down up just at that moment 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:27.940
 when we change the accord we go further 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.219
 f f chord but we put the single set 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.960
 him so 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:34.419
 remember how in the couplet we had 2 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.090
 part of the same way the fingers are on such 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.069
 chord e fmaj7 in f major 7 will 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.699
 be called the right chord play that 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.699
 same fight 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.150
 given a chord from the third part 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:52.520
 note that the sixth 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.520
 the string doesn't sound like an ewok order f 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.699
 and then put the chord e which was also 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.600
 we have in a couplet connect all four 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.600
 chord and play together 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.659
