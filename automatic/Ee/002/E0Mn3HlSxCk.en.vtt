00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.220
 Hello dear PetrijÃ¼nger today one time 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.900
 product video of me me 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.599
 And today my two roles are 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.609
 I had to buy it myself 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.630
 So I'm not getting paid right now 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.390
 sneak advertising I have the here 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.850
 cormorant freewheel roll 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:40.019
 komax wr 3af in 2,500 so that's one 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.210
 Freewheel role as we already said 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.360
 see here is the normal brake 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.239
 for the active the active foot brake 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.280
 so to speak and here we have the 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.760
 Brake for the free-running of the free-running is 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.430
 every lever weber is very light 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.900
 a lay now with a hand 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.110
 a bit difficult but we can do that 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.110
 already gone 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.630
 It's an aluminum cast here in front 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.159
 the coil itself this made of aluminum 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.659
 we see very nice thick temple here 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:26.430
 a beautiful a very nice schnurchen 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:30.230
 big prevented so fast was here 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.270
 The handle itself so here the crank 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.370
 this probably steel or steel 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.340
 aluminum which is simply chrome plated 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.570
 the choir concept is out 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.870
 bring plastic 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.420
 that means a bit of weight savings 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.020
 can be very easily turn the crank 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.409
 itself is very smooth in all 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.310
 positions down here we still have one 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.310
 returns 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:06.439
 Stop or you may call that it is 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:10.910
 a 2500 of the role has a version 20 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:14.690
 25 only from 210 meters and at 930 only from 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:21.110
 150 meters are two steel balls installed 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:23.959
 is a translation of 5 2 to 1 who 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:29.830
 So what can it start as I said 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.830
 worked the whole thing very nicely 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.410
 not the easiest thing yet 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.850
 but yes, I think so 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.320
 Stationary role quite useful 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.090
 I have the whole of a browning cards 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.860
 route easy garden route I mounted 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.610
 find it very beautiful 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.300
 overall impression 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.310
 now we come to freewheel and the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.380
 one does not need activated one 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.660
 quarter turn it back in 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.860
 do not even get close quarters 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.720
 turn it is really very very much 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.570
 fast 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.150
 I personally think that I have very good 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.530
 already rolling in the country had 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.510
 It takes you two whole turns 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.220
 so that the strap can ratchet up again 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.450
 ever take a little too long 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.250
 That's why I think that's good 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.140
 here actually after a very short time 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.090
 already directly a limp so that can 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.850
 I am very good 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.200
 yes if the freewheel is activated you 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.940
 see yourself I have just 70 drum 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.470
 stay tuned he pretty much 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.120
 but not too easy 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.690
 Smooth that means when we have one 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.790
 adjusting 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:40.980
 on a very easy level, I say now 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:43.200
 times with minimal resistance on 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.330
 the earth arrived where you need now 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.400
 I do not know how much grams that 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.260
 cloth are but it is not too 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.540
 smoothly I say that's it 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.700
 for some okay for others 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.080
 which must have made it extremely smooth 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.610
 I think it's great because my part 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.520
 I can not stop it now 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.320
 I can do that extremely smoothly 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.090
 front at the top by the algae was 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.530
 so I can see a good one so far 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.180
 before the fish takes off and then 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.540
 the role has virtually also school-free 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.380
 So as I said I think so very well 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:16.890
 it does not have to be smoother 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.250
 that is completely enough for me yes 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.420
 Forgotten relationship 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.440
 to mention briefly that is an alu 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.100
 I think I already had that coil 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.890
 but said is a long throw coil 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.060
 that is supposedly supposedly so 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.800
 can throw on 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.720
 I'll pronounce that when 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.590
 I'm on new year's eve to the well 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.920
 that's how it really is 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:43.550
 yes it was now just here to 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:46.430
 Cormorant roll that maybe I still 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.370
 mention should go to the end 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.760
 the brake that can be naturally 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.760
 imagine 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.950
 and all the harder this brake here 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:04.580
 put down or the highest level is 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.870
 like the softest or hardest here 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.840
 stage here at the front of the brake 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.280
 set so that means I have the 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:16.100
 Brakes pretty much slammed when I 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:18.980
 but here it is open here 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.280
 also easier again so that the 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:28.100
 maximum hardness of the freewheel brakes 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:32.630
 I put the quasi over the back 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.890
 maximum hardness of the front brake that 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.210
 I do this morning with my test 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.230
 on franck does not know that it is normal 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.210
 or whatever I still had 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.340
 no freewheel role itself 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.770
 try out 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:46.280
 but maybe there is no one or 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:50.450
 other interesting good now it was 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.730
 but that really says goodbye to me 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.350
 have you guys until the next video blogs 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.130
 you like subscribe if yes 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.880
 Leave a Comment 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:01.690
 here whatsoever perhaps suggestions it 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.690
 runs until next time
