00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.830 
should I say and you're gonna have it
with<00:03:59.570> the<00:04:00.570> face<00:04:00.780> is<00:04:01.080> hmm<00:04:02.120> but<00:04:03.120> there<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:03.660> go

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
with the face is hmm but there you go

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.729 
with the face is hmm but there you go
he's<00:04:04.440> quite<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.250> cool<00:04:05.430> figure<00:04:06.800> it's<00:04:09.739> doing

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
he's quite a cool figure it's doing

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.970 
he's quite a cool figure it's doing
really<00:04:11.570> sort<00:04:12.570> of<00:04:12.600> look<00:04:12.750> like<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:13.080> Emperor<00:04:13.350> you

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
really sort of look like the Emperor you

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.340 
really sort of look like the Emperor you
can<00:04:14.160> say

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
can say

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.250 
can say
but<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:17.570> don't<00:04:18.570> think<00:04:18.690> they're<00:04:18.840> really<00:04:18.930> going

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
but I don't think they're really going

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.520 
but I don't think they're really going
for<00:04:19.470> realism<00:04:20.130> they're<00:04:20.459> going<00:04:20.640> for<00:04:20.910> what<00:04:21.720> sort

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
for realism they're going for what sort

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.270 
for realism they're going for what sort
of<00:04:22.620> captures<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.850> character<00:04:27.650> yeah<00:04:28.650> last<00:04:29.010> but

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
of captures the character yeah last but

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.010 
of captures the character yeah last but
not<00:04:29.970> least<00:04:30.240> is<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.950> lord<00:04:31.950> Vader<00:04:32.130> himself<00:04:33.020> in
