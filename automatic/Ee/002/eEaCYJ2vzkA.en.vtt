we're doing more you asked the answer

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.970 
we're doing more you asked the answer
and<00:00:09.349> our<00:00:10.120> question<00:00:11.120> here<00:00:11.509> it's<00:00:12.349> actually<00:00:12.769> two

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
and our question here it's actually two

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.409

questions from the same guy we're going

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.299 
questions from the same guy we're going
to<00:00:14.480> merge<00:00:14.660> it<00:00:14.870> together<00:00:14.959> from<00:00:15.410> brace<00:00:15.769> Lewis

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309

well<00:00:20.300> first<00:00:20.570> one<00:00:20.720> is<00:00:20.810> what's<00:00:21.019> a<00:00:21.140> bit<00:00:21.349> changes

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
well first one is what's a bit changes

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.009 
well first one is what's a bit changes
this<00:00:22.039> an<00:00:22.189> experienced<00:00:22.849> lifter<00:00:23.420> need<00:00:23.660> to<00:00:23.810> make

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
this an experienced lifter need to make

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.769 
this an experienced lifter need to make
in<00:00:24.199> programming<00:00:25.009> to<00:00:25.730> go<00:00:25.820> from<00:00:26.060> good<00:00:26.240> to<00:00:26.449> great

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
in programming to go from good to great

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.230 
in programming to go from good to great
in<00:00:26.990> terms<00:00:27.859> of<00:00:28.099> combined<00:00:28.699> total<00:00:29.119> in<00:00:29.210> general

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
in terms of combined total in general

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.430 
in terms of combined total in general
and<00:00:30.279> and<00:00:31.279> then<00:00:31.460> his<00:00:32.119> follow-up<00:00:32.630> is<00:00:32.990> that<00:00:33.230> is

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
and and then his follow-up is that is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.230 
and and then his follow-up is that is
the<00:00:33.590> same<00:00:33.800> question<00:00:34.280> to<00:00:34.310> go<00:00:34.490> how<00:00:34.760> do<00:00:34.820> you<00:00:34.940> what

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
the same question to go how do you what

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.180 
the same question to go how do you what
do<00:00:35.360> you<00:00:35.390> need<00:00:35.539> to<00:00:35.660> do<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:36.020> go<00:00:36.110> from<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.410> 600<00:00:37.010> plus

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
do you need to do to go from a 600 plus

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.410 
do you need to do to go from a 600 plus
water<00:00:37.520> to<00:00:37.969> a<00:00:38.000> 700<00:00:38.930> pounds<00:00:39.200> water<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:39.829> to<00:00:40.420> make

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
water to a 700 pounds water so to make

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.950 
water to a 700 pounds water so to make
that<00:00:41.600> that<00:00:41.870> quantum<00:00:42.320> leap<00:00:43.539> what<00:00:44.539> type<00:00:44.930> of

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
that that quantum leap what type of

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.420 
that that quantum leap what type of
things<00:00:45.230> have<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:45.500> done<00:00:45.649> or<00:00:45.949> people<00:00:46.370> that

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
things have you done or people that

you've trained with or trained what have
they<00:00:49.280> done<00:00:49.489> to<00:00:49.550> make<00:00:50.149> that<00:00:50.359> jump

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
they done to make that jump

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.389 
they done to make that jump
well<00:00:53.210> you're<00:00:53.359> using<00:00:53.629> you're<00:00:54.559> using<00:00:54.769> mice<00:00:55.039> mice

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
well you're using you're using mice mice

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.060 
well you're using you're using mice mice
Cal<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:56.449> soft<00:00:56.750> good<00:00:56.960> great<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:57.680> know<00:00:57.800> so

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
Cal of soft good great you know so

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.139 
Cal of soft good great you know so
to<00:00:59.000> go<00:00:59.210> from<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:00.980> suck<00:01:01.250> it's<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.579> big<00:01:01.820> step

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
to go from to suck it's a big step

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.549 
to go from to suck it's a big step
because<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.809> means<00:01:02.899> you<00:01:03.019> got<00:01:03.109> to<00:01:03.140> actually

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
because that means you got to actually

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.020 
because that means you got to actually
commit<00:01:03.859> to<00:01:03.920> something<00:01:04.250> which<00:01:04.489> most<00:01:04.640> people

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
commit to something which most people

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.020 
commit to something which most people
have<00:01:05.180> a<00:01:05.710> four<00:01:06.710> are<00:01:06.800> not<00:01:06.980> able<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.369> do<00:01:07.610> they're

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.570 
not really able to go all Hannity's
might<00:01:10.070> mess<00:01:10.670> around<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:11.060> little<00:01:11.090> bit<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:13.430> go

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
might mess around a little bit to go

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.109 
might mess around a little bit to go
from<00:01:13.790> suck<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.060> good<00:01:14.619> that's<00:01:15.619> another<00:01:16.119> big

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
from suck to good that's another big

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.240 
from suck to good that's another big
flight<00:01:17.479> of<00:01:17.689> steps<00:01:17.930> because<00:01:18.500> now<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:18.950> gotta<00:01:19.130> be

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
flight of steps because now you gotta be

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.850 
flight of steps because now you gotta be
consistent<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.509> got<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.140> be<00:01:21.229> dedicated<00:01:21.829> to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you know it's making all those small

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.740 
you know it's making all those small
sacrifices<00:02:01.570> that<00:02:01.600> everybody<00:02:02.370> else<00:02:03.750> isn't

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
sacrifices that everybody else isn't

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.080 
sacrifices that everybody else isn't
willing<00:02:05.260> to<00:02:05.560> make<00:02:05.770> because<00:02:06.070> they<00:02:06.370> justify<00:02:07.060> oh

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
willing to make because they justify oh

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.620 
willing to make because they justify oh
well<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.020> can<00:02:08.410> go<00:02:08.560> do<00:02:08.800> this<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.610> it's<00:02:10.510> still

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
well I can go do this and it's still

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.530 
well I can go do this and it's still
okay<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.250> answer<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.700> question<00:02:12.880> it's<00:02:13.300> not

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
okay so to answer that question it's not

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.830 
okay so to answer that question it's not
really<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.190> programming<00:02:15.420> answer<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.690> an

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
really a programming answer it's an

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.050 
really a programming answer it's an
answer<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.380> discipline<00:02:17.980> sacrifice<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.970> what

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
answer of discipline sacrifice and what

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.050 
answer of discipline sacrifice and what
are<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.330> willing<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.750> actually<00:02:20.020> do<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.790> go<00:02:22.030> to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
are you willing to actually do to go to

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.580 
are you willing to actually do to go to
that<00:02:22.480> next<00:02:22.720> step<00:02:23.760> very<00:02:24.760> very<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.600> programming

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
that next step very very the programming

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.250 
that next step very very the programming
wise<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:27.640> know<00:02:27.760> if<00:02:27.940> you're<00:02:28.180> already<00:02:28.720> good

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
wise you know if you're already good

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.500 
wise you know if you're already good
you've<00:02:29.590> already<00:02:29.860> kind<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.460> figured<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:30.910> out

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
you've already kind of figured it out

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.980 
you've already kind of figured it out
you<00:02:32.110> know<00:02:32.230> once<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.710> are<00:02:33.100> at<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.360> level<00:02:34.420> to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
you know once you are at that level to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.870 
you know once you are at that level to
where<00:02:35.410> your<00:02:35.590> commitment<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.730> you're

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
where your commitment is that you're

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.880 
where your commitment is that you're
going<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.060> accept<00:02:37.570> no<00:02:37.780> other<00:02:37.810> option<00:02:38.620> but<00:02:38.650> to

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
going to accept no other option but to

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.760 
going to accept no other option but to
be<00:02:39.280> great<00:02:39.660> well<00:02:40.660> then<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:41.020> will<00:02:41.230> be<00:02:41.470> that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
be great well then you will be that

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.170 
be great well then you will be that
because<00:02:42.340> you're<00:02:42.460> not<00:02:42.610> going<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.850> accept

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
because you're not going to accept

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.590 
because you're not going to accept
anything<00:02:43.540> else<00:02:43.930> other<00:02:44.470> than<00:02:44.710> that<00:02:45.420> when<00:02:46.420> you

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
anything else other than that when you

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.840 
anything else other than that when you
are<00:02:46.900> there<00:02:47.800> at<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.210> level<00:02:50.070> in<00:02:51.070> whatever<00:02:51.640> it

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
are there at that level in whatever it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.760 
are there at that level in whatever it
is<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.420> know<00:02:52.510> usually<00:02:52.930> I'll<00:02:53.080> define<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.590> as

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
is you know usually I'll define that as

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.270 
is you know usually I'll define that as
being<00:02:54.070> in<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.220> top<00:02:54.780> 20%<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:56.620> whatever<00:02:57.010> you're

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
being in the top 20% of whatever you're

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.660 
being in the top 20% of whatever you're
doing<00:02:57.840> then<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:58.990> becomes<00:02:59.410> more<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.310> what<00:03:00.640> I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
doing then it becomes more of what I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.640 
doing then it becomes more of what I
think<00:03:01.000> he's<00:03:01.180> actually<00:03:01.450> asking<00:03:02.170> me<00:03:02.320> what

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
think he's actually asking me what

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.620 
think he's actually asking me what
things<00:03:02.890> need<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.220> be<00:03:03.370> done<00:03:03.700> if<00:03:04.270> you're<00:03:04.540> an

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
things need to be done if you're an

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.780 
things need to be done if you're an
elite<00:03:04.930> lifter<00:03:05.470> if<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.040> want<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.250> become<00:03:06.489> even

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
elite lifter if you want to become even

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.860 
elite lifter if you want to become even
better<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.930> know<00:03:08.050> as<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.500> elite<00:03:08.830> lifter<00:03:09.280> and

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
better you know as that elite lifter and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.140 
better you know as that elite lifter and
typically<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.989> lot<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.860> that<00:03:12.010> falls<00:03:12.459> back<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:13.120> a

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
typically a lot of that falls back to a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.550 
typically a lot of that falls back to a
lot<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.570> same<00:03:13.780> things<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:14.230> need<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.440> be

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
lot of the same things that need to be

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.250 
lot of the same things that need to be
focused<00:03:14.800> on<00:03:15.190> as<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> beginner<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.780> technique

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
focused on as a beginner the technique

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.400 
focused on as a beginner the technique
has<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.530> constantly<00:03:18.430> be<00:03:18.940> dead-on<00:03:19.300> but<00:03:20.230> one

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
has to constantly be dead-on but one

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.080 
has to constantly be dead-on but one
thing<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.650> you'll<00:03:20.950> see<00:03:21.010> with<00:03:21.400> an<00:03:21.550> elite<00:03:21.850> or<00:03:22.060> a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
thing that you'll see with an elite or a

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.420 
thing that you'll see with an elite or a
pro<00:03:22.450> lift<00:03:22.780> or<00:03:23.050> is<00:03:23.500> if<00:03:23.770> you<00:03:23.920> watch<00:03:24.130> their

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
pro lift or is if you watch their

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.760 
pro lift or is if you watch their
technique<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.060> only<00:03:25.570> time<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:26.320> will<00:03:26.350> ever

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
technique the only time it will ever

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.940 
technique the only time it will ever
break<00:03:27.160> down<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:27.820> if<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:29.140> waste<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.620> have<00:03:29.770> any

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
break down is if the waste you have any

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.100 
break down is if the waste you have any
forces<00:03:30.430> in<00:03:30.550> either<00:03:30.700> groove<00:03:31.090> if<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:31.900> watch

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
forces in either groove if you watch

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.590 
forces in either groove if you watch
them<00:03:32.320> in<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.500> warm-up<00:03:32.920> room<00:03:33.160> every<00:03:33.790> every

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
them in the warm-up room every every

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.020 
them in the warm-up room every every
single<00:03:35.080> repetition<00:03:35.320> looks<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.250> same<00:03:36.430> over

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
single repetition looks the same over

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.880 
single repetition looks the same over
and<00:03:37.060> over

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
and over

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.330 
and over
/<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.940> when<00:03:39.120> I'm<00:03:39.210> looking<00:03:39.390> at<00:03:39.800> videos<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:40.830> our

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
/ and when I'm looking at videos of our

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.610 
/ and when I'm looking at videos of our
lifters<00:03:41.820> when<00:03:42.060> they<00:03:42.180> want<00:03:42.390> me<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.540> analyze<00:03:43.320> it

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
lifters when they want me to analyze it

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.380 
lifters when they want me to analyze it
usually<00:03:44.130> they're<00:03:44.280> gonna<00:03:44.370> send<00:03:44.700> me<00:03:44.850> their<00:03:45.210> last

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
usually they're gonna send me their last

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.360 
usually they're gonna send me their last
three<00:03:45.720> lifts<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.500> first<00:03:46.710> thing<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:46.980> look<00:03:47.190> at<00:03:47.310> is

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
three lifts the first thing I look at is

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.180 
three lifts the first thing I look at is
the<00:03:47.640> consistency<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:49.350> know<00:03:49.470> are<00:03:49.680> all<00:03:49.890> three

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
the consistency you know are all three

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.010 
the consistency you know are all three
lifts<00:03:50.610> do<00:03:50.790> they<00:03:50.910> all<00:03:51.090> look<00:03:51.330> exactly<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.900> same

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
lifts do they all look exactly the same

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.680 
lifts do they all look exactly the same
and<00:03:52.920> if<00:03:53.100> they<00:03:53.250> don't<00:03:53.460> which<00:03:54.060> one<00:03:54.270> looks<00:03:54.510> at<00:03:54.600> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
and if they don't which one looks at the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.570 
and if they don't which one looks at the
best<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.500> then<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.770> look<00:03:55.920> at<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.460> then

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
best and then you look at that and then

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.890 
best and then you look at that and then
you<00:03:56.700> compare<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.150> little<00:03:57.510> more<00:03:57.630> wrong<00:03:57.870> and

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
you compare a little more wrong and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.280 
you compare a little more wrong and
those<00:03:58.230> other<00:03:58.470> two<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:59.640> techniques<00:04:00.600> gonna<00:04:00.900> be<00:04:01.110> a

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
those other two so techniques gonna be a

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.980 
those other two so techniques gonna be a
huge<00:04:01.590> factor<00:04:01.950> there<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:03.090> other<00:04:03.270> factor<00:04:03.780> from

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
huge factor there the other factor from

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.510 
huge factor there the other factor from
the<00:04:04.110> training<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.770> it<00:04:04.890> falls<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.190> little<00:04:05.220> bit

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
the training and it falls a little bit

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.770 
the training and it falls a little bit
back<00:04:05.670> down<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.510> original<00:04:06.740> statement<00:04:07.740> is

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
back down to the original statement is

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.330 
back down to the original statement is
there's<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.840> lot<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.290> things<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:10.770> you<00:04:10.950> can<00:04:11.160> do

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
there's a lot of things that you can do

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.960 
there's a lot of things that you can do
if<00:04:11.700> it's<00:04:11.940> nutritionally<00:04:12.930> if<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.910> know

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
if it's nutritionally if it's you know

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.199 
if it's nutritionally if it's you know
just<00:04:15.240> basic<00:04:15.750> conditioning<00:04:16.440> your<00:04:16.739> GPB<00:04:17.430> that

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
just basic conditioning your GPB that

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.539 
just basic conditioning your GPB that
may<00:04:18.450> only<00:04:18.630> add<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:18.930> half<00:04:19.350> percent<00:04:19.950> or<00:04:20.220> one

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
may only add a half percent or one

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.909 
may only add a half percent or one
percent<00:04:20.970> but<00:04:21.630> all<00:04:21.840> those<00:04:22.019> little<00:04:22.140> percents

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
percent but all those little percents

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.070 
percent but all those little percents
add<00:04:23.130> up<00:04:23.430> so<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.060> need<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.330> look<00:04:24.510> at<00:04:24.660> all<00:04:24.870> those

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
add up so you need to look at all those

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.680 
add up so you need to look at all those
things<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:26.430> could<00:04:26.940> make<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.419> better

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
things that could make you a better

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.340 
things that could make you a better
lifter<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:28.470> then<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.340> need<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.700> do<00:04:29.850> them<00:04:30.350> and

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
lifter and then you need to do them and

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.680 
lifter and then you need to do them and
that's<00:04:31.560> pretty<00:04:32.130> much<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:32.669> you<00:04:33.360> know<00:04:33.480> and

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
that's pretty much it you know and

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.960 
that's pretty much it you know and
that's<00:04:34.250> that's<00:04:35.250> not<00:04:35.490> saying<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:35.820> you're

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
that's that's not saying that you're

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.490 
that's that's not saying that you're
gonna<00:04:36.030> be<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.419> best<00:04:36.660> of<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:36.990> best<00:04:37.140> because

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
gonna be the best of the best because

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.230 
gonna be the best of the best because
too<00:04:37.650> many<00:04:37.740> other<00:04:37.980> factors<00:04:38.460> fall<00:04:38.760> into<00:04:39.060> there

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
too many other factors fall into there

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.000 
too many other factors fall into there
such<00:04:39.480> as<00:04:39.630> genetics<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:40.320> other<00:04:40.470> things<00:04:40.740> but<00:04:40.890> it

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
such as genetics and other things but it

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.590 
such as genetics and other things but it
will<00:04:41.100> make<00:04:41.340> you<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.550> best<00:04:41.700> you<00:04:42.360> can<00:04:42.540> possibly

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
will make you the best you can possibly

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.050 
will make you the best you can possibly
be<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.560> probably<00:04:44.400> better<00:04:44.610> than<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:44.940> ever

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
be and probably better than you ever

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.240 
be and probably better than you ever
thought<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.510> could<00:04:45.540> be<00:04:45.720> so<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.890> programming

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
thought you could be so the programming

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.250 
thought you could be so the programming
doesn't<00:04:47.520> change<00:04:47.850> but<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.360> get<00:04:48.570> more<00:04:48.840> from<00:04:49.140> the

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
doesn't change but you get more from the

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.020 
doesn't change but you get more from the
programming<00:04:49.860> by<00:04:50.010> putting<00:04:50.280> more<00:04:50.430> into<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:50.790> with

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
programming by putting more into it with

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.880 
programming by putting more into it with
those<00:04:51.150> otherwise<00:04:51.450> if<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.140> programming<00:04:52.710> does

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
those otherwise if the programming does

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.100 
those otherwise if the programming does
change<00:04:53.280> it's<00:04:53.490> gonna<00:04:53.640> change<00:04:53.729> because<00:04:54.210> you

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
change it's gonna change because you

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.890 
change it's gonna change because you
know<00:04:55.500> what<00:04:56.310> needs<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.700> change<00:04:56.850> there<00:04:57.510> becomes

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
know what needs to change there becomes

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.880 
know what needs to change there becomes
a<00:04:58.050> point<00:04:58.380> in<00:04:58.650> time<00:04:59.070> with<00:04:59.970> every<00:05:00.890> advanced

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
a point in time with every advanced

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.250 
a point in time with every advanced
lifter<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:02.640> probably<00:05:03.330> every<00:05:03.750> advanced

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
lifter and probably every advanced

lifter and probably every advanced
athlete<00:05:04.710> as<00:05:04.860> far<00:05:05.100> as<00:05:05.220> that<00:05:05.430> goes

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
athlete as far as that goes

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.710 
athlete as far as that goes
to<00:05:06.540> where<00:05:06.780> they<00:05:07.110> they<00:05:07.680> basically<00:05:08.160> almost<00:05:08.729> have

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
to where they they basically almost have

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.680 
to where they they basically almost have
mastered<00:05:10.440> how<00:05:10.650> to<00:05:10.710> train<00:05:11.160> themselves<00:05:11.690> so

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
mastered how to train themselves so

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.719 
mastered how to train themselves so
they'll<00:05:12.960> know<00:05:13.229> through<00:05:13.560> their<00:05:13.800> own<00:05:13.950> train<00:05:14.370> at

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
they'll know through their own train at

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.550 
they'll know through their own train at
what<00:05:14.940> point<00:05:15.270> they<00:05:15.419> need<00:05:15.600> to<00:05:15.720> back<00:05:15.930> it<00:05:15.960> down<00:05:16.169> at

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
what point they need to back it down at

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.950 
what point they need to back it down at
what<00:05:16.710> point<00:05:17.010> can<00:05:17.190> they<00:05:17.340> drive<00:05:17.580> harder<00:05:18.180> so<00:05:18.840> if

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
what point can they drive harder so if

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.830 
what point can they drive harder so if
the<00:05:19.080> program<00:05:19.530> says<00:05:19.890> they<00:05:20.100> need<00:05:20.220> to<00:05:20.280> do<00:05:20.540> 85%<00:05:21.540> for

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
the program says they need to do 85% for

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.140 
the program says they need to do 85% for
a<00:05:21.870> triple<00:05:22.440> and<00:05:22.770> they're<00:05:23.400> warming<00:05:23.729> up<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:24.030> they

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
a triple and they're warming up and they

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.730 
a triple and they're warming up and they
know<00:05:24.390> this<00:05:24.750> is<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:25.080> day<00:05:25.229> they<00:05:25.410> could<00:05:25.470> probably

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
know this is the day they could probably

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.130 
know this is the day they could probably
push<00:05:26.160> it<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.400> little<00:05:26.430> bit<00:05:26.700> more<00:05:27.090> they<00:05:27.870> know<00:05:28.080> to

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
push it a little bit more they know to

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.429 
push it a little bit more they know to
push<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.710> little<00:05:28.890> bit<00:05:29.040> more<00:05:29.220> if

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:29.439 
push it a little bit more if

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.719 
push it a little bit more if
warming<00:05:29.830> up<00:05:29.919> and<00:05:30.099> they<00:05:30.159> know<00:05:30.279> it's<00:05:30.429> not<00:05:30.489> there

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
warming up and they know it's not there

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.089 
warming up and they know it's not there
they<00:05:30.849> know<00:05:30.999> to<00:05:31.059> back<00:05:31.330> it<00:05:31.539> down<00:05:31.569> so<00:05:32.469> they<00:05:32.679> become

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
they know to back it down so they become

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.600 
they know to back it down so they become
more<00:05:33.580> in<00:05:33.939> sync<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:34.659> more<00:05:34.839> in<00:05:34.959> tune<00:05:35.169> I<00:05:35.589> thought

more in sync and more in tune I thought

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:52.089 
set the set session to session so the

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.879 
set the set session to session so the

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
programming isn't so much now I'm doing

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.959 
programming isn't so much now I'm doing
block<00:05:56.889> training<00:05:57.339> there<00:05:57.489> now<00:05:57.610> I'm<00:05:57.789> doing

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
block training there now I'm doing

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.969 
block training there now I'm doing
website<00:05:58.449> training<00:05:58.929> and<00:05:59.110> it's<00:05:59.229> now<00:05:59.559> I'm<00:05:59.739> doing

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
website training and it's now I'm doing

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.189 
website training and it's now I'm doing
Dave<00:06:00.159> training<00:06:00.669> you<00:06:01.389> know<00:06:01.509> which<00:06:01.689> is<00:06:01.869> modeled

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
Dave training you know which is modeled

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.969 
Dave training you know which is modeled
after<00:06:02.759> whatever<00:06:03.759> you<00:06:04.719> know<00:06:04.839> theory<00:06:05.349> or<00:06:05.589> you're

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
after whatever you know theory or you're

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.519 
after whatever you know theory or you're
using<00:06:06.279> but<00:06:07.209> you<00:06:07.329> figured<00:06:07.809> out<00:06:07.959> how<00:06:08.139> you<00:06:08.199> train

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:08.529 
using but you figured out how you train

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:10.619 
using but you figured out how you train
yourself<00:06:08.679> that's<00:06:09.279> a<00:06:09.579> big<00:06:09.819> part<00:06:10.149> of<00:06:10.269> what<00:06:10.449> that

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:10.629 
yourself that's a big part of what that

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:13.199 
yourself that's a big part of what that
leap<00:06:10.869> is<00:06:11.079> as<00:06:11.379> well<00:06:11.619> at<00:06:12.309> the<00:06:12.459> same<00:06:12.699> time<00:06:12.939> those

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:13.209 
leap is as well at the same time those

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:15.089 
leap is as well at the same time those
are<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.449> people<00:06:13.629> who<00:06:13.839> no<00:06:14.019> longer<00:06:14.050> fall<00:06:14.709> for

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
are the people who no longer fall for

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.469 
are the people who no longer fall for
every<00:06:15.309> new<00:06:15.459> training<00:06:15.819> method<00:06:16.179> that<00:06:16.300> comes

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
every new training method that comes

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.689 
every new training method that comes
around<00:06:16.709> because<00:06:17.709> they<00:06:17.889> already<00:06:18.129> know<00:06:18.489> what

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
around because they already know what

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.089 
around because they already know what
they<00:06:18.819> need<00:06:19.029> to<00:06:19.149> do<00:06:19.300> and<00:06:19.599> how<00:06:20.139> they<00:06:20.619> need<00:06:20.769> to<00:06:20.829> do

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
they need to do and how they need to do

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.159 
they need to do and how they need to do
it<00:06:21.309> now<00:06:21.939> they<00:06:22.089> look<00:06:22.329> at<00:06:22.479> the<00:06:22.569> other<00:06:22.719> training

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
it now they look at the other training

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.989 
it now they look at the other training
methods<00:06:23.499> and<00:06:23.649> the<00:06:23.709> other<00:06:23.889> programs<00:06:24.249> for<00:06:24.429> ideas

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:24.999 
methods and the other programs for ideas

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.779 
methods and the other programs for ideas
to<00:06:25.300> help<00:06:25.689> fill<00:06:26.019> those<00:06:26.169> voids<00:06:26.439> but<00:06:27.429> that<00:06:27.610> all

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
to help fill those voids but that all

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.299 
to help fill those voids but that all
falls<00:06:28.209> in<00:06:28.599> there<00:06:29.139> and<00:06:29.319> it's<00:06:29.469> something<00:06:29.829> that<00:06:30.039> I

00:06:30.299 --> 00:06:30.309 
falls in there and it's something that I

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:34.079 
falls in there and it's something that I
don't<00:06:31.239> believe<00:06:31.659> it's<00:06:31.929> a<00:06:32.139> teachable<00:06:32.919> thing<00:06:33.339> you

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:34.089 
don't believe it's a teachable thing you

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.779 
don't believe it's a teachable thing you
know<00:06:34.240> it's<00:06:34.860> you<00:06:35.860> can<00:06:36.039> teach<00:06:36.309> them<00:06:36.610> different

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789 
know it's you can teach them different

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:38.249 
know it's you can teach them different
methods<00:06:37.329> and<00:06:37.419> programming<00:06:38.019> but<00:06:38.110> that's

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
methods and programming but that's

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.559 
methods and programming but that's
something<00:06:38.679> that<00:06:38.889> they<00:06:39.519> just<00:06:39.550> hit<00:06:40.029> a<00:06:40.089> certain

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:40.569 
something that they just hit a certain

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.019 
something that they just hit a certain
point<00:06:40.779> in<00:06:40.929> time<00:06:41.050> and<00:06:41.529> then<00:06:41.679> they<00:06:41.829> know<00:06:42.039> and<00:06:42.939> I

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:43.029 
point in time and then they know and I

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:45.809 
point in time and then they know and I
remember<00:06:43.449> to<00:06:43.659> speak<00:06:43.869> into<00:06:44.139> the<00:06:45.069> Jeremy<00:06:45.610> for

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:45.819 
remember to speak into the Jeremy for

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.269 
remember to speak into the Jeremy for
eight<00:06:45.879> years<00:06:45.909> ago<00:06:46.569> you<00:06:47.110> know<00:06:47.259> and<00:06:47.289> talking

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:48.279 
eight years ago you know and talking

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:50.639 
eight years ago you know and talking
about<00:06:48.550> this<00:06:48.789> very<00:06:49.059> subject<00:06:49.389> and<00:06:50.199> so<00:06:50.409> they<00:06:50.499> just

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:50.649 
about this very subject and so they just

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:52.709 
about this very subject and so they just
came<00:06:50.769> with<00:06:50.919> time<00:06:51.069> where<00:06:51.219> a<00:06:51.249> new<00:06:51.459> you<00:06:52.300> know<00:06:52.419> this

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:52.719 
came with time where a new you know this

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:54.329 
came with time where a new you know this
is<00:06:52.869> what<00:06:53.050> I<00:06:53.079> need<00:06:53.289> to<00:06:53.409> do<00:06:53.529> this<00:06:53.709> is<00:06:53.889> how<00:06:54.039> I<00:06:54.069> need

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:54.339 
is what I need to do this is how I need

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:57.659 
is what I need to do this is how I need
to<00:06:54.369> do<00:06:54.639> it<00:06:54.789> and<00:06:55.349> it<00:06:56.349> locked<00:06:56.679> in<00:06:56.889> and<00:06:57.099> everything

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:57.669 
to do it and it locked in and everything

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:00.269 
to do it and it locked in and everything
took<00:06:57.849> off<00:06:58.029> from<00:06:58.239> there<00:06:58.509> so<00:06:59.050> it's<00:06:59.259> the<00:06:59.860> magic

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:00.279 
took off from there so it's the magic

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.159 
took off from there so it's the magic
moment<00:07:00.669> I<00:07:00.699> suppose<00:07:01.029> on<00:07:01.239> a<00:07:01.269> house<00:07:01.479> to<00:07:01.689> define<00:07:02.019> it

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:02.169 
moment I suppose on a house to define it

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.479 
moment I suppose on a house to define it
okay<00:07:03.069> thanks<00:07:03.729> for<00:07:03.789> the<00:07:03.939> question<00:07:04.269> race
