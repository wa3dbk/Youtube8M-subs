00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.040
 jean louis is a grand prize of 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hungary 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 it is undeniably the most beautiful 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.580
 round of the 2014 season so far yes 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.650
 because we had pretty much all 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.750
 of what a great grand prize can 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.000
 book a scenario a bit 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.380
 more at the beginning it's perfect we know 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.320
 very well that rain is an adjuvant 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.199
 important in the show a race 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.029
 very beautiful among leaders and among 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.230
 big arm so it's even better and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.369
 that's why it was a treat for 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.410
 everyone everyone was 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.329
 really delighted at a time when we 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.110
 starts to criticize the formula 1 yes 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.210
 it's not funny 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.730
 louis cars this yes the pilots 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.579
 that etc. it fell right and we go 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.160
 holiday with a really good image 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.750
 in the eyes leading by the way almost 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.430
 missing from the podium since it's daniel 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.440
 ricciardo who rides on the highest 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.750
 walk with him behind fernando alonso 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.890
 these are the two strong men after the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.170
 mercedes pilots 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.390
 I think Ricardo has won a 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.370
 more convincing victory than the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.080
 canada where there had been concerns for 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.240
 mercedes really technical problems 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.290
 which was important besides there this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.780
 times the mercedes have seen problems 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.260
 during qualifying and during the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.780
 race but ricardo has won and 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.909
 so for me it's not only a 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.830
 deserved victory a victory gained from 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.140
 all beauty in the forms 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.520
 he had only tender tires he got 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.650
 really well done and especially 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.220
 especially he attacked in a way 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.960
 wonderful 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.299
 he made trips all 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.159
 so great so it was the man of 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.119
 of the grand prix alonso also a small 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.890
 word on him formidable alonso because 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.259
 its tires do not suddenly stood and when 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.780
 even he knew how to preserve them until the end 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.240
 and you saw that as much hamilton had 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.810
 hard to exceed sacred alonso as much he 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.909
 was extremely sporty lord with 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.790
 Ricardo he was also the great 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.799
 man from the party I believe that 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.290
 ferrari did not lead great prices 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.479
 as long and long ago and 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.399
 for that fernando was extremely 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.670
 applauded even though after in conference of 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.290
 press 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.270
 he was quite equal to himself 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.250
 that is to say cold enough elsewhere he has 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.319
 been great and ferrari frankly there 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.350
 and it's downright a victory for them 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.940
 almost in any case 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.230
 talk about technical concern at mercedes 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.120
 there was not that that also we know he 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.710
 there have been some problems between 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.180
 instructions given to hamilton in particular 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.740
 hamilton who are doing rather well 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.570
 very well with a third place and 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.390
 who had mechanical problems 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.310
 yes then hamilton he had in 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.410
 qualifications a breakdown for which 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.730
 even you geraldine you would refuse to 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.990
 perret pay the bill at your 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.610
 garage, that is to say a necklace 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.740
 poorly ease tight that it can more 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.750
 exist on no car has even more 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.610
 on Formula 1 now for what 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.950
 regards the instructions of equipped it is 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.810
 simple there is an alternative where one in 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.250
 do not give where we give it if we give it 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.840
 well it is for everyone the same 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.550
 where we do not give what is still 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.890
 better mercedes said he would not sell 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.020
 no instructions during the whole season 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.850
 except maybe the end then no need 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.420
 to say hamilton to let pass 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.890
 rosberg 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.840
 it's true that rosberg was a lot 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.640
 faster it's true that hamilton did not 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.970
 not let pass but you have to know what 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.010
 we want 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.150
 that said hamilton I give him little 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.160
 reason because they have come up from afar 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.660
 but I give just as much reason for 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.180
 rosberg that could have passed 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.240
 actually and I know that spend the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.190
 10 difficult rounds behind hamilton 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.170
 it still has ruined his race must 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.030
 understand that the three leaders whose 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.680
 rossberg helping vettel they had their 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.660
 race massacred by cars of 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.070
 security and so it was over for them 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.570
 I think even robert he had 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.880
 not really attacked he could have finished 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.480
 even further so he finishes fourth he 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.160
 save the furniture 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.750
 it's not that bad 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.060
 this sap that carla that intervenes at a 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.800
 weird moment we're going to say since 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.120
 leaders can not go back to 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.230
 same time as others do 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.800
 it's not the fia that got a little tangled up 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.780
 the brushes 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.830
 yes but here too you have to know what 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.960
 we want to forget just waiting for 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.520
 past leaders we see the car of 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.760
 security or there are problems 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.020
 dangerous delicate and we solve them all 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.730
 right away so what happened in the summer 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.620
 is that in absolute value there has been 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.570
 two security cars but if you 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.490
 take the rule had 3 there was the 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.360
 first when ericsson shifts that 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.920
 in the safety rail 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.840
 I'm doing an ericsson parenthesis that did not 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.490
 not at all its place in formula 1 I 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.640
 close the parenthesis there is one 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.930
 second is grosjean romain he wants 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.040
 warm up his tires he tires 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.370
 on the white band that is still 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.210
 wet 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.830
 but he goes in lollipop that's where the 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.180
 safety car had to go not 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.830
 at all she stays on track will want 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.410
 so a third intervention when 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.419
 peruse well done his with his 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.190
 crewmate with vettel brief perez who 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.470
 was not fit at all this weekend 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.360
 I pass and so there was that 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.920
 had to take a moment to take in 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.930
 account the safety car that's right 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.730
 I repeat that she ruined the race 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.010
 de rosberg and the vettel race 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.690
 there too a parenthesis about vettel who has 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.220
 shown that in the field of 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.560
 point it was not going at all he did 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.540
 still a double head to tail in full 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.730
 speed without touching anything finally in 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.290
 tutelage a little wall he is doing well 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.000
 but it shows that it's not going at all 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.770
 with this red bull renault 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.470
 did you see someone roman grosjean 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.030
 we can talk about jean eric vergne who 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.710
 is 9th and jules bianchi is the 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.490
 guardian well listen vergne did 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.470
 a very nice race 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.820
 bianchi equal to himself even though he was 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.560
 of a dog mood on Friday because 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.390
 it did not work at all. 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.010
 found way to recover itself this is 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.380
 not so bad now 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.120
 understand that transfers have 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.770
 soon to play it is during 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.250
 holidays and that unlike 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.170
 appearances 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.120
 I think it's valves that is the 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.830
 more threatened I'm doing a paper on it 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.560
 in the next auto more I think 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.100
 with the red bull 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.900
 performance of his teammate 2004 i 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.720
 think I had seriously threatened 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.340
 grosjean I think he'll stay at 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.810
 lotus even though he believes he has 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.030
 openings elsewhere I think it's 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.780
 lotus the best solution on all 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.730
 mercedes engines 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.010
 but beware the mercedes engines there 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.840
 have to pay them not like with renault and 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.880
 then bianchi the oil and he is well he 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.770
 is quiet because at least his 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.240
 maroussia team will want to keep it because 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.740
 that even though he scored two points 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.390
 monaco and that's very important 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.520
 and then he may have other 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.070
 openings so for the French there are 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.710
 the good of the average and the good of the 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.780
 any holiday vacation equals rest 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.280
 forced fit and a forced rest because 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.250
 that even if engineers take away 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.680
 their laptop with them one does not 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.350
 can not query CPUs 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.820
 big teams that's closed and 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.680
 so there are fifteen days of rest 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.630
 mandatory now we will meet again 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.630
 at the grand prix of belgium at the end of august
