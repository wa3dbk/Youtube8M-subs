00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:05.689 
yes going this is my high banker putting

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.129 
yes going this is my high banker putting
it<00:00:05.779> together<00:00:05.899> by<00:00:06.290> myself<00:00:06.939> what<00:00:07.939> we<00:00:08.090> have<00:00:08.300> is<00:00:08.719> a

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
it together by myself what we have is a

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.190 
it together by myself what we have is a
50-inch<00:00:09.559> sluice<00:00:10.009> box<00:00:10.370> and<00:00:10.639> I<00:00:10.759> just<00:00:11.059> slid<00:00:11.990> that

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
50-inch sluice box and I just slid that

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.929 
50-inch sluice box and I just slid that
a<00:00:12.490> little<00:00:13.870> forward<00:00:14.870> of<00:00:15.019> the<00:00:15.110> frame<00:00:15.490> and<00:00:16.490> I<00:00:16.730> put

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
a little forward of the frame and I put

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.720 
a little forward of the frame and I put
this<00:00:17.060> hopper<00:00:17.420> here<00:00:17.660> and<00:00:18.609> essentially<00:00:19.609> what

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
this hopper here and essentially what

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.340 
this hopper here and essentially what
the<00:00:19.820> hopper<00:00:20.150> is<00:00:20.269> is<00:00:20.449> it's<00:00:20.570> just<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.869> real<00:00:21.050> rugged

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
the hopper is is it's just a real rugged

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.820 
the hopper is is it's just a real rugged
plastic<00:00:22.130> storage<00:00:23.060> bin<00:00:23.480> that<00:00:23.689> I<00:00:23.779> got<00:00:23.990> at<00:00:24.170> IKEA

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830

grizzly as a crash mat there I'll
probably<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.300> fix<00:00:41.570> with<00:00:41.720> some<00:00:42.790> expanded<00:00:43.790> metal

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
probably a fix with some expanded metal

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.220 
probably a fix with some expanded metal
and<00:00:44.540> maybe<00:00:44.990> a<00:00:47.620> washer<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:48.890> a<00:00:49.270> wingnut<00:00:50.270> and<00:00:50.660> the

front there is a hole to evacuate the
water<00:00:54.620> into<00:00:54.950> the<00:00:55.040> front<00:00:55.310> of<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.460> sluice<00:00:55.730> box

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
water into the front of the sluice box

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.260 
water into the front of the sluice box
and<00:00:57.170> I'll<00:00:57.260> show<00:00:57.440> you<00:00:57.470> how<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:57.740> goes<00:00:57.950> together

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
and I'll show you how this goes together

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.750 
and I'll show you how this goes together
I've<00:00:59.270> made<00:00:59.510> it<00:00:59.690> to<00:00:59.900> be<00:01:00.220> you<00:01:01.220> know<00:01:01.340> the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
I've made it to be you know the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.439 
I've made it to be you know the
intentions<00:01:02.150> were<00:01:02.830> portability<00:01:03.830> and<00:01:04.400> to<00:01:05.300> be

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
intentions were portability and to be

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.690 
intentions were portability and to be
lightweight<00:01:05.740> so<00:01:06.740> there's<00:01:07.340> very<00:01:07.550> little

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
lightweight so there's very little

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.290 
lightweight so there's very little
hardware<00:01:08.270> that<00:01:08.540> goes<00:01:09.400> into<00:01:10.400> this<00:01:10.550> and<00:01:10.610> it

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
hardware that goes into this and it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.540 
hardware that goes into this and it
seems<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.720> be<00:01:11.810> quite<00:01:11.990> rugged<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:13.130> weekend

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
seems to be quite rugged this weekend

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.880 
seems to be quite rugged this weekend
we'll<00:01:13.760> figure<00:01:14.030> out<00:01:14.210> how<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.140> works<00:01:15.380> it's<00:01:15.800> just

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
we'll figure out how it works it's just

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.520 
we'll figure out how it works it's just
a<00:01:16.070> prototype<00:01:16.660> and<00:01:17.660> I'll<00:01:18.080> show<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:18.320> how

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
a prototype and I'll show you how

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.050 
a prototype and I'll show you how
everything<00:01:18.710> goes<00:01:18.920> together<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:19.400> let<00:01:19.820> me<00:01:19.880> put

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
everything goes together so let me put

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:35.880 
everything goes together so let me put
this<00:01:20.150> camera<00:01:20.390> down

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.980 

all<00:01:36.890> right<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.299> classifier

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
all right and this is the classifier

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.960 
all right and this is the classifier
essentially<00:01:42.829> what<00:01:43.039> it<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.280> is<00:01:43.490> I<00:01:43.579> stand<00:01:43.880> a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
essentially what it is is I stand a

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.899 
essentially what it is is I stand a
bunch<00:01:44.149> of<00:01:44.830> leftover<00:01:45.830> oak<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.369> milled<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.759> up

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
bunch of leftover oak and I milled it up

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.480 
bunch of leftover oak and I milled it up
and<00:01:47.649> countersunk<00:01:48.649> everything<00:01:49.159> with<00:01:49.280> wood

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
and countersunk everything with wood

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.490 
and countersunk everything with wood
screws<00:01:49.820> nothing's<00:01:50.270> glued<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.229> can<00:01:51.350> take

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
screws nothing's glued so you can take

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.529 
screws nothing's glued so you can take
it<00:01:51.590> apart<00:01:51.679> and<00:01:52.039> replace<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.789> screen<00:01:53.270> if<00:01:53.450> you

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
it apart and replace the screen if you

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.550 
it apart and replace the screen if you
want<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.080> just<00:01:54.820> 3/16<00:01:55.820> hardware<00:01:56.270> clock

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
want this is just 3/16 hardware clock

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.109 
want this is just 3/16 hardware clock
took<00:01:57.560> some<00:01:57.710> aluminum<00:01:58.159> stock<00:01:58.399> cut<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:58.909> size

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
took some aluminum stock cut it to size

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.960 
took some aluminum stock cut it to size
put<00:01:59.720> it<00:01:59.780> in<00:01:59.869> the<00:01:59.929> front<00:02:00.110> here<00:02:00.459> to<00:02:01.459> reinforce

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
put it in the front here to reinforce

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.930 
put it in the front here to reinforce
the<00:02:02.149> box<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.810> then<00:02:02.929> some<00:02:03.560> aluminum<00:02:04.399> stock<00:02:04.700> on

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.009 
reinforcement
this<00:02:08.750> simply<00:02:09.080> just<00:02:09.289> drops<00:02:09.619> in<00:02:09.860> here<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:11.450> this

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
this simply just drops in here and this

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.360 
this simply just drops in here and this
back<00:02:12.380> part<00:02:12.819> pops<00:02:13.819> out<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.209> SN<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.950> what<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.100> did

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
back part pops out the SN and what I did

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.539 
back part pops out the SN and what I did
was<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.760> drilled<00:02:17.209> two<00:02:17.420> holes<00:02:17.769> in<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:19.069> top<00:02:19.370> of

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
was I drilled two holes in the top of

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.250 
was I drilled two holes in the top of
the<00:02:19.610> classifier<00:02:20.239> here<00:02:20.569> in<00:02:20.690> here<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.170> then

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
the classifier here in here and then

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.600 
the classifier here in here and then
there's<00:02:21.440> two<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.860> Hopf<00:02:22.010> are<00:02:22.250> there<00:02:22.430> and

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
there's two and the Hopf are there and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.430 
there's two and the Hopf are there and
there<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.060> like<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.600> said<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:23.989> is<00:02:24.140> meant<00:02:24.380> for

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
there and like I said this is meant for

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.470 
there and like I said this is meant for
portability<00:02:25.160> into<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.519> lightweight<00:02:26.090> so

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
portability into the lightweight so

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.839 
portability into the lightweight so
there's<00:02:27.140> no<00:02:27.380> hardware<00:02:27.860> used<00:02:28.099> to<00:02:28.310> hold<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.610> in

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
there's no hardware used to hold this in

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.110 
there's no hardware used to hold this in
you<00:02:29.450> simply<00:02:29.840> just<00:02:29.989> use<00:02:30.110> two<00:02:30.530> zip<00:02:30.769> ties<00:02:30.799> and<00:02:31.790> if

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
you simply just use two zip ties and if

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.210 
you simply just use two zip ties and if
you<00:02:32.239> want<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.540> run<00:02:32.720> clay<00:02:33.019> weave<00:02:33.799> these<00:02:33.980> zip

you want to run clay weave these zip

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.550 
you want to run clay weave these zip
ties<00:02:34.430> loose<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.239> will<00:02:35.390> sit<00:02:35.600> flat<00:02:35.840> if

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
ties loose and this will sit flat if

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.890 
ties loose and this will sit flat if
you're<00:02:36.739> running<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.250> know<00:02:37.400> stone<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.359> sand

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
you're running you know stone and sand

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.500 
you're running you know stone and sand
and<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.829> know<00:02:39.950> your<00:02:40.130> average<00:02:40.340> growls<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.269> just

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
and you know your average growls I just

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.509 
and you know your average growls I just
pull<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:41.840> up<00:02:42.019> site<00:02:42.290> here<00:02:42.560> because<00:02:43.340> that's

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
pull this up site here because that's

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.099 
pull this up site here because that's
how<00:02:43.609> I<00:02:43.670> tested<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.450> everything<00:02:44.780> seems<00:02:45.049> to

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
how I tested it and everything seems to

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.630 
how I tested it and everything seems to
hang<00:02:45.350> around<00:02:45.470> for<00:02:45.739> just<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.070> second<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.489> then

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
hang around for just a second and then

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.810 
hang around for just a second and then
wash<00:02:46.880> right<00:02:47.180> out<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.070> just<00:02:49.250> did<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.609> with

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
wash right out and I just did that with

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.060 
wash right out and I just did that with
some<00:02:50.030> some<00:02:50.480> walks<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.079> water<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.590> some

handfuls of different materials just to
make<00:02:54.470> sure<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.680> had<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.920> angle<00:02:55.370> right<00:02:55.519> prior<00:02:56.299> to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
make sure I had the angle right prior to

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.780 
make sure I had the angle right prior to
drilling<00:02:56.750> any<00:02:56.959> holes<00:02:57.049> in<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.590> hopper<00:02:57.980> because

straighten this out I know I'm gonna

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.890 
straighten this out I know I'm gonna
have<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.580> adjust<00:04:39.670> it<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.330> angle<00:04:40.660> on<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
sluice box he had to run a little bit

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.730 
sluice box he had to run a little bit
steeper<00:04:42.880> but<00:04:43.210> that's<00:04:43.900> essentially<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.470> in<00:04:44.680> a

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
steeper but that's essentially it in a

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
budget and that seems to be pretty

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.290

if<00:05:58.699> not<00:05:59.650> we'll<00:06:00.650> look<00:06:00.800> at<00:06:00.949> something<00:06:01.160> different

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
if not we'll look at something different

if not we'll look at something different
but<00:06:01.729> right<00:06:01.940> there<00:06:02.150> we've<00:06:02.360> got<00:06:02.389> a<00:06:02.539> pretty<00:06:03.110> fair

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
but right there we've got a pretty fair

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.820 
but right there we've got a pretty fair
amount<00:06:03.590> of<00:06:03.860> surface<00:06:04.070> area<00:06:04.490> in<00:06:04.910> the<00:06:05.030> sluice<00:06:05.830> to

amount of surface area in the sluice to

certainly large enough where you could

certainly large enough where you could
stand<00:06:13.639> here<00:06:13.910> with<00:06:14.030> a<00:06:14.060> bucket<00:06:14.479> and<00:06:14.510> just<00:06:14.840> spray
