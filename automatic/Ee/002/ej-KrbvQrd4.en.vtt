00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.910
 hi guys it's always me 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.920
 today I will talk to you about this program 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.230
 identical eye and even more breath 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.480
 identical an advanced version let's say 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:22.250
 it's called pp 25 you will find many tutorials 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 online so I will not list downloads 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.680
 you will find the link for sure but vi 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.220
 I'll talk about how 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.050
 you will use this home where 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:39.040
 we could find applications 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.340
 the main ones are not ours 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.559
 app 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.400
 now a tina no feel has gone down 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:53.090
 same page 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 sorry these are the apps for without the 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.250
 jailbreak because there are apps that don't 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.470
 only then jaibreak high not most 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.460
 part I am without jailbreak anyway 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.340
 then this is the construction section of the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.250
 our downloads and downloads 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.810
 finished when they finish downloading yes 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.640
 will click this and then install the qua 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.810
 big difference from others that you can 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.600
 add climate audio photo ringtones 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.190
 in the tools because why using 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.890
 this program itunes and will not 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.490
 be used because each 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.030
 will raise awareness will be done 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.610
 tuning will ask to start up 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.000
 cracked applications you will ask about apple 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.190
 and all will not make the big difference 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.790
 of programs you can update yourself as 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.880
 I said before is itunes style 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:53.080
 this program is therefore very simple and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:56.380
 now I will explain to you how to connect the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.170
 our devices for the first time when 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.200
 we click on these red in other 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:07.090
 here there will be this blue one will click 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.090
 will finish loading parastos in 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.320
 automatic and our survey will be possible 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.680
 we are everything 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.820
 after which you can go to look up from 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.820
 here above 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.310
 Now we will try some one billion 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.580
 will load we see a bit and I have to 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.220
 say that there are many good ones above all 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.709
 Italians unlike the others I have 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.680
 noticed that I'll show you they knew there 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:46.140
 so shsh updates are there 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.250
 let's say brio in full points 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.390
 then the ipod touch 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.130
 oh well now the paths we are there then 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:02.410
 other things I haven't seen like 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:06.250
 many e-mail address book 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.010
 other things this itunes program yes 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.980
 will click this button for i from a node 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.360
 or if you want to see information 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.330
 click on the icon then load page 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.880
 both for uploading photos is 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.450
 instead the download 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.370
 now you see the loading of 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.140
 images 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.300
 we mean the loading of the icon 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.400
 so I will show the page 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:40.690
 I think, however, of download it already goes down 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.610
 the page there is this little arrow yes 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.930
 will click download is in 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.060
 automatic here 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.200
 as you see the expense saw not the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.080
 mortal kombat 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.280
 then the download is quite fast 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.900
 then obviously it depends on everyone who 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:02.360
 conversion to change the second speed 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.930
 however compared to other programs e 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.440
 very fast and what else can I do with 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:17.660
 see the music 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:18.970
 now we will go to music and yes 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.030
 will add more songs 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:27.740
 dragging and then coming to us from 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:32.240
 alone to our idevice and as I said 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.360
 there are many very good applications 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.110
 then a great chance to do 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.790
 access to the app store and when you 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.139
 access to the southern history that 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.960
 will close the dust 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.660
 I really think we can do that 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.740
 program and Chinese and is only for windows 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:05:04.010
 remember for all ipad device then 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:07.570
 of any os and I think I said 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.570
 all yes 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:20.379
 yes the updates are there and look 

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:23.649
 for updates there are one ways 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:27.579
 fondly in the deep mentally and the 

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:33.879
 so practically here a species will come out 

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:37.329
 of notify almost and with the two apps 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:39.459
 olap that we will keep updated then there 

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:40.389
 it will be the classic arrow I have 

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:43.209
 talked about before 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:47.259
 starting from a load automatically 

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:49.419
 will flap at the ten o'clock update 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:55.749
 minutes ago it was scary update of 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:57.959
 bit rough work attested on two ai 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:02.069
 iphone ipod device 

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:05.189
 anyway this time I'm filming 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:08.550
 bugs not found as mentioned not 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:12.939
 absolutely used itunes 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:17.500
 because practically creates the problem 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:22.360
 of the opening of the asp and it will be a nice one 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.719
 slaughterhouse that should be deleted 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.810
 app 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:28.300
 the list program darmon each 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.449
 so there is no need because how 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.539
 you have seen almost can do everything as it is 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:37.750
 a greeting I remind you to dismiss me from mine 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:40.030
 channel that we do or other videos we say 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:44.039
 mixed because not only your iphone but 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.039
 also on android and app return 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:51.060
 minecraft gameplay of xbox games 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.590
 I remember to sign up to comment 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.780
 if you liked it if you have any problems 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:07:00.870
 installation and how I found it 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:04.139
 I give you advice if you go looking for e 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.540
 in the guides you see that the download does not 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:07.980
 it works you have to go look for it a little 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.530
 usually around what he has 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.990
 so many people worked when not 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.300
 it worked was the rare one I have 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:18.060
 encountered an opening problem 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:22.410
 then I downloaded it from a site not me 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:25.830
 I remember where and rare point went 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:28.800
 because he gave me a hero who was missing one 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:32.910
 my part since first anyway then 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:37.620
 there are many guides, however, many 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:40.260
 online is an eye alternative to nov 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.870
 much better than it came out at the end of the year 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:46.620
 this program a day later and it is 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:49.940
 much better then a greeting and there 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.940
 see you at the next video bye
