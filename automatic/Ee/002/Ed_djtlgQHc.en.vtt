00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.810 

okay<00:00:00.840> folks<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.650> axle<00:00:02.159> peg<00:00:02.399> which<00:00:02.669> is

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
okay folks this is the axle peg which is

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.519 
okay folks this is the axle peg which is
the<00:00:02.939> last<00:00:03.179> part<00:00:03.540> you<00:00:03.600> have<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.840> draw<00:00:04.170> it's<00:00:04.410> less

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
the last part you have to draw it's less

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.260 
the last part you have to draw it's less
than<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.770> most<00:00:04.950> complicated<00:00:05.400> part<00:00:05.910> because

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
than the most complicated part because

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.259 
than the most complicated part because
you<00:00:06.509> cannot<00:00:07.020> do<00:00:07.379> it<00:00:07.500> with<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> revolve<00:00:08.179> you<00:00:09.179> have

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
you cannot do it with a revolve you have

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.940 
you cannot do it with a revolve you have
to<00:00:09.389> do<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.599> with<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.750> loft<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.590> got<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.800> put

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
to do it with a loft and you got to put

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.900 
to do it with a loft and you got to put
threads<00:00:11.250> on<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.900> so<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.200> am<00:00:13.950> going<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.370> draw<00:00:14.580> on

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
threads on it so I am going to draw on

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.480 
threads on it so I am going to draw on
the<00:00:16.310> front<00:00:17.310> view<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.970> guess<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.140> fine<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:20.250> first

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the front view I guess is fine the first

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.650 
the front view I guess is fine the first
thing<00:00:20.670> I'm<00:00:20.789> going<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.330> I'm<00:00:21.480> going<00:00:21.510> to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.120 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
draw<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.260> little<00:00:23.220> disc<00:00:24.199> that<00:00:25.199> makes<00:00:25.830> up<00:00:26.099> part

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
draw that little disc that makes up part

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.310 
draw that little disc that makes up part
of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.550> head<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.150> thing<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
of the head of this thing and the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.410 
of the head of this thing and the
diameter<00:00:28.740> there<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:30.170> point<00:00:31.170> 4<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.949> 2<00:00:35.180> I'm<00:00:36.180> going

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
diameter there is point 4 to 2 I'm going

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.690 
diameter there is point 4 to 2 I'm going
to<00:00:36.480> finish<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.020> sketch<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.670> to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
to finish the sketch and I'm going to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.840 
to finish the sketch and I'm going to
extrude<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:42.110> point<00:00:43.110> 0<00:00:43.590> 3<00:00:43.710> 1<00:00:44.219> which<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.670> what

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
extrude that point 0 3 1 which is what

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.670 
extrude that point 0 3 1 which is what
it<00:00:44.969> tells<00:00:45.239> me<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.960> thickness<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.559> that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it tells me that the thickness of that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.049 
it tells me that the thickness of that
little<00:00:46.950> disc<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.870> now<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> disc

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
little disc is so now I have the disc

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.529 
little disc is so now I have the disc
and<00:00:51.590> now<00:00:52.590> I'm<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.039> do<00:00:53.219> plane<00:00:53.730> offset

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and now I'm going to do plane offset

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.840 
and now I'm going to do plane offset
from<00:00:54.750> plane<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.379> I'm<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> loft<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
from plane and I'm going to do a loft to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.650 
from plane and I'm going to do a loft to
create<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:59.010> smaller<00:00:59.370> circle<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.359> loft

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
create the smaller circle and then loft

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.880 
create the smaller circle and then loft
it<00:01:00.899> down<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.649> reason<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.039> guys<00:01:02.190> can't<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
it down the reason you guys can't do a

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.170 
it down the reason you guys can't do a
revolve<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> gives

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
revolve with this is because it gives

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
revolve with this is because it gives
you<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.570> those<00:01:06.689> weird<00:01:07.049> spherical<00:01:07.680> radii

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
you one of those weird spherical radii

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.880 
you one of those weird spherical radii
and<00:01:08.540> remember<00:01:09.540> that's<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.900> 3d<00:01:10.260> measurement<00:01:10.799> in

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and remember that's a 3d measurement in

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.120 
and remember that's a 3d measurement in
the<00:01:10.950> 2d<00:01:11.280> space<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:11.970> doesn't<00:01:12.330> work<00:01:12.570> right

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
the 2d space and it doesn't work right

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.530 
the 2d space and it doesn't work right
you<00:01:14.130> won't<00:01:14.310> get<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.580> perfect<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.360> need

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
you won't get it perfect and you need

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.270 
you won't get it perfect and you need
this<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.900> close<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.320> perfect<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:16.950> get

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
this as close to perfect as you can get

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.910 
this as close to perfect as you can get
so<00:01:17.310> your<00:01:17.640> wheels<00:01:17.820> fit<00:01:18.119> correctly<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.770> order

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
so your wheels fit correctly so in order

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.240 
so your wheels fit correctly so in order
to<00:01:20.070> figure<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.460> how<00:01:20.580> far<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.479> want<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.530> plane

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
to figure out how far I want that plane

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.570 
to figure out how far I want that plane
to<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.000> offset<00:01:24.509> from<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.860> height<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
to be offset from the height of the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.499 
to be offset from the height of the
entire<00:01:27.119> head<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:28.460> 0.125<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
entire head is 0.125 but I have to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.319 
entire head is 0.125 but I have to
subtract<00:01:30.990> out<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.259> point<00:01:31.860> zero<00:01:32.299> three<00:01:33.299> one

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
subtract out that point zero three one

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.530 
subtract out that point zero three one
that<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> have<00:01:34.170> already<00:01:34.200> created<00:01:35.270> I'm<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that I have already created I'm going to

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.539 
that I have already created I'm going to
tell<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.720> okay<00:01:37.170> I'm<00:01:37.470> gonna<00:01:37.680> put<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> sketch<00:01:38.250> on

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
tell it okay I'm gonna put a sketch on

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.140 
tell it okay I'm gonna put a sketch on
this<00:01:38.729> plane<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:40.729> I'm<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> draw<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
this plane and I'm going to draw a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.870 
this plane and I'm going to draw a
circle<00:01:45.380> I'm<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> project<00:01:46.799> geometry<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
circle I'm going to project geometry to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.730 
circle I'm going to project geometry to
make<00:01:48.030> sure<00:01:48.240> they're<00:01:48.450> concentric<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.530> click

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
make sure they're concentric so click

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.340 
make sure they're concentric so click
concentric<00:01:50.460> click<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.149> one<00:01:51.420> click<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.049> one

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
concentric click that one click this one

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.380 
concentric click that one click this one
they<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:54.020> dimension<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:56.490> dimension<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
they are dimension the dimension of the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:06.600 
they are dimension the dimension of the
smaller<00:01:57.750> circle<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.939> 0.25

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.010 

so<00:02:07.610> now<00:02:07.820> I'm<00:02:07.970> going<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.210> finish<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.750> sketch

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
so now I'm going to finish the sketch

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.470 
so now I'm going to finish the sketch
and<00:02:09.500> I'm<00:02:10.070> going<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.250> go<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.430> loft<00:02:10.760> notice<00:02:11.360> I

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
and I'm going to go to loft notice I

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.780 
and I'm going to go to loft notice I
only<00:02:11.630> have<00:02:11.900> one<00:02:12.230> sketch<00:02:12.620> right<00:02:12.980> now<00:02:13.190> but<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.520> can

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
only have one sketch right now but I can

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.180 
only have one sketch right now but I can
still<00:02:14.060> loft<00:02:14.330> because<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.840> have<00:02:15.140> an<00:02:15.650> edge<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:16.160> can

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
still loft because I have an edge I can

the outside of the circle so I'm gonna

and<00:04:25.069> the<00:04:26.030> way<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.389> know<00:04:26.539> the<00:04:26.870> diameter

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
and the way that I know the diameter

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.260 
and the way that I know the diameter
that<00:04:27.740> this<00:04:27.919> should<00:04:28.129> be<00:04:28.159> is<00:04:28.460> if<00:04:28.669> I<00:04:28.789> look<00:04:29.000> at<00:04:29.150> the

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
that this should be is if I look at the

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.659 
that this should be is if I look at the
thread<00:04:29.629> call-out<00:04:30.199> and<00:04:30.469> I<00:04:30.919> know<00:04:30.979> it's<00:04:31.310> threads

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
thread call-out and I know it's threads

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.100 
thread call-out and I know it's threads
because<00:04:32.000> not<00:04:32.360> only<00:04:32.389> does<00:04:32.659> it<00:04:32.689> look<00:04:32.840> like

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
because not only does it look like

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.260 
because not only does it look like
threads<00:04:33.439> because<00:04:33.620> it's<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.919> screw<00:04:34.219> but<00:04:35.000> because

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
threads because it's a screw but because

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.969 
threads because it's a screw but because
it<00:04:35.389> has<00:04:35.539> letters<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.199> remember<00:04:36.530> if<00:04:36.590> it<00:04:36.800> has

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
it has letters and remember if it has

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:37.420 
it has letters and remember if it has
letters

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430

it's<00:04:37.759> got<00:04:38.000> threads<00:04:38.360> on<00:04:38.539> it<00:04:38.719> somewhere<00:04:39.319> I<00:04:39.349> see

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
it's got threads on it somewhere I see

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.920 
it's got threads on it somewhere I see

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
quarter-inch - 20 UNC that means that

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.649 
quarter-inch - 20 UNC that means that
major<00:04:45.169> diameter<00:04:45.530> is<00:04:46.129> 0.25<00:04:47.000> which<00:04:47.479> is<00:04:47.629> a

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
quarter of an inch I'm gonna finish the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.730 
quarter of an inch I'm gonna finish the
sketch<00:04:50.659> and<00:04:51.610> I'm<00:04:52.610> going<00:04:52.789> to<00:04:52.879> extrude<00:04:53.419> the

sketch and I'm going to extrude the
distance<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:54.919> I'm<00:04:55.039> going<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.370> extrude<00:04:56.030> is

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
distance that I'm going to extrude is

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.020 
distance that I'm going to extrude is
one<00:04:57.139> because<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:57.800> tells<00:04:58.039> me<00:04:58.310> quarter<00:04:58.759> of<00:04:58.879> an

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
one because it tells me quarter of an

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.309 
one because it tells me quarter of an
inch<00:04:59.150> with<00:04:59.870> 20<00:05:00.770> pitch<00:05:01.120> unc<00:05:02.120> series<00:05:02.569> times<00:05:02.930> 1

inch with 20 pitch unc series times 1

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.600 
inch with 20 pitch unc series times 1
inch<00:05:04.330> that's<00:05:05.330> where<00:05:05.569> that<00:05:05.690> comes<00:05:05.990> from

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
inch that's where that comes from

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.260 
inch that's where that comes from
i'm<00:05:07.610> gonna<00:05:07.729> tell<00:05:07.940> it<00:05:08.090> okay<00:05:08.569> and<00:05:09.909> now<00:05:10.909> i<00:05:10.969> have<00:05:11.090> to

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
i'm gonna tell it okay and now i have to

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.510 
i'm gonna tell it okay and now i have to
put<00:05:11.479> the<00:05:11.900> threads<00:05:12.259> on<00:05:12.529> here<00:05:12.889> so<00:05:13.129> I'm<00:05:13.250> gonna<00:05:13.340> go

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
put the threads on here so I'm gonna go

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.709 
put the threads on here so I'm gonna go
to<00:05:13.580> thread<00:05:14.379> and<00:05:15.699> I'm<00:05:16.699> going<00:05:16.819> to<00:05:16.909> turn<00:05:17.090> off<00:05:17.150> full

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:19.209 
to thread and I'm going to turn off full
length<00:05:17.990> because<00:05:18.409> it<00:05:18.590> tells<00:05:18.800> me<00:05:18.979> it's<00:05:19.129> a

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
length because it tells me it's a

length because it tells me it's a
quarter<00:05:19.610> inch<00:05:19.789> offset<00:05:20.120> I<00:05:20.719> want<00:05:21.349> the<00:05:21.529> threads

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
quarter inch offset I want the threads

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.390 
quarter inch offset I want the threads
