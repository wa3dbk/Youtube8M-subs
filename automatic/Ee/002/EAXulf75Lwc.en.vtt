00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
hearing kids comments and it's really

weeks and my next appointment with her
isn't<00:03:08.770> until<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.550> think<00:03:10.390> two<00:03:10.630> weeks<00:03:10.780> from<00:03:11.050> now

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230

and so that's hard um I'd let I'd love
to<00:03:17.830> find<00:03:18.070> a<00:03:18.250> therapist<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.940> can<00:03:19.180> see<00:03:19.390> me

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
to find a therapist that can see me

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.800 
to find a therapist that can see me
after<00:03:19.930> work<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.640> like<00:03:21.640> 22<00:03:22.300> times<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.660> week

after work and like 22 times a week

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.720 
after work and like 22 times a week

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
because it doesn't seem like I'm getting

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.490 
because it doesn't seem like I'm getting
to<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.150> core<00:03:25.360> issues<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.959> just<00:03:25.990> seems<00:03:26.350> like

to the core issues it just seems like

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.290 
to the core issues it just seems like
I'm<00:03:26.709> kind<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:27.070> going<00:03:27.520> through<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.850> motions

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.840 
I'm kind of going through the motions
and<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.950> that's<00:03:30.070> going<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.400> be<00:03:30.520> one<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:30.700> my
