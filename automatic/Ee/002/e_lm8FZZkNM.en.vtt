00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 girls hello everyone today i want 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.930
 share with you one of the ways how 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.639
 you can wind your hair with 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.650
 conventional ironing rectifier 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.110
 so if you're interested then 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.089
 stay with me i'm actually 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.510
 I often use the iron 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.550
 just use it to 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.240
 curl my hair I always did everything 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.730
 on one form that is, we take a strand 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.010
 we clamp with tongs we turn and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.529
 it turns out that the tip is down below and we 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.960
 This is how we perform hair 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.600
 we are spinning today I want you 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.850
 show a slightly different option and know 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.700
 I like him a lot more because 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.300
 that curls are obtained along the entire length for 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:51.480
 First, I will divide the hair into sections I 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.120
 so much easier to do styling and all 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.070
 too much I'll be stabbed like that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.790
 themselves often use a hairdresser 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.930
 divide into two 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.540
 Topic 2 braids 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.940
 fix turn the iron 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.500
 And here is the way that the end looked at us 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.960
 up and slowly spend outside 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.570
 the slower you do it those 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.210
 better curl twist if you 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.640
 hold quickly then naturally curl 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.890
 it will turn out less twisted what you 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.240
 see it don't burn hair it 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:33.090
 moisture evaporates so goes such porn 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.259
 Sorry it's a pity that so much 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.229
 moisture 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.320
 evaporates from the hair but when styled 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:45.170
 ironing this can not be avoided see what 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.170
 logan turned out just brilliant 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.320
 what else did I tell you about the hair 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.110
 that hair is twisted all 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.869
 not 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.560
 beauty take the next strand 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.560
 we clamp with tongs 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:14.650
 turn the end to look up and 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:19.140
 quietly omit the slower 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.140
 we lower the stronger curl 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:41.040
 among which loses it turns out cool 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:46.200
 Now we will turn the next part 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.540
 hair is separated and half the extra 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.819
 we remove 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.069
 sharing the hair that is already screwed 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.670
 hair that needs to be twisted 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.480
 from 1 st 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.480
 same thing 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.470
 much more convenient 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.209
 and I will do absolutely the same thing 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.209
 we clamp 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:18.569
 turn and quietly lead down 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.230
 Of course, to make this styling 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:27.099
 need to spend a lot of time 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.620
 so if you are in a hurry then you will not quickly 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.760
 It will usually turn on hair styling 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.239
 never mind 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.090
 lining her hair or curling me 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.139
 leaves about well for about half an hour 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:44.109
 just because my hair is long 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:47.160
 It requires a lot of attention and time you have 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.730
 in secret short time 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.970
 I'll fight but now the third part 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.180
 my hair and i lean them forward 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.730
 to give a little window space I 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.650
 I'll twist my hair like that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:11.970
 take a look in the middle 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:14.300
 separate strand doing all the same 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.300
 procedure 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:31.620
 and now ready strand I rest immediately 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:33.690
 so back i will 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.320
 Absolutely with all the hair that 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.740
 I stayed apart from bangs so I take 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.740
 this zone 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.380
 5 hair 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.370
 as you can see it came to the bangs she 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.380
 I am long by this method is not a bang 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.720
 I will not curl because it turns out 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.890
 honestly raised not very nice and 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.500
 here is a bang I will do as I do it usually 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.340
 I divide the bangs on 2 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.340
 halves 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:22.710
 one half smaller the other bigger 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.710
 I take a strand iron 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.750
 killing is cranking away from the face and on 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.230
 throughout 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.230
 bangs 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:39.719
 and here is the result 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.719
 then I neatly fingers 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.410
 I walk along the bangs putting it in that 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.690
 I like the side that I want 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:54.580
 principle, that's what happens now the same 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:06:01.229
 I will do the same from this side 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.229
 and sprinkled the whole thing a little bit varnish 

00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:09.769
 girls i hope you liked it
