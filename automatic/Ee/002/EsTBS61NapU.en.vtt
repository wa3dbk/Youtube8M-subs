00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
think of kind of like a Nightwing and

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.960 
think of kind of like a Nightwing and
pretty<00:02:35.630> much<00:02:36.160> look<00:02:37.160> at<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:37.370> that's<00:02:37.790> what<00:02:37.940> I

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
pretty much look at this that's what I

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.570 
pretty much look at this that's what I
was<00:02:38.090> trying<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.360> yeah<00:02:38.600> there<00:02:38.840> we<00:02:38.900> go<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.580> think

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
was trying to yeah there we go I think

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.540 
was trying to yeah there we go I think
of<00:02:40.670> Nightwing<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.300> think<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:42.430> what<00:02:43.430> he

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
of Nightwing and I think of what he

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.190 
of Nightwing and I think of what he
called<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.880> rain<00:02:44.180> for<00:02:44.450> more<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.690> come<00:02:44.720> back<00:02:45.020> if
