00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
mix go scared about it blowing up top

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.089 
mix go scared about it blowing up top
has<00:03:12.019> been<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:15.260> makes<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.620> lot<00:03:15.709> easier<00:03:16.069> for

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
has been it makes it a lot easier for

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.530 
has been it makes it a lot easier for
dropping<00:03:16.459> cans<00:03:16.639> of<00:03:16.790> coconut<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.209> saw<00:03:17.359> in<00:03:17.480> the

dropping cans of coconut you saw in the
video<00:03:17.629> that's<00:03:18.620> still<00:03:18.920> it's<00:03:19.040> gonna<00:03:19.159> this<00:03:19.340> is

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
video that's still it's gonna this is

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:32.319 
video that's still it's gonna this is
not<00:03:19.609> going<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.760> be<00:03:19.849> filled<00:03:23.590> in<00:03:24.590> later<00:03:26.290> now<00:03:31.329> you

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
not going to be filled in later now you

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.470 
not going to be filled in later now you
see<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.629> flaking<00:03:33.099> going<00:03:34.099> on<00:03:34.329> as<00:03:35.329> the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
see the flaking going on as the

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:56.680 
see the flaking going on as the
temperatures<00:03:35.930> are<00:03:36.049> so<00:03:36.410> hot<00:03:36.680> on<00:03:36.769> my<00:03:55.690> there's

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
temperatures are so hot on my there's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.009 
temperatures are so hot on my there's
the<00:03:56.780> results<00:03:57.169> of<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.379> castings<00:03:57.829> so<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.930> was

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
the results of the castings so that was

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.219 
the results of the castings so that was
the<00:04:00.109> very<00:04:00.230> first<00:04:00.349> one<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:02.060> round<00:04:02.299> disc<00:04:02.629> more

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:03.229 
the very first one the round disc more

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.699 
the very first one the round disc more
than<00:04:03.379> that<00:04:04.840> then<00:04:05.840> I've<00:04:05.989> got<00:04:06.199> casting<00:04:06.620> the

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
than that then I've got casting the

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.860 
than that then I've got casting the
skull<00:04:08.709> got<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:10.579> first<00:04:10.879> one<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.150> total<00:04:11.569> failure

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
skull got the first one a total failure

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.939 
skull got the first one a total failure
I<00:04:12.049> think<00:04:12.079> it<00:04:12.319> was<00:04:12.409> this<00:04:12.530> one

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:12.949 
I think it was this one

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.369 
I think it was this one
so<00:04:13.849> I<00:04:13.909> basically<00:04:14.090> ended<00:04:14.389> up<00:04:14.479> with<00:04:14.599> a<00:04:14.629> cam<00:04:14.989> of

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
so I basically ended up with a cam of

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.689 
so I basically ended up with a cam of
aluminium<00:04:15.909> response<00:04:16.909> at<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.150> bottom<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:17.449> it

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
aluminium response at the bottom of it

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.390 
aluminium response at the bottom of it
that's<00:04:19.699> probably<00:04:20.060> down<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.449> Sam<00:04:20.690> lobbying

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
that's probably down to the Sam lobbying

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.219 
that's probably down to the Sam lobbying
mixed<00:04:22.400> with<00:04:22.490> bentonite<00:04:23.060> being<00:04:23.479> green<00:04:23.720> salmon

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
mixed with bentonite being green salmon

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.860 
mixed with bentonite being green salmon
there's<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.530> second<00:04:24.919> one<00:04:25.330> with<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.360> partial

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
there's the second one with a partial

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.689 
there's the second one with a partial
one<00:04:27.409> on<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.710> watched<00:04:27.979> a<00:04:28.159> few<00:04:28.310> more<00:04:28.490> videos

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
one on that watched a few more videos

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
cams a fair bit of aluminium has ended

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.960 
cams a fair bit of aluminium has ended
up<00:04:39.830> with<00:04:39.949> some
