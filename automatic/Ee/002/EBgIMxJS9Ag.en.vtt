00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
actually smaller it is a lot softer on

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.540 
actually smaller it is a lot softer on
your<00:00:39.600> gums<00:00:39.809> when<00:00:40.379> using<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> hard<00:00:41.010> bristle<00:00:41.430> i

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
your gums when using a hard bristle i

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.340 
your gums when using a hard bristle i
feel<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.210> destroys<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:42.930> gums<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
feel like it really destroys my gums and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.410 
feel like it really destroys my gums and
sometimes<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:43.950> i<00:00:44.040> brush<00:00:44.430> more<00:00:45.000> than<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.210> minute

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
sometimes if i brush more than a minute

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.990 
sometimes if i brush more than a minute
or<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.870> i'll<00:00:46.050> start<00:00:46.350> bleeding<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.550> i<00:00:47.610> started

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
or so i'll start bleeding so i started

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.270 
or so i'll start bleeding so i started
using<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.420> soft-bristled<00:00:48.930> toothbrush<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.980> i

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
using a soft-bristled toothbrush and i

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.770 
using a soft-bristled toothbrush and i
actually<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.789> better<00:00:51.120> because<00:00:51.629> it's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
actually like that better because it's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.750 
actually like that better because it's
easy<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.110> my<00:00:52.320> guns<00:00:52.559> i<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:53.010> brush<00:00:53.219> longer

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
easy on my guns i can brush longer

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
easy on my guns i can brush longer
without<00:00:54.030> becoming<00:00:54.239> irritated<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.260> maybe

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
without becoming irritated and maybe

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.310 
without becoming irritated and maybe
this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.610> me<00:00:56.940> overthinking<00:00:57.780> things<00:00:57.840> but

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
this is just me overthinking things but

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.869 
this is just me overthinking things but
i<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> bristles<00:00:59.190> are<00:00:59.280> smaller<00:00:59.609> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
i think if the bristles are smaller it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.490 
i think if the bristles are smaller it
can<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.120> into<00:01:00.539> between<00:01:00.840> my<00:01:01.050> teeth<00:01:01.109> better

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
can get into between my teeth better

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.799 
can get into between my teeth better
maybe<00:01:02.309> not<00:01:02.579> maybe<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.149> not<00:01:03.300> true<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.690> i

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
maybe not maybe it's not true but i

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.539 
maybe not maybe it's not true but i
really<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> soft-bristled<00:01:05.010> toothbrush

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
really like a soft-bristled toothbrush

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.219 
really like a soft-bristled toothbrush
as<00:01:05.700> opposed<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.180> hard<00:01:06.450> bristle<00:01:06.810> toothbrush

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
as opposed to a hard bristle toothbrush

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.170 
as opposed to a hard bristle toothbrush
just<00:01:07.470> because<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.130> better<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.430> your<00:01:08.640> gums<00:01:08.850> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
just because it's better on your gums it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.510 
just because it's better on your gums it
feels<00:01:09.510> better<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:10.979> easier<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.310> me<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
feels better and it's easier for me to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.670 
feels better and it's easier for me to
brush<00:01:11.760> longer<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.409> guys<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.650> looking

every toothpaste you know why because I

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.830 
every toothpaste you know why because I
mean<00:01:49.979> heck<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.549> could<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.030> put<00:01:51.180> water<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.509> this

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
mean heck I could just put water on this

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.899 
mean heck I could just put water on this
and<00:01:52.020> say<00:01:52.140> oh<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.680> waters<00:01:52.860> whitening<00:01:53.520> because

if I brush with water my teeth will be
wider<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.390> because<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.780> toothpaste

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
wider so just because the toothpaste

wider so just because the toothpaste
says<00:01:58.710> whitening<00:01:59.280> doesn't<00:01:59.880> actually<00:02:00.090> mean

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.020 
drugstore and I will shove it into the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
toothpaste so it gets wet and then i'll

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.699 
toothpaste so it gets wet and then i'll
shove<00:02:43.299> it<00:02:43.420> into<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.750> thing<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:43.989> baking<00:02:44.349> soda<00:02:44.379> and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
because I feel like it gives the whitest

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.699 
because I feel like it gives the whitest
clean<00:02:48.669> and<00:02:48.879> it<00:02:49.030> does<00:02:49.239> taste<00:02:49.569> kind<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:50.019> gross<00:02:50.230> do

clean and it does taste kind of gross do
not<00:02:50.859> swallow<00:02:51.159> it<00:02:51.430> but<00:02:51.939> you<00:02:52.030> just<00:02:52.060> brush<00:02:52.540> that

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.569 
not swallow it but you just brush that
and<00:02:53.049> it's<00:02:53.409> kind<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.650> an<00:02:53.739> old<00:02:53.889> wives<00:02:54.069> tale<00:02:54.280> but

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
and it's kind of an old wives tale but

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.059 
and it's kind of an old wives tale but
it<00:02:54.700> works<00:02:55.030> baking<00:02:55.930> soda<00:02:55.959> whitens<00:02:56.859> your<00:02:56.950> teeth
