Hi people, I'm Tary from team Urban Sense.

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:15.131
I would like to explain how to do BACK FLIP today and how to get rid of the fear of him.

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:29.730
Before we get to the actual technique, I would like to help you with fear.

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:35.958
Back flip is the hardest flip to fear from basic flips.

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:42.260
Is very difficult to try first.

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:45.940
It is the turning point, if you try it once and you're not afraid...

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.771
...if the first attempt won't be a crash.

00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:56.149
Then you are more afraid to try again.

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:00.983
The first attempt must be full.

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:05.223
You may not be in the air frightened or think about it.

00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:11.068
I personally learned the back flip in the sand.

00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:14.122
I bounced from sand and landed to the sand.

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:18.717
Because I could not hit in the head...

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.820
...if I bounced from concrete wall I can hit my head.

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:29.892
Sometimes it may happen that instead of bounce behind you, bounce up and then is crash.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.462
I suggest you to bounce from something low.

00:01:36.178 --> 00:01:38.307
Learn it on level ground for example.

00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:41.011
There are several ways you can overcome fear of BF.

00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:42.795
...on trampolines...water...

00:01:44.183 --> 00:01:47.107
...foam pit...sand.

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:51.295
I suggest you first trampoline.

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:55.830
If you fall on the trampoline at your head, nothing happens.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:00.588
Foam pit is great, but not all have access.

00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:07.364
After a trampoline you could possibly go on the sand.

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:12.853
The first attempt will be super if someone will insure you.

00:02:13.252 --> 00:02:16.272
If you fall on your head, and someone turns you around.

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:19.526
Here, however, you have to trust that person.

00:02:19.604 --> 00:02:21.840
You should not worry so much.

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:24.822
Because you know that there is someone there.

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:28.745
Now it may be fully...

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:30.666
...when you accidentally wrong, nothing happens.

00:02:33.144 --> 00:02:36.582
Bounce from the front of the feet - toes.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.896
This part of the...

00:02:39.516 --> 00:02:42.071
Landing is also on the front of the feet.

00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:48.746
Does not land on your heels and did not bounce on them.

00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:53.801
Go to the bent knee during your bounce.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.150
On your toes.

00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:58.857
Your arms are in front ready to swing.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.789
...bend the knnes...

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:04.760
...put your arms back.

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:11.818
Swing your arms while the rebound from the knees bent knees.

00:03:12.223 --> 00:03:14.082
This is how the movement.

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.702
Put your arms back and than ready to swing with them up.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.083
Bounce from the knees of toes.

00:03:29.515 --> 00:03:35.711
Now I will show you how it should look like, look mainly on my legs.

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:46.708
Tuck in.

00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:49.105
Grab your knees with your hands.

00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:50.623
Like this.

00:03:51.862 --> 00:03:53.503
For both legs.

00:03:55.872 --> 00:04:00.146
In the air, you must put your knees to your chest.

00:04:00.704 --> 00:04:03.956
Never do this backwards, because you'll have low high.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:06.544
Bye.
