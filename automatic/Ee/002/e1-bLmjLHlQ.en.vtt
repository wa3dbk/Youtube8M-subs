00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:20.750
 I drove home with my brand new TV standing behind 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.622
 in my F-150, when a motorist took me to the 

00:00:25.622 --> 00:00:30.068
 can of the road called. 

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:33.690
 Armed with pistols and an angry glow, she was the woman 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.984
 of my dreams. 

00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:41.904
 On the way to a con, dressed in Lara Croft cosplay, car trouble 

00:00:41.904 --> 00:00:47.295
 causing delays, help needed when a cowboy 

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:54.470
 stopped in front of me, with a forty-liter hat and a 60-inch 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.068
 screen, he was the man of my dreams. 

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:05.490
 Gamer Girl, Country Boy, hoping that our love will survive. 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.936
 Couldn't let you go even though we were out 

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:12.406
 different lives. 

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:16.358
 So when you search for love, open your eyes. 

00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:19.816
 It can be out of your normal sight. 

00:01:19.816 --> 00:01:24.756
 Remember, Gamer Girls and Country Boys are okay. 

00:01:31.064 --> 00:01:34.820
 Never thought a guy without a console, no 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.923
 Twitter account and that talks with an accent, my head could 

00:01:38.923 --> 00:01:41.869
 I have never fallen on newbs. 

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:51.954
 His password is "abc123" but he is the one for me. 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.606
 Well, I don't understand why she likes to wear eleven ears, 

00:01:55.606 --> 00:01:59.312
 MMORGP, that doesn't mean anything to me. 

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:01.610
 She likes to watch sci-fi. 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.810
 I? 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.370
 I'm an Eastwood man. 

00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:11.187
 The sound of a honky tonk makes her scream, but she 

00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:13.682
 is that one for me. 

00:02:14.014 --> 00:02:20.169
 Gamer Girl, Country Boy, hoping that our love will survive. 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:25.159
 Couldn't let you go even though we were out 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.155
 different lives. 

00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:31.147
 So when you search for love, open your eyes. 

00:02:31.147 --> 00:02:34.640
 It can be out of your normal sight. 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.626
 Remember, Gamer Girls and Country Boys are okay. 

00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:45.360
 My mother's brisket is the best. 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.818
 That's okay, I can only warm up. 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.770
 I never miss an Ole Miss game. 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.228
 That's OK, I'll go to the arcade. 

00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:59.192
 Some may find it strange. 

00:02:59.192 --> 00:03:02.650
 But there is nothing about you that I would change. 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.000
 One thing we both want: 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.730
 Getting married at the shooting range! 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.630
 Gamer Girl, Country Boy, many ask us why. 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.930
 Two of us, made for each other, didn't think it would work. 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.130
 So when you search for love, open your eyes. 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.130
 It can be out of your normal sight. 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.530
 Remember, Gamer Girls and Country Boys, Gamer Girls and 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.330
 those Country Boys. 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.430
 Remember, Gamer Girls and Country Boys are okay.
