more earlier reveals pokemon and people
were<00:00:21.570> speculating<00:00:21.810> at<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.380> time<00:00:22.560> because<00:00:22.740> i

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
were speculating at that time because i

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.679 
were speculating at that time because i
don't<00:00:23.100> believe<00:00:23.340> very<00:00:23.970> type<00:00:24.330> had<00:00:24.570> been

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
don't believe very type had been

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.050 
don't believe very type had been
revealed<00:00:25.080> by<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.439> point<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:26.310> there<00:00:26.970> was

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
revealed by that point that there was

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.480 
revealed by that point that there was
going<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> new<00:00:27.510> type<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.380> sound<00:00:29.160> was

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
going to be a new type and sound was

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.950 
going to be a new type and sound was
kind<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.730> thrown<00:00:29.910> around<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.390> an<00:00:30.480> idea<00:00:30.750> that

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
kind of thrown around as an idea that

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.420 
kind of thrown around as an idea that
people<00:00:31.019> think<00:00:31.289> maybe<00:00:31.500> sound<00:00:31.859> would<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> new

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
people think maybe sound would be a new

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.760 
people think maybe sound would be a new
type<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.910> no<00:00:33.390> van<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.930> certainly<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> poster

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
type and no van was certainly the poster

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.100 
type and no van was certainly the poster
child<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.570> unfortunately<00:00:36.570> will<00:00:36.870> found

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
child for that unfortunately will found

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840 
child for that unfortunately will found
out<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.590> was<00:00:37.620> part<00:00:38.070> flying<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.489> dragon

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
out that it was part flying and dragon

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.150 
out that it was part flying and dragon
and<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.629> no<00:00:39.899> sound<00:00:40.260> type<00:00:40.530> attributed

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.400 
and there was no sound type attributed
kind<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.850> killed<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.870> speculation

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
kind of killed all of that speculation

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.290 
kind of killed all of that speculation
but<00:00:43.829> enough<00:00:44.550> about<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.789> let's<00:00:45.090> talk<00:00:45.149> about

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
but enough about that let's talk about

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.549 
but enough about that let's talk about
us<00:00:45.450> look<00:00:45.719> that's<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.289> looks

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
us look that's what it what it looks

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.900 
us look that's what it what it looks
like<00:00:47.120> it<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:49.200> really<00:00:49.860> my<00:00:49.890> favorite<00:00:50.340> design

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
like it is not really my favorite design

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.170 
like it is not really my favorite design
i<00:00:51.350> am<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> huge<00:00:52.770> fan<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.120> those

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
i am not a huge fan of it's one of those

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.799 
i am not a huge fan of it's one of those
dragons<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.350> Dragon<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> degree<00:00:57.480> like

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
dragons like Dragon to a degree like

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.220 
dragons like Dragon to a degree like
Haxorus<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> don't<00:00:59.329> feel<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.510> design<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
Haxorus that I don't feel the design is

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.500 
Haxorus that I don't feel the design is
something<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:01.949> hits<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> spot<00:01:03.090> for

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
something that really hits the spot for

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.140 
something that really hits the spot for
me<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.870> know<00:01:03.899> I'm<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.470> too<00:01:05.100> excited<00:01:05.400> about<00:01:05.820> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
me you know I'm not too excited about it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.560 
me you know I'm not too excited about it
it's<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.659> weird<00:01:06.720> arm<00:01:08.000> core<00:01:09.000> shape

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it's just got this weird arm core shape

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.710 
it's just got this weird arm core shape
which<00:01:09.900> goes<00:01:10.229> into<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.680> wing<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:12.210> just

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
which goes into the wing and it's just

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.499 
which goes into the wing and it's just
that<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.650> big<00:01:14.340> sound<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> top

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that there is big sound is at the top

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.600 
that there is big sound is at the top
it's<00:01:15.810> very<00:01:16.020> confusing<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.100> where<00:01:17.369> its

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it's very confusing in like where its

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.149 
it's very confusing in like where its
eyes<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.479> snows<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.799> kind

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
eyes what is it snows like it's a kind

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.910 
eyes what is it snows like it's a kind
of<00:01:20.189> misleading<00:01:20.880> design<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> feel<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.560> way

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
of misleading design I feel in that way

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.460 
of misleading design I feel in that way
and<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.549> don't<00:01:23.909> really<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.420> things<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.320> are

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and I don't really like things that are

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.859 
and I don't really like things that are
designed<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
designed like that so what do you know I

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.410 
designed like that so what do you know I
am<00:01:28.409> NOT<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> big<00:01:29.040> fan<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.579> guess<00:01:30.060> there<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.390> some

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420

am NOT a big fan I guess there are some
people<00:01:30.689> who<00:01:30.900> are<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.369> are<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.700> of

move<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.930> mechanics<00:01:43.439> let's<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
move on to the mechanics let's do that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.210 
move on to the mechanics let's do that
now<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> am<00:01:45.960> fully<00:01:46.200> aware<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.710> fact<00:01:47.040> that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
now I am fully aware of the fact that

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760 
now I am fully aware of the fact that
leaks<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.970> happened<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.409> there<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.740> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
leaks have happened and that there is a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.679 
leaks have happened and that there is a
lot<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> information<00:01:50.820> out<00:01:50.939> there<00:01:51.000> about<00:01:51.210> new

Pokemon right now no stats and stuff and

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.410 
Pokemon right now no stats and stuff and
move<00:01:54.630> pull<00:01:54.899> everything<00:01:55.820> but<00:01:56.820> I'm<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.299> going

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
move pull everything but I'm not going

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.520 
move pull everything but I'm not going
to<00:01:57.509> discuss<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.810> I'm<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> talk

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
to discuss this I'm not going to talk

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.810 
to discuss this I'm not going to talk
about<00:01:58.680> any<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> leaks<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.670> don't

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
about any of the leaks because I don't

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.670 
about any of the leaks because I don't
think<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.149> kind<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.450> appropriate<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.229> until

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
think it's kind of appropriate to until

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.469 
think it's kind of appropriate to until
the<00:02:01.740> game<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:01.920> fully<00:02:02.219> released<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.060> I'm<00:02:03.329> just

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
the game is fully released so I'm just

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.120 
the game is fully released so I'm just
going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> go<00:02:03.750> off<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.350> knowledge<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.770> we

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
going to go off the knowledge that we

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.719 
going to go off the knowledge that we
had<00:02:05.399> prior<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.119> any<00:02:06.390> leaks<00:02:06.719> prior<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.380> anything

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
had prior to any leaks prior to anything

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
had prior to any leaks prior to anything
apart<00:02:08.729> from<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.270> ability<00:02:09.750> which<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.229> did<00:02:10.410> kind

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
apart from the ability which I did kind

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.930 
apart from the ability which I did kind
of<00:02:10.679> look<00:02:10.739> into

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
of look into

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.780 
of look into
I<00:02:11.970> was<00:02:12.210> kind<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:13.380> sure<00:02:13.860> as<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.280> whether

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
I was kind of not sure as to whether

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.670 
I was kind of not sure as to whether
this<00:02:15.180> was<00:02:15.450> true<00:02:15.870> because<00:02:16.080> there's<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.500> only

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
this was true because there's like only

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.770 
this was true because there's like only
one<00:02:16.980> screenshot<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.880> I'm<00:02:18.150> not<00:02:18.300> sure<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.660> it's

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
one screenshot and I'm not sure if it's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.020 
one screenshot and I'm not sure if it's
been<00:02:19.020> doctored<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.500> whatever<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
been doctored or whatever but the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.270 
been doctored or whatever but the
ability<00:02:21.210> is<00:02:21.510> apparently<00:02:22.020> frisk<00:02:22.410> I'm<00:02:22.860> not<00:02:23.070> sure

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
ability is apparently frisk I'm not sure

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.910 
ability is apparently frisk I'm not sure
if<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.600> case<00:02:24.630> but<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.350> all<00:02:25.470> honesty

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
if that is the case but in all honesty

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.110 
if that is the case but in all honesty
when<00:02:26.070> we're<00:02:26.220> talking<00:02:26.310> about<00:02:26.490> competitive

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
when we're talking about competitive

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.020 
when we're talking about competitive
it's<00:02:27.600> not<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.870> huge<00:02:28.230> deal<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.740> has<00:02:28.950> its<00:02:29.190> uses<00:02:29.430> its

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
it's not a huge deal it has its uses its

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.570 
it's not a huge deal it has its uses its
niche<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.290> somewhat<00:02:31.680> useful<00:02:31.920> to

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
niche this can be somewhat useful to

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.580 
niche this can be somewhat useful to
determine<00:02:33.120> specific<00:02:33.660> items<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.230> everything

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
determine specific items and everything

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.890 
determine specific items and everything
but<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.850> wouldn't<00:02:36.510> say<00:02:36.540> it's<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> best

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
but I wouldn't say it's the best

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.080 
but I wouldn't say it's the best
competitive<00:02:37.230> ability<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.370> even<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.030> is

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
competitive ability so even if it is

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.300 
competitive ability so even if it is
true<00:02:39.270> whatever<00:02:40.020> we're<00:02:40.530> not<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.040> caring

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
true whatever we're not really caring

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.650 
true whatever we're not really caring
about<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> hope<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.030> has<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.210> secondary

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
about it I hope it has the secondary

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.910 
about it I hope it has the secondary
ability<00:02:43.080> probably<00:02:43.710> something<00:02:43.890> like

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
ability probably something like

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.920 
ability probably something like
soundproof<00:02:44.520> would<00:02:44.730> be<00:02:44.910> appropriate<00:02:45.450> but

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
soundproof would be appropriate but

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.810 
soundproof would be appropriate but
let's<00:02:46.500> talk<00:02:46.590> about<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:46.890> typing<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.460> typing

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
let's talk about it's typing it's typing

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.180 
let's talk about it's typing it's typing
is<00:02:48.090> very<00:02:48.480> traditional<00:02:49.410> when<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.830> comes<00:02:50.070> to

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
is very traditional when it comes to

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.220 
is very traditional when it comes to
dragons<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.940> course<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.240> Dragonite<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
dragons you of course have Dragonite and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.400 
dragons you of course have Dragonite and
salamence<00:02:53.090> altaria<00:02:54.090> lots<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.870> things<00:02:55.110> which

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
salamence altaria lots of things which

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.980 
salamence altaria lots of things which
just<00:02:56.100> follow<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.550> model<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.970> flying<00:02:57.330> dragon

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
just follow the model of flying dragon

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.740 
just follow the model of flying dragon
it<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.350> unfortunately<00:02:59.040> even<00:02:59.640> more<00:03:00.150> nerf<00:03:00.480> to

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
it is unfortunately even more nerf to

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.090 
it is unfortunately even more nerf to
this<00:03:00.900> generation<00:03:01.350> with<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.800> fact<00:03:01.980> that

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
this generation with the fact that

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.950 
this generation with the fact that
Dragon<00:03:02.520> has<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.850> additional<00:03:03.060> weakness<00:03:03.780> or

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
Dragon has the additional weakness or

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.440 
Dragon has the additional weakness or
ferry<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.890> not<00:03:04.980> only<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.490> weak<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.000> itself

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
ferry so not only is it weak to itself

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.520 
ferry so not only is it weak to itself
its<00:03:06.840> weak<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.410> ice<00:03:08.150> times<00:03:09.150> for<00:03:09.540> that's<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.320> big

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
its weak to ice times for that's the big

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.170 
its weak to ice times for that's the big
kicker<00:03:11.040> that's<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.400> one<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.640> really<00:03:11.790> screws

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
kicker that's the one that really screws

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.420 
kicker that's the one that really screws
over<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> lot<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.840> dragons<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:14.010> course<00:03:14.040> now

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
over a lot of dragons and of course now

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.690 
over a lot of dragons and of course now
ferry<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.330> it's<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:17.340> little<00:03:17.580> bit

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
ferry so it's a and a little bit

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.370 
ferry so it's a and a little bit
annoying<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.570> is<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.840> case<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.200> it's<00:03:19.350> a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
annoying that it is the case and it's a

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.440 
annoying that it is the case and it's a
flying<00:03:19.590> dragon<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.160> would<00:03:20.400> have<00:03:20.489> liked<00:03:20.730> them<00:03:21.150> to

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
flying dragon I would have liked them to

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.400 
flying dragon I would have liked them to
do<00:03:21.630> something<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.930> bit<00:03:22.050> more<00:03:22.110> interesting

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
do something a bit more interesting

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.920 
do something a bit more interesting
especially<00:03:22.820> given<00:03:23.820> its<00:03:23.880> design<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.390> given

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
especially given its design and given

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.449 
especially given its design and given
the<00:03:24.989> fact<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.739> looks<00:03:25.800> like<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.340> could

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
the fact that it looks like it could

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.490 
the fact that it looks like it could
maybe<00:03:26.610> be<00:03:26.940> hott<00:03:27.420> Dogg<00:03:27.720> be<00:03:28.020> another<00:03:28.230> Dark

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
maybe be hott Dogg be another Dark

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.310 
maybe be hott Dogg be another Dark
Dragon<00:03:28.770> like<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.160> drag<00:03:29.400> on<00:03:29.550> or<00:03:29.670> something<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.930> I

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
Dragon like I drag on or something it I

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.750 
Dragon like I drag on or something it I
think<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.890> would<00:03:32.010> have<00:03:32.100> been<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.280> lot<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.670> lot

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
think that would have been a lot a lot

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.760 
think that would have been a lot a lot
cooler<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:33.420> that's<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.140> case<00:03:34.320> we<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.739> a

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
cooler but that's the case we have a

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.190 
cooler but that's the case we have a
flying<00:03:35.040> dragon<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.670> guess<00:03:36.180> we<00:03:36.870> have<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.020> live

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
flying dragon I guess we have to live

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.410 
flying dragon I guess we have to live
with<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:37.950> earlier<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.489> talked<00:03:38.820> about<00:03:38.940> how

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
with it so earlier I talked about how

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.540 
with it so earlier I talked about how
people<00:03:39.780> were<00:03:40.050> speculating<00:03:40.260> maybe<00:03:40.830> know<00:03:41.220> even

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
people were speculating maybe know even

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.910 
people were speculating maybe know even
would<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:41.880> some<00:03:42.090> new<00:03:42.209> kind<00:03:42.330> of<00:03:42.450> sound<00:03:42.750> type<00:03:43.110> and

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
would be some new kind of sound type and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.650 
would be some new kind of sound type and
then<00:03:44.220> there<00:03:44.519> was<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:44.670> move<00:03:44.970> boom<00:03:45.330> burst

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
then there was that move boom burst

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.780 
then there was that move boom burst
which<00:03:46.019> people<00:03:46.709> for<00:03:46.890> hey<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:47.340> could<00:03:47.489> be<00:03:47.670> like

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
which people for hey this could be like

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.790 
which people for hey this could be like
the<00:03:47.940> sound<00:03:48.150> type<00:03:48.360> move<00:03:48.570> not<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.620> case

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
the sound type move not the case

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.740 
the sound type move not the case
unfortunately<00:03:50.250> boom<00:03:50.820> versus<00:03:51.300> in<00:03:51.420> fact<00:03:51.630> a

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
unfortunately boom versus in fact a

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.900 
unfortunately boom versus in fact a
normal<00:03:52.290> type<00:03:52.530> move<00:03:52.800> meaning<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.400> doesn't<00:03:53.430> even

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
normal type move meaning it doesn't even

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.460 
normal type move meaning it doesn't even
get<00:03:54.090> stabbed<00:03:54.510> on<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:54.900> which<00:03:55.080> is<00:03:55.260> rather

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
get stabbed on it which is rather

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.620 
get stabbed on it which is rather
unfortunate<00:03:56.030> but<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.120> kind<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.300> fits<00:03:57.480> the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
unfortunate but it kind of fits the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.750 
unfortunate but it kind of fits the
theme<00:03:57.660> because<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.560> sound<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.160> massive<00:03:59.610> is

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
theme because of sound the massive is

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.850 
theme because of sound the massive is
that<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.060> has<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.630> fact<00:04:01.200> it's<00:04:01.350> called<00:04:01.530> noivern

that it has and fact it's called noivern

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.240 
that it has and fact it's called noivern

Ashley based which is kind of cool

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.860 
Ashley based which is kind of cool
because<00:04:28.680> actually<00:04:29.580> thinking<00:04:30.449> about<00:04:30.509> it

be<00:04:33.449> special<00:04:33.900> anyway<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.590> was<00:04:34.830> going<00:04:34.949> to<00:04:35.009> say

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:35.219 
be special anyway I was going to say

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.790 
be special anyway I was going to say
like<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.939> primarily<00:04:36.750> physical<00:04:37.379> and<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.560> think

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
like that primarily physical and I think

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.570

you can throw specs on meds you can run

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.219 
you can throw specs on meds you can run
mix<00:04:44.009> men<00:04:44.219> so<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.490> can<00:04:44.669> run<00:04:44.849> dragonite<00:04:45.750> in<00:04:45.930> rain

because<00:05:10.710> we<00:05:11.039> don't<00:05:11.219> have<00:05:11.280> stats<00:05:11.729> or<00:05:12.030> at<00:05:12.539> least

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
because we don't have stats or at least

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.749 
because we don't have stats or at least
I<00:05:12.960> haven't<00:05:13.319> looked<00:05:13.500> into<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.919> leaks<00:05:14.129> which

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
I haven't looked into the leaks which

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.450 
I haven't looked into the leaks which
may<00:05:15.120> tell<00:05:15.389> you<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.659> stats<00:05:15.979> but<00:05:16.979> I<00:05:17.039> think<00:05:17.310> it's

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
may tell you the stats but I think it's

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.850 
may tell you the stats but I think it's
going<00:05:17.520> to<00:05:17.610> be<00:05:17.699> like<00:05:17.940> an<00:05:18.150> altaria<00:05:18.930> or<00:05:19.139> a<00:05:19.169> Flygon

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
going to be like an altaria or a Flygon

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.670 
going to be like an altaria or a Flygon
a<00:05:19.919> kind<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.219> a<00:05:20.340> second-tier<00:05:21.090> dragon<00:05:21.629> I<00:05:22.050> hope

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
a kind of a second-tier dragon I hope

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.290 
a kind of a second-tier dragon I hope
it's<00:05:22.860> not<00:05:22.949> as<00:05:23.069> bad<00:05:23.190> as<00:05:23.250> dragon<00:05:23.849> because<00:05:24.060> that

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
it's not as bad as dragon because that

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.640 
it's not as bad as dragon because that
thing<00:05:24.330> unfortunately<00:05:24.719> didn't<00:05:25.199> turn<00:05:25.349> out<00:05:25.379> too

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
thing unfortunately didn't turn out too

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.860 
thing unfortunately didn't turn out too
well<00:05:25.680> but<00:05:26.310> maybe<00:05:26.550> in<00:05:26.909> the<00:05:27.090> mid-range<00:05:27.300> kind<00:05:27.810> of

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
well but maybe in the mid-range kind of

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.899 
well but maybe in the mid-range kind of
a<00:05:27.960> mid-range<00:05:28.409> giant<00:05:28.860> dragon<00:05:29.219> as<00:05:29.340> opposed<00:05:29.639> to

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
a mid-range giant dragon as opposed to

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:33.830 
a mid-range giant dragon as opposed to
write<00:05:30.479> up<00:05:30.629> the<00:05:30.779> top<00:05:30.990> of<00:05:31.259> the<00:05:31.889> tables<00:05:32.370> but<00:05:33.090> that

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
write up the top of the tables but that

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.930 
write up the top of the tables but that
is<00:05:33.960> about<00:05:34.110> it<00:05:34.289> that<00:05:34.620> wraps<00:05:34.860> us<00:05:35.039> up<00:05:35.069> so<00:05:35.610> I<00:05:35.639> hope

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
is about it that wraps us up so I hope
