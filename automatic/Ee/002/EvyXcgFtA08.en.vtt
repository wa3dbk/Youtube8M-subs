00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
my brushless Rustler a review and pros

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.709 
my brushless Rustler a review and pros
and<00:00:09.929> cons<00:00:10.080> at<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.349> end<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:10.800> let's<00:00:11.519> start<00:00:11.759> now

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
and cons at the end so let's start now

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.960 
and cons at the end so let's start now
the<00:00:13.590> Rustler<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:15.470> pretty<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.730> two

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
the Rustler is a pretty like it's two

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.599 
the Rustler is a pretty like it's two
wheel<00:00:18.119> drive<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.800> back<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> lot

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
wheel drive and the back is a lot

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.070 
wheel drive and the back is a lot
heavier<00:00:20.820> than<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> front<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.869> do<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
heavier than the front so you can do a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.560 
heavier than the front so you can do a
lot<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.260> wheelies<00:00:22.740> as<00:00:23.359> really<00:00:24.359> great

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
receiver box and Tom these antennas our

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.080 
receiver box and Tom these antennas our
opinion<00:01:06.510> yes<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.900> get<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.400> finally

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.730 
opinion yes to get in but if I finally
on<00:01:09.240> youtube<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:11.510> it<00:01:12.510> has<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> high<00:01:13.680> voltage

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
on youtube so it has a high voltage
