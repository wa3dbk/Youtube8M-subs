00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
thread so I thought with Africa make use

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.999 
thread so I thought with Africa make use
of<00:04:07.519> it<00:04:07.759> you<00:04:07.970> might<00:04:08.120> not<00:04:08.269> have<00:04:08.419> it<00:04:08.599> and<00:04:08.889> at<00:04:09.889> least

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:10.009 
of it you might not have it and at least

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.219 
of it you might not have it and at least
it's<00:04:10.220> getting<00:04:10.340> some<00:04:10.759> good<00:04:11.299> use<00:04:11.569> rather<00:04:12.079> than

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:12.229 
it's getting some good use rather than

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.050 
it's getting some good use rather than
sitting<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:12.709> my<00:04:12.829> bra<00:04:13.040> gathering<00:04:13.459> dust<00:04:13.729> and

rather than just moan don't get me wrong
the<00:05:20.600> GoPro<00:05:21.050> is<00:05:21.200> great<00:05:21.440> for<00:05:21.650> wide<00:05:21.800> angle<00:05:22.190> stuff

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
but it does make me feel a bit queasy on

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.020

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
when I'm editing because I'm watching it

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.440 
when I'm editing because I'm watching it
a<00:05:39.380> lot<00:05:39.560> obviously<00:05:40.160> with<00:05:40.280> the<00:05:40.310> editing<00:05:40.790> and

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
a lot obviously with the editing and

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.060 
a lot obviously with the editing and

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
on the lens there is a kind of

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.270 
on the lens there is a kind of
queasiness<00:05:44.900> that<00:05:45.139> you<00:05:45.230> can<00:05:45.410> sort<00:05:45.830> of<00:05:45.950> come

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
queasiness that you can sort of come

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.800 
queasiness that you can sort of come
down<00:05:46.490> with<00:05:46.700> obviously<00:05:47.150> some<00:05:47.300> people<00:05:47.419> get<00:05:47.660> it

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
down with obviously some people get it

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.710 
down with obviously some people get it
sort<00:05:48.139> of<00:05:48.200> worse<00:05:48.440> than<00:05:48.650> others<00:05:49.389> your<00:05:50.389> name<00:05:50.600> is<00:05:50.660> a

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
sort of worse than others your name is a

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.420 
sort of worse than others your name is a
bit<00:05:50.840> weird<00:05:50.870> on<00:05:51.229> this<00:05:51.350> camera<00:05:51.620> it<00:05:51.800> sounds<00:05:52.100> okay

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
bit weird on this camera it sounds okay

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.390 
bit weird on this camera it sounds okay
but<00:05:52.700> depends<00:05:53.600> on<00:05:53.660> your<00:05:53.810> situation<00:05:54.160> it<00:05:55.160> seems

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
but depends on your situation it seems

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.060 
but depends on your situation it seems
to<00:05:55.610> adapt<00:05:55.910> its<00:05:56.120> levels<00:05:56.510> so<00:05:56.810> when<00:05:57.229> you<00:05:57.410> start<00:05:57.830> to

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
to adapt its levels so when you start to

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.700 
to adapt its levels so when you start to
record<00:05:58.490> it<00:05:59.090> works<00:05:59.630> out<00:05:59.900> the<00:06:00.080> ambient<00:06:00.500> noise

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
record it works out the ambient noise

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.030 
record it works out the ambient noise
and<00:06:01.100> then<00:06:01.550> sets<00:06:02.030> itself<00:06:02.360> accordingly<00:06:02.960> this<00:06:03.919> is

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
and then sets itself accordingly this is

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.830 
and then sets itself accordingly this is
bad<00:06:04.190> if<00:06:04.370> you<00:06:04.490> start<00:06:04.729> talking<00:06:04.910> immediately<00:06:05.300> as

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
bad if you start talking immediately as

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.390 
bad if you start talking immediately as
it<00:06:06.139> will<00:06:06.260> change<00:06:06.440> level<00:06:06.800> as<00:06:06.979> always<00:06:07.250> it's

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
it will change level as always it's

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.070 
it will change level as always it's
better<00:06:07.580> record<00:06:07.940> using<00:06:08.210> an<00:06:08.389> external<00:06:08.600> mic<00:06:08.930> if

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
better record using an external mic if

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.710 
better record using an external mic if
you<00:06:09.200> can<00:06:09.639> also<00:06:10.639> this<00:06:10.940> works<00:06:11.150> brilliantly<00:06:11.330> in

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
you can also this works brilliantly in

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.570 
you can also this works brilliantly in
daylight<00:06:12.169> and<00:06:12.440> image<00:06:12.770> quality<00:06:12.950> is<00:06:13.190> pretty

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
daylight and image quality is pretty

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.700 
daylight and image quality is pretty
nice<00:06:13.790> the<00:06:14.389> built-in<00:06:14.840> image<00:06:15.320> stabilization

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
nice the built-in image stabilization

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.219 
nice the built-in image stabilization
only<00:06:16.190> works<00:06:16.370> at<00:06:16.550> seven-twenty<00:06:17.150> though<00:06:17.900> and

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
only works at seven-twenty though and

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.680 
only works at seven-twenty though and
not<00:06:18.650> when<00:06:18.919> recording<00:06:19.160> in<00:06:19.430> full<00:06:19.669> 1080<00:06:20.060> well

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
not when recording in full 1080 well

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.020 
not when recording in full 1080 well
that's<00:06:20.840> okay<00:06:21.080> because<00:06:21.169> I<00:06:21.320> generally<00:06:21.740> always

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
that's okay because I generally always

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.900 
that's okay because I generally always
film<00:06:23.030> in<00:06:23.120> 720<00:06:23.810> so<00:06:24.050> that's<00:06:24.320> pretty<00:06:24.560> good<00:06:24.910> as

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
film in 720 so that's pretty good as

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.640 
film in 720 so that's pretty good as
with<00:06:26.120> most<00:06:26.210> these<00:06:26.419> cameras<00:06:26.780> it<00:06:26.990> doesn't<00:06:27.470> cope

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
with most these cameras it doesn't cope

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.430 
with most these cameras it doesn't cope
so<00:06:28.010> well<00:06:28.190> in<00:06:28.400> low<00:06:28.580> light<00:06:28.910> either<00:06:29.320> anyway<00:06:30.320> it's

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
so well in low light either anyway it's

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.140 
so well in low light either anyway it's
all<00:06:30.530> yours<00:06:30.710> now<00:06:30.770> may<00:06:31.010> I<00:06:31.190> do<00:06:31.280> hope<00:06:31.789> you<00:06:31.940> can<00:06:32.120> make

find<00:06:48.860> that<00:06:49.250> I<00:06:49.310> don't<00:06:50.200> don't<00:06:51.200> end<00:06:51.410> up<00:06:51.530> using

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
find that I don't don't end up using

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.250 
find that I don't don't end up using
this<00:06:52.130> as<00:06:52.460> much<00:06:52.850> as<00:06:52.880> we<00:06:53.060> thought<00:06:53.389> I<00:06:53.630> might<00:06:54.080> end

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 
this as much as we thought I might end

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.640 
this as much as we thought I might end
up<00:06:54.350> using<00:06:54.530> it<00:06:54.830> then<00:06:55.280> what<00:06:55.490> I<00:06:55.520> will<00:06:55.639> do<00:06:56.150> is<00:06:56.810> give

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
up using it then what I will do is give

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.150 
up using it then what I will do is give
someone<00:06:58.010> else<00:06:58.220> an<00:06:58.400> opportunity<00:06:59.060> to<00:06:59.979> use<00:07:00.979> it

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
someone else an opportunity to use it

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.790 
someone else an opportunity to use it
and<00:07:01.340> if<00:07:02.300> like<00:07:02.660> I<00:07:02.750> say<00:07:02.870> if<00:07:02.960> I<00:07:03.050> find<00:07:03.320> I<00:07:03.410> don't<00:07:03.590> use

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
and if like I say if I find I don't use

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.400 
and if like I say if I find I don't use
it<00:07:03.830> after<00:07:04.070> a<00:07:04.310> time<00:07:04.610> then<00:07:04.910> I<00:07:04.940> will<00:07:05.300> make<00:07:05.930> sure<00:07:06.200> it
