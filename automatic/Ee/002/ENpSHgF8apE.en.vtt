 and then we must select from 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.870
 terminal boxes 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.170
 for example in this case it would be ops and web 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.109

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.259
 I would be in this case 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.430
 and we should also check the box 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:13.810
 water for castilla that extracts is 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.840
 activated by pressing twice 1 2 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.710
 and we will look for the room you would need 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.600
 This smartphone 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.600
 and in this case it would be this 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.490
 well now I stationary it off 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.080
 we must press the following 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.270
 keys continuously 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.430
 lower volume central button and turn on 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.060
 that will look for an android working 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.610
 there is 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.030
 after this I plug it in and we 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.030
 computer 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.430
 good if you are if you recognize it 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.460
 I recommend you to start the samsung ice 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.190
 that comes with driver that will help us 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.140
 so that our computer recognizes the 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.810
 mobile device 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.980
 well here he already recognized and we will give 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.550
 to be 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:11.690
 there they like the cell phone in certain 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.150
 moment will start but it will not be a signal 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.490
 to unplug what we owe 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.650
 unplug it when it stops where it says 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.650
 apps 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.190
 I would say would say peace and with blue color in the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.920
 its background 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.830
 and good some will find what we 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.840
 They serve to use our good android 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.240
 they serve us because many 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.040
 applications are with androids 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:44.300
 higher this is the case of the leicester 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:47.660
 that is not for 2.1.1 that comes from 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.330
 factory with this phone 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.340
 the play store would be from 2.2 in 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.740
 forward that comes with many 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.750
 applications for 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.790
 to open with two top points 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.790
 both paid or free 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:11.460
 well after existing it would be 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.110
 to start the phone 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.360
 good took this time to 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.050
 tell them to subscribe be my channel 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.180

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.239
 or if not every two or three days the 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.269
 to choose an emergency also what 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.950
 I invite you to tears on facebook 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.739

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.120
 well let's go to the middle of the process 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.739

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.739
 you should already be reset 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.340
 good now at the beginning the good 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.140

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.150
 that will be installing the package 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.629
 data of this update as they can 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.629
 observe there 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.370
 to restart again 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.739
 it will start again 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.709
 Y 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.709
 It was not normal but it is not the driver 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.130
 well there they observe the model and it will be a 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.130
 start of android 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.510
 today he will be loading the samsung logo and 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:46.330
 now they will load some data and only 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:49.400
 book made the cell phone and it will be ready 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.710
 there it is ready as you can observe for 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.439
 measure would direct me to configurations 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.580
 to proceed to show you the new 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.419
 android 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.419
 and I'll be right back 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:12.069
 well still do not disconnect it because now 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.940
 data that will be installed good and 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:17.509
 information configurations 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:21.919
 phone and version of android 2.2 point 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:25.069
 2 v will already have the new android and 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.840
 they will only have to wait 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.840
 finish the waiting time 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:38.060
 and this video is about to end 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:41.129
 I think it does not end up being five minutes but 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.330
 we already took the big step that would be the 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:46.499
 update because it's ready 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.279
 make sure you do everything correctly 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:52.650
 like in this video and good now 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:56.060
 it only remains to wait for it to end 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:59.550
 the good time how long we take 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.080
 we would see five minutes it's just very 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.020
 little bit 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.379
 this is not very good in the next 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:10.530
 video in that area how to install the 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:13.229
 Raptors recovery plot and how to install the 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.260
 android 2.3 points 7 in this same 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.430
 device 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:23.230
 and good now we only have to wait 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.230
 four minutes when the second one arrives 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:29.009
 we only have to wait for the dimension 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.009
 previous 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.180
 of peace 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.180
 in blue 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:49.290
 I believe that it will not go beyond the 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.290
 five minutes than the 20 seconds 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.650
 is almost finished as they see progress 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.290
 quickly the cell phone continues 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:03.990
 normally I do not restart anything or anything 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.990
 now only normally 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.760
 good 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:13.110
 but good five minutes 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:18.180
 beyond that it will not take longer 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:21.150
 I told him there will be peace and we have already 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.400
 finished we will observe the odin and 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.470
 we will proceed to see the phone plug 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.260
 or if they want or left installed 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:31.110
 plugged in programming music songs 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:34.110
 or etcetera but well that was my video 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:37.280
