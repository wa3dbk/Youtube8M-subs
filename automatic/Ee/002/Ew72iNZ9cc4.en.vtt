00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
have a URL yet so a little bit

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.389 
have a URL yet so a little bit
unfortunate<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.120> me<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.559> new<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.070> way

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
unfortunate for me I the new the way

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.389 
unfortunate for me I the new the way
Google+<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.270> can't<00:00:39.570> come<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.399> URL

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
Google+ is I can't come up with a URL

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.970 
Google+ is I can't come up with a URL
that<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.790> want<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.450> suggests<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> URL<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.590> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that I want it suggests the URL for you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.139 
that I want it suggests the URL for you
so<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> makes<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.059> lot<00:00:45.360> more<00:00:45.420> difficult<00:00:46.230> to

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
so it makes it a lot more difficult to

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.569 
so it makes it a lot more difficult to
make<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.420> youtube<00:00:48.899> channel<00:00:48.960> name<00:00:49.340> but<00:00:50.340> anyways

really<00:01:30.780> enjoying<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.320> beta<00:01:31.500> there's<00:01:31.890> some

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
really enjoying the beta there's some

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.890 
really enjoying the beta there's some
there's<00:01:32.490> some<00:01:32.579> things<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> beta<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.659> I

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
there's some things in the beta that I

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.719 
there's some things in the beta that I
would<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.829> changed<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.400> release

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
would like to be changed for the release

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670 
would like to be changed for the release
of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> full<00:01:36.210> game<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.140> think<00:01:37.350> it'd<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
of the full game and I think it'd be a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.010 
of the full game and I think it'd be a
really<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.189> solid<00:01:39.030> game<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.630> game<00:01:39.810> kind

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
really really solid game this game kind

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.330 
really really solid game this game kind
of<00:01:40.079> reminds<00:01:40.380> me<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.530> cult<00:01:40.799> duty<00:01:41.009> ghosts<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
of reminds me of cult duty ghosts a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.370 
of reminds me of cult duty ghosts a
little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> little<00:01:42.299> bit<00:01:42.750> better<00:01:42.960> maps

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
little bit with a little bit better maps

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.960 
little bit with a little bit better maps
with<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> lot<00:01:43.950> better<00:01:44.100> maps<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.909> I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
with a lot better maps actually and I

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.130 
with a lot better maps actually and I
think<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.299> what<00:01:45.540> called<00:01:45.780> did<00:01:45.930> he<00:01:45.990> goes

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
think this is what called did he goes

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.380 
think this is what called did he goes
could<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.439> been<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.549> tick<00:01:47.729> rate<00:01:47.939> isn't<00:01:48.149> as

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
could have been the tick rate isn't as

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.850 
could have been the tick rate isn't as
fast<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.020> call<00:01:49.200> duty<00:01:49.350> ghosts<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:49.740> it's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
fast as in call duty ghosts but it's

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.950 
fast as in call duty ghosts but it's
still<00:01:50.009> fairly<00:01:50.220> quick<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.750> call

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
still fairly quick but I think a call

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.179 
still fairly quick but I think a call
duty<00:01:52.110> ghosts<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> had<00:01:52.829> better<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
duty ghosts have what I had better a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.649 
duty ghosts have what I had better a
little<00:01:53.399> bit<00:01:53.579> better<00:01:53.670> weapons<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.329> little<00:01:54.570> bit

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
little bit better weapons a little bit

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.480 
little bit better weapons a little bit
better<00:01:54.810> kill<00:01:55.110> streaks<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.340> this

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
better kill streaks this is what this

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.950 
better kill streaks this is what this
game<00:01:56.670> kind<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.000> reminds<00:01:57.329> me<00:01:57.420> about<00:01:57.509> know<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> lot

you guys today about boys like I said

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.510 
you guys today about boys like I said
it's<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.230> nuclear<00:02:19.560> gameplay<00:02:19.980> thing<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.280> wanted

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
it's a nuclear gameplay thing I wanted

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.590 
it's a nuclear gameplay thing I wanted
ended<00:02:20.880> up<00:02:20.970> going<00:02:21.180> 48<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.959> three<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:23.850> think

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
ended up going 48 and three and I think

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.240 
ended up going 48 and three and I think
out<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.920> was<00:02:26.040> like<00:02:26.160> 38<00:02:26.700> kills<00:02:28.069> 30<00:02:29.069> of

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
out of like it was like 38 kills 30 of

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.920 
out of like it was like 38 kills 30 of
them<00:02:29.370> were<00:02:29.520> my<00:02:29.670> gun<00:02:29.910> kills<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.600> kill<00:02:30.780> trees

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
them were my gun kills so the kill trees

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.870 
them were my gun kills so the kill trees
weren't<00:02:31.140> really<00:02:31.350> doing<00:02:31.530> work<00:02:31.860> for<00:02:31.890> me<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.340> think

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
weren't really doing work for me I think

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.040 
weren't really doing work for me I think
there<00:02:32.970> was<00:02:33.000> somebody<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.540> Lobby<00:02:33.810> that
