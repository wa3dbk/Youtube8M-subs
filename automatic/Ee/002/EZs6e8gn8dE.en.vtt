device or a detector you know I've got
several<00:00:55.790> detectors<00:00:56.300> I've<00:00:56.420> been<00:00:56.570> using<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:57.410> I

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
several detectors I've been using and I

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.460 
several detectors I've been using and I
just<00:00:59.089> want<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.329> say<00:00:59.449> one<00:00:59.600> thing<00:00:59.629> uh<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:03.140> XP

just want to say one thing uh the XP
Deus<00:01:03.619> in<00:01:04.040> I've<00:01:04.489> always<00:01:04.790> I've<00:01:04.940> said<00:01:05.119> before

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
Deus in I've always I've said before

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.330 
Deus in I've always I've said before
it's<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.630> highest<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.470> detector<00:01:06.950> I've<00:01:07.070> got

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
it's the highest and detector I've got

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.590 
it's the highest and detector I've got
and<00:01:07.790> in<00:01:08.570> my<00:01:08.720> opinion<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.229> function<00:01:09.770> is<00:01:09.979> is<00:01:10.600> it's

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
and in my opinion is function is is it's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.399 
and in my opinion is function is is it's
a<00:01:11.750> is<00:01:12.650> equal<00:01:13.340> to<00:01:13.580> any<00:01:13.970> detector<00:01:14.570> even<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.170> ones

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
a is equal to any detector even the ones

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.070 
a is equal to any detector even the ones
slightly<00:01:15.890> more<00:01:16.070> expensive<00:01:16.130> than<00:01:16.760> it<00:01:16.939> was<00:01:17.840> at

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
slightly more expensive than it was at

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.109 
slightly more expensive than it was at
purchase<00:01:18.500> I<00:01:18.680> think<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:18.979> is<00:01:19.100> dropping<00:01:19.369> prices

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
purchase I think it is dropping prices

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.850 
purchase I think it is dropping prices
dropping<00:01:20.920> nowadays<00:01:22.119> but<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:24.439> one<00:01:24.590> thing<00:01:24.770> I

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
want to say is with this detector I had

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.730 
want to say is with this detector I had
this<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:29.060> 9<00:01:29.240> inch<00:01:29.420> coil<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.380> it's<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.560> very

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
this the 9 inch coil and it's a very

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.790 
this the 9 inch coil and it's a very
good<00:01:30.860> detector<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:31.840> found<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.960> ring<00:01:34.300> you<00:01:35.300> know<00:01:35.800> it

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
good detector I found a ring you know it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.760 
good detector I found a ring you know it
was<00:01:37.310> very<00:01:37.550> good<00:01:37.810> but<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:38.840> do<00:01:38.960> want<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.350> say<00:01:39.530> this

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
a detector change more by the addition

the sovereign GT and all of those change

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.530 
the sovereign GT and all of those change
the<00:03:08.070> character<00:03:08.580> detector<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.270> make<00:03:09.390> them

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
the character detector and make them

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.250 
the character detector and make them
better<00:03:09.860> but<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:12.120> addition<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:12.960> call

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
better but the the addition of this call

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.630 
better but the the addition of this call
and<00:03:13.560> made<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.190> detector<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.480> much<00:03:15.780> better

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
and made this detector so much better

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.430 
and made this detector so much better
that<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.670> have<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.120> think<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.810> reason<00:03:19.080> not<00:03:19.290> to

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
that I have to think of a reason not to

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.100 
that I have to think of a reason not to
carry<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:19.980> with<00:03:20.130> me<00:03:20.160> all<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.550> time<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.150> it's

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
carry it with me all the time and it's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.430 
carry it with me all the time and it's
basically<00:03:22.410> all<00:03:22.530> I've<00:03:22.770> got<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:22.980> safe<00:03:23.540> int<00:03:24.540> I've

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
basically all I've got a safe int I've

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.270 
basically all I've got a safe int I've
gotten<00:03:26.010> hit<00:03:26.670> after<00:03:26.910> hit<00:03:27.290> in<00:03:28.290> areas<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.950> thought

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
gotten hit after hit in areas I thought

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.190 
gotten hit after hit in areas I thought
were<00:03:30.710> we're<00:03:31.710> empty<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.490> targets<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.210> this<00:03:34.050> is

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
were we're empty of targets and this is

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.350 
were we're empty of targets and this is
suddenly<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:34.710> you<00:03:35.700> know<00:03:35.820> she's<00:03:35.970> like<00:03:36.090> Bing

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
suddenly just you know she's like Bing

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.090

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
saying that might not be affected I'm

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.870 
saying that might not be affected I'm
covering<00:03:40.440> different<00:03:40.590> areas<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.340> told<00:03:41.640> you

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880

and a call move two or three or four

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.540 
and a call move two or three or four
inches<00:03:45.900> in<00:03:45.960> either<00:03:46.320> direction<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.980> suddenly

the<00:04:02.760> purchase<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.300> this<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.630> no<00:04:03.780> mean<00:04:04.050> feat

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
the purchase of this is no mean feat

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.010 
the purchase of this is no mean feat

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
separation in my opinion this equal to

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
been and a great increase in my ability

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.170 
been and a great increase in my ability
to<00:05:45.600> go<00:05:45.870> out<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:46.080> hunt<00:05:46.320> and<00:05:46.740> I've<00:05:47.280> had<00:05:47.670> a<00:05:47.700> lot

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
to go out and hunt and I've had a lot

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.610 
to go out and hunt and I've had a lot
more<00:05:48.210> fines<00:05:49.580> might<00:05:50.580> be<00:05:50.790> due<00:05:51.600> to<00:05:51.630> this<00:05:52.290> like

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
more fines might be due to this like

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.950 
more fines might be due to this like
more<00:05:52.920> circumference<00:05:53.400> but<00:05:54.210> I<00:05:54.240> also<00:05:54.390> think<00:05:54.750> it's

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
more circumference but I also think it's

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.920 
more circumference but I also think it's
due<00:05:55.110> to<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.440> quality<00:05:56.010> and<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.930> intelligence

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
due to the quality and the intelligence

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.050 
due to the quality and the intelligence
and<00:05:58.230> the<00:05:58.320> circuitry<00:05:59.310> there's<00:05:59.580> better<00:05:59.850> this

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
and the circuitry there's better this

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.220 
and the circuitry there's better this
new<00:06:00.270> call<00:06:00.830> well<00:06:01.830> it's<00:06:01.980> all<00:06:02.070> I<00:06:02.130> can<00:06:02.280> say<00:06:02.630> I<00:06:03.630> will
