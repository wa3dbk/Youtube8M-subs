great<00:00:00.299> part<00:00:00.630> about<00:00:00.719> developing<00:00:01.439> power

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
great part about developing power

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.760 
great part about developing power
through<00:00:01.979> medicine<00:00:02.250> ball<00:00:02.520> throws<00:00:02.939> is

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:03.770 
through medicine ball throws is

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.720 
through medicine ball throws is
especially<00:00:04.770> when<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.069> have<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.250> ball<00:00:05.580> that's

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
especially when you have a ball that's

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.190 
especially when you have a ball that's
going<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.940> bounce<00:00:06.150> off<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.569> wall<00:00:06.750> or<00:00:07.020> if

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
going to bounce off of a wall or if

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.900 
going to bounce off of a wall or if
you're<00:00:07.290> using<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.649> partner<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.370> not<00:00:08.519> only<00:00:08.700> have

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
you're using a partner you not only have

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.610 
you're using a partner you not only have
to<00:00:09.030> accelerate<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.870> power<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.230> throwing

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
to accelerate and the power of throwing

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.169 
to accelerate and the power of throwing
the<00:00:10.710> ball<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.250> also<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.700> decelerate

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
the ball you also have to decelerate

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.850 
the ball you also have to decelerate
when<00:00:12.630> catching<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> ball<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.440> you're<00:00:13.590> working

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
when catching the ball so you're working

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.799 
when catching the ball so you're working
your<00:00:13.980> core<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.790> two<00:00:15.030> different<00:00:15.210> ways

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
your core in two different ways

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.260 
your core in two different ways
thus<00:00:16.379> making<00:00:16.710> these<00:00:16.800> exercises<00:00:17.580> twice<00:00:18.090> as

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
thus making these exercises twice as

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.689 
thus making these exercises twice as
productive<00:00:18.420> as<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.650> any<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.010> our<00:00:20.160> exercises

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
productive as with any of our exercises

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.240 
productive as with any of our exercises
these<00:00:21.300> can<00:00:21.539> all<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.810> tweaked<00:00:22.350> by<00:00:22.769> not<00:00:22.949> only

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
these can all be tweaked by not only

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.250 
these can all be tweaked by not only
changing<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> way<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.689> throw<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.080> ball

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
changing the way that you throw the ball

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.410 
changing the way that you throw the ball
but<00:00:25.740> changing<00:00:26.160> your<00:00:26.279> feet<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:26.970> do<00:00:27.240> things

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
but changing your feet you can do things

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.330 
but changing your feet you can do things
from<00:00:27.720> an<00:00:27.840> athletic<00:00:28.170> stance<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.250> do

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
from an athletic stance you can do

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.040 
from an athletic stance you can do
things<00:00:29.580> from<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.910> split<00:00:30.179> stance<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.750> we'll

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
things from a split stance and we'll

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.479 
things from a split stance and we'll
even<00:00:31.199> show<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.500> some<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.859> you'll<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.189> from<00:00:32.399> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
even show you some that you'll do from a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.459 
even show you some that you'll do from a
lunge<00:00:32.730> what<00:00:33.480> I'm<00:00:33.570> gonna<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.870> these<00:00:33.989> guys<00:00:34.260> do

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
lunge what I'm gonna have these guys do

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.850 
lunge what I'm gonna have these guys do
now<00:00:34.649> Matt<00:00:35.340> once<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.640> come<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.590> we're<00:00:37.590> gonna<00:00:37.680> do

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
now Matt once you come in we're gonna do

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.100 
now Matt once you come in we're gonna do
just<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.190> simple<00:00:38.340> overhead<00:00:39.030> throw<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.840> instead

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
just a simple overhead throw so instead

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.600 
just a simple overhead throw so instead
of<00:00:40.170> throwing<00:00:40.379> down<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> ground<00:00:41.219> like<00:00:41.460> we

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
of throwing down to the ground like we

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.340 
of throwing down to the ground like we
did<00:00:41.760> earlier<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.390> that's<00:00:42.600> gonna<00:00:42.719> throw<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
did earlier and that's gonna throw and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
did earlier and that's gonna throw and
and<00:00:43.770> try<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.309> consistent<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.090> everything

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
and try and be consistent in everything

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.330 
and try and be consistent in everything
that<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.960> basketball<00:00:46.350> players<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> hit

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
that we do is basketball players and hit

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
that we do is basketball players and hit
the<00:00:47.460> same<00:00:47.670> brick<00:00:47.940> every<00:00:48.239> single<00:00:48.570> time<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.230> he

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the same brick every single time so he

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.439 
the same brick every single time so he
will<00:00:49.500> throw<00:00:49.829> ball<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:50.640> bounce<00:00:50.789> off<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> wall

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
will throw ball will bounce off the wall

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.689 
will throw ball will bounce off the wall
one<00:00:51.989> time<00:00:52.230> off<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> ground<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.039> he'll<00:00:53.460> catch

once you do three throws yep perfect and
he<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> same<00:01:01.590> thing<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.280> time

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
he can do the same thing that this time

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.009 
he can do the same thing that this time
just<00:01:02.699> alternate<00:01:03.090> your<00:01:03.210> feet<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.750> throw

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
just alternate your feet so you throw

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
here catch so here once you get to each

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.730 
here catch so here once you get to each
foot<00:01:06.600> hard<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> can

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
foot hard as you can

perfect<00:01:15.990> now<00:01:16.320> he's<00:01:16.500> generating<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> lot<00:01:17.189> of

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
perfect now he's generating a lot of

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.740 
perfect now he's generating a lot of
power<00:01:17.310> using<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> full<00:01:18.450> body<00:01:18.659> exercise

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
power using this as a full body exercise

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.960 
power using this as a full body exercise
which<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.860> want<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.820> want

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
to isolate the core now I just want you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
to isolate the core now I just want you
to<00:01:22.770> kneel<00:01:23.009> down<00:01:23.189> you'll<00:01:23.430> literally<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
to kneel down you'll literally be in a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.940 
to kneel down you'll literally be in a
lunge<00:01:24.479> position<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:25.170> knee<00:01:25.350> resting<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.830> the

lunge position back knee resting on the
ground

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
ground

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.940 
ground
do<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> same<00:01:26.939> thing<00:01:27.049> hard<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.439> yep

would switch feet go ahead you can stand
now<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:36.630> we're<00:01:36.780> gonna<00:01:36.869> switch<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.710> way

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
now now we're gonna switch the the way

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.830 
now now we're gonna switch the the way
in<00:01:38.009> which<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.340> throw<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> ball<00:01:38.909> Matt's<00:01:39.689> gonna

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
in which we throw the ball Matt's gonna

there you go yep that's perfect hard as
you<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.799> though<00:02:03.229> one<00:02:04.229> more

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.089 

one<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> things<00:02:07.650> that's<00:02:07.890> that's

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
one of the things that's that's

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.949 
one of the things that's that's
difficult<00:02:08.580> concept<00:02:09.240> for<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> players<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.720> get

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
difficult concept for the players to get

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.330 
difficult concept for the players to get
because<00:02:10.289> everything<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.160> weight

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
because everything we do in the weight

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.160 
because everything we do in the weight
room<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.730> usually<00:02:11.880> slow<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.599> under<00:02:12.780> control

room is usually slow and under control
is<00:02:13.410> they<00:02:13.770> kind<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.099> hold<00:02:14.250> back<00:02:14.520> when<00:02:14.730> doing<00:02:14.970> the
