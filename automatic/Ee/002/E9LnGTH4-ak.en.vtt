00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.060
 and lots of oil for all the girls 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.830
 well found on the human crime today is here 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.029
 as always your max that will make you 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.400
 see how to unlock all the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.650
 goals on origins and above all 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.710
 any advice or something 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.189
 in short, because now I explain you it takes 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.590
 almost all of them goals of this 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.000
 package maps in short of origins are 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.530
 then everyone who has to do with 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.110
 the witches so if you do the egg task 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.940
 he does all the goals now 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.710
 going on practically this the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.250
 climate or lost children that is 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.360
 just the egg game won for itself and not 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.390
 sure to explain apart from the fact that 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.640
 blue magna seems to me so precisely 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 He did the tutorial for the easter egg 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.510
 then via flip of the description links 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.869
 go for those videos if you want to have 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.750
 form how to do for example be 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:04.350
 this instead is the elementary goal 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.119
 watson 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.299
 or built their own sticks 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.250
 food in one game is a lot 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.900
 simply this goal gives it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.719
 the whole team for everything 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.310
 the group because there is also one 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.750
 only person can do all the sticks and 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.329
 has the goal of the whole lobby 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.640
 this is instead an individual goal 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.130
 that is, we need to use everybody 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.850
 how many elementary sticks strengthened in 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.369
 a game so we should take them n 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.840
 1 and use it or at least have it in 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.030
 hand which goal 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.549
 zombies for a day we must 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.799
 conquer a converter generator 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.259
 more precisely and also the kidneys but le 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.509
 three people at once 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.859
 I was already wearing this dress but 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.140
 the very simple tutorial will suffice 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.969
 take and use zombie greetings 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.950
 at the beginning when playing in four 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.740
 from the chest will come out the blood of the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.369
 zombies and therefore doing in this 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.469
 way 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.670
 we will have the blood I could use 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.079
 denis but our companions do 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.359
 the goal of the arc of three seconds 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.429
 practically here now you are seeing 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:09.009
 the goal masters of kung fu that in 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.860
 few words consists in getting rid of 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.840
 from the robot's rapid hold the panzer 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.980
 more precisely and to free ours too 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.110
 ally 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.640
 here instead the target on the tank 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.220
 which is not very difficult to leave 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.079
 last zombie but we could do it too 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.090
 much easier way than ever 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.739
 simon single player putting us in 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.069
 this gray or holding c.so a 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.500
 pedal tank and rice there 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.239
 they will see the passion of his goal 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.910
 full charge or to conquer 6 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.299
 generators during a game of 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.400
 having us active in the meantime and not 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.079
 there is a lot to explain the red has made a 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.480
 video on where between them generators then 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.680
 pastime for that video 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.389
 now the goal they have done 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.970
 deploy more absolute or if you 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.470
 he walks because he is very long 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.450
 true duty a potential a stick e 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.519
 revive him with the strengthened stick 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.440
 our partner then we will have to go to 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.889
 maxi petroleum if we have to revive it with 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.780
 the maxis drones and then there is the animation 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.819
 simple or that without closing 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.079
 live and the one with live sugars e 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.030
 with his are the four different ways 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.650
 to revive our comrades 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.060
 we are my evil I don't even know 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.010
 on players but also other players 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.799
 in the north, in fact, it does remote three 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.430
 different people and no boys 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.250
 these here 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.170
 were the goals on origins in some 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.500
 there is no saying mole type tutoria that 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.209
 from which he then does it unwittingly for 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.799
 the meticulous goal I had put a 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.480
 video on every where i show how it is 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.069
 blocked the four challenges then put 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.840
 better in the field than that and nothing 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.319
 guys these when the goals up 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.939
 origin 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.159
 I remind you that we can unlock them has 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.379
 personalized and also very easy 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.030
 because I unwittingly came into 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.590
 this lobby of this enemy which I have 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.290
 made the objective indeed those who walk and 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.459
 it was easy so no boys 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.019
 this one at the end of the video 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.389
 I recommend it certainly be like e 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.900
 nothing nice to the next video or not 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.900
 championship
