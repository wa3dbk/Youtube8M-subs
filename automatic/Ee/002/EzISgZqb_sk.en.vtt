00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
they've eaten unless they've had kimchi

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.339 
they've eaten unless they've had kimchi
and<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.279> part<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.939> Korean<00:00:27.510> culture<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.140> life

there's<00:00:32.790> no<00:00:32.940> Ram<00:00:33.210> even<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> ray<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.110> kimchi<00:00:34.320> in

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
there's no Ram even a ray of kimchi in

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.979 
there's no Ram even a ray of kimchi in
front<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.040> us<00:00:35.160> here<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.730> new<00:00:36.030> Wan<00:00:36.270> Jo<00:00:36.570> but

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
front of us here what new Wan Jo but

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.030 
front of us here what new Wan Jo but
what<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.250> basic<00:00:38.670> kimchi<00:00:39.480> kimchi<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.530> any

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
what is the basic kimchi kimchi is any

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.900 
what is the basic kimchi kimchi is any
type<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:42.350> fermented<00:00:43.350> vegetable<00:00:44.250> or<00:00:44.370> fruit<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
type of fermented vegetable or fruit and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.610 
type of fermented vegetable or fruit and
we<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.149> four<00:00:45.329> different<00:00:45.570> kinds<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.140> we've

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
we have four different kinds here we've

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.470 
we have four different kinds here we've
got<00:00:46.770> radish<00:00:47.160> kimchi<00:00:47.370> we've<00:00:47.820> got<00:00:48.000> cabbage

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
got radish kimchi we've got cabbage

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.540 
got radish kimchi we've got cabbage
kimchi<00:00:48.660> cucumber<00:00:49.620> kitchy<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> different

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
kimchi cucumber kitchy and a different

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.010 
kimchi cucumber kitchy and a different
type<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> cabbage<00:00:51.210> kimchi<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.539> isn't<00:00:51.899> that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
type of cabbage kimchi that isn't that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200 
type of cabbage kimchi that isn't that
spicy<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.680> basically<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> core<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> is

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
spicy but basically the core of it is

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.880 
spicy but basically the core of it is
that<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.930> fermented<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.680> goes

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
that it has to be fermented what goes

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.729 
that it has to be fermented what goes
into<00:00:56.160> fermenting<00:00:57.059> both<00:00:57.780> cabbage<00:00:58.320> kimchi<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
into fermenting both cabbage kimchi and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.020 
into fermenting both cabbage kimchi and
other<00:00:58.920> vegetables<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.670> cheese<00:00:59.820> as<00:01:00.000> well

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
other vegetables and cheese as well

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.029 
other vegetables and cheese as well
fermentation<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.050> different<00:01:01.440> than<00:01:01.559> pickling

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
fermentation is different than pickling

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.080 
fermentation is different than pickling
in<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.250> sense<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.579> there's<00:01:02.699> no<00:01:02.760> vinegar

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
in a sense that there's no vinegar

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.810 
in a sense that there's no vinegar
involved<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.350> basically<00:01:05.250> what<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.670> do

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
involved and so basically what you do

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.370 
involved and so basically what you do
here<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.270> brine<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> vegetables

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
here is you brine all the vegetables

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.230 
here is you brine all the vegetables
first<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> bit<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> salt<00:01:08.970> sometimes

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
first and a bit of a salt sometimes

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.660 
first and a bit of a salt sometimes
sugar<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.780> well<00:01:09.840> overnight<00:01:10.409> or<00:01:10.770> eight<00:01:11.280> hours

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
sugar as well overnight or eight hours

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.090 
sugar as well overnight or eight hours
and<00:01:11.880> then<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:13.020> rinse<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.439> off<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and then you rinse it off and then you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.649 
and then you rinse it off and then you
put<00:01:14.280> all<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> your<00:01:14.549> chilies<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.090> spices<00:01:15.150> some

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
put all of your chilies and spices some

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.780 
put all of your chilies and spices some
fish<00:01:15.869> sauce<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.560> let<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.950> sit<00:01:17.369> at

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
fish sauce and then you let that sit at

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.280 
fish sauce and then you let that sit at
room<00:01:17.850> temperature<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:18.960> all<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
room temperature and then all of that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.950 
room temperature and then all of that
lactic<00:01:20.189> acid<00:01:20.700> starts<00:01:21.060> forming<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.630> bubbling

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
lactic acid starts forming and bubbling

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.539 
lactic acid starts forming and bubbling
with<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> sugars<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.159> everything<00:01:23.430> it

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
with all the sugars and everything it

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.429 
with all the sugars and everything it
creates<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.970> almost<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.659> an<00:01:24.750> alcohol<00:01:25.170> so

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
creates it almost like an alcohol so

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.950 
creates it almost like an alcohol so
it's<00:01:26.009> similar<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> beer<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.030> sense<00:01:27.570> right

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it's similar to beer in that sense right

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.810 
it's similar to beer in that sense right
and<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.470> fermentation<00:01:28.829> process<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.670> what

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
and the fermentation process is what

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.999 
and the fermentation process is what
makes<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.509> incredibly<00:01:31.320> healthy<00:01:31.619> because

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
makes it so incredibly healthy because

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.670 
makes it so incredibly healthy because
that<00:01:32.159> lactic<00:01:32.549> acid<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.290> lactobacillus<00:01:34.290> which

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that lactic acid is lactobacillus which

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.710 
that lactic acid is lactobacillus which
is<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:35.759> good<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.150> your<00:01:36.210> guts<00:01:36.479> in

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
is really really good for your guts in

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.969 
is really really good for your guts in
one<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> super<00:01:37.409> foods<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.740> world

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
