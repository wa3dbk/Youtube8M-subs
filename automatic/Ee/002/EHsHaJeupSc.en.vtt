 millions of people in the world with 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.990
 diabetes 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.030
 diabetes is a disorder of 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.860
 metabolism that alters the process that 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.380
 convert the food we eat into 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.510
 Energy 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.570
 During digestion , the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.010
 foods to create glucose glucose 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.720
 is the sugar found in the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.870
 blood and is the biggest source of 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.970
 fuel for the body this glucose 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.770
 passes from the blood where the insulin 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.290
 allows to enter the cells so that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.990
 sugar in the body is leveled 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.960
 in people with diabetes one of the two 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.540
 components of this system fails the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.090
 pancreas does not produce or produce little 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.650
 insulin we call diabetes 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.230
 Type 1 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.600
 or the cells of the body do not respond to 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.340
 the insulin that is produced to which 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.340
 it is known as type 2 diabetes 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.560
 1.3 million people die a year to 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.470
 cause of this disease and it is estimated that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.920
 for the year 2030 the number of patients 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.340
 with diabetes doubles to 440 million 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.430
 of patients the world organization of 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.380
 health estimates that around 5.4 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.560
 millions of people do not know that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.610
 they have diabetes as the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.880
 time we think that only one donates 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.510
 it's just a donut and some cookies is 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.530
 just a donate cookies and soda but 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.470
 not only is that obesity is consumption 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.190
 excessive fat and these are the 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.800
 main causes of diabetes 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.190
 every minute die in the world six 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.930
 people because of diabetes you already 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.930
 do you do something to prevent diabetes 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.450
 the cnimme is a tree with abundant 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.090
 branches that reach 10 meters 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.940
 height is a species native to the

 Indian and belongs to the family of 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.730
 Seaweed already adapts in dry areas and 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.390
 hot because of its low water requirement 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.420
 and land also grows very fast in the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.700
 india this tree is of total relevance 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.700
 It is used medicinally
