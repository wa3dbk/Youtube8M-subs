gradient the gold shadow that we applied

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:37.610

on<00:02:29.700> first

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.070 

let<00:02:38.430> me<00:02:38.550> apply<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.790> same<00:02:39.150> shadow<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.660> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
center part of your bottom lid I

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.430 
center part of your bottom lid I
realized<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.420> they<00:02:42.540> like<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.720> emphasize<00:02:43.290> how

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
realized that they like to emphasize how

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.080 
realized that they like to emphasize how
it<00:02:43.620> goes<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.950> lot<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.370> that's<00:02:44.610> what<00:02:44.760> they<00:02:44.880> tend

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it goes a lot so that's what they tend

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.060 
it goes a lot so that's what they tend
to<00:02:45.210> do<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.630> then<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.200> also<00:02:46.290> applied<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
to do and then I also applied it to the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.300 
to do and then I also applied it to the
inner<00:02:47.280> corner<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.790> your<00:02:47.940> eyes<00:02:48.920> then<00:02:49.920> with<00:02:50.100> any

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
inner corner of your eyes then with any

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.950 
inner corner of your eyes then with any
brown<00:02:50.610> eyeliner<00:02:51.090> prints<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.600> your<00:02:51.630> choice

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
brown eyeliner prints of your choice

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.020 
brown eyeliner prints of your choice
we're<00:02:52.170> going<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.530> line<00:02:52.770> our<00:02:53.040> bottom<00:02:53.430> lashline

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
we're going to line our bottom lashline

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.140 
we're going to line our bottom lashline
I<00:02:54.300> didn't<00:02:54.960> have<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> thin<00:02:55.770> regular<00:02:56.310> brown<00:02:56.880> liner

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
I didn't have a thin regular brown liner

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.180 
I didn't have a thin regular brown liner
so<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.450> had<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.810> go<00:02:57.960> for<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.350> next<00:02:58.740> jump<00:02:59.010> up

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
so I had to go for this next jump up

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.920 
so I had to go for this next jump up
until<00:03:01.310> then<00:03:02.310> with<00:03:02.490> ami<00:03:02.790> black<00:03:03.330> eyeliner

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
until then with ami black eyeliner

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.750 
until then with ami black eyeliner
prints<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.380> your<00:03:04.500> choice<00:03:04.740> just<00:03:05.010> go<00:03:05.190> ahead<00:03:05.280> and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
prints of your choice just go ahead and

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.670 
prints of your choice just go ahead and
tight<00:03:06.120> line<00:03:06.330> your<00:03:06.360> top<00:03:06.900> waterline<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:13.020> for

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
tight line your top waterline and for

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.680 
tight line your top waterline and for
this<00:03:13.830> lecture<00:03:14.190> has<00:03:14.340> two<00:03:14.580> wings<00:03:14.880> going<00:03:15.210> on<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:15.660> I

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
this lecture has two wings going on so I

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.420 
this lecture has two wings going on so I
thought<00:03:16.050> maybe<00:03:16.230> using<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.800> liquid<00:03:16.980> pen<00:03:17.280> would

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
thought maybe using a liquid pen would

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.520 
thought maybe using a liquid pen would
be<00:03:17.550> a<00:03:17.580> lot<00:03:17.820> better<00:03:18.020> we're<00:03:19.020> gonna<00:03:19.140> start<00:03:19.440> off

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
be a lot better we're gonna start off

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.410 
be a lot better we're gonna start off
with<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.800> bottom<00:03:20.010> one<00:03:20.160> first<00:03:20.580> extend<00:03:21.090> me<00:03:21.180> from

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
with the bottom one first extend me from

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.170 
with the bottom one first extend me from
the<00:03:21.840> bottom<00:03:22.170> lashline<00:03:22.710> outwards<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.520> then

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
the bottom lashline outwards and then

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.240 
the bottom lashline outwards and then
I'm<00:03:24.480> just<00:03:24.630> dragging<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.110> in<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.560> fileted<00:03:25.890> and

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
I'm just dragging it in and fileted and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.060 
I'm just dragging it in and fileted and
ever<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.030> slightly<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.960> then<00:03:28.530> after<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:28.890> was

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
ever so slightly and then after I was

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.950 
ever so slightly and then after I was
done<00:03:29.220> with<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.850> will<00:03:30.030> go<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.300> top<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.840> kind

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
done with that I will go on top and kind

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.780 
done with that I will go on top and kind
of<00:03:31.080> just<00:03:31.260> make<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> little<00:03:31.710> V<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.400> guess

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
of just make it like a little V I guess

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.300 
of just make it like a little V I guess
you<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.060> say<00:03:33.500> she's<00:03:34.500> kind<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.740> hard<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:34.980> try<00:03:35.250> to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
you can say she's kind of hard to try to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.920 
you can say she's kind of hard to try to
explain<00:03:35.670> this<00:03:35.850> but<00:03:36.120> as<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.540> guys<00:03:36.720> can<00:03:36.870> see

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
explain this but as you guys can see

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.710 
explain this but as you guys can see
it's<00:03:37.260> kind<00:03:37.530> of<00:03:37.590> more<00:03:37.950> like<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.190> fishtail<00:03:38.720> you

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
it's kind of more like a fishtail you

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.140 
it's kind of more like a fishtail you
know<00:03:39.900> or<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.230> guess<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.130> by<00:03:41.280> watching<00:03:41.489> it's<00:03:42.000> a

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
know or I guess just by watching it's a

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.920 
know or I guess just by watching it's a
lot<00:03:42.300> easier<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.959> understand<00:03:44.780> remember<00:03:45.780> to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
lot easier to understand remember to

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.270 
lot easier to understand remember to
keep<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:46.320> mind<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.739> when<00:03:46.890> you're<00:03:47.040> creating

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
keep in mind that when you're creating

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.400 
keep in mind that when you're creating
these<00:03:47.580> two<00:03:47.850> winged<00:03:48.120> liner<00:03:48.360> don't<00:03:49.110> make<00:03:49.260> them

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
these two winged liner don't make them

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.380 
these two winged liner don't make them
too<00:03:49.680> thick<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.459> always<00:03:50.790> want<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.060> keep<00:03:51.209> them

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
too thick you always want to keep them

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.720 
too thick you always want to keep them
fairly<00:03:51.870> thin<00:03:52.320> because<00:03:52.709> she<00:03:53.220> doesn't<00:03:53.580> wear

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
fairly thin because she doesn't wear

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.790 
fairly thin because she doesn't wear
thick<00:03:54.150> liner<00:03:54.540> at<00:03:54.810> all<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.230> only<00:03:55.380> thing<00:03:55.500> that

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800
