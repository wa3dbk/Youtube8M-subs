00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
when you look at you know when you when

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.940 
when you look at you know when you when
you<00:02:23.250> compare<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> two<00:02:23.879> shows<00:02:24.120> NXT<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.049> what

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
we got at TLC I guess NXT was still a

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.640 
we got at TLC I guess NXT was still a
bit<00:02:29.250> better<00:02:29.489> than<00:02:29.730> what<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.030> got<00:02:30.180> at<00:02:30.330> TLC<00:02:30.690> but

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
bit better than what we got at TLC but

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.589 
bit better than what we got at TLC but
you<00:02:31.830> know<00:02:31.920> that's<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:32.340> terms<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.819> how<00:02:33.299> things

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
you know that's in terms of how things

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.140
