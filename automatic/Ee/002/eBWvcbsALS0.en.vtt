and they came up with some kind of a
dial<00:01:42.060> coating<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.659> think<00:01:42.869> they<00:01:42.960> call<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.350> that

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100

it<00:01:44.220> doesn't<00:01:44.549> scratch<00:01:44.850> most<00:01:45.360> titanium<00:01:45.930> watches

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it doesn't scratch most titanium watches

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.410 
it doesn't scratch most titanium watches
scratch<00:01:46.680> very<00:01:46.979> easily<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.939> really<00:01:48.270> get

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
scratch very easily and they really get

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.200 
scratch very easily and they really get
scratched<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:49.079> quick<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:50.009> has<00:01:50.640> virtually<00:01:50.850> no

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
about right so that's the only reason

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.330
