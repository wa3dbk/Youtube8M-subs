00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
boss in just a moment and that is going

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.730

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
to be a different video and so this is

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.560 
to be a different video and so this is
basically<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.909> mob<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.820> I'm<00:01:42.970> thinking<00:01:43.420> is

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
basically the mob what I'm thinking is

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.289 
basically the mob what I'm thinking is
it's<00:01:43.870> all<00:01:44.049> death<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.650> decay<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.040> maybe<00:01:45.940> in<00:01:46.180> the

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
it's all death and decay so maybe in the

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.890 
it's all death and decay so maybe in the
future<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:47.500> will<00:01:47.560> be<00:01:48.549> kind<00:01:48.850> of<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.060> dark<00:01:49.330> our
