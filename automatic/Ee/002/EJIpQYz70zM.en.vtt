00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
little calibration across here so I was

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.880 
little calibration across here so I was
just<00:03:19.010> telling<00:03:19.340> me<00:03:19.580> just<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:20.200> import<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:21.830> click

just telling me just to import and click
that<00:03:22.520> little<00:03:22.760> red<00:03:22.880> dot<00:03:23.000> this<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.630> can

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
that little red dot this I can

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.030 
that little red dot this I can
recalibrate<00:03:24.260> is<00:03:24.620> what

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
recalibrate is what

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.559 
recalibrate is what
go<00:03:25.700> in<00:03:26.360> there<00:03:26.629> and<00:03:27.459> push<00:03:28.459> on<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.790> down<00:03:29.329> there

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
go in there and push on it down there

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.509 
go in there and push on it down there
and<00:03:30.610> on<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.819> other<00:03:31.849> side<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.989> as<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.040> see<00:03:34.310> now

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
and on the other side and as you see now

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.059 
and on the other side and as you see now
it<00:03:34.670> actually<00:03:34.989> has<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.019> really<00:03:36.140> recalibrated

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
it actually has a really recalibrated

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.640 
it actually has a really recalibrated
you<00:03:37.220> can<00:03:37.370> see<00:03:37.549> that<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:37.879> quite<00:03:38.120> accurate<00:03:38.650> so

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
you can see that it is quite accurate so

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.309 
you can see that it is quite accurate so
I<00:03:39.739> can<00:03:39.890> here<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.129> play<00:03:40.340> again<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.780> what<00:03:42.079> you<00:03:42.200> can

see here is there's a few different
options<00:03:43.459> on<00:03:43.819> the<00:03:43.909> side<00:03:44.150> here<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.540> we<00:03:44.659> have<00:03:44.870> so

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
options on the side here that we have so

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.420 
options on the side here that we have so
I<00:03:45.140> can<00:03:45.230> use<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.680> for<00:03:45.860> a<00:03:45.890> PowerPoint

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
I can use it for a PowerPoint

writing emails as well but what I want

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.800 
writing emails as well but what I want
to<00:03:55.400> do<00:03:55.519> here<00:03:55.819> is<00:03:55.849> I<00:03:56.000> just<00:03:56.209> want<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.480> click<00:03:56.659> on

to do here is I just want to click on

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.869 
to do here is I just want to click on
screen<00:03:57.079> writing<00:03:57.409> over<00:03:57.650> here<00:03:57.980> which<00:03:58.670> is<00:03:58.790> the

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
screen writing over here which is the

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.460 
screen writing over here which is the
one<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.120> I<00:03:59.209> probably<00:03:59.390> use<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.959> most<00:03:59.989> which

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
one that I probably use the most which

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.319 
one that I probably use the most which
is<00:04:00.500> just<00:04:00.829> by<00:04:00.950> annotating<00:04:01.400> so<00:04:01.970> once<00:04:02.180> you've

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
is just by annotating so once you've

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.970 
is just by annotating so once you've
clicked<00:04:02.599> that<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:03.260> can<00:04:03.409> write<00:04:03.560> anywhere<00:04:03.799> on

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
clicked that you can write anywhere on

clicked that you can write anywhere on
the<00:04:04.069> screen<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.670> you'll<00:04:05.090> see<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.569> I'll

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
the screen and you'll see that I'll

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.869 
the screen and you'll see that I'll
start<00:04:06.079> to<00:04:06.379> a<00:04:06.620> draw<00:04:07.099> which<00:04:07.280> is<00:04:07.310> really<00:04:07.670> good<00:04:07.849> for

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
start to a draw which is really good for

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.520 
start to a draw which is really good for
entertaining<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:08.810> I'm<00:04:09.049> doing<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.349> presentation

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
entertaining so I'm doing a presentation

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.430 
entertaining so I'm doing a presentation
and<00:04:10.190> I<00:04:10.250> have<00:04:10.400> a<00:04:10.430> projector<00:04:11.060> setup<00:04:11.840> on<00:04:12.079> momi

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
and I have a projector setup on momi

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.710 
and I have a projector setup on momi
then<00:04:12.859> what<00:04:13.010> I<00:04:13.040> can<00:04:13.310> do<00:04:13.459> is<00:04:13.609> I<00:04:13.730> can<00:04:13.790> annotate<00:04:14.150> on

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
then what I can do is I can annotate on

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.539 
then what I can do is I can annotate on
my<00:04:14.900> notebook<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:15.560> obviously<00:04:16.250> going<00:04:16.489> to

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
my notebook and obviously going to

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.210 
my notebook and obviously going to
reflect<00:04:16.789> that<00:04:17.120> on<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.720> projector<00:04:18.560> screen<00:04:18.859> so

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
reflect that on the projector screen so

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.550 
reflect that on the projector screen so
I'm<00:04:19.370> running<00:04:19.639> ink<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.180> one<00:04:20.419> here<00:04:20.780> as<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.410> can

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
I'm running ink I one here as you can

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:30.640 
I'm running ink I one here as you can
see<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.829> is<00:04:21.949> quite<00:04:22.220> accurate

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.800 

it's<00:04:31.100> amazing<00:04:31.580> ok<00:04:31.790> so<00:04:31.850> like<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.270> said<00:04:32.330> earlier

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
it's amazing ok so like I said earlier

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.420 
it's amazing ok so like I said earlier
this<00:04:32.990> unit<00:04:33.260> won't<00:04:33.410> just<00:04:33.710> work<00:04:33.890> on<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.250> one

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
this unit won't just work on the one

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.000 
this unit won't just work on the one
surface<00:04:34.730> works<00:04:35.240> on<00:04:35.450> all<00:04:35.690> services<00:04:36.290> so<00:04:36.740> as<00:04:36.890> you

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
surface works on all services so as you

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.680 
surface works on all services so as you
can<00:04:37.130> see<00:04:37.370> here<00:04:37.610> I've<00:04:37.730> got<00:04:37.760> a<00:04:37.940> pin<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.480> top

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
can see here I've got a pin to the top

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.810 
can see here I've got a pin to the top
piece<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:38.930> my<00:04:39.200> paper<00:04:39.500> here<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:39.980> I<00:04:40.580> can<00:04:40.730> also

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
piece of my paper here and I can also

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.120 
piece of my paper here and I can also
take<00:04:41.240> it<00:04:41.420> off<00:04:41.510> your<00:04:41.720> in<00:04:41.810> turn<00:04:41.960> on<00:04:42.290> my<00:04:42.440> tabletop

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
take it off your in turn on my tabletop

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.190 
take it off your in turn on my tabletop
and<00:04:43.370> effectively<00:04:43.910> whatever<00:04:44.270> I<00:04:44.390> write<00:04:44.720> on<00:04:44.960> here

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
and effectively whatever I write on here

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.510 
and effectively whatever I write on here
will<00:04:45.440> automatically<00:04:46.400> input<00:04:47.000> into<00:04:47.360> my<00:04:48.250> PC<00:04:49.250> here

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
will automatically input into my PC here

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.490 
will automatically input into my PC here
now<00:04:49.880> if<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.090> want<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.330> recalibrate<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:51.110> like<00:04:51.320> I

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
now if I want to recalibrate it like I

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.080 
now if I want to recalibrate it like I
said<00:04:51.560> you<00:04:51.830> can<00:04:52.010> just<00:04:52.040> go<00:04:52.340> into<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.730> software

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
said you can just go into the software

said you can just go into the software
and<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.690> can<00:04:53.720> recalibrate<00:04:54.230> it<00:04:54.590> that<00:04:54.770> way<00:04:54.950> to

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
and you can recalibrate it that way to

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.410 
and you can recalibrate it that way to
make<00:04:55.310> sure<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.550> you're<00:04:55.790> getting<00:04:55.910> procedure

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
make sure that you're getting procedure

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.540 
make sure that you're getting procedure
with<00:04:56.630> what<00:04:56.810> you're<00:04:56.960> writing<00:04:57.200> ok<00:04:57.980> so<00:04:58.040> this<00:04:58.280> unit

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
with what you're writing ok so this unit
