00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.529
 Welcome to my today 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.630
 gameplay or says tutorial about stars 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.590
 and republic as you do in the west and on the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.570
 fastest level core from 1 to 50 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.279
 or now from the update from 1 to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.710
 60 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.109
 That's how we start with basic tips 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.119
 the first one I can always give 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.490
 xp boost i believe for good 90 kartell 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.579
 You can do that to acquire one, that is 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.460
 a significant xp boost is effective 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.590
 for three hours and on any rp 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.969
 acts on war zone obtained 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:49.379
 There are pvp story or quest in there 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.309
 even in a smaller format for 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.469
 an hour of cost equal to 40 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.489
 or it may take 50 to make one can but 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.440
 also buy in the auction house for what 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.180
 I think I would always recommend that 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.650
 Greater pack to pick because you too 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.549
 much on the xoom endeffekt 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.799
 credits always saves money 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.670
 have 25 percent ep and power 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.950
 something from the next bus is the one 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.220
 always has with which he is still on 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.619
 should say that one is like that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.049
 Guild ep bonus arrives on funds 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.290
 maximum are ten percent ep the one 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.060
 but always there is that and that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.509
 means you should look for a guild 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.390
 should have a look you can see the top right 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.229
 Guild experience bonus with man 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.759
 can then see is maximum or 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.610
 There are not other farmyard bean 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.610
 bonis but we are going straight from the ep 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.680
 drive so if you have done it all 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.659
 it is easy to level quickly 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.700
 I will briefly summarize now 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.340
 and twice, of course, starts with the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.579
 story quests and of course I would 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.979
 say that the joke at 20 in any case 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.899
 all quests will definitely be on of 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.350
 At first, planets make all the quests 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.360
 by leveling until you are all 20 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.830
 then as I do with every character 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.560
 I had done so far too 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.940
 Well developed was a mixture of pvp 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.470
 and this flashpoint for a while 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.800
 certain update which I know myself 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.200
 not exactly says extras there is one 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.470
 mini called kurt 3 where you drive from 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:30.330
 level 15 down to level 54 can run 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.610
 that brings you accordingly 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.349
 actually always a group finds the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.390
 with one can go in and thus 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.510
 teamed extremely lp and always to the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.459
 people never end up in the puszta 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.850
 use if you submit the quest that 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.910
 it completely meaningless much better 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.560
 it's more like the ep bus in front of you 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.110
 sentences say the moment you go in 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.680
 you have to be the person because there is 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.650
 several reasons first the mobs 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.660
 bring an incredible amount of ep that is 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.810
 unbelievably much more than 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.920
 So we really take standard pug 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.890
 at times 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.170
 let's say twice 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.480
 three times as much then come 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.069
 contrary to add it more bosses 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.769
 Variable at the end, there is a belief 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.640
 Either a clone warrior easily 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.829
 take care of 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.299
 but you should still be with the group 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.040
 So in the rhine go over the groups 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.100
 he finds himself wrong on the map 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.569
 you always find losses 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.290
 Just jump in and put it in quickly 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.660
 beginning very easy to level course 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.280
 Personally, I would say I would 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.530
 Rom and Karl quickly finished because that is 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.420
 for me as the most uncomfortable level 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.450
 then I would say 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.560
 the main thing is to do that so far 430, 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:54.410
 does not take long you have a bit 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:04:00.840
 fun and level 30 is good level 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:06.360
 Look through 40 questing stories and continue 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.520
 we go with let's say you have 540 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.680
 then reaches in any case story 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.740
 make story story up to 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.790
 the point where you are invited to mag 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.590
 you do not need the main story 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.090
 In any case , Akep will keep track of it for a long time 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.519
 Flying directly on the planet Mars 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.160
 There any quest really does 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.950
 brings the most ep of any planet 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.090
 man is relatively fast and also 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.860
 The story Chris is best done 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.960
 with the guild, however, the friend 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.760
 Take along at the same level 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.470
 or just people who are there asking 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.340
 because the faster the faster 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:41.190
 it's quicker if you then 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.290
 say we should have level 54 then 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.640
 relatively fast go to more detailed videos 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.450
 and details with all things I will 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.480
 still bring 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.600
 From then on, I would just say 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.250
 flashpoints by shooting or simply 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.530
 just a few more quests on others 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:00.060
 planet do then do you have the 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.890
 550 from 55 to 60 now with the new one 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.010
 update I expect to make a new one 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:08.820
 where I exactly every single person 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:15.620
 and say anything about who does it until then 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.620
 it's good and always thumbs up
