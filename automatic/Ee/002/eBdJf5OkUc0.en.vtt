00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
I've now got to the point where I can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.060 
I've now got to the point where I can
think<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.780> totally<00:01:43.200> obscure<00:01:43.560> things<00:01:43.860> like

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
think about totally obscure things like

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.469 
think about totally obscure things like
shop<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.700> stuff<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.210> still<00:01:45.420> be

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
shop in and stuff like that and still be

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.179 
shop in and stuff like that and still be
keeping<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> pressure<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.159> a

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
keeping the pressure on and it's a

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.560 
keeping the pressure on and it's a
really<00:01:47.400> important<00:01:47.970> race<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.390> just

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
really important race to just

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.600 
really important race to just
concentrate<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.890> know<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.280> feeling

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
concentrate on you know that feeling

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.740 
concentrate on you know that feeling
when<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:51.030> absolutely<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> edge

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
when you're absolutely on the edge

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.020 
when you're absolutely on the edge
you're<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> limit<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.830> threshold<00:01:53.759> power

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you're on the limit of threshold power

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.240 
you're on the limit of threshold power
you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.420> you're<00:01:55.200> producing<00:01:55.439> lactic<00:01:55.860> acid<00:01:56.189> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you can you're producing lactic acid you
