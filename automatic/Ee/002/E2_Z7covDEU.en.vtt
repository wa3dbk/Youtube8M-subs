00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.689
 hello my name is the time I want 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.090
 present to your attention a cycle of gears 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.279
 how do the extras think where will i be 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.580
 analyze tactical decisions about the top 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.730
 case studies and tactics 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.730
 formed and knowledge of tth tank profitable 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.590
 positions on the map and will wbr therefore 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.260
 look remember and apply map 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.469
 highway bottom respawn our hero on 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.559
 Japanese middle tank level ten 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:53.270
 stb-1 going to the left squares one where 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.270
 there is a wonderful position 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.760
 great from this position 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.969
 review which in stb-1 neither more nor 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.920
 less than 410 meters 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.070
 Aubrey installed optics yes in theory 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.170
 the quality of their heel crew eagle eye 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.630
 radio intercepts fighting brotherhood our review 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.149
 equal to 400 45 meters with a good 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.360
 coefficient which lowers the enemy 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.280
 disguise 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.350
 also from this position excellent range 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:31.380
 visibility and hills and terrain 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:34.229
 can open the body of our tank gun 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.049
 protrusions one leans on cheers already on 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.459
 a whole minus 10 degrees down and plus 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.679
 13 degrees up 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:44.659
 what makes this position even more 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.659
 useful for supporting allied tanks 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.820
 stb-1 tank little armored but 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.590
 this have ricocheted sloping armor in 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.850
 frontal projection as vld and in the tower 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.459
 so to tank from the tower is quite 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.899
 real, but that doesn't mean our tower 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.899
 no one can pierce 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.989
 relatively then quiet stb-1 we understand 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.409
 why our hero took exactly this 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.409
 position 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.209
 and now our hero is left alone 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.040
 three on this flank and certainly 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.140
 the only correct solution is 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.640
 hang out closer to the base highlighting 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.799
 opponents of the Allied arte 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.739
 while not getting extra damage by 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.290
 our tank is why we choose 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.590
 trajectory of movement in such a way that 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.030
 there were obstacles between us and the enemy 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.690
 to make the enemy as difficult as possible 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.609
 get us 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.500
 you can only stay on the move 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:01.989
 keep fighting is n't it 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.239
 like our guns van -10 degrees 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.400
 accordingly we play from the tower 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.079
 so that between us the enemy 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.079
 there was this fold 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.859
 see that loreyna full speed 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.379
 comes to us in the stern 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:22.129
 we do a symmetrical maneuver and again 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.129
 go over the hill 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.410
 there are two of us left against five 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.390
 artillery most likely based 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.519
 St-1 did not glow but most likely on the left 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.830
 since we got a couple spank from him on 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.050
 Zelenka so go go highlights our 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.690
 arte platoons of their own who go with 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.319
 cities switch to cumulative 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.970
 shells 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.489
 since they have elevated 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:59.010
 armor penetration which with distance is not 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.700
 loses its properties carefully 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.160
 we aim 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.440
 as cumulative shells fly 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.510
 somewhat longer than normal armor piercing or 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.510
 subcaliber yes and you need to win 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.860
 Art-1 very good armor 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.979
 which means butting with him in the forehead for us is not 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.919
 option especially since he has 400 thousand 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.509
 hp against our 600 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.680
 so working at a distance not 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.680
 getting extra damage 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.050
 in this case we need 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.510
 take advantage of the effect of surprise 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.550
 to put at least one 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.550
 several shots without php exchanges 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.460
 seek shelter for bushes or fallen 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.930
 trees to light up the enemy and 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.930
 damage first 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.740
 St-1 is not illuminated so it means 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.469
 hid behind the building in this case we 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.729
 use the dynamics of stb-1 is 20 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.919
 horsepower per ton 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.169
 and trying to twist the sluggish 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.889
 Soviet heavyweight still have nowhere to go 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.889
 need to win 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:23.490
 what are we going for arta 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.509
 Yes, do not forget that she may well 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.509
 send us to the hangar 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.949
 here we are not lit up not because 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.430
 us good disguise 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:38.949
 or between us bushes but only because 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.530
 between the dimensional points of our tank and 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.110
 points of view of enemy art was 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.900
 obstacle in the form of a water tower 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.069
 thanks to which we go with impunity 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.069
 make the seventh fragment 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.790
 well, the results of the battle speak for themselves 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.729
 I hope you enjoyed this video and 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:18.879
 will help make the right decisions in 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:21.870
 difficult situations with you was lech to 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.870
 rend meetings
