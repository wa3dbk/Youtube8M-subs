your laptop so it may be running in the
7<00:00:15.900> Windows<00:00:16.500> 8<00:00:16.770> or<00:00:17.100> Windows<00:00:17.220> 8.1<00:00:17.670> but<00:00:18.630> will<00:00:18.810> work

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
7 Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 but will work

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.470 
7 Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 but will work
on<00:00:19.199> all<00:00:19.380> three<00:00:19.770> versions<00:00:19.980> here<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.240> basically

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
on all three versions here so basically

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.570 
on all three versions here so basically
what<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.260> need<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.830> go<00:00:23.039> into<00:00:23.160> your<00:00:23.279> PC

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
what you need to do is go into your PC

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.060 
what you need to do is go into your PC
settings<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.630> Windows<00:00:25.019> 7<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.529> need<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.920> go

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
settings so in Windows 7 you need to go

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.550 
settings so in Windows 7 you need to go
to<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.250> start<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.760> right<00:00:27.720> click<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.349> my

computer and go to the properties in

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.170 
computer and go to the properties in
windows<00:00:31.289> 8<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.529> 8.1<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.520> need<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.759> go<00:00:32.910> here

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
windows 8 and 8.1 you need to go here

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.470 
windows 8 and 8.1 you need to go here
into<00:00:33.570> PC<00:00:34.020> info<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:35.550> take<00:00:35.760> your<00:00:35.790> ran<00:00:36.180> here

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
into PC info and just take your ran here

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.610 
into PC info and just take your ran here
so<00:00:37.170> mine<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.530> 4<00:00:38.309> gigabytes<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.600> then<00:00:40.469> you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
so mine is 4 gigabytes here and then you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.000 
so mine is 4 gigabytes here and then you
need<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.129> into<00:00:41.340> advanced<00:00:41.700> system<00:00:42.059> settings

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
need to go into advanced system settings

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.139 
need to go into advanced system settings
then<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.370> window<00:00:44.520> will<00:00:44.730> appear

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
then this window will appear

appear and then go to advanced and hit

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.029 
appear and then go to advanced and hit
on<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> change<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.770> this

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
on the change so here you can see this

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.250 
on the change so here you can see this
window<00:00:53.489> will<00:00:53.670> appear<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.930> need<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
window will appear so here you need to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.380 
window will appear so here you need to
actually<00:00:55.469> uncheck<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.430> automatically

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
actually uncheck the automatically

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.529 
actually uncheck the automatically
manage<00:00:57.750> paging<00:00:57.780> file<00:00:58.469> size<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:59.010> all<00:00:59.160> drivers

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
manage paging file size for all drivers

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.500 
manage paging file size for all drivers
and<00:01:00.539> check<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.199> custom<00:01:01.559> size<00:01:01.829> then<00:01:02.699> need<00:01:03.059> you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and check the custom size then need you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.550 
and check the custom size then need you
go<00:01:03.870> ahead<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.530> open<00:01:04.589> your<00:01:05.270> calculator<00:01:06.270> so

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.770 

open<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.680> calculator<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:11.780> you'll

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
open your calculator and then you'll

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.149 
open your calculator and then you'll
just<00:01:12.990> type<00:01:13.170> 1<00:01:13.470> 0<00:01:13.860> 2<00:01:14.070> 4<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.030> 1<00:01:15.869> 0<00:01:15.900> 2<00:01:16.259> 4<00:01:16.500> M<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.860> equal

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
just type 1 0 2 4 so 1 0 2 4 M is equal

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.820 
just type 1 0 2 4 so 1 0 2 4 M is equal
to<00:01:17.189> 1<00:01:17.460> GB<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.960> see<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.530> MB

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
to 1 GB so here you can see it's in MB

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.310 
to 1 GB so here you can see it's in MB
so<00:01:20.100> we'll<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.659> multiplied<00:01:21.659> by<00:01:21.689> your<00:01:22.020> RAM

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
so we'll do this multiplied by your RAM

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.030 
so we'll do this multiplied by your RAM
so<00:01:22.770> mine<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:22.979> 4<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.670> x<00:01:24.090> 4<00:01:24.479> equals<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> 4<00:01:25.380> 0<00:01:25.409> 9<00:01:25.770> 6

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
so mine is 4 so x 4 equals to 4 0 9 6

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.380 
so mine is 4 so x 4 equals to 4 0 9 6
and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:26.970> x<00:01:28.040> 10.5<00:01:29.040> equals<00:01:30.030> 6<00:01:30.360> 1<00:01:30.659> 4<00:01:31.380> 4<00:01:31.939> then<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and then x 10.5 equals 6 1 4 4 then you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.390 
and then x 10.5 equals 6 1 4 4 then you
just<00:01:33.630> copy<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.290> paste<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.740> over<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:34.920> on

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
just copy that and paste it over here on

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.910 
just copy that and paste it over here on
the<00:01:35.880> initial<00:01:36.299> size<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.750> well<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.110> maximum<00:01:37.560> size

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the initial size as well as maximum size

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.170 
the initial size as well as maximum size
then<00:01:38.700> hit<00:01:38.939> OK<00:01:39.450> ok<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:41.159> won't<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.759> again<00:01:41.850> I

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
then hit OK ok and I won't do it again I

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.389 
then hit OK ok and I won't do it again I
just<00:01:42.360> did<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.829> will<00:01:43.890> ask<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.369> to

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
just did it so it will ask you to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.380 
just did it so it will ask you to
restart<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:45.299> computer<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:47.670> let<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> chain

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
restart your computer to let the chain

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.870 
restart your computer to let the chain
this<00:01:48.540> work<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.950> will<00:01:50.340> show<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.549> how<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
this work then I will show you how the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.660 
this work then I will show you how the
DRAM<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.540> actually<00:01:52.020> increased<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.520> to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
DRAM is actually increased so going to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.370 
DRAM is actually increased so going to
calculator<00:01:54.090> again<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.250> 1<00:01:56.820> 0<00:01:57.119> 2<00:01:57.479> 4<00:01:57.810> x<00:01:58.799> 4<00:01:59.460> equals

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
calculator again so a 1 0 2 4 x 4 equals

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.060 
calculator again so a 1 0 2 4 x 4 equals
this<00:02:01.380> into<00:02:02.149> 1.5<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.390> mine<00:02:03.540> was<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
this into 1.5 so mine was this so it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.719 
this into 1.5 so mine was this so it
will<00:02:05.280> divided<00:02:05.579> by<00:02:05.790> 1<00:02:06.119> 0<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.719> 4<00:02:07.200> again<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.829> there

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
will divided by 1 0 to 4 again and there

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.339 
will divided by 1 0 to 4 again and there
you<00:02:08.849> go<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.390> RAM<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.720> increased

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
you go your RAM is increased
