away and your opponent is still coming
in<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.190> can<00:02:12.340> use<00:02:12.550> this<00:02:12.760> leg<00:02:13.090> top<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.780> ball<00:02:13.959> or

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
in you can use this leg top the ball or

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.730 
in you can use this leg top the ball or
touch<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.400> ball<00:02:15.580> in<00:02:15.790> any<00:02:16.030> direction<00:02:16.500> right<00:02:17.500> or

I'm coming I'm doing it real slow

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.949 
I'm coming I'm doing it real slow
remember<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.950> essence<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.519> footwork<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.660> not

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
remember the essence of footwork is not

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.830 
remember the essence of footwork is not
just<00:02:59.319> to<00:02:59.560> use<00:02:59.830> speed<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.850> show<00:03:01.060> how<00:03:01.269> fast<00:03:01.569> you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
just to use speed to show how fast you

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.900 
just to use speed to show how fast you
can<00:03:01.959> do<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.260> for<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.519> get<00:03:03.700> your

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
can do the for it is to get your

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.160 
can do the for it is to get your
opponent's<00:03:04.780> or<00:03:05.500> opponent<00:03:06.280> off<00:03:06.519> balance<00:03:07.170> that

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
opponent's or opponent off balance that

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.320 
opponent's or opponent off balance that
is<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.650> essence<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.280> four<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:09.819> if<00:03:10.090> you

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
is the essence of four and if you

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.600 
is the essence of four and if you
violated<00:03:10.959> that<00:03:10.989> principle<00:03:11.650> by<00:03:12.069> trying<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.430> use

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
violated that principle by trying to use

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.449 
violated that principle by trying to use
speed<00:03:13.030> over<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.540> ball<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.830> show<00:03:15.040> off<00:03:15.190> by

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
speed over the ball and to show off by

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.860 
speed over the ball and to show off by
how<00:03:15.640> fast<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.060> can<00:03:16.209> do<00:03:16.299> forwards<00:03:16.690> you're

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
how fast you can do forwards you're

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.360 
how fast you can do forwards you're
defeating<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.440> purpose<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:18.040> will<00:03:18.130> walk

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
defeating the purpose you will walk

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.479 
defeating the purpose you will walk
forward<00:03:18.700> skills<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:20.410> in<00:03:20.560> essence<00:03:20.980> it's<00:03:21.220> very

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
forward skills so in essence it's very

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.030 
forward skills so in essence it's very
important<00:03:22.030> for<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.780> understand<00:03:23.440> that

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
important for you to understand that

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.570 
important for you to understand that
your<00:03:24.280> footwork<00:03:24.700> speed<00:03:25.150> must<00:03:25.599> vary<00:03:26.580> inversely

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
your footwork speed must vary inversely

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.690 
your footwork speed must vary inversely
I<00:03:28.620> don't<00:03:29.620> know<00:03:29.709> some<00:03:29.920> mathematically<00:03:30.519> right

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
I don't know some mathematically right

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.520 
I don't know some mathematically right
now<00:03:30.820> inversely<00:03:31.120> proportional<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.350> of

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
now inversely proportional to that of

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.800 
now inversely proportional to that of
your<00:03:32.709> opponents<00:03:33.280> who<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.850> coming<00:03:34.239> in<00:03:34.480> toward

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
your opponents who is coming in toward

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.050 
your opponents who is coming in toward
you<00:03:35.170> so<00:03:35.650> if<00:03:35.769> your<00:03:36.160> opponent<00:03:36.609> is<00:03:36.670> coming<00:03:36.970> in

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
you so if your opponent is coming in

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.360 
you so if your opponent is coming in
fast<00:03:37.299> for<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.290> ball<00:03:38.500> your<00:03:38.739> footwork<00:03:39.070> should

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
fast for the ball your footwork should

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.400 
fast for the ball your footwork should
be<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.519> little<00:03:39.760> bit<00:03:39.850> slow<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.299> if<00:03:40.810> your<00:03:40.959> opponent

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
be a little bit slow so if your opponent

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.770 
be a little bit slow so if your opponent
is<00:03:41.500> coming<00:03:41.530> in<00:03:41.920> slow<00:03:42.190> your<00:03:42.700> fork<00:03:43.060> can<00:03:43.299> be<00:03:43.480> fast

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
is coming in slow your fork can be fast

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.130 
is coming in slow your fork can be fast
I<00:03:44.340> do<00:03:45.340> not<00:03:45.549> want<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.850> set<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:46.060> law<00:03:46.359> where<00:03:46.930> there

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
I do not want to set a law where there

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.259 
I do not want to set a law where there
is<00:03:47.230> none<00:03:47.500> soccer<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.430> an<00:03:48.489> open<00:03:48.819> game<00:03:49.000> for

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
is none soccer is an open game for

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.470 
is none soccer is an open game for
creativity<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.440> want<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:50.950> vary<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
creativity so I want you to vary the

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.900 
creativity so I want you to vary the
speed<00:03:52.870> over<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.410> ball<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:54.040> get<00:03:54.190> your<00:03:54.340> opponent

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
speed over the ball to get your opponent

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.870 
speed over the ball to get your opponent
off<00:03:55.030> balance<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:56.019> that's<00:03:56.500> just<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.160> elements

of a footwork system if you do otherwise

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.390 
of a footwork system if you do otherwise
you're<00:04:02.049> violating<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.799> knee<00:04:03.010> that
