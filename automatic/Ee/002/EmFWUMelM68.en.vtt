 even with hunger treated and we will fight 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.970
 on top of the paper 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.900
 the ease of informing ourselves of our 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.800

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.210
 now let's take it to the preheated oven 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.310
 in average temperature for 45 minutes 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.770
 in a pan on low heat we 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.160
 we put condensed milk 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:03.630

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.300
 now we'll keep stirring here until 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.730
 loosen from the bottom of the pan 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.799
 continuing low fire 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.000
 when it starts to release from the 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.730
 pan 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.400

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.230
 filling our cake 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.300

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.450
 pot out of the fire 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.560
 We are going to mix condensed milk 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.780
 Let's put the chocolate and let's go 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.240

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.430
 margarine 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.040

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.750
 lower bottom of pan on low heat 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.880

 the thicker Brigadier there is already 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.820
 at the point we now want to release 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:13.110
 from the bottom of the pan 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:16.050
 Here it is so we put out the fire. 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.510
 now we'll let it cool down now 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.260
