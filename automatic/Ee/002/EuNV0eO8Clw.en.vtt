00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.690
 hello lovers of the automotive element 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.730
 surely each of you had a childhood 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.309
 a dream to our favorite toy 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.770
 the machine was in two versions 1 and even 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.420
 only two versions of two colors or with 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.030
 additional modifications and all 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.600
 for some reason, because one was supposed 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.070
 for use in a children's sandbox and 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.040
 overcoming grass barriers a second 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 for smooth rides on asphalt 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.910
 road time passes 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.219
 however autopan helps to embody 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.620
 our dreams come true here today 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.989
 us on the test the car that caused 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.620
 considerable storm of emotions and impressions like 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.390
 auto experts and fans 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.289
 automotive field today we have on 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 test car toyota highlander 2014 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.710
 two interesting variants of two 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.609
 trim levels 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.069
 the first is a highlander with engine 2 and 7 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:02.190
 tenths of a liter which gives 188 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:04.830
 horsepower in picking prestige and 2 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.950
 highlander with v6 engine working 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.920
 volume of 3.5 liters which gives 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.079
 almost 250 horsepower than 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.880
 different are these two cars and what their 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.939
 unites today we are with you and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.560
 let's go let's go 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.810
 certainly the first common factor for 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.289
 these two cars is their 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.930
 bright appearance what can I say 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.729
 highlander matured and matured new 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.789
 trapezoidal wide radiator 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.140
 lattice weighty lateral nostrils made 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.780
 illuminated running lights 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.240
 pointy look front optics not 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.670
 give you the opportunity to tear your eyes away from the new 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.939
 models and really harsh traits 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.289
 front of the car like 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.060
 envelop the ties of the model to the very 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.679
 the final point of his design 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.149
 solutions 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.060
 which are only extended wheel 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.570
 arches which, in addition to ribbed outlines 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.270
 purchased a plastic edging abundance 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.429
 chromium sharp angle solutions in 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.499
 exterior elements agree 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.960
 only came to the benefit of the new 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:08.759
 highlander 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.670
 internal filling 2 test versions 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.459
 also surprising in both trim levels 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.250
 prestige and luxury arise the same 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.830
 feeling like you sit behind the wheel at all 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.860
 another car class car 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.230
 higher in comparison with the previous model 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.310
 new highlander at their maximum 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.769
 trim levels in two versions 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.590
 offers a rich gentleman's set 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.110
 leather trim matt under 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.190
 wood plastic large 8-inch 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.069
 touchscreen 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.409
 three-zone climate control modern 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.140
 multimedia innovations excellent 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.700
 speaker system 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.890
 word model with a volume of 3 and a half 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.739
 liters of luxury equipment equipped 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.230
 acoustic units in Jebel 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.150
 combined with excellent sound insulation in 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.310
 this group was not forgotten by engineers and about 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.849
 mass of roomy only for improvised 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.700
 of things 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.950
 whether it is a long trip out of town or 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.909
 Business travel in the city can be accurately 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.650
 say that the car will cope with a bang 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.900
 one of the unifying factors in two 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.239
 luxury grade and prestige is 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.610
 Of course, increased comfort as 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.620
 you see putting it here with a vengeance 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.930
 at the same time that I do not rest in any way 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.629
 in the front seat a man who sits 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.459
 on the back of the couch he is experiencing just 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.080
 pretty good impression later 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.569
 why because he can tune 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.030
 the seat underneath is no thumb too 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.189
 people who have long legs like you 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.400
 see are doing quite well 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.140
 so this is a cool testable version 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.000
 highlander and luggage compartment also 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.939
 is quite roomy for 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.829
 transportation of goods of various sizes 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:46.319
 true dimensions of these most goods need 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.329
 will still count in advance when 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.720
 raised rear seats 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:55.110
 offices is 260 9 liters and at 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.750
 folded 813 liters i.e. fantasies 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.450
 when loading different tor and bags there 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.340
 where to roam 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.680
 zatar and plunging leave 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.890
 the outlines of the city in search of the present 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.349
 tests for suspension and motors by the way 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.799
 unlike motors suspension on data 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.500
 models 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.620
 updated 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.690
 highlander installed 1 floor that 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.549
 regards the suspension which is really 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.549
 fulfills himself 100 percent 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.560
 both on asphalt road and about 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.420
 off - road off - road conditions 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.210
 the car is more than 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.620
 comfortable why because developed 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.340
 used the most advanced technology 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.710
 front suspension type mcpherson rear 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.840
 these are double wishbones therefore 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.270
 really car smoothly and 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.160
 moves quietly in all conditions 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.610
 It is comfortable conveniently the main thing 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.140
 practically finally getting out of 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.060
 beauty urban landscapes 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.610
 get into an interesting suburban 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.160
 the road atmosphere here is us and 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.140
 waiting for real experiments and 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.620
 endurance test of our two 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.300
 updated toyota highlander models 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.160
 car with inline four and volume 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.190
 2 and 7 liters passes most 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.260
 road obstacles with a whistle however before 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.230
 we face a more interesting barrier 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.870
 modest swamp ditch i'm bridging 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:17.410
 which requires special skills and rather 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.120
 all-wheel drive would be our 188 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.610
 horses try to bite into 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.890
 the obstacles to the maximum swinging 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.490
 car and driving out of the rut we 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.229
 triumph and move forward 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.540
 further on approach our friend sv reverse 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.940
 six on board and working volume 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.010
 engine three and a half liters on 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.450
 This model is installed plug 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.190
 four-wheel drive with intellectual 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.010
 active distribution system 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.470
 torque as a result of our ditch 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.020
 overcome without problems should be noted 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.180
 as in this powerful version of highlander a 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.280
 we went to conquer the heights and 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.650
 country roads and in these conditions 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.620
 This type of drive showed itself with the best 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.830
 parties 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.060
 skating your vast expanses of country element 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.180
 inspired by new feats and 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.940
 accomplishments auto panorama returns to 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.220
 city ​​along the way we have long discussed and 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.800
 shared impressions about the two 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.320
 such similar but still different models 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.720
 new toyota highlander 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.360
 volume does matter however need 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.150
 consider these conditions and those goals that 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.400
 are coming to conquer this car 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.380
 because it is based on this and will 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.229
 opt for one of two 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.240
 models tested today 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:32.520
 highlander is back and ready to amaze and
