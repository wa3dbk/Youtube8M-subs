00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.680
 Hello, today I want to show you 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.989
 Like her very simple rubber bracelets 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.870
 with a simple pattern with one 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:41.059
 you can then make fork 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:44.590
 As always you can clear the colors 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.590
 choose what you like 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.769
 then it came to me what he needs for it 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.190
 would be a very simple fork her 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:59.479
 needs federal rubber bands something pointed 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:04.010
 and of course you klipp so if you 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:06.979
 At the beginning you hold the fork so for you 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.250
 with the good side forward and you 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.810
 start with the first rubber band you 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.110
 puts it around the first fork tip pulls 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.810
 it's a bit long behind the fork 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:28.930
 cross it and pass it from behind 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:35.119
 third tip so it looks like then 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:40.729
 then you take your second color sets 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:43.759
 this on the second cable tip behind 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:48.590
 turn the forks martin again and over 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.939
 the fourth cloudy pose so it looks 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.060
 from her wish that a little bit after 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.060
 below 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.450
 Now you do the same in again 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.840
 the expensive first color makes the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.009
 rubber bands again about 1 and 3 and over 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.009
 2 and 4 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.220
 so now you have on the fork or on 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.100
 the fork tip two rubber bands each 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.070
 same color now you take yours 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.030
 tip object or fingernails if 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.980
 you have received the finger with the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.350
 rubbers from behind firmly so that's not 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.230
 so can slip because by halt 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.870
 still pretty much everything is loose and drive 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.780
 with the tip in the lower rubber 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.360
 into it goes over the second comet 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.250
 over and over the fork 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:01.000
 sharpener and just let it fall 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.450
 That's what you do with all four fork 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.450
 sharpen 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.690
 it now looks like everything else 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.690
 bit messed up so takes her 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.430
 the thumb and forefinger pulls you so 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.010
 a little bit of the rubbers in shape 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:32.500
 So you're in front here again a rubber 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.370
 ekd-top have now we catch again 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:42.970
 At the same rubber band color on one 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:51.720
 and take three to two on four behind 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:04:00.489
 ticking draplessly 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:04.660
 behind cross over and down the 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:08.250
 lowest rubber band over the over 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.250
 and second on the transfer spike 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.919
 and repeat 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:58.010
 so now you can already see how the bracelet 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:59.360
 slowly take shape and you do 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.270
 that until you are yours 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.270
 have reached the desired length 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.150
 if you have done that for a while 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:42.840
 then pull out your board so lays out 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.290
 you check it around your wrist whether 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.680
 it fits and when it's done 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:53.160
 if he thinks it will be enough 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:59.730
 you take the lower end and take the 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:01.650
 you're pulling in two green rubber bands 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.110
 bit taut i always made finger 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:08.100
 so pure 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.690
 Now I take my clip and you 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.290
 make him around the two rubber bands 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.290
 around 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.480
 Now I'm going back to my fork 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.440
 Now I am making these four 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.390
 rubber bands 2 that means I go from 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.550
 get it in the back of the fork 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:40.810
 elastic band from the fourth fork tip 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:44.730
 on the third fork tip and that 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.730
 rubber band from the first there was great 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:59.730
 I was on my hands and put it on 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:59.730
 the second power peak is what it looks like 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:08.950
 and now I give the lowest rubbers 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:14.170
 over the fork tip over it again 4 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:16.240
 the land so now I take the 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:24.390
 both last rubberized on mine 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:24.390
 pointed to object these criminal 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:45.750
 and hagem a clip and finished 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:46.550
 a very simple rubber bracelet with with 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.620
 a fork 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.650
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.650
