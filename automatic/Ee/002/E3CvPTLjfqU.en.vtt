00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
sounds sound great for a standard kit

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.290 
sounds sound great for a standard kit
but<00:00:22.900> on<00:00:23.170> my<00:00:23.380> other<00:00:23.650> tanks<00:00:24.070> which<00:00:24.250> at<00:00:25.210> the

hybrid<00:00:32.410> I<00:00:32.769> use<00:00:33.640> this<00:00:33.940> setup<00:00:34.210> which<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:36.430> a

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
hybrid I use this setup which is in a

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.290 
hybrid I use this setup which is in a
nutshell<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.890> can<00:00:39.010> pretty<00:00:39.160> much<00:00:39.250> carry<00:00:40.239> it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
nutshell you can pretty much carry it

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.260 
nutshell you can pretty much carry it
around<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:40.719> put<00:00:41.680> it<00:00:41.710> in<00:00:41.860> other<00:00:41.980> tanks<00:00:42.370> as<00:00:43.120> you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
around and put it in other tanks as you

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.080 
around and put it in other tanks as you
see<00:00:43.450> fit<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:43.930> basically<00:00:44.590> it<00:00:44.890> is<00:00:45.040> just<00:00:45.090> turnigy

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
see fit so basically it is just turnigy

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.610 
see fit so basically it is just turnigy

long bowman control there's been a

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.260 
long bowman control there's been a
benefit<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.290> this<00:01:17.350> system<00:01:18.030> here's<00:01:19.030> like<00:01:19.150> I

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
benefit of this system here's like I

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.969 
benefit of this system here's like I
said<00:01:19.479> you<00:01:19.630> can<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:23.229> kind<00:01:23.409> of<00:01:23.439> take<00:01:23.650> it<00:01:23.799> out<00:01:23.890> of

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
said you can just kind of take it out of

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.200 
said you can just kind of take it out of
a<00:01:24.040> tank<00:01:24.250> put<00:01:25.240> in<00:01:25.330> another<00:01:25.600> tank<00:01:26.020> I<00:01:30.119> find<00:01:31.119> that

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
a tank put in another tank I find that

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.289 
a tank put in another tank I find that
be<00:01:31.860> cost<00:01:32.860> effective<00:01:33.159> if<00:01:33.790> you<00:01:33.970> have<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.090> few

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
be cost effective if you have a few

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.060 
be cost effective if you have a few
teams<00:01:34.570> you<00:01:34.720> don't<00:01:34.750> want<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.049> spend<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.619> lot<00:01:36.040> of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
teams you don't want to spend a lot of

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.740 
teams you don't want to spend a lot of
money<00:01:36.220> always<00:01:36.610> buying<00:01:36.880> another<00:01:37.119> Clarke<00:01:37.450> board

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750
