this video shall give you a basic

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.059 
this video shall give you a basic
knowledge<00:00:03.720> about<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.380> most<00:00:04.589> commonly<00:00:04.980> used

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069

knowledge about the most commonly used
MRI<00:00:05.700> sequences<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.690> don't<00:00:07.379> want<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.680> talk<00:00:07.859> so

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
MRI sequences I don't want to talk so

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.860 
MRI sequences I don't want to talk so
much<00:00:08.130> about<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.670> technical<00:00:09.120> details<00:00:09.300> but

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
much about the technical details but

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.959 
much about the technical details but
instead<00:00:10.200> focus<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:10.830> how<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> recognize<00:00:11.340> a

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
instead focus on how to recognize a

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.789 
instead focus on how to recognize a
certain<00:00:12.450> sequence<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.290> also<00:00:13.440> what

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
certain sequence and also what

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.740 
certain sequence and also what
information<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.639> sequence<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.389> give<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.719> a

hemorrhage<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:01.739> have<00:03:01.830> two<00:03:02.069> options<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:02.760> can

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
hemorrhage we have two options you can

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.420 
hemorrhage we have two options you can
either<00:03:03.510> choose<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.870> Fed<00:03:04.230> saturated<00:03:04.769> sequence

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
either choose a Fed saturated sequence

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.340 
either choose a Fed saturated sequence
so<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.790> if<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.150> lesion<00:03:06.360> contains<00:03:06.870> fat<00:03:07.140> it

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
so that if the lesion contains fat it

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.800 
so that if the lesion contains fat it
becomes<00:03:07.709> dark<00:03:08.069> or<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.120> choose<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.420> blood

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810
