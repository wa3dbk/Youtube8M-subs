great photographer with digital
photography<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.880> really<00:00:09.179> don't<00:00:09.360> need<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.570> lot

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
photography you really don't need a lot

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.560 
photography you really don't need a lot
of<00:00:09.840> fancy<00:00:10.139> equipment<00:00:10.639> it's<00:00:11.639> it's<00:00:12.030> your<00:00:12.240> skill

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
of fancy equipment it's it's your skill

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.240 
of fancy equipment it's it's your skill
and<00:00:12.870> experience<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.679> makes<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.040> great

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
and experience that makes the great

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.550 
and experience that makes the great
pictures<00:00:14.730> rather<00:00:14.969> than<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> equipment<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.990> do

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
pictures rather than the equipment I do

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.740 
pictures rather than the equipment I do
recommend<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.550> get<00:00:17.880> yourself<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.330> camera

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
recommend that you get yourself a camera

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.920 
recommend that you get yourself a camera
that<00:00:18.900> allows<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.260> manually<00:00:19.949> control<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
that allows you to manually control the

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.870 
that allows you to manually control the
aperture<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.580> film<00:00:23.580> speed<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:25.880> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
aperture and the film speed and the the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.029 
aperture and the film speed and the the
speed<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> exposure<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.890> get

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
speed of the exposure and that you get

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.460 
speed of the exposure and that you get
yourself<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.490> really<00:00:29.730> good<00:00:29.910> light<00:00:30.179> meter<00:00:30.470> this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
yourself a really good light meter this

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.110 
yourself a really good light meter this
is<00:00:31.590> an<00:00:31.710> example<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.219> light<00:00:32.399> meter<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.000> you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
is an example of a light meter and you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.729 
is an example of a light meter and you
don't<00:00:33.329> really<00:00:33.480> need<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> super<00:00:34.110> fancy<00:00:34.500> light

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
don't really need a super fancy light

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.620 
don't really need a super fancy light
meter<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.219> one's<00:00:35.489> fairly<00:00:35.700> fancy<00:00:36.239> because<00:00:36.420> I

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
meter this one's fairly fancy because I

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.540 
meter this one's fairly fancy because I
do<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.989> lot<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.260> studio<00:00:37.649> work<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.129> wedding<00:00:38.370> work

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
do a lot of studio work and wedding work

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.209 
do a lot of studio work and wedding work
but<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.510> still<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.440> simple<00:00:40.770> light<00:00:40.950> meter

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
but but still just a simple light meter

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.240 
but but still just a simple light meter
to<00:00:41.670> help<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.149> understand<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.290> exposure<00:00:43.649> now

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
to help you understand the exposure now

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.190 
to help you understand the exposure now
the<00:00:44.370> exposure<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.360> total<00:00:45.930> amount<00:00:46.170> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the exposure is the total amount of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.770 
the exposure is the total amount of
light<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:47.219> hits<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.969> sensor<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.719> your

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
light that hits the sensor in your

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.200 
light that hits the sensor in your
camera<00:00:49.559> which<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> equivalent<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.910> film

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
camera which is the equivalent of film

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
camera which is the equivalent of film
and<00:00:51.510> film<00:00:51.780> photography<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.800> are<00:00:52.890> three

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and film photography and there are three

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.029 
and film photography and there are three
things<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.760> determine<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.620> expose

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
things that determine what that expose

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.490 
things that determine what that expose
your<00:00:56.250> ought<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.670> or<00:00:57.030> how<00:00:57.360> much<00:00:57.539> light<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.230> is

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
your ought to be or how much light is is

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.549 
your ought to be or how much light is is
is<00:00:59.039> reaching<00:00:59.670> your<00:00:59.789> sensor<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.230> them<00:01:01.410> is

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
is reaching your sensor one of them is

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.369 
is reaching your sensor one of them is
the<00:01:01.680> aperture<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.760> aperture<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:04.170> an

the aperture the aperture is a is an

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.800 
the aperture the aperture is a is an

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
iris that gets smaller and larger inside

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960 
iris that gets smaller and larger inside
your<00:01:07.049> lens<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.590> allows<00:01:07.860> more<00:01:08.159> or<00:01:08.400> less<00:01:08.670> light

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
your lens and allows more or less light

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.170 
your lens and allows more or less light
to<00:01:09.210> come<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.170> larger<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.220> number<00:01:11.250> for

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
to come in the larger the number for

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
to come in the larger the number for
your<00:01:12.270> aperture<00:01:12.600> called<00:01:13.290> f-stops

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
your aperture called f-stops

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.340 
your aperture called f-stops
the<00:01:14.790> less<00:01:15.090> amount<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.540> light<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.110> brings

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the less amount of light that it brings

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.050 
the less amount of light that it brings
in<00:01:16.759> then<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.890> actual<00:01:20.060> shutter

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
in then there is the the actual shutter

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.260 
in then there is the the actual shutter
speed<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> how<00:01:22.439> long<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
speed and that is how long the the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.539 
speed and that is how long the the
shutter<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.780> actually<00:01:25.290> open<00:01:25.770> allowing<00:01:26.159> light

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
shutter is actually open allowing light

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.910 
shutter is actually open allowing light
to<00:01:26.580> reach<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.180> sensor<00:01:27.420> before<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.200> closes<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
to reach the sensor before it closes and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.030 
to reach the sensor before it closes and
then<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.939> third<00:01:30.240> thing<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.710> actual

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
then the third thing is the the actual

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.520 
then the third thing is the the actual
sensitivity<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.270> which<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.290> in

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
sensitivity of it which is in at in

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.950 
sensitivity of it which is in at in
digital<00:01:35.040> photography<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.850> called<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.299> ISO

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
digital photography is called the ISO

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
digital photography is called the ISO
and<00:01:37.409> I'm<00:01:37.829> not<00:01:38.220> sure<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.430> even<00:01:38.640> remember<00:01:38.759> what

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and I'm not sure I even remember what

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.749 
and I'm not sure I even remember what
ISO<00:01:39.750> stands<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.100> that's<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.549> old

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
ISO stands for but that's the old

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.510 
ISO stands for but that's the old
equivalent<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.720> film<00:01:43.049> speed<00:01:43.439> now<00:01:44.159> what<00:01:44.369> you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
equivalent of film speed now what you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.160 
equivalent of film speed now what you
want<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.210> want<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> juggle<00:01:45.750> those

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
want to do is you want to juggle those

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.770 
want to do is you want to juggle those
three<00:01:46.619> things<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.399> order<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.939> get<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.329> total

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
three things in order to get the total

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.289 
three things in order to get the total
amount<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.079> light<00:01:49.140> that's<00:01:49.950> correct<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.909> your

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
amount of light that's correct for your

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.749

narrow depth of field like if you want
for<00:02:35.269> instance<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.840> take<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.080> picture<00:02:36.500> where<00:02:36.680> you

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
for instance to take a picture where you

have someone in sharp focus but you want

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.199 
have someone in sharp focus but you want
the<00:02:39.560> background<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:40.310> be<00:02:40.519> a<00:02:40.700> little<00:02:40.940> blurred

you<00:02:41.989> can<00:02:42.170> do<00:02:42.319> that<00:02:42.530> by<00:02:43.660> by<00:02:44.660> balancing<00:02:45.590> those

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
you can do that by by balancing those

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.520 
you can do that by by balancing those
two<00:02:46.220> things<00:02:46.489> but<00:02:47.450> my<00:02:47.630> best<00:02:48.110> advice<00:02:48.290> for

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
two things but my best advice for

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.800 
two things but my best advice for
learning<00:02:49.220> digital<00:02:49.370> photography<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:50.269> get<00:02:50.780> a

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
learning digital photography is get a

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.380 
learning digital photography is get a
camera<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.380> just<00:02:51.470> take<00:02:52.099> lots<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.880> lots<00:02:53.090> and

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
camera and just take lots and lots and

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.839 
camera and just take lots and lots and
lots<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.870> pictures<00:02:54.049> so<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.700> eventually<00:02:55.700> you

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
lots of pictures so that eventually you

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.339 
lots of pictures so that eventually you
get<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.239> point<00:02:56.540> where<00:02:56.780> you've<00:02:56.959> mastered

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
get to the point where you've mastered

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.589 
get to the point where you've mastered
your<00:02:57.620> equipment<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:59.000> can<00:02:59.030> think<00:02:59.480> about

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
your equipment and you can think about

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.930 
your equipment and you can think about
the<00:02:59.900> composition<00:03:00.319> in<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:00.920> picture<00:03:01.370> without

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
the composition in the picture without

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.660 
the composition in the picture without
having<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.660> juggle<00:03:03.140> with<00:03:03.349> with<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.250> controls

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
having to juggle with with the controls

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.890 
having to juggle with with the controls
on<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.000> camera<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.420> know<00:03:05.660> just

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
on the camera you know just

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.220 
on the camera you know just
instinctively<00:03:06.530> what<00:03:06.829> to<00:03:07.010> use
