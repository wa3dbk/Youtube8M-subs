00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 this leads to a new technology 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.030
 Idea I will touch you 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.610
 pack or the offender take action tunis 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:15.750
 but I think everyone in the network is late 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.680
 have guessed namely the super 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.240
 I have to mario kart wii pack here 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.830
 maybe not everything for a second 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.140
 for example you can already knows is 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.090
 It's normal for the eater to ask 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 but nice many system marius 32 games 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:57.899
 for pc and then all changed as well 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:01:03.260
 said the pc and so the temps in all 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:07.290
 it stays the same, but it looks the same 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.970
 there is a little slip there is also 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.450
 Mother to the ever description 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.670
 can do what is quite money and yes 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.729
 I fly two over it as you said 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:25.830
 are you not changed pusterla 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:31.670
 some the example for free here but has 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.670
 he does not even have her glass of march in Leipzig 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:42.760
 because here from the shelf above 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.160
 the wood otherwise not okay then the 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.480
 Everything has changed here 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:55.270
 man also stays i would that possible 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:57.310
 otherwise I think that's normal 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.670
 cobblestone the pistons have become 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.550
 actually changed to 11 something 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:10.090
 so not the flowers 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.780
 are here for times province has 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:20.130
 changed 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:23.800
 but the earth also here these trees 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.950
 no idea, mostly, that's where it comes from 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:38.050
 here the earth so it goes on 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:46.540
 This fast and here stone if you 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:48.240
 that's that's the wood otherwise as well 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.680
 changed 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:03:00.910
 quiet also normal stone too and that 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:03.940
 she also showed these things once 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.440
 I'm going to have a way too 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.060
 changed and the whole would also good 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.490
 now perhaps offenders what you do not 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.250
 necessarily take for now tell me 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.230
 let's play but time to found texture 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.320
 pack and I think it's no matter where the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.100
 imagine and last in the 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.209
 description 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.209
 I'll just say it until next time and 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.209
 builders
