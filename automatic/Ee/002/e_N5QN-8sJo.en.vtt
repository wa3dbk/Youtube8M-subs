realistic<00:03:10.540> it's<00:03:10.900> not<00:03:11.050> fun<00:03:13.290> honestly<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.380> don't

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
realistic it's not fun honestly I don't

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.229 
realistic it's not fun honestly I don't
know<00:03:14.680> how<00:03:14.890> far<00:03:15.130> or<00:03:15.400> how<00:03:15.459> much<00:03:15.850> I'm<00:03:16.060> going<00:03:16.180> to

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
know how far or how much I'm going to

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.180 
know how far or how much I'm going to
get<00:03:16.360> into<00:03:16.570> this<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.959> player<00:03:17.200> right<00:03:17.410> away<00:03:17.590> I'm<00:03:18.130> a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
get into this I player right away I'm a

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.530 
get into this I player right away I'm a
feeling<00:03:18.610> they're<00:03:18.700> gonna<00:03:18.790> have<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.090> patch<00:03:19.269> this

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
feeling they're gonna have to patch this

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.160 
feeling they're gonna have to patch this
because<00:03:19.900> this<00:03:20.019> kind<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.470> breaks<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.920> mode<00:03:22.170> it

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
because this kind of breaks the mode it

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.210 
because this kind of breaks the mode it
just<00:03:23.320> really<00:03:23.500> doesn't<00:03:23.650> down<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.100> mode

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
just really doesn't down the mode

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.040 
just really doesn't down the mode
basically<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.790> mean<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.600> great<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:25.959> they

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
basically I mean it's great that they

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.770 
basically I mean it's great that they
added<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:27.060> difficulty<00:03:28.060> chain<00:03:28.269> to<00:03:28.420> be<00:03:28.570> able<00:03:28.630> to

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
added the difficulty chain to be able to

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.090 
added the difficulty chain to be able to
change<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.019> difficulty<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.769> court<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.040> i

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
change a difficulty the court and i

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.530 
change a difficulty the court and i
colapse<00:03:30.370> up<00:03:30.610> it's<00:03:30.730> great<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.000> added<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.269> but

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
colapse up it's great the added that but

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.380 
colapse up it's great the added that but
they<00:03:31.750> left<00:03:32.110> out<00:03:32.260> of<00:03:32.380> such<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> basic<00:03:32.950> feature<00:03:33.390> if
