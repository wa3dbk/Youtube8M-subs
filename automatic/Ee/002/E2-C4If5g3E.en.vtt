00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.629
 for the slowness of Christ we play 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.049
 of minecraft minecraft in quotes 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.740
 because the truth is that the game 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:17.180
 minecraft because of edicions is not 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.189
 compatible with samsung galaxy keys 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.410
 unfortunately the game has been like 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.960
 adapted to the phone of this version a 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.310
 little poorer but complies with what 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.310
 same the same functionality 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.470
 I honestly am not a big fan 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.920
 of minecraft but because the truth is a 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.960
 very constructive game 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.769
 so many have asked me not too 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.640
 on behalf of the powers as the king 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.640
 could you say 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.200
 yes that river 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.500
 I do not know how good process the play of 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.480
 micros is too simple and the truth 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.010
 give us a lot of science 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.010
 Well with no minerals 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.979
 when I think 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.729
 is please with these blocks and is 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.729
 here 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.790
 I knew it 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.170
 this is the world of michael farr so 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.240
 You can see the truth is that the game 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.060
 until I got it has very good 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.100
 texture does not look very good do not read well 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.179
 nothing is done if he runs the game 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.179
 runs perfectly 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.100
 it's getting dark and so we 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.950
 It's getting dark and if you want my 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.460
 mobile 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.469
 is the main objective of these creates 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.420
 all materials survival 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.119
 for example marked armor food is 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.890
 get food the basics do not stop 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.750
 survive and conflicts 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.840
 houses and what you want if you do not see 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.019
 nothing, my god 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.019
 a little bit more the brightness this 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.640
 beretta 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.940
 follow its inverse 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.010
 it seems a little bit we are not 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.700
 and it can be a microsoft mode for 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.380
 find enemies know that you will have to 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.040
 destroy here that this is a car that already 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.150
 is 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.170
 I do not know the animals we are 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.580
 squares that says the tango saw that but 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.220
 well 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.390
 and I 'm not a fan of minecraft 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.760
 true 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.250
 but because the game well and then here 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.480

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.340
