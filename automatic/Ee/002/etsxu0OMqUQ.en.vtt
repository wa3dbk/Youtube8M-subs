how everybody this is certain job okay

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.930 
how everybody this is certain job okay
so<00:00:03.480> earlier<00:00:03.959> we<00:00:04.140> showed<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.410> video<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:05.040> samsung

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
so earlier we showed a video of samsung

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.009 
so earlier we showed a video of samsung
galaxy<00:00:06.450> s2<00:00:07.309> with<00:00:08.309> its<00:00:08.990> rear<00:00:09.990> cover<00:00:12.019> being

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
galaxy s2 with its rear cover being

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.510 
galaxy s2 with its rear cover being
folded<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.530> half<00:00:16.190> so

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
folded in half so

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.480 
folded in half so
we<00:00:19.520> theorize<00:00:20.210> a<00:00:20.240> lot<00:00:20.689> of<00:00:20.779> things<00:00:21.490> thinking

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
we theorize a lot of things thinking

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.730 
we theorize a lot of things thinking
that<00:00:22.699> you<00:00:22.820> know<00:00:22.849> maybe<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.720> Korean<00:00:24.529> version

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
that you know maybe the Korean version

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.080 
that you know maybe the Korean version
is<00:00:25.189> using<00:00:25.910> a<00:00:26.029> different<00:00:26.390> kind<00:00:27.079> of<00:00:27.140> plastic<00:00:27.590> or

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
is using a different kind of plastic or

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.819 
is using a different kind of plastic or
you<00:00:29.090> know<00:00:29.180> because<00:00:29.439> you<00:00:30.439> know<00:00:30.470> one<00:00:30.650> of<00:00:30.680> the

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
you know because you know one of the

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.220 
you know because you know one of the
strike<00:00:31.070> to<00:00:31.189> do<00:00:31.340> it<00:00:31.369> and<00:00:32.680> and<00:00:33.680> chickened<00:00:34.129> out

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
strike to do it and and chickened out

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.920 
strike to do it and and chickened out
probably<00:00:36.230> like<00:00:37.239> three<00:00:38.239> quarters<00:00:38.660> of<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:38.839> way

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
probably like three quarters of the way

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.070 
probably like three quarters of the way
through<00:00:39.640> because<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:40.910> know<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:41.269> you<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:41.900> need

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
through because you know it you you need

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.520 
through because you know it you you need
considerable<00:00:42.800> force<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.339> do<00:00:43.460> this<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.530> it's

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
considerable force to do this and it's

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.350 
considerable force to do this and it's
just<00:00:45.920> not<00:00:46.070> natural<00:00:46.250> for<00:00:46.670> plastic<00:00:47.030> tube<00:00:47.210> end

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
just not natural for plastic tube end

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.389 
just not natural for plastic tube end
this<00:00:47.570> way<00:00:47.780> but<00:00:48.909> one<00:00:49.909> of<00:00:50.089> us<00:00:50.649> has<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:51.920> balls<00:00:52.100> do

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
this way but one of us has the balls do

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.230 
this way but one of us has the balls do
it<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:53.000> let's<00:00:53.870> see<00:00:54.460> how<00:00:55.460> it<00:00:55.489> goes

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.640
