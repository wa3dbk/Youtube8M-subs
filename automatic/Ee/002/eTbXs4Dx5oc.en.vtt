that<00:01:10.880> way<00:01:11.120> the<00:01:11.300> more<00:01:11.480> winch<00:01:11.750> line<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:12.200> have

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
that way the more winch line you have

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.100 
that way the more winch line you have
out<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.490> more<00:01:13.700> powerful<00:01:14.030> your<00:01:14.330> winch<00:01:14.570> is<00:01:14.840> if

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
out the more powerful your winch is if

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.100 
out the more powerful your winch is if
you<00:01:15.650> have<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.890> 90<00:01:16.610> 500<00:01:17.180> pound<00:01:17.420> winch<00:01:17.780> like

you have a 90 500 pound winch like

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.870 
you have a 90 500 pound winch like
myself<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:19.750> 9,500<00:01:20.750> pound<00:01:20.960> winch<00:01:21.290> is<00:01:21.530> only<00:01:21.710> a

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
myself that 9,500 pound winch is only a
