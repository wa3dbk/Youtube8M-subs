is that twenty thirty percent of battery

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
life left that's where you typically get

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.289 
life left that's where you typically get
that<00:01:19.350> anxiety<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.950> oh<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:20.580> we're<00:01:20.640> really<00:01:20.939> down

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
that anxiety of oh now we're really down

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.719 
that anxiety of oh now we're really down

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
now we really need a charge you don't

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.580 
now we really need a charge you don't
get<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.299> thing<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.170> motorola

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
get that with this thing the motorola

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.200 
get that with this thing the motorola
droid<00:01:25.680> turbo<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.549> makes<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
droid turbo really makes you have to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.270 
droid turbo really makes you have to
rethink<00:01:27.450> what<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.829> own<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.979> phone

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
rethink what it's like to own a phone

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.580 
rethink what it's like to own a phone
when<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.939> see<00:01:30.060> those<00:01:30.210> percentages<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.290> they

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
when you see those percentages so they

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.020 
when you see those percentages so they
don't<00:01:31.740> really<00:01:31.770> mean<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> same<00:01:32.670> thing<00:01:32.700> that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
don't really mean the same thing that

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
don't really mean the same thing that
they<00:01:33.150> mean<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.479> other<00:01:33.630> devices<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.799> thing

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
they mean on other devices the one thing

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.319 
they mean on other devices the one thing
people<00:01:35.159> are<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.610> shocked<00:01:36.000> about<00:01:36.150> when

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
people are really shocked about when

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.700 
people are really shocked about when
they<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.930> phone<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.200> person<00:01:37.409> is
