Mongoose<00:00:46.649> actually<00:00:47.219> sorted<00:00:47.670> me<00:00:47.820> out<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
Mongoose actually sorted me out with a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.330 
Mongoose actually sorted me out with a
front<00:00:48.719> fork<00:00:49.020> brace<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> try<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.280> on

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
front fork brace so going to try that on

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.310 
front fork brace so going to try that on
and<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.390> makes<00:00:51.570> any<00:00:51.719> difference

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
right in underneath and so it's been a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.969 
right in underneath and so it's been a
bit<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.049> time<00:01:46.259> rip<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.340> thing<00:01:48.950> came<00:01:49.950> off

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979

eventually<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.110> first<00:01:52.110> thing<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.409> was

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
eventually and first thing I was

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.319 
eventually and first thing I was
thinking<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.520> don't<00:01:53.729> want<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
thinking is I don't want this to be a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.810 
thinking is I don't want this to be a
major<00:01:54.570> pain<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.079> butt<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.320> put<00:01:55.590> back<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:56.040> so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
major pain in the butt to put back on so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.510 
major pain in the butt to put back on so
I<00:01:57.320> prepared<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.469> bit<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.829> surface<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
I prepared a bit of a surface on the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.819 
I prepared a bit of a surface on the
underside<00:01:59.939> of<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.270> mud<00:02:00.450> guard<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.020> used<00:02:01.680> a

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
underside of the mud guard and used a

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.910 
underside of the mud guard and used a
bit<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.100> cold<00:02:02.399> weld<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.719> hold<00:02:04.500> those<00:02:04.649> nuts

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
bit of a cold weld to hold those nuts

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.499 
bit of a cold weld to hold those nuts
into<00:02:05.100> place<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:05.969> crank<00:02:06.329> them

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
into place so I can just crank them

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.089 
into place so I can just crank them
right<00:02:06.689> down<00:02:06.960> when<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.320> go<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.590> put<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.890> back

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
right down when I go to put this back

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.339 
right down when I go to put this back
together<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:09.060> flip<00:02:09.270> your<00:02:09.420> mongers<00:02:09.780> made<00:02:10.080> this

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
together so flip your mongers made this

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.040 
together so flip your mongers made this
brace<00:02:10.800> himself<00:02:11.209> man<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.239> big<00:02:12.660> chunk<00:02:12.930> of

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
brace himself man a big chunk of

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.960 
brace himself man a big chunk of
aluminium<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.069> could<00:02:14.250> use<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.760> its

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
aluminium and you could use it on its

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.699 
aluminium and you could use it on its
own<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.629> think<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.989> looks<00:02:16.200> sort<00:02:16.379> of<00:02:16.470> cool

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
own but I think it looks sort of cool

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.440 
own but I think it looks sort of cool
with<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.129> original<00:02:17.520> brace<00:02:17.760> sitting<00:02:18.090> on<00:02:18.209> top

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
with the original brace sitting on top

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.199 
with the original brace sitting on top
or<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.260> bolts<00:02:19.590> were<00:02:19.739> long<00:02:20.550> enough<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:21.030> be<00:02:21.120> able

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
or the bolts were long enough to be able

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.720 
or the bolts were long enough to be able
to<00:02:21.300> bolt<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.720> back<00:02:21.930> down<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:23.250> put<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.550> one

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
to bolt that back down so put that one

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.000 
to bolt that back down so put that one
in<00:02:24.060> there<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.450> bolt<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.200> all<00:02:25.290> back<00:02:25.530> together

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.240 

so<00:02:29.010> I've<00:02:29.280> opted<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.540> katana<00:02:30.980> 600<00:02:31.980> rear

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
being down a bit further your chain is

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.300 
being down a bit further your chain is
going<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:49.000> be<00:04:49.150> pretty<00:04:49.420> loose<00:04:49.860> so<00:04:50.860> tighten<00:04:51.250> that

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310
