hi<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:01.949> one<00:00:02.280> control<00:00:02.550> we're<00:00:02.879> gonna<00:00:03.000> show

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hi this is one control we're gonna show

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.559 
hi this is one control we're gonna show
you<00:00:03.149> how<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.360> use<00:00:03.629> an<00:00:03.840> effects<00:00:04.200> loop<00:00:04.350> with<00:00:04.950> a

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569 
you how to use an effects loop with a

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.430 
you how to use an effects loop with a
c10<00:00:06.569> so<00:00:07.340> first<00:00:08.340> thing<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.490> got<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.700> do<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.440> plug

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
c10 so first thing you got to do is plug

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.820 
c10 so first thing you got to do is plug
in<00:00:10.620> your<00:00:11.460> guitar<00:00:11.540> into<00:00:15.320> either<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.440> buffered

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
in your guitar into either the buffered

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.380 
in your guitar into either the buffered
and<00:00:16.949> unbuffered<00:00:17.039> input<00:00:19.970> and<00:00:20.970> then<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> next

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
and unbuffered input and then the next

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.470 
and unbuffered input and then the next
thing<00:00:21.539> you're<00:00:21.720> gonna<00:00:21.810> do<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.949> run<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.000> effects

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
thing you're gonna do is run the effects

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.080 
thing you're gonna do is run the effects
then<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.019> do<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.439> eight<00:00:25.830> right<00:00:26.430> here<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.029> is

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
then and do in eight right here this is

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.980 
then and do in eight right here this is
in<00:00:27.390> eighth

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
in eighth

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.890 
in eighth
let<00:00:28.529> me<00:00:28.590> effects<00:00:28.890> them<00:00:29.210> your<00:00:30.210> sin<00:00:30.420> will<00:00:30.599> go<00:00:30.720> out

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
let me effects them your sin will go out

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900 
let me effects them your sin will go out
to<00:00:31.199> whatever<00:00:31.470> you're<00:00:31.710> using<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:31.980> reverb<00:00:32.610> or

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
to whatever you're using for reverb or

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.400 
to whatever you're using for reverb or
whatever<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.360> want<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> put<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.870> your<00:00:33.899> effects

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
whatever you want to put in your effects

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.350 
whatever you want to put in your effects
then<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:36.600> then<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.670> effects<00:00:38.670> return<00:00:39.030> you

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
then and then the effects return you

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720 
then and then the effects return you
just<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:39.660> from<00:00:39.719> output<00:00:40.230> oh<00:00:40.260> that's<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:40.770> then

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
just go from output oh that's there then

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.340 
just go from output oh that's there then
run<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.500> effects<00:00:43.789> return<00:00:44.789> well<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
run your effects return well that the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.750 
run your effects return well that the
out<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.710> number<00:00:46.980> eight<00:00:47.160> into<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:47.550> effects

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
out is number eight into your effects

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.330 
out is number eight into your effects
return<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.950> if<00:00:49.950> your<00:00:50.160> effects<00:00:50.579> then<00:00:50.820> has<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
return and if your effects then has a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.779 
return and if your effects then has a
channel<00:00:53.340> changer<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.070> run<00:00:56.610> from

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
channel changer on that you can run from

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
channel changer on that you can run from
the<00:00:56.969> next<00:00:57.180> output<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:58.140> using<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.680> send<00:00:59.190> of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the next output I'm using the send of

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.849 
the next output I'm using the send of
nine<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.760> go<00:00:59.850> into<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.420> amp<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.680> can

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
nine to go into this amp and so I can

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.630 
nine to go into this amp and so I can
turn<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> effects<00:01:02.579> loop<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.899> off<00:01:04.640> other

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
turn the effects loop on and off other

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.520 
turn the effects loop on and off other
than<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.210> plug-in<00:01:06.869> effects<00:01:07.320> just

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
than that you can plug-in effects just

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.219 
than that you can plug-in effects just
like<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.770> would<00:01:08.010> any<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.299> way<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> OC

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
like you would any other way with the OC

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.440 
like you would any other way with the OC
ten<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:12.600> terms<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.930> using<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.229> serious<00:01:13.590> loops

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
ten in terms of using the serious loops

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.590 
ten in terms of using the serious loops
and<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.810> cool<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.860> will<00:01:17.189> give<00:01:17.280> you

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
and it's cool because that will give you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.960 
and it's cool because that will give you
more<00:01:18.600> definition<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.409> certain<00:01:19.860> parts<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.369> your

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
more definition to certain parts of your

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.999 
more definition to certain parts of your
playing<00:01:21.380> especially<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:22.860> using

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
playing especially like if you're using

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.410 
playing especially like if you're using
like<00:01:23.310> fuzz<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.420> it'll<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> reverb<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.470> your

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
like fuzz and it'll a reverb like your

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.749 
like fuzz and it'll a reverb like your
get<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> little<00:01:27.750> bit<00:01:27.869> more<00:01:28.159> articulation<00:01:29.159> out

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
get a little bit more articulation out

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.499 
get a little bit more articulation out
of<00:01:30.259> some<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.380> stuff<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.650> play<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.509> right

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
of some of the stuff you play so right

00:01:33.509 --> 00:02:18.949 
of some of the stuff you play so right
now

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.660 

so<00:02:19.959> one<00:02:20.739> thing<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.010> want<00:02:21.159> to<00:02:21.219> realize<00:02:21.340> that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
so one thing you want to realize that

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.899 
so one thing you want to realize that
this<00:02:21.849> is<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.329> um<00:02:23.459> since<00:02:24.459> you're<00:02:24.579> using<00:02:24.700> the

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
this is that um since you're using the

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.619 
this is that um since you're using the
serious<00:02:25.299> loops<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.560> know<00:02:26.680> Drive

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
serious loops for you know Drive

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.250 
serious loops for you know Drive
overdrive<00:02:28.629> stuff<00:02:29.620> like<00:02:29.769> that<00:02:29.980> most<00:02:30.400> likely

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
overdrive stuff like that most likely

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.869 
overdrive stuff like that most likely
and<00:02:32.260> you're<00:02:32.799> gonna<00:02:32.920> run<00:02:33.189> the<00:02:33.340> output<00:02:33.519> of<00:02:33.790> that

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
and you're gonna run the output of that

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.390 
and you're gonna run the output of that
which<00:02:34.299> is<00:02:34.420> either<00:02:34.540> out<00:02:34.750> one<00:02:35.170> or<00:02:35.290> two<00:02:35.349> to<00:02:35.950> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
which is either out one or two to the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.339 
which is either out one or two to the
normal<00:02:36.730> input<00:02:36.879> in<00:02:37.090> your<00:02:37.120> amp<00:02:37.389> and<00:02:37.719> then<00:02:37.870> the

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
normal input in your amp and then the

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.520 
normal input in your amp and then the
output<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.159> the<00:02:39.840> separate<00:02:40.840> loops<00:02:41.019> will<00:02:41.260> go<00:02:41.409> to

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
output of the separate loops will go to

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.399 
output of the separate loops will go to
your<00:02:41.739> effects<00:02:42.069> return<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.939> hope<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:43.959> clears

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
your effects return so hope that clears

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.890 
your effects return so hope that clears
up<00:02:44.620> some<00:02:44.650> questions<00:02:45.189> about<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.609> subject<00:02:46.120> if

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
up some questions about the subject if

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.059 
up some questions about the subject if
you<00:02:47.049> have<00:02:47.139> any<00:02:47.290> questions<00:02:47.709> leave<00:02:47.829> them<00:02:47.920> in<00:02:47.980> the
