00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.929
 or not 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.580
 the test of the omnium woodcock nets 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.660
 light 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.180
 this is the pattern obtained with the 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:40.080
 bri dispersing choke she 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:45.240
 slightly low but I would say anyway 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.100
 also very very extensive so try 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.980
 superseded by this point of view 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.400
 here we have the choke instead 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.970
 original cylindrical of rizzini that 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.000
 however it also provides in this too 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.400
 case a self-centered pattern is 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.790
 quite enlarged maybe a little less 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.640
 of the other then also here 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.040
 the scattering effect obtained at 15 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.960
 meters of cylindrical trumpet e 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.960
 however valid therefore it can use us
