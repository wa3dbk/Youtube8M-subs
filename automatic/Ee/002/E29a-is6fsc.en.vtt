with that Eibach cr-z we're getting

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.410 
with that Eibach cr-z we're getting
ready<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.000> convert<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.109> hybrid<00:00:25.590> now<00:00:26.010> I

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
ready to convert it to a hybrid now I

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.790 
ready to convert it to a hybrid now I
know<00:00:27.420> you're<00:00:27.630> thinking<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.349> already<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
know you're thinking this was already a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.560 
know you're thinking this was already a
hybrid<00:00:29.220> but<00:00:29.369> back<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> day<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.300> used<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
hybrid but back in the day we used to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.299 
hybrid but back in the day we used to
call<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> hybrid<00:00:30.990> anything<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> VTEC<00:00:32.070> motor

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
call a hybrid anything with a VTEC motor

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.370 
call a hybrid anything with a VTEC motor
swap<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:32.850> an<00:00:32.910> Acura<00:00:33.239> motor<00:00:33.450> swap<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.930> that's

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
swap or an Acura motor swap and that's

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.950 
swap or an Acura motor swap and that's
what<00:00:34.620> we're<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.510> Eibach

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
what we're going to do with the Eibach

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.299 
what we're going to do with the Eibach
cr-z<00:00:39.170> we've<00:00:40.170> not<00:00:40.500> done<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> these<00:00:41.070> cars

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
cr-z we've not done one of these cars

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.240 
cr-z we've not done one of these cars
before<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.940> we're<00:00:42.059> starting<00:00:42.239> off<00:00:42.510> carefully

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
before so we're starting off carefully

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.979 
before so we're starting off carefully
this<00:00:44.250> has<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> battery<00:00:44.969> pack<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> back<00:00:45.719> that

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
this has a battery pack in the back that

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.709 
this has a battery pack in the back that
works<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.469> over<00:00:46.710> 100<00:00:47.070> volts<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:48.210> manual

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
works on over 100 volts so with manual

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.160 
works on over 100 volts so with manual
in<00:00:48.930> hand<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:51.360> remove<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
in hand we are going to remove the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.869 
in hand we are going to remove the
battery<00:00:52.320> pack<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.190> remove<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.699> motor

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
battery pack and then remove the motor

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.090 
battery pack and then remove the motor
we<00:00:54.449> started<00:00:54.780> off<00:00:54.960> by<00:00:54.989> turning<00:00:55.620> off<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.070> power

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
we started off by turning off the power

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.389 
we started off by turning off the power
to<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.360> hybrid<00:00:58.109> battery<00:00:58.260> pack<00:00:58.620> disconnecting

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
to the hybrid battery pack disconnecting

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.279 
to the hybrid battery pack disconnecting
it<00:00:59.489> from<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> motor<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.210> now<00:01:00.809> we're<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
it from the motor and now we're going to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.840 
it from the motor and now we're going to
go<00:01:01.440> back<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.070> disconnect<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> wire

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
go back in and disconnect all the wire

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
go back in and disconnect all the wire
so<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> pull<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> battery<00:01:03.719> pack<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.140> then

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
so to pull the battery pack and then

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
so to pull the battery pack and then
that<00:01:04.769> should<00:01:05.040> pretty<00:01:05.189> much<00:01:05.280> make<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that should pretty much make it just a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.790 
that should pretty much make it just a
straight<00:01:06.720> forward<00:01:06.930> engine<00:01:07.350> drop<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.250> out

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.040 

a<00:01:14.470> lot<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.500> people<00:01:15.800> compare<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:16.280> car<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:17.480> the

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
a lot of people compare this car to the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.250 
a lot of people compare this car to the
88<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.590> 91<00:01:18.830> CRX<00:01:19.340> si<00:01:19.700> I<00:01:19.940> actually<00:01:20.600> prefer<00:01:20.930> to

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
88 to 91 CRX si I actually prefer to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.170 
88 to 91 CRX si I actually prefer to
compare<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.540> e4<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.900> seven<00:01:24.640> Civic<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.820> has

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
compare to the e4 to seven Civic it has

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.280 
compare to the e4 to seven Civic it has
strut<00:01:26.750> front<00:01:27.710> suspension<00:01:27.830> it<00:01:28.460> has<00:01:29.300> only<00:01:30.050> about

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
strut front suspension it has only about

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.450 
strut front suspension it has only about
a<00:01:30.410> hundred<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:30.940> ten<00:01:31.940> horsepower<00:01:32.510> and<00:01:33.460> the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
a hundred and ten horsepower and the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.120 
a hundred and ten horsepower and the
rear<00:01:34.760> beam<00:01:35.150> suspension<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:36.170> also<00:01:36.860> very

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
rear beam suspension is also very

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.500 
rear beam suspension is also very
similar<00:01:37.430> let<00:01:37.790> me<00:01:37.880> show<00:01:38.000> you<00:01:38.090> what<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.240> looks

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
similar let me show you what that looks

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.210 
similar let me show you what that looks
like<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:39.140> rear<00:01:39.350> suspension<00:01:39.530> on<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.040> is<00:01:40.190> a

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
like the rear suspension on this is a

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.100 
like the rear suspension on this is a
beam<00:01:40.520> suspension<00:01:40.790> it<00:01:41.360> actually<00:01:41.780> looks<00:01:41.960> more

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
beam suspension it actually looks more

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.870 
beam suspension it actually looks more
like<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.320> swing<00:01:42.650> arm<00:01:42.800> you<00:01:43.220> have<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.550> pivot

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
like a swing arm you have the pivot

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.750 
like a swing arm you have the pivot
point<00:01:44.150> up<00:01:44.810> front<00:01:45.200> here<00:01:45.590> then<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.280> have<00:01:46.310> a

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
point up front here then you have a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.660 
point up front here then you have a
cross<00:01:47.300> piece<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:48.020> goes<00:01:48.170> back<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.890> then<00:01:48.980> two

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
cross piece that goes back and then two

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.660 
cross piece that goes back and then two
kind<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.090> trailing<00:01:50.660> links<00:01:51.230> back<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:52.490> come

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
kind of trailing links back that come

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.490 
kind of trailing links back that come
back<00:01:52.790> here<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.240> what<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.720> spindles<00:01:54.110> bolt<00:01:54.320> to

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
back here to what the spindles bolt to

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.640 
back here to what the spindles bolt to
notice<00:01:55.400> that<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.760> shock<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.390> way<00:01:57.050> at<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.470> back

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
notice that the shock is way at the back

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.590 
notice that the shock is way at the back
that<00:01:58.310> actually<00:01:58.490> helps<00:01:58.910> quite<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.120> bit<00:01:59.360> if<00:01:59.510> you

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
that actually helps quite a bit if you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.840 
that actually helps quite a bit if you
look<00:01:59.780> at<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.080> early<00:02:00.620> insight<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.640> first

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
look at the early insight and the first

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.780 
look at the early insight and the first
gen<00:02:02.120> fit<00:02:02.900> they<00:02:03.440> have<00:02:03.470> their<00:02:04.100> shock<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.490> little

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
gen fit they have their shock a little

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.820 
gen fit they have their shock a little
too<00:02:05.000> far<00:02:05.240> forward<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:06.380> get<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.530> lot<00:02:06.710> of

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
too far forward so you get a lot of

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.050 
too far forward so you get a lot of
axial<00:02:07.280> movement<00:02:07.400> for<00:02:07.730> the<00:02:07.790> amount<00:02:07.970> of

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
axial movement for the amount of

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.389 
axial movement for the amount of
dampening<00:02:08.540> you<00:02:08.690> get<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.050> it's<00:02:09.320> not<00:02:09.470> really

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
dampening you get so it's not really

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.640 
dampening you get so it's not really
that<00:02:10.580> effective<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.300> would<00:02:11.810> imagine<00:02:12.050> that<00:02:12.320> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
that effective I would imagine that the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.340 
that effective I would imagine that the
Civic<00:02:13.130> type-r<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:13.880> europe<00:02:14.630> has<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.110> same

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
Civic type-r in europe has the same

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.890 
Civic type-r in europe has the same
setup<00:02:15.650> where<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:15.950> damper<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.580> back<00:02:17.480> behind

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
setup where the damper is back behind

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.740 
setup where the damper is back behind
where<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> axle<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.850> means<00:02:20.390> that

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
where the axle is and that means that

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.690 
where the axle is and that means that
for<00:02:21.350> every<00:02:21.530> inch<00:02:21.770> of<00:02:21.920> travel<00:02:22.100> here<00:02:22.489> you're

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
for every inch of travel here you're

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.040 
for every inch of travel here you're
going<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.850> get<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.239> little<00:02:23.510> more<00:02:23.720> than<00:02:23.840> an<00:02:23.959> inch

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
going to get a little more than an inch

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.410 
going to get a little more than an inch
of<00:02:24.230> travel<00:02:24.380> here<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.860> shock<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.340> that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
of travel here on the shock and that

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.600 
of travel here on the shock and that
works<00:02:26.420> out<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.720> be<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> much<00:02:27.080> better<00:02:27.260> control

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
works out to be a much better control

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.670 
works out to be a much better control
but<00:02:28.610> again<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> straight<00:02:29.959> beam<00:02:30.200> axle

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
but again this is a straight beam axle

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.500 
but again this is a straight beam axle
very<00:02:31.070> similar<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.550> what<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.730> find<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.030> 84

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
very similar to what you find on the 84

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.320 
very similar to what you find on the 84
to<00:02:32.570> 7<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.260> 88<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.709> 91<00:02:33.950> has<00:02:34.340> double<00:02:34.970> wishbone

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
to 7 the 88 to 91 has double wishbone

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.390 
to 7 the 88 to 91 has double wishbone
front<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.900> rear<00:02:36.140> even<00:02:36.920> though<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.190> rear

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
front and rear even though the rear

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.670 
front and rear even though the rear
wishbone<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.880> kind<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.270> modified<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.560> know

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
wishbone is kind of a modified you know

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:48.179 
wishbone is kind of a modified you know
swing<00:02:40.010> arm

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:04:04.600 

put<00:02:49.189> up<00:02:49.849> or<00:02:50.090> shut<00:02:50.620> up

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.790 

oh<00:04:04.670> forget<00:04:05.480> it

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.710 

that's<00:04:12.800> ground<00:04:13.130> clearance<00:04:13.450> that's<00:04:14.450> how<00:04:14.600> it's

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
that's ground clearance that's how it's

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.780 
that's ground clearance that's how it's
going<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:14.870> sit<00:04:15.110> then<00:04:15.860> on<00:04:16.190> that<00:04:16.370> side<00:04:16.640> over

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
going to sit then on that side over

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.250 
going to sit then on that side over
there<00:04:17.560> we're<00:04:18.560> going<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.739> put<00:04:18.980> our<00:04:19.130> normal<00:04:19.610> our

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
there we're going to put our normal our

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.510 
there we're going to put our normal our
normal<00:04:21.260> amount<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.709> goes<00:04:21.890> on<00:04:22.130> top<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.400> the

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
normal amount that goes on top of the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.430 
normal amount that goes on top of the
transmission<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.330> then<00:04:23.930> just<00:04:24.170> figure<00:04:24.410> out

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
transmission and then just figure out

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.980 
transmission and then just figure out
where<00:04:24.740> those<00:04:25.670> through<00:04:26.030> bolt<00:04:26.270> holes<00:04:26.510> are<00:04:26.780> that

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
where those through bolt holes are that

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.020 
where those through bolt holes are that
hold<00:04:27.170> that<00:04:27.280> mountain<00:04:28.280> to<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.520> frame<00:04:28.820> rail

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
hold that mountain to that frame rail

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.850 
hold that mountain to that frame rail
and<00:04:29.240> we'll<00:04:29.780> make<00:04:29.930> a<00:04:29.960> bracket<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.530> kind<00:04:30.800> of

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
and we'll make a bracket that kind of

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.950 
and we'll make a bracket that kind of
cascades<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.520> goes<00:04:32.120> down<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.480> hangs<00:04:32.630> on<00:04:32.810> to

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
cascades and goes down and hangs on to

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.580 
cascades and goes down and hangs on to
our<00:04:33.050> our<00:04:33.560> mount<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:35.780> then<00:04:36.140> once<00:04:36.320> all<00:04:36.440> that's

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
our our mount and then once all that's

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.840 
our our mount and then once all that's
done<00:04:36.770> we'll<00:04:37.400> we'll<00:04:38.300> use<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.630> O<00:04:38.660> six<00:04:39.020> civic<00:04:39.320> SI

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
done we'll we'll use the O six civic SI

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.750 
done we'll we'll use the O six civic SI
oil<00:04:40.850> pan<00:04:41.230> so<00:04:42.230> that<00:04:42.260> we<00:04:42.470> can<00:04:42.620> use<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:43.100> style<00:04:43.610> of

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
oil pan so that we can use that style of

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.670 
oil pan so that we can use that style of
rear<00:04:44.150> mount<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.600> then<00:04:45.230> we'll<00:04:45.380> just<00:04:45.500> figure

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
rear mount and then we'll just figure

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.470 
rear mount and then we'll just figure
out<00:04:45.800> word<00:04:46.010> you<00:04:46.370> know<00:04:46.490> how<00:04:46.790> to<00:04:46.850> make<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.270> fit

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
out word you know how to make it fit

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.200 
out word you know how to make it fit
with<00:04:47.720> this<00:04:47.930> sub<00:04:48.380> front<00:04:48.620> this<00:04:49.340> particular<00:04:49.880> one

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
with this sub front this particular one

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.240 
with this sub front this particular one
happens<00:04:50.420> to<00:04:50.570> be<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.690> same<00:04:50.870> as<00:04:51.050> 0-6<00:04:51.440> Civic<00:04:51.740> so

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
happens to be the same as 0-6 Civic so

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.580 
happens to be the same as 0-6 Civic so
you<00:04:52.310> just<00:04:52.460> use<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.760> O<00:04:52.790> six<00:04:53.060> civic<00:04:53.360> cables<00:04:54.320> and

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
you just use the O six civic cables and

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.800 
you just use the O six civic cables and
we'll<00:04:54.830> just<00:04:55.190> make<00:04:55.400> new<00:04:55.580> brackets<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.300> attach

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
we'll just make new brackets to attach

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.540 
we'll just make new brackets to attach
them<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.140> the<00:04:57.260> transmission<00:04:59.620> coming<00:05:00.620> up<00:05:00.860> Ryan

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
them to the transmission coming up Ryan

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.160 
them to the transmission coming up Ryan
breaks<00:05:01.790> down<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.120> process<00:05:02.360> of<00:05:02.720> designing<00:05:03.110> the
