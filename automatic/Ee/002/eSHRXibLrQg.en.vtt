00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.590
 hello friends welcome back to what 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.600
 more paranormal 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.260
 today I come to talk about a creature 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.140
 strange to be named in the project 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.279
 extraterrestrials if you see that it presents itself to 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.279
 end of the month of april 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.370
 10 years ago the remains were discovered 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.730
 Modified from a small object 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:42.610
 said object was the closest thing to a 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.610
 extraterrestrial or at least even my 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.610
 alien 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.970
 the fetus was provided with hard teeth 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.399
 His head was bulging and he had a 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.149
 extra bizarre extrusion in the 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.149
 upper part 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.160
 his body was scaly and dark in color and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.810
 unlike humans had 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.810
 nine ribs 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.939
 but recent research on its 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:20.080
 DNA already assume that the fetus is 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:23.470
 human origin and not extraterrestrial 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.190
 then how can I have 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.190
 some differences 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:35.020
 is it a fetus of a pre- human like 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.070
 the homo erectus osasuna ander tal 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.520
 and if that is how it was managed to conserve 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.799
 modified in that state 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.679
 are some of the unknowns that 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.650
 will have to resolve in the next 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.800
 documentary xirles 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.590
 since now it has been discovered that the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.290
 subject of human origin and has also been 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.450
 discarded 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.450
 of being a monkey or a primate 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.410
 even so and having some unknowns 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.619
 many more remain unresolved 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.470
 reply 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.680
 and at least I hope the doctor 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.969
 live, you can achieve 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.969
 in that documentary 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.819
 Greetings and see you in another new 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.599
 video 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.599
 see you later
