00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.609
 Good day to you Ruslan 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.239
 Romanyuk you are watching my video channel Rama 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.789
 games 

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:23.400
 I want to show you one developing 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.140
 a game that everyone knows for sure 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.019
 many played it in childhood 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.519
 the game is called monopoly in 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.859
 You can find several on the Internet 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.430
 various computer remakes of this 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.010
 toys 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.460
 I opted for a version from 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.890
 Osinki software because she 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.930
 Russian language only drawback 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.030
 This is the fact that she is very old therefore 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.950
 graphics outside are very primitive and on 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.290
 level of the late nineties 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.940
 but it's not that important since 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.790
 monopolies as in chess 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.270
 graphics are not critical 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.590
 the main thing is the gameplay itself 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.250
 You can download the toy completely 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.559
 free cis site . no there you can 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.170
 load various additional cards 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.450
 if you don't want to play classic 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.789
 field you want to make some 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.460
 variety in the game but personally I 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.229
 I prefer the classic version since 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.630
 she is the most realistic 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.939
 if I can say so pictures 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.100
 monopoly works perfectly for everyone 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.770
 windows versions since it is very 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.380
 primitive only problem 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.170
 which occurs after starting the game on 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.079
 new versions of windows are missing 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.200
 image gaming me instead we 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.630
 for some reason we see our desktop but 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.789
 this is solved quite simply 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.609
 first roll up the window with the game and then 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.439
 deploy it back for this should 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:50.549
 or press a combination on the keyboard 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.529
 Alt tab keys 2 times or click on 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.779
 the first of two circles which 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:57.869
 located on the top right corner of the game 

00:01:54.779 --> 00:02:00.979
 windows after this procedure we still 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.380
 see the game menu will be able to play it 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.899
 how to play monopoly ultimate goal 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.090
 games are to force out all competitors and 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.259
 remain the only monopolist on 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.480
 game board 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.799
 for this you need to buy as much as possible 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.750
 more real estate 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.129
 so that she brings us money and 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.739
 helped develop 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.400
 every cell on the playing field is something 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.439
 means 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.450
 there are cells on which are located 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:28.349
 properties are available for purchase 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.030
 the players are these press cells 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:35.519
 invisible price 100 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.590
 copy center price 110 store price 50 if 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.989
 we get on the cell owned 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.120
 one of the players against whom we 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.239
 compete that we will have to him 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.879
 pay and vice versa when getting on 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.420
 our cells are our rivals 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.430
 should give us a ding started gaming 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.120
 the cheapest field is located 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.329
 the property 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.170
 brings little income here this 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:04.769
 the press we have already seen 100 worth the book 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.889
 store 125 dollars and the farther 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.510
 real estate is steeper expensive to this end 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.000
 field 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.769
 filled with the most expensive objects 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.560
 who need to strive for 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.250
 purchase and also make sure that 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.709
 they could not take over our rivals 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.560
 example from the airline costs 700 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.329
 $ 200 store price and income 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.959
 accordingly, more sleep 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:33.449
 current income is 65 dollars and the press is 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.310
 first cell current income of only 8 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.780
 dollars 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.359
 objects of the same color can 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.549
 merge into corporations to establish 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.690
 the corporation needs to buy all three objects 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:49.530
 same color for example all three 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:53.220
 purple cells or all three red 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.959
 either green and so on after that to us 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.870
 will become available such function as 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.060
 opening stores cost money but 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.549
 it justifies itself as the presence of 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.230
 stores on our own cells 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.540
 significantly increases the cost of this 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.750
 real estate and our competitors are forced 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.709
 pay us more if you accidentally fall 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.109
 on these cells 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.150
 therefore it is important to try to buy at least 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.070
 one cell of each color 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.680
 To not give rivals on warp 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.840
 corporations otherwise they pull us all 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.099
 money we lose the exception 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.680
 make up ports 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:29.400
 as well as electricity and water supply 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.969
 here are ports 4 ports north west 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.979
 east and south here is electricity and 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:37.979
 water supply on these cells stores 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.300
 therefore it is impossible to put a pass on them 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.000
 It is always inexpensive 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.360
 there are also cells for interdiction 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.979
 which we have to pay money is 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:53.270
 taxes here they are and this one 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:56.490
 give money the inscription, too, this type 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:00.300
 entertainment venue hit 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:04.349
 these three cells from our account will be written off 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:08.849
 a certain amount of cells labeled 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:13.159
 the chance is these two and here it is the arrow 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:15.810
 where is it written take some money 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:20.340
 mean that we will be given the opposite 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:23.250
 lottery money here we can do three 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.560
 it could be as lucky here we can we 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.080
 get bucks as a gift or we have them 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.630
 will be taken away when they hit the cop 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.260
 plot with us will begin to extort bribe 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.750
 if we are gutters and do not pay 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.150
 policemen some money we will have 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.560
 miss and move a maximum of us can 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.320
 keep moving here 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.479
 and then still let go wait with everyone 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.669
 course bribe amount will decrease 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.060
 therefore sometimes it is more profitable to pay 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:53.969
 than sit in both of me Nikita last 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:57.659
 after each round of the playing field 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:06:00.360
 we are waiting for a salary of a couple of hundred dollars 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:02.699
 the beginning of the game it helps a lot but 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.659
 then this money becomes too little 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:08.789
 so I do not recommend them just 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:10.379
 run around the playing field and aimlessly 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.989
 spend precious moves 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:15.959
 otherwise computer opponents you quickly 

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:18.149
 bankrupt and you lose but if you all 

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:20.369
 did they manage to trade all their money 

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:22.679
 then you can lay some 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:24.739
 your property or 

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:29.009
 sell it to settle debts 

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:31.169
 he's here buttons to lay sell a game 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.869
 for you will end up losing when you 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.569
 left without money and without real estate 

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:38.759
 which can be sold as well in the game 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:43.110
 real estate exchange function between 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:45.299
 players here is a button in one setting 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.329
 games need to tick 

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:50.129
 asks permission to exchange otherwise 

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:52.469
 tricky computer without your demand 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:54.779
 quickly you change all your dear 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:58.139
 real estate on some cheap trash and 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:07:00.119
 you then lose the offer 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:02.610
 exchange from computer players is always 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:05.519
 very unprofitable so you can safely from 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.379
 refuse them does not even read well here and 

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:10.469
 all rules of winnings in this game 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:12.509
 the end much depends on luck but also 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:14.849
 player actions also have a strong effect on 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:16.800
 the end result if you don't 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:19.409
 think and plan your actions on 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.279
 few moves ahead then win you 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:25.829
 it will be very difficult to thank you all for 

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:27.989
