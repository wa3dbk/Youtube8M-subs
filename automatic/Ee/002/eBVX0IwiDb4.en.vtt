still<00:00:41.640> ridiculously<00:00:42.030> broken<00:00:42.750> even<00:00:43.440> more<00:00:43.710> so

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980

than<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.219> megaman<00:00:44.670> 2<00:00:44.879> probably<00:00:45.450> because<00:00:45.780> they

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
than in megaman 2 probably because they

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.130 
than in megaman 2 probably because they
take<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.940> greater<00:00:47.940> percentage<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> screen

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
take a greater percentage of the screen

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.119 
take a greater percentage of the screen
now<00:00:49.379> they<00:00:49.980> still<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.789> all<00:00:51.120> their<00:00:52.129> advantages

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
now they still have all their advantages

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.270 
now they still have all their advantages
in<00:00:53.309> dealing<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.120> lot<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.570> damage<00:00:54.780> being<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.620> shoot

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
etc etc so I won't be using them much of

dodge him very awkwardly and as the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.350 
dodge him very awkwardly and as the
hitboxes<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.380> work<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.070> game<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.909> is

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
hitboxes do not work in this game it is

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300 
hitboxes do not work in this game it is
just<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.840> cool<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.280> on

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
just not cool at all you see the one on

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.190 
just not cool at all you see the one on
the<00:01:23.549> stairs<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> far<00:01:24.600> better<00:01:24.750> placement

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the stairs is a far better placement

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.700 
the stairs is a far better placement
because<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.340> deal<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.700> him<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
because you have to deal with him and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.140 
because you have to deal with him and
actually<00:01:28.710> dodge<00:01:28.950> him<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.430> clever<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:29.759> but

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
actually dodge him in a clever way but

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.590 
actually dodge him in a clever way but
it's<00:01:30.329> not<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.750> em<00:01:31.020> knowingly<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:33.270> baton

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
it's not like em knowingly so the baton

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.910 
it's not like em knowingly so the baton
turns<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> other<00:01:34.170> hand<00:01:34.380> take<00:01:34.619> far<00:01:34.890> too

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
turns on the other hand take far too

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.980 
turns on the other hand take far too
long<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.310> deploy<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.970> i<00:01:36.000> could<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.450> skip<00:01:36.780> this

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990

but<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.360> could<00:01:54.659> take<00:01:54.960> out<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> lot<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
but you know you could take out a lot of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.380 
but you know you could take out a lot of
things<00:01:55.710> by<00:01:55.950> sparing<00:01:56.189> method<00:01:56.579> late<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:56.969> i<00:01:57.180> will

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
things by sparing method late so i will

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.959 
things by sparing method late so i will
not<00:01:57.509> do<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.869> because<00:01:58.020> I'm<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.500> us<00:01:58.619> grow<00:01:58.969> this

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
not do that because I'm of us grow this

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.780 
not do that because I'm of us grow this
bunny<00:02:00.210> also<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.810> placed<00:02:01.110> far<00:02:01.680> better<00:02:02.040> than<00:02:02.219> any

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
bunny also is placed far better than any

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.389 
bunny also is placed far better than any
other<00:02:03.240> enemies<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:03.899> far<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.200> guess<00:02:04.500> because<00:02:04.979> you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
other enemies so far I guess because you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.219 
other enemies so far I guess because you
have<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.090> let<00:02:06.240> him<00:02:06.360> shoot<00:02:06.630> because<00:02:06.689> he<00:02:07.020> has

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
have to let him shoot because he has

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.130 
have to let him shoot because he has
just<00:02:07.439> enough<00:02:07.770> hair<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.989> but<00:02:09.989> it's

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
just enough hair for that and but it's

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.140 
just enough hair for that and but it's
not<00:02:10.349> impossible<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:11.370> dodge<00:02:11.640> him<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.270> is

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
not impossible to dodge him it is

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.089 
not impossible to dodge him it is
you<00:02:13.390> have<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.750> position<00:02:14.049> yourself<00:02:14.560> cleverly

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
you have to position yourself cleverly

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.369 
you have to position yourself cleverly
rerouted<00:02:15.370> shots<00:02:16.030> it's<00:02:16.540> very<00:02:16.659> reminiscent<00:02:17.110> of

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
rerouted shots it's very reminiscent of

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.140 
rerouted shots it's very reminiscent of
the<00:02:17.439> first<00:02:17.769> games<00:02:18.159> puzzle<00:02:18.700> your<00:02:18.909> rooms

the first games puzzle your rooms

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.110

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
just reversing simply do not work all

just reversing simply do not work all
that<00:02:24.700> well<00:02:24.760> because<00:02:25.329> a<00:02:25.360> gaunt<00:02:25.810> enough<00:02:26.049> enemies

understood<00:02:31.359> by<00:02:31.810> ox<00:02:32.019> well<00:02:32.500> they<00:02:32.709> didn't<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.250> I

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
understood by ox well they didn't and I

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.789 
understood by ox well they didn't and I
said<00:02:34.209> in<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.450> blind<00:02:34.720> video<00:02:35.109> that<00:02:35.439> I<00:02:35.470> would

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
said in the blind video that I would

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.009 
said in the blind video that I would
show<00:02:36.010> off<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.489> water<00:02:36.700> park<00:02:37.030> there<00:02:37.359> and<00:02:37.659> the

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
show off the water park there and the

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.020 
show off the water park there and the
top<00:02:38.230> part<00:02:38.500> here<00:02:38.709> but<00:02:39.069> i<00:02:39.250> do<00:02:39.310> not<00:02:39.519> want<00:02:39.700> them<00:02:39.849> to

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
top part here but i do not want them to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.940 
top part here but i do not want them to
make<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.359> blind<00:02:40.569> videos<00:02:40.959> required<00:02:41.409> watching

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
make the blind videos required watching

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.020 
make the blind videos required watching
so<00:02:42.159> you<00:02:42.430> get<00:02:42.879> both<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.269> us<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:45.400> cannon<00:02:45.730> here<00:02:45.940> is

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
so you get both of us the cannon here is

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.479 
so you get both of us the cannon here is
also<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.629> giant<00:02:47.109> pain<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.530> ass<00:02:47.680> from<00:02:48.280> its

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
also a giant pain in the ass from its

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.240 
also a giant pain in the ass from its
placement<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.299> as<00:02:50.109> is<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.739> net<00:02:50.980> which

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
placement and as is this net which

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.520 
placement and as is this net which
completely<00:02:51.909> surprises<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.170> bullets

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
completely surprises you and the bullets

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.099 
completely surprises you and the bullets
are<00:02:53.739> again<00:02:54.329> somewhat<00:02:55.329> impossible<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.930> dodge

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
are again somewhat impossible to dodge

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.170 
are again somewhat impossible to dodge
but<00:02:57.010> my<00:02:57.190> main<00:02:57.340> problem<00:02:57.609> with<00:02:57.879> the<00:02:58.030> enemy

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
but my main problem with the enemy

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.539 
but my main problem with the enemy
placement<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.900> how<00:02:59.170> uh-huh<00:02:59.950> facade<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.430> is

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
placement is how uh-huh facade it is

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.940 
placement is how uh-huh facade it is
look<00:03:01.000> at<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.269> cannon<00:03:01.689> Lee<00:03:01.810> has<00:03:02.109> no<00:03:02.590> way<00:03:02.920> of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
look at this cannon Lee has no way of

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.830 
look at this cannon Lee has no way of
hitting<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:04.030> can't<00:03:04.269> just<00:03:04.450> hang<00:03:04.689> out

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
hitting you you can't just hang out

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.440 
hitting you you can't just hang out
there<00:03:04.900> is<00:03:05.230> absolutely<00:03:05.709> no<00:03:05.920> problem<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.609> again

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
there is absolutely no problem and again

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.599 
there is absolutely no problem and again
with<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.780> mat<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.379> far<00:03:08.769> harder<00:03:09.129> and<00:03:09.549> then

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
with the mat it is far harder and then

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.149 
with the mat it is far harder and then
at<00:03:09.909> the<00:03:10.060> end<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.450> have<00:03:10.540> these<00:03:10.930> new<00:03:11.200> spikes<00:03:11.650> for

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
at the end you have these new spikes for

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.460 
at the end you have these new spikes for
some<00:03:12.549> reason<00:03:13.000> which<00:03:13.329> do<00:03:13.540> not<00:03:13.569> think<00:03:14.079> you<00:03:14.349> will

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
some reason which do not think you will

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.619 
some reason which do not think you will
never<00:03:14.709> get<00:03:14.920> hit<00:03:15.040> by<00:03:15.250> them<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.299> room<00:03:16.450> gets

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
never get hit by them so the room gets

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.869 
never get hit by them so the room gets
progressively<00:03:16.930> easy<00:03:17.709> as<00:03:18.129> it<00:03:18.280> goes<00:03:18.489> on<00:03:18.669> which

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
progressively easy as it goes on which

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.770 
progressively easy as it goes on which
makes<00:03:19.180> absolutely<00:03:19.449> no<00:03:20.079> sense<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.799> me<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.780> you

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
makes absolutely no sense to me and you

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.180 
makes absolutely no sense to me and you
see<00:03:22.959> this<00:03:23.139> room<00:03:23.440> here<00:03:23.620> for<00:03:23.650> example<00:03:23.889> you

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
see this room here for example you

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.800 
see this room here for example you
cannot<00:03:24.519> just<00:03:24.669> jump<00:03:25.000> through<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.359> because<00:03:25.449> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
cannot just jump through it because the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.720 
cannot just jump through it because the
baton<00:03:26.139> tones<00:03:26.440> are<00:03:26.680> still<00:03:27.069> in<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.310> way<00:03:27.430> because

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
baton tones are still in the way because

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.550 
baton tones are still in the way because
it<00:03:27.849> is<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.120> cramped<00:03:28.569> but<00:03:28.720> they<00:03:28.900> still<00:03:29.109> take<00:03:29.349> too

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
it is so cramped but they still take too

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.589 
it is so cramped but they still take too
long<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.769> deploy<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.549> don't<00:03:31.090> really<00:03:31.329> know<00:03:31.449> what

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
long to deploy so don't really know what

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.619 
long to deploy so don't really know what
to<00:03:31.750> think<00:03:31.829> these<00:03:32.829> Mets<00:03:33.099> to<00:03:33.400> hear<00:03:33.699> you<00:03:33.970> have<00:03:34.359> no

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
to think these Mets to hear you have no

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.599 
to think these Mets to hear you have no
way<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:35.019> dodging<00:03:35.290> this<00:03:35.680> one<00:03:35.919> if<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.190> let<00:03:36.370> him

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
way of dodging this one if you let him

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.720 
way of dodging this one if you let him
shoot<00:03:36.909> so<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.799> have<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:39.010> go<00:03:39.159> down<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.609> ladder

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
shoot so you have to go down the ladder

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.550 
shoot so you have to go down the ladder
awkwardly<00:03:40.449> because<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.959> letter<00:03:41.139> physics

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
awkwardly because the letter physics

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.830 
awkwardly because the letter physics
also<00:03:41.709> do<00:03:41.919> not<00:03:42.069> work<00:03:42.280> in<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.549> also<00:03:42.940> all<00:03:43.120> not<00:03:43.599> very

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
also do not work in is also all not very

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.080 
also do not work in is also all not very
well<00:03:44.109> thought<00:03:44.139> out<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.949> why<00:03:45.609> did<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.879> get<00:03:46.030> a

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
well thought out and why did I get a

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.420 
well thought out and why did I get a
second<00:03:46.569> large<00:03:46.810> energy<00:03:47.109> pellet<00:03:47.590> in<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:48.069> second

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
second large energy pellet in the second

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.250 
second large energy pellet in the second
room<00:03:48.579> in<00:03:48.729> a<00:03:48.819> row<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.180> really<00:03:49.720> do<00:03:49.870> not<00:03:50.019> know

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
room in a row I really do not know

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.930 
room in a row I really do not know
because<00:03:50.919> here<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.310> another<00:03:51.519> checkpoint

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
because here is another checkpoint

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.449 
because here is another checkpoint
actually<00:03:52.750> this<00:03:53.470> game<00:03:53.769> has<00:03:53.979> a<00:03:54.010> lot<00:03:54.430> of

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
actually this game has a lot of

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.879 
actually this game has a lot of
checkpoints<00:03:55.329> in<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:56.019> levels<00:03:56.349> and<00:03:56.500> with<00:03:56.709> this

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
checkpoints in the levels and with this

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.129 
checkpoints in the levels and with this
far<00:03:57.190> easy<00:03:57.340> for<00:03:57.639> them<00:03:57.729> if<00:03:58.599> I<00:03:58.720> mentioned<00:03:59.079> that

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
far easy for them if I mentioned that

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.319 
far easy for them if I mentioned that
the<00:03:59.319> engine<00:03:59.650> doesn't<00:03:59.799> work<00:04:00.190> because<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:01.000> is

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
the engine doesn't work because it is

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.020 
the engine doesn't work because it is
really<00:04:01.780> not<00:04:01.900> good<00:04:01.959> at<00:04:02.290> all<00:04:02.549> so<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.699> robot

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
really not good at all so the robot

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.330 
really not good at all so the robot
chickens<00:04:04.419> they<00:04:05.260> have<00:04:05.409> been<00:04:05.650> changed<00:04:06.069> a<00:04:06.190> little

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
chickens they have been changed a little

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.490 
chickens they have been changed a little
comparison<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.269> Mega<00:04:07.449> Man<00:04:07.690> 2<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.870> think<00:04:08.229> there

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
comparison to Mega Man 2 I think there

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.259 
comparison to Mega Man 2 I think there
you<00:04:08.650> could<00:04:08.829> just<00:04:08.979> stand<00:04:09.370> up<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:09.909> jump<00:04:09.940> and

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
you could just stand up and jump and

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.939 
you could just stand up and jump and
here<00:04:10.510> they<00:04:10.629> will<00:04:10.780> jump<00:04:11.079> after<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.409> fixed<00:04:11.739> time

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
here they will jump after a fixed time

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.699 
here they will jump after a fixed time
of<00:04:12.250> being<00:04:12.609> on<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:13.000> screen<00:04:13.269> which<00:04:13.989> is<00:04:14.199> fair<00:04:14.680> i

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
of being on the screen which is fair i

of being on the screen which is fair i
guess<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.340> if<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:15.639> have<00:04:15.729> metal<00:04:16.030> days<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.299> can

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
guess and if you have metal days you can

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.779 
guess and if you have metal days you can
completely<00:04:17.139> and<00:04:17.380> utterly<00:04:17.470> realize<00:04:18.310> them<00:04:18.609> if

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
completely and utterly realize them if

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.149 
completely and utterly realize them if
you<00:04:19.269> remember<00:04:19.720> in<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.989> original<00:04:20.229> Mega<00:04:20.769> Man<00:04:20.979> 2

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
you remember in the original Mega Man 2

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.810 
you remember in the original Mega Man 2
they<00:04:21.370> were<00:04:21.430> actually<00:04:21.969> if<00:04:22.330> you

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
they were actually if you

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.760 
they were actually if you
to<00:04:22.910> methylate<00:04:23.360> survivor<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:24.110> change<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.650> I

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
to methylate survivor to change it I

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.240 
to methylate survivor to change it I
have<00:04:24.920> no<00:04:25.370> idea<00:04:26.350> but<00:04:27.350> actually<00:04:27.770> this<00:04:27.920> pretty

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
have no idea but actually this pretty

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.520 
have no idea but actually this pretty
fun<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.610> do<00:04:28.730> with<00:04:28.910> them<00:04:29.060> here<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:29.540> this<00:04:30.290> is<00:04:30.350> a

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
fun to do with them here and this is a

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.930 
fun to do with them here and this is a
very<00:04:30.890> very<00:04:31.070> nice<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:33.890> change<00:04:34.610> in<00:04:34.730> pace

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
very very nice the change in pace

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.970 
very very nice the change in pace
because<00:04:35.570> you're<00:04:36.290> torturing<00:04:36.560> chickens<00:04:36.740> all

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
because you're torturing chickens all

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.590 
because you're torturing chickens all
the<00:04:37.100> times<00:04:37.280> up<00:04:37.520> there's<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.970> bunny<00:04:38.180> which<00:04:38.450> is

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
the times up there's a bunny which is

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.240 
the times up there's a bunny which is
completely<00:04:38.990> throwing<00:04:39.320> off<00:04:39.530> your<00:04:39.560> timing<00:04:40.100> and

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
completely throwing off your timing and

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.310 
completely throwing off your timing and
it's<00:04:40.700> a<00:04:40.850> very<00:04:41.030> very<00:04:41.120> clever<00:04:41.690> trap<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:42.290> you

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
it's a very very clever trap and you

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.320 
it's a very very clever trap and you
have<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.650> watch<00:04:42.800> out<00:04:42.980> for<00:04:43.010> that<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:43.730> did<00:04:44.090> like

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
have to watch out for that so I did like

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.230 
have to watch out for that so I did like
that<00:04:44.630> stretch<00:04:45.310> now<00:04:46.310> for<00:04:46.580> good<00:04:46.730> men<00:04:46.940> sports

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
that stretch now for good men sports

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.240 
that stretch now for good men sports
fight<00:04:47.570> Woodman<00:04:48.050> has<00:04:48.200> always<00:04:48.590> been<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.830> shitty

fight Woodman has always been a shitty
boss<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:49.850> I<00:04:49.910> hated<00:04:50.210> him<00:04:50.540> because<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.380> is<00:04:51.500> just

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
boss and I hated him because it is just

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.280 
boss and I hated him because it is just
so<00:04:51.920> boring<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.520> basic<00:04:52.760> and<00:04:53.270> you<00:04:53.510> have<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.960> have

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
so boring and basic and you have to have

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.430 
so boring and basic and you have to have
pixel<00:04:54.740> perfect<00:04:54.920> dodging<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.960> case

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
pixel perfect dodging in this case

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.090 
pixel perfect dodging in this case
however<00:04:57.910> he's<00:04:58.910> an<00:04:59.090> absolute<00:04:59.270> joke<00:04:59.870> his<00:05:00.740> damage

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
however he's an absolute joke his damage

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.550 
however he's an absolute joke his damage
has<00:05:01.310> been<00:05:01.340> reduced<00:05:01.820> far<00:05:02.420> far<00:05:02.870> far<00:05:03.200> more<00:05:03.260> than

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
has been reduced far far far more than

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.770 
has been reduced far far far more than
it<00:05:03.770> should<00:05:03.890> need<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.790> be<00:05:04.970> reduced<00:05:05.360> even<00:05:05.540> though

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
it should need to be reduced even though

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.320 
it should need to be reduced even though

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
it didn't to be reduced my opinion you

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.870 
it didn't to be reduced my opinion you
can<00:05:08.600> shoot<00:05:08.930> through<00:05:09.320> his<00:05:09.620> shield<00:05:10.190> with<00:05:10.610> just

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
can shoot through his shield with just

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.390 
can shoot through his shield with just
kind<00:05:11.150> of<00:05:11.410> defeating<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.500> whole<00:05:12.650> point<00:05:12.980> of<00:05:13.250> a

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
kind of defeating the whole point of a

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.060 
kind of defeating the whole point of a
shield<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:14.050> as<00:05:15.050> I<00:05:15.110> said<00:05:15.260> you<00:05:15.470> can<00:05:15.500> just<00:05:15.860> tanked

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
shield and as I said you can just tanked
