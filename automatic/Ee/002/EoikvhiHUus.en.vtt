00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.170
 hello hello what's up kids like that 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.930
 we have let's go for another 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.990
 achievement is going to be here in the tidal nest 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.020
 dark is worth here south of the shadow valley 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.390
 moon he managed a giant tortilla says 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.840
 breaks the egg of r and the giant in the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.410
 level more dark tide vale come for 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.690
 to get it 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.310
 well for the first thing we come here ok 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.620
 the island here further south of the valley 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.010
 and what we have to do is kill 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.180
 engineering of this dark tide are worth 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.760
 both the engineers that are 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.550
 directly on the ground like those that 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.059
 are mounted on robots or these we 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.860
 will give the rocket backpack ok and with this 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.080
 backpack for what we have is during 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.230
 three minutes there you can see the bufo 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:58.550
 top right in the minimum 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:00.950
 a backpack because that the rocket ok 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.320
 we do not have to use 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.350
 it's necessary because I would not know 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.470
 tell you if the toy this we go toy 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.080
 Workshop contraption not mico do not know if 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.229
 would arrive is so high up and the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.570
 abyan's halls has been what it's called 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.479
 I think that they do not arrive so high 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.700
 so then the appropriate thing would be to do it 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.860
 with this where I say would be to send what 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.320
 better 23 engineers and I would finish the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.020
 rod giving you the backpack 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.040
 come once we have the backpack myself 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.070
 same for the northern area of ​​the island 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.800
 why I think it's easier 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.160
 upload now you are going to see a little how 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.160
 it is going up 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.549
 Come on, it has enough range but I 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.439
 I think that already in the area by the zone of 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.719
 here on the mountain I think that the 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.659
 jumps are too long 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:59.899
 then I would not give would not give the backpack the 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.270
 range that we have hopefully since the 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.850
 island come here for this area you kill 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.950
 to the engineers in this area and then 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.450
 for this very reason you start to climb 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.660
 since here you will find eggs 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.520
 big 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.180
 then they will raise us in what would be the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.490
 advance in the assault mission which 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.200
 I think it's necessary to be able 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.230
 make the achievement because otherwise we can not 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.250
 interact with the eggs if we do not have 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.350
 the mission of assaulting the nest or is of 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.750
 citadel campaign that sends us to 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.420
 here we could not do it 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.370
 come on but we're here finishing 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.430
 I have not seen anything you do not have does not have much 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.340
 mystery 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.840
 and since on top of everything at the top here 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.840
 we have return of giant rule worth 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.040
 get the coordinates a little bit of 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.040
 all 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.890
 and well from here then we are going to 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.870
 we are going to take it and we will be there 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.870
 we have a giant tortilla 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.829
 and I leave you with these views you know how 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.200
 make another scream and nothing for him in 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.760
 how much do you have access to this area to be 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.040
 by the daily for the mission of the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.769
 citadel or come here and achievement 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.690
 It's worth it, you know that 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.280
 so more information and such I will leave you here 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.330
 in 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.400
 the link water or pp ok and nothing if it has 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.130
