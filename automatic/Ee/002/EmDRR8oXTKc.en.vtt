00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.099
 so I wanted to say two words by 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.400
 report on the relationship between another 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.469
 artistic idea is your interpretation 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.020
 and the technique 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.390
 the relationship with the fingers because in 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.660
 done when you have the idea of ​​a stamp 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.560
 to whose phrases and 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.720
 there for you it passes before touching 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.110
 acquired in touch and that will guarantee the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.239
 sound result that you want to get 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.040
 and touching it must be very concrete 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.870
 you must know exactly for 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.989
 what reasons do you use means 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.400
 techniques so that's out for that 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.860
 we give you is installed the report 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.660
 between your body is the instrument and 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.910
 to know exactly what are you 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.879
 make to get every little 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.680
 sound gradation so that's 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.930
 would seem logical it seems very 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.899
 obvious but yesterday for example I have side 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:05.780
 a pianist who could not go 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:09.170
 beyond my nice strong jumps because 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.600
 that I think he feared the world 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.240
 caught up that sealed if they're over 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.160
 strong and so virgin waited someone 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.039
 who's who and who's a concert performer 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.940
 are many concerts but his palette 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.280
 dark and the very limited between 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.110
 share yes and so when I looked 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.330
 what does he do with his body and 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.819
 how energy understood the problem and 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.950
 the problem what his body intervenes 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.470
 not so stiff neck and back 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.860
 there are the bankers days and when she 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.470
 wanted to play harder he did that 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.649
 when we do that you're screwed 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.560
 there is nothing then what do we 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.840
 hurts you just have to see this 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.860
 that they did the classics the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.039
 prefects to there is a chopin exercise 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.349
 however, advised this exercise 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.750
 all teachers from 1st 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.729
 course with the student, ie that 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.069
 chopin considered that this exercise that 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.869
 must be the first relationship with the 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.819
 piano of the first contact with the feet 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.530
 bah I do not know why you 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.510
 do not do but in fact I'm going to 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.450
 between this exercise and I think that's 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.370
 very useful even for concert players 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.110
 because if you are going to try doing 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.850
 once you will see that there is a 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.220
 some thing that you do not use 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.830
 there are you how to say 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.440
 possibilities that are still dormant 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.130
 which are put 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.550
 the interviews use so here's in 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.640
 do we press the right pedal we do not 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.160
 loose more 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.650
 there was an easiest finger with 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.739
 the third we start playing a 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.050
 Strip alone game is to busnes 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.560
 from the sweetest fashion the most 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.319
 low 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.930
 until you rent or cloud then center 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:06.560
 going through every step was 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.530
 intermediate and you will see that 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.090
 we do it with our body 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.410
 that is when we use the 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.470
 gravitational principle 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.930
 that is to say that to lie down small 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.180
 object and falls small distances and 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:28.819
 viable strike if a grain of home 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:33.400
 we fall from 5th floor ben it'll be 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:38.749
 the trait and so it's for him to get 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.420
 from piano to telus tv we do not play on 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:43.810
 For this purpose there we showed facebook 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.870
 the sand to show that two encounters 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:51.709
 in fact that in common or it's a small 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.870
 finger that plays on the key there is 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.549
 no distance between our fingers and the 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:01.129
 open mouth 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.410
 it is a very good style with which one 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.780
 can do anything 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.719
 when you vote 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.670
 or 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:12.310
 make a voice more or believe you 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.150
 see that there is already the wrist that 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.959
 conquers there is a certain distance 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.959
 enjoyed before the arm 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.040
 m 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.310
 I am 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.789
 e 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.219
 I always had you always have the 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.849
 bottom there is no brake there is 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.849
 some tips 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:52.920
 this is not what is ugly and so what 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.050
 advised to do not do it is to do 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.420
 with every finger with us for this 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.820
 style with the 5th but it's mostly with 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.410
 the 5th 25th is another story I 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.850
 you were talking about 5th must pass the 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.520
 disaster what are you doing 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:09.300
 you go to it I very often have it 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.100
 have to put it standing in it's too and 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.140
 must bear the weight of our body 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.150
 that we fall back to small dishes 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.250
 put a vertical and so you go 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.450
 do the same exercise and with the little 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.450
 5th must also 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.949
 no 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.590
 m 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.689
 we 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.419
 or 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:36.069
 and a pediatrician you make to laugh that's 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.080
 to say that we stronger than me for 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.829
 we have a strong stir now to 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.739
 save time I did lille but if 

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:48.759
 I'm wrong I can not find I can 

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:51.519
 harris 58 59 10 between us between me 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:54.579
 must and not see others this is 

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:57.399
 which you have to do already with your 

00:05:54.579 --> 00:06:00.459
 pupils from pine first course and 

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:03.059
 and even if you're moving forward that's it 

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:06.309
 does good to revise this exercise 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:08.529
 regularly to re install this 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:11.050
 feeling that I made love I can 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:12.909
 order whatever I wanted to say 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.189
 immediately know exactly what 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:19.769
 means I do it that's it's the base 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:19.769
 of our piano interpretation
