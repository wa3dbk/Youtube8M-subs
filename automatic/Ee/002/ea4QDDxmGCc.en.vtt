00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:08.340
 good to ask for a little bit of everything except the 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:10.780
 years, my name is gloria 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.830
 I am freelance, I dedicate myself to 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.830
 organization of congresses events 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.260
 the central price and when they gave me the 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.840
 availability of schedules and that 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.660
 they are because if it is price but then not 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.650
 there are schedules 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.239
 and with work I have it very clear and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.720
 when your schedules and late 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.000
 week and everything fantastic and it is also that 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.860
 the people that go it seems that also 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.780
 they are chosen not only personal but 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.780
 the students 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.890
 here you are encouraged that 99% prove that if you 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.140
 you put us we help you that if 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.880
 you 're going to try for sure everything was 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.280
 positive positive then late as 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.380
 we went out we all laughed and then when 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.600
 they told me is that it has been zero to failures 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.160
 zero failures and good that affirms is my 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.160
 life I think it's worth I 'll believe it 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.850
 very easy in class because really 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:18.450
 I say they teach you to try 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.200
 and they teach you how to drive 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.200
 people 2 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:34.380
 min and I loved doing it in a mini if 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:36.640
 is that you enter as the decoration as 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.630
 I was also studying marketing 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.240
 secret is 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.340
 you value all this because you get 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.490
 through the eyes people kindness is 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.710
 a profile that goes with me and I think it's going 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.909
 with many people because it is a change to be 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.899
 has made a change of generation and 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.899
 that did not work
