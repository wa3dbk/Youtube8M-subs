00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.590

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.810
 ariana has samsung right demo 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.450
 played that I already theme d3 and 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.400
 played yes that's what have you seen what 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.410
 there being done some of the shall 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.180
 practice intermediate canopy for one to one 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.460
 scam costs went to a chemical plant 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.040
 where the scarecrow is a gift from his hand 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.510
 would be good what they do they leave 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.610
 him intro'tje they see the driver 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.030
 batmobile a little bit a bit afferd 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.870
 to 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.390
 is of course something that one 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.710
 occupies a prominent place within the 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.360
 new batman there it is not common 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.620
 a little car we a bit around we like 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.170
 has a missions through or would it say 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.000
 a prominent role there is the fattest 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.519
 most comprehensive bat mobile ever 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.930
 have seen a whole batman and and they beautiful 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.909
 also immediately give a place in this demo 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.589
 because you come to the manufacturer 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.780
 mind is inside without the thing you need the 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.690
 pop out of the gate in battle mode 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.740
 battle mode where you have to aim with 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.900
 the bat mobile 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.150
 we have real 36 can come true 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.890
 and then your death and destruction can be boring 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.940
 is kind of heavy that has poor mode 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.280
 actually be your whenever 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.420
 actually one can use what you don't 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.560
 can do if you are the common man we are 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.450
 just a lot can tear when you out 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.890
 who just never did sent him murder 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.740
 and whoever says just built it up 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.780
 speed he good and what's cool is that 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.940
 everything goes on like simons 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.100
 from the cinematics rows 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.630
 straight through in a playboy piece 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.040
 but also with that bat mobile you can 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.140
 arrive driving 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.030
 you jump out you do one or the other 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.160
 follow key light chicken far in is right away 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.190
 in the action so it's just high pass 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.870
 it's fast and jesus what does it look fat 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.160
 from that looks so good because the 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.720
 graphics look it is natural with 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.270
 jenny yes it is 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.159
 look you should i say i have never 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.020
 such a sexy leather suit your family 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.730
 yes yes well that it packs too 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.740
 one thing of course because it is not 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.450
 just a leather suit you have one 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.710
 a bit of a philosophy behind I think because 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.990
 batman was of course always very bad 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.880
 techy always had a lot of gadgets 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.099
 but everything is very similar now 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.260
 The wetsuit is also integrated 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.540
 really betsy two point 3 point zero 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.410
 maybe even though it is one 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.270
 kind of combat arms light sweet 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.440
 giant remote control and a it 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.170
 is all just going to a level 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.370
 further than in the previous batman's and yes 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.290
 i just have to say it works 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.520
 very nice and that struck me 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.870
 indeed also because it is normal 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.820
 all together just works very well 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.950
 you smooth your Batmobile 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.110
 you run your tight to the bad guys 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.790
 the glide that glide kiksen 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.440
 in the freeflow it was always possible 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.790
 all super sol it has been and it is now 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.410
 she also puts it back in 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.970
 you switch off is blink back in you 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.480
 car then continues to the next one 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.480
 objects 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.080
 free folk to it is in this pepper game 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.640
 also really next level was in the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.040
 previous game has not changed much 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.330
 compared to who's predecessor again but yes 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.920
 they now have some new things they 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.970
 have charlie tags that you can 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.370
 evade 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.900
 you can pick up the weapons for one 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.460
 hand out a few big hits with one 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.590
 lead pipe I think you can also just 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.080
 giant sinks and fireman characters and 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.300
 weather not just and warm take down 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.740
 rails because you can do a very free thing 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.060
 of you using it warm and that is 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.560
 the bat mobile again 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.450
 you can literally be a guy in the air 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.070
 throw and know with voice on the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.070
 shooting a bat mobile from the air 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.590
 ruby's now 7 years 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.090
 if there is one thing that stands out about this one 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.680
 batman game is all that's good out 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.030
 every batman games from 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.069
 absolutely but they just 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.110
 ironed out is a new animations 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.420
 in the freeflow combat is extensive and 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.069
 of course that bat mobile 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.870
 it all works so well with each other and 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.640
 runs seamlessly over acquisition 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.519
 as a landing and again and again 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.230
 what struck this idea is the cinematics 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.819
 running smoothly so nice also to 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.840
 I absolutely gameplay all my previous ones 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.189
 And son is that you really whole 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.230
 intensive anyway 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.790
 semi you had funny scene with batman and 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.049
 and the bad guy 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.909
 and did you still have that cattle two or 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.500
 the loading screen very briefly for the 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.000
 in the gameplay it came but was taken away 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.539
 it just works so well that's just 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.690
 fantastic 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.070
 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i this 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.539
 think it's going to be very simple 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.389
 when they play 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:30.300
 by the end of 2015, not by the end of sometime in 2005 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.919
 games 2015 comes out and you start it up and on 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.380
 3h later you realize that you are late to him 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.610
 for your school for your work I became for 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.199
 whatever faith you go the 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.570
 forget home from batman arkham knight 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:46.160
