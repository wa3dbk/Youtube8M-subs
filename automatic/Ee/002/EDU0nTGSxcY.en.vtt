00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.750
 hi girls, how are you? 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.520
 Welcome once again to my channel 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
 fashion and in this case I bring you an outfit 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.050
 but this one is summer summery 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.000
 because I always say the same but then 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.200
 same came long pants I do not know when 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.360
 that this time is very very very 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.700
 cool because I'm going to take the 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.530
 legs to the straight and to the air and then the 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.980
 T-shirt fabric is super super 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:35.129
 finito fresquito would not say it 's flax 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.650
 ok but it is very finite and very cool 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.260
 It's worth everything I'm going to bring in the 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.940
 video because this video if you have it in 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.160
 store the stores that I will go quoting 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.360
 throughout the video so if you 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.090
 center to the craving you already know that you can 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.980
 buy it and then quickly put it 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.350
 which is what I wear in makeup 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 a super neutral makeup for all 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.739
 the days for any occasion and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.690
 perfect for any type of eyes 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.239
 ok then what I wear is the shadow 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.860
 It was from sea all shadows are from sea 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.729
 and the shadow was on the mobile eyelid and 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.420
 then in the outer zone very slightly 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.270
 I carry the shadow 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.369
 the acting and then to darken look at a 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.390
 little bit more right in the corner takes the 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.119
 shadow 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.549

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.380

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.570

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.500
