00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.830 
two or three weeks before Batman V
Superman<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.880> there<00:01:42.270> wasn't<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.570> much

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
Superman then there wasn't that much

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.380 
Superman then there wasn't that much
around<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.770> could<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.310> taken<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.149> box

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
around it so it could have taken the box

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.999 
around it so it could have taken the box
office<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:45.899> those<00:01:46.079> few<00:01:46.439> weeks<00:01:46.649> maybe<00:01:46.829> it's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
office for those few weeks maybe it's

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.440 
office for those few weeks maybe it's
better<00:01:47.220> than<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.939> cuz<00:01:48.149> they've<00:01:48.329> been

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
better than we think cuz they've been

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.170 
better than we think cuz they've been
done<00:01:48.780> shooting<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> while<00:01:49.939> but<00:01:50.939> they're

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
done shooting it for a while but they're

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.670 
done shooting it for a while but they're
going<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:51.509> against<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.990> think<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.290> going<00:01:52.560> up

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
going up against I think not going up

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.469 
going up against I think not going up
against<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.460> around<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:53.970> time<00:01:54.210> I

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
against but like around that time I

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.350 
against but like around that time I
think<00:01:54.990> may<00:01:55.409> six<00:01:55.829> civil<00:01:56.340> wars<00:01:56.579> coming<00:01:56.880> out<00:01:57.030> May

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
kind of putting themselves in a much

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.730 
kind of putting themselves in a much
more<00:02:05.159> competitive<00:02:05.520> area<00:02:06.020> where<00:02:07.020> Pacific<00:02:07.530> Rim

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
more competitive area where Pacific Rim

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.350 
more competitive area where Pacific Rim
is<00:02:07.770> moving<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> more<00:02:08.640> competitive<00:02:09.000> area

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
is moving for a more competitive area

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.420 
is moving for a more competitive area
into<00:02:09.750> less<00:02:10.050> competitive<00:02:10.470> area<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.890> August

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
into less competitive area in August

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.350 
into less competitive area in August
where

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
where

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.390 
where
I<00:02:12.420> think<00:02:12.690> only<00:02:12.840> Suicide<00:02:13.560> Squad<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:14.010> coming<00:02:14.250> out

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
I think only Suicide Squad is coming out

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.520 
I think only Suicide Squad is coming out
that<00:02:14.670> same<00:02:14.910> around<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.390> same<00:02:15.420> time<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.260> I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
that same around that same time and I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.930 
that same around that same time and I
wish<00:02:16.770> they<00:02:16.950> kind<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.160> pushed<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.430> back<00:02:17.520> even<00:02:17.850> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
wish they kind of pushed it back even a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.430 
wish they kind of pushed it back even a
week<00:02:18.090> further<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:18.660> maybe<00:02:19.140> they<00:02:19.320> need

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
week further because maybe they need

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.600 
week further because maybe they need
more<00:02:19.560> time<00:02:19.740> with<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.010> visual<00:02:20.160> effects<00:02:20.490> is

this<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:35.970> just<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.239> little<00:03:36.480> bit<00:03:36.570> of<00:03:36.630> move<00:03:36.780> and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
this is just a little bit of move and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.810 
this is just a little bit of move and
it's<00:03:37.049> only<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.380> four<00:03:37.650> month<00:03:37.860> push<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:38.670> it

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
it's only a four month push so it

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.370 
it's only a four month push so it
doesn't<00:03:39.060> really<00:03:39.120> raise<00:03:39.420> any<00:03:39.630> flags<00:03:39.750> for<00:03:40.080> me<00:03:40.200> I

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.830 
doesn't really raise any flags for me I
just<00:03:40.769> don't<00:03:40.860> like<00:03:41.160> this<00:03:41.700> date<00:03:42.090> change<00:03:42.480> as<00:03:42.690> much

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
just don't like this date change as much

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.370 
just don't like this date change as much
as<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:43.049> like<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.320> date<00:03:43.500> change<00:03:43.739> for<00:03:44.010> warcraft
