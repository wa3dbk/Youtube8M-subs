the Sun it's a very diagrammatic model

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.030 
the Sun it's a very diagrammatic model
because<00:01:32.000> I've<00:01:32.150> just<00:01:32.330> shown<00:01:32.540> with<00:01:32.750> two<00:01:33.050> planets

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
because I've just shown with two planets

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.370 
because I've just shown with two planets
on<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.370> interior<00:01:35.030> which<00:01:35.750> are<00:01:35.930> going<00:01:36.170> around

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
on the interior which are going around

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.680 
on the interior which are going around
quite<00:01:36.800> a<00:01:36.830> lot<00:01:36.920> faster<00:01:37.700> than<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.000> earth<00:01:38.030> around

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
quite a lot faster than the earth around

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.770 
quite a lot faster than the earth around
the<00:01:38.870> Sun<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.580> outer<00:01:40.760> planets<00:01:41.330> which<00:01:41.510> move

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
the Sun and the outer planets which move

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.780 
the Sun and the outer planets which move
very<00:01:42.170> slowly<00:01:42.590> because<00:01:43.190> of<00:01:43.310> their<00:01:43.430> distance

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
very slowly because of their distance

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.270 
very slowly because of their distance
away<00:01:43.970> from<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.390> Sun<00:01:44.659> as<00:01:45.320> they<00:01:45.590> go<00:01:45.770> round<00:01:46.010> and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
away from the Sun as they go round and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.070 
away from the Sun as they go round and
orbit<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.820> Sun<00:01:48.280> now<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:49.940> is<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.270> fairly

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
orbit the Sun now this is a fairly

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.100 
orbit the Sun now this is a fairly
standard<00:01:51.530> model<00:01:52.180> and<00:01:54.010> you<00:01:55.010> can<00:01:55.190> see<00:01:55.490> that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
standard model and you can see that

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.410 
standard model and you can see that
we've<00:01:57.110> not<00:01:57.920> changed<00:01:58.340> anything<00:01:58.670> from<00:01:59.270> the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
we've not changed anything from the

we've not changed anything from the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.619 
system now many years ago they used to
make<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.489> I<00:02:10.610> think<00:02:10.640> they<00:02:10.939> may<00:02:11.090> still<00:02:11.390> make

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
make and I think they may still make

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
the Sun was the center of the orrery

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.049 
the Sun was the center of the orrery
because<00:04:58.349> the<00:04:58.529> mechanism<00:04:59.339> is<00:04:59.490> still<00:04:59.610> working

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:00.059 
because the mechanism is still working

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:02.540

in the phases of moons or planets or
anything<00:05:31.469> like<00:05:31.770> that<00:05:32.959> we<00:05:33.959> can<00:05:34.139> show<00:05:34.349> that

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379 
anything like that we can show that

anything like that we can show that
another<00:05:34.979> way<00:05:35.189> as<00:05:35.369> well

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
another way as well

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.980 
another way as well
we<00:05:37.020> can<00:05:37.229> take<00:05:37.469> a<00:05:38.069> simple<00:05:38.699> plan<00:05:39.270> again<00:05:39.629> that<00:05:39.839> we

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
we can take a simple plan again that we

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.860 
we can take a simple plan again that we
had<00:05:40.139> in<00:05:40.259> that<00:05:40.289> beginning<00:05:40.979> and<00:05:41.269> just<00:05:42.269> simply

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
had in that beginning and just simply

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.519 
had in that beginning and just simply
rotate<00:05:43.319> it<00:05:43.499> around<00:05:43.709> the<00:05:44.159> Sun<00:05:44.849> as<00:05:45.089> normal<00:05:45.629> this

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:46.529 
rotate it around the Sun as normal this

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.519 
rotate it around the Sun as normal this
is<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:46.979> heliocentric<00:05:47.699> the<00:05:48.269> version<00:05:48.719> as<00:05:49.409> it

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529 
is the heliocentric the version as it

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:53.809 
is the heliocentric the version as it
all<00:05:49.740> slowly<00:05:50.189> rotates<00:05:50.849> around<00:05:51.059> the<00:05:51.330> Sun<00:05:52.819> but

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 
all slowly rotates around the Sun but

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.259 
all slowly rotates around the Sun but
then<00:05:54.059> if<00:05:54.449> we<00:05:55.249> now<00:05:56.249> make<00:05:56.519> the<00:05:56.669> center<00:05:57.029> of<00:05:57.149> the

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:57.269 
then if we now make the center of the

00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:00.350 
then if we now make the center of the
earth<00:05:57.559> the<00:05:58.559> center<00:05:59.189> of<00:05:59.279> the<00:05:59.430> planetary<00:05:59.909> system

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
earth the center of the planetary system

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.179 
earth the center of the planetary system
it<00:06:01.169> will<00:06:01.379> all<00:06:01.529> rotate<00:06:02.069> around<00:06:02.389> clockwise<00:06:04.189> 24

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:05.189 
it will all rotate around clockwise 24

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:09.739 
it will all rotate around clockwise 24
hours<00:06:05.729> once<00:06:05.969> every<00:06:06.300> 24<00:06:06.719> hours<00:06:07.099> and<00:06:08.099> that<00:06:08.749> gives

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:09.749 
hours once every 24 hours and that gives

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.889 
hours once every 24 hours and that gives
you<00:06:09.899> again<00:06:10.229> the<00:06:10.649> same<00:06:10.919> sort<00:06:11.249> of<00:06:11.899> relationships

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:12.899 
you again the same sort of relationships

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:15.799 
you again the same sort of relationships
between<00:06:13.229> the<00:06:13.529> planets<00:06:13.949> and<00:06:14.189> the<00:06:14.939> Sun<00:06:15.389> and<00:06:15.689> the

stars and the moons to the earth as it
was<00:06:18.689> before<00:06:19.129> we<00:06:20.129> are<00:06:20.249> just<00:06:20.490> simply<00:06:20.869> changing

00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:21.869 
was before we are just simply changing

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:27.649 
was before we are just simply changing
the<00:06:22.050> center<00:06:22.830> of<00:06:23.219> rotation<00:06:25.069> and<00:06:26.069> so<00:06:26.339> you<00:06:26.399> see<00:06:26.729> in

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
the center of rotation and so you see in

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:33.350 
the center of rotation and so you see in
