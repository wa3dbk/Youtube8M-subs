00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.370 
polishing just remember that you're
supposed<00:05:08.760> to<00:05:08.850> do<00:05:09.000> really<00:05:09.240> really<00:05:09.450> thin<00:05:09.960> coats

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
supposed to do really really thin coats

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.950 
supposed to do really really thin coats
it<00:05:10.800> gives<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.700> best<00:05:11.940> finish<00:05:12.450> and<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.780> just

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
it gives it the best finish and it just

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.930 
it gives it the best finish and it just
looks<00:05:13.200> great<00:05:13.530> but<00:05:13.830> for<00:05:14.070> magnetic<00:05:14.430> you<00:05:14.760> have<00:05:14.850> to

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
looks great but for magnetic you have to

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.210 
looks great but for magnetic you have to
do<00:05:15.060> thin<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.720> then<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:16.229> do<00:05:16.410> it<00:05:16.560> like<00:05:16.800> super

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
do thin and then you do it like super

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.580 
do thin and then you do it like super
super<00:05:17.550> thick<00:05:17.970> it's<00:05:18.450> crazy<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:22.110> now<00:05:22.320> I'm<00:05:22.440> going

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
super thick it's crazy and now I'm going

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.380 
super thick it's crazy and now I'm going
to<00:05:22.650> take<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.950> cap<00:05:23.220> of<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.520> magnetic<00:05:23.940> polish

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
to take the cap of the magnetic polish

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.420 
to take the cap of the magnetic polish
because<00:05:24.780> it<00:05:24.960> has<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.320> magnet<00:05:25.740> on<00:05:25.890> it<00:05:25.950> and<00:05:26.310> I'm

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
because it has the magnet on it and I'm

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.130 
because it has the magnet on it and I'm
going<00:05:26.580> to<00:05:26.610> set<00:05:26.850> it<00:05:26.880> on<00:05:27.060> top<00:05:27.120> of<00:05:27.390> my<00:05:27.539> nail<00:05:27.840> not

straight on top but hovering over it for

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.580 
straight on top but hovering over it for
10<00:05:30.060> seconds<00:05:30.479> and<00:05:30.630> it<00:05:30.780> should<00:05:30.990> look<00:05:31.110> like<00:05:31.169> that

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590
