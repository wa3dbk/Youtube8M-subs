getting<00:00:09.870> up<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.410> bunch<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.980> missile<00:00:11.340> turrets<00:00:11.639> as

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
swinging mutalisks looks like Xena is

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.570 
swinging mutalisks looks like Xena is
going<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.590> pull<00:00:16.740> off<00:00:16.890> all<00:00:17.100> these<00:00:17.250> drones

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
going to pull off all these drones

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.310 
going to pull off all these drones
perhaps<00:00:18.000> transfer<00:00:18.420> him<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.810> third<00:00:19.050> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
perhaps transfer him to that third and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.130 
perhaps transfer him to that third and
going<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.430> try<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.090> save<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.600> layer<00:00:21.869> for

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
going to just try to save this layer for

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.960 
going to just try to save this layer for
as<00:00:22.230> long<00:00:22.410> as<00:00:22.470> possible<00:00:22.830> getting<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:23.850> be

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
as long as possible getting at be

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.300 
as long as possible getting at be
hydrolysed<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.810> while<00:00:25.019> he<00:00:25.199> can<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:26.130> I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
hydrolysed and while he can but I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.589 
hydrolysed and while he can but I
believe<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.789> layer<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.539> be

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
believe this layer is going to be

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.540 
believe this layer is going to be
short-lived<00:00:28.080> as<00:00:28.320> these<00:00:29.310> three<00:00:29.730> Thor's<00:00:30.199> and

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
short-lived as these three Thor's and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.860 
short-lived as these three Thor's and
the<00:00:32.550> one<00:00:32.700> medevac<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.809> be

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the one medevac here just going to be

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.280 
the one medevac here just going to be
too<00:00:34.170> much<00:00:34.200> especially<00:00:34.770> with<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> grid<00:00:35.340> micro

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
too much especially with the grid micro

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.440 
too much especially with the grid micro
see<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> one<00:00:37.590> Thor<00:00:37.800> has<00:00:37.980> 12<00:00:38.309> kills<00:00:38.579> 17<00:00:39.090> kills

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
see the one Thor has 12 kills 17 kills

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.080 
see the one Thor has 12 kills 17 kills
for<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.930> captain<00:00:40.379> Thor<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> unit's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
for that captain Thor if if the unit's

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.180 
for that captain Thor if if the unit's
lost<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.570> 400<00:00:43.200> resources<00:00:43.710> compared<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
lost just 400 resources compared to the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.060 
lost just 400 resources compared to the
3100<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> Zerg<00:00:45.450> player<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:46.469> Zinio<00:00:46.860> is

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
3100 for the Zerg player now Zinio is

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.340 
3100 for the Zerg player now Zinio is
going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> lose<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.820> layer<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.320> look

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
going to lose this layer so if we look

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.160 
going to lose this layer so if we look
he<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:49.980> yet<00:00:50.550> creating<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> layer<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:52.050> he

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
he is not yet creating a layer but he

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.319 
he is not yet creating a layer but he
does<00:00:52.379> get<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.770> nydus<00:00:53.129> worm<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.210> looks

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
does get this nydus worm up so it looks

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.819 
does get this nydus worm up so it looks
like<00:00:54.390> he's<00:00:54.600> creating<00:00:54.989> all<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> techie<00:00:55.620> can

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
like he's creating all the techie can

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.849 
like he's creating all the techie can
while<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.250> layer<00:00:56.460> was<00:00:56.699> was<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.469> now

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
while that layer was was up and now

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.319 
while that layer was was up and now
trying<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.219> saturate<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> second<00:01:00.180> good

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
trying to saturate the second good

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.389 
trying to saturate the second good
saturation<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.140> look<00:01:01.260> at<00:01:01.289> income<00:01:01.500> level<00:01:01.949> 50

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
saturation if we look at income level 50

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.359 
saturation if we look at income level 50
workers<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.910> 38<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.320> even<00:01:04.739> though<00:01:04.769> zinnia<00:01:05.159> did

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
workers for 38 so even though zinnia did

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.840 
workers for 38 so even though zinnia did
lose<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.729> expansion<00:01:06.740> he<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.950> still<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.729> an

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
lose that expansion he is still at an

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.820 
lose that expansion he is still at an
economic<00:01:09.360> advantage<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.170> thing<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.380> he<00:01:10.619> just

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
economic advantage the thing is he just

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.620 
economic advantage the thing is he just
sunk<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.400> many<00:01:11.610> minerals<00:01:11.790> into<00:01:12.119> defending

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
sunk so many minerals into defending

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
sunk so many minerals into defending
that<00:01:12.750> expansion<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.500> feel<00:01:13.950> he's<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.340> behind

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
that expansion I feel he's really behind

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.670 
that expansion I feel he's really behind
at<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.880> point<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> number<00:01:16.560> of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
at this point we do have a number of

at this point we do have a number of
Thor's<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> field<00:01:17.430> looks<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.759> five

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
Thor's on the field looks like five

Thor's on the field looks like five
Thor's<00:01:18.270> right<00:01:18.360> now<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:21.210> now<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.570> retreating

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
Thor's right now so now just retreating

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.570 
Thor's right now so now just retreating
back<00:01:22.200> trying<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.710> his<00:01:22.830> economy<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
back trying to get his economy up and

running his boxer through the income tab

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.510

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
should even up with these mules in just

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.670 
should even up with these mules in just
a<00:01:29.610> moment<00:01:29.880> 56<00:01:30.360> workers<00:01:30.689> compared<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> 40
