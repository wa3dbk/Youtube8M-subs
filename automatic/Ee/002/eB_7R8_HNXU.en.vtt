00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.900
 and in this video I come to show you how 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.279
 change the notification bar of the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.720
 galaxy s 4 by the galaxy s 5 like 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.620
 can see these are the originals of 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.940
 samsung 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:34.940
 that comes from galaxy s 4 not all several 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.820
 models we simply have to have 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.300
 installed the road explorer and for that 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.900
 we occupy the root user open the root 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.900
 explorer 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:54.129
 here in January w we can r 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.820
 will ask us for superuser's permission 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:01.890
 that we allow now we look for the folder 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.890
 what it says is called system 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.890
 and here is 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.049
 and now this file the third of 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:15.840
 build prop we leave you pressed and 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.840
 we select to open the text editor 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.460
 if we want to change it also from w 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.590
 hereu we say yes and here 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.940
 we simply search 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.380
 here 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:37.200
 where it says product name and productive is 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.479
 here we have to change it 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.549
 depends on the model if it is the galaxy and 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:53.630
 9,500 has to be capitalized 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:56.930
 It's a 900-hour script in both 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:03.850
 the river product and the ere or productive 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:07.820
 in my case my model is the sgh and 337 m 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:14.120
 for this model you have to put sm 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:19.250
 script n900 s this combination is also 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 for him and 9,500 5 is the same and March 37 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.970
 my him and 9,500 5 just here 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.510
 we delete what you have selected 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.780
 capital letters we put sm script 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.350
 in 900 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.350
 s 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:46.060
 and below we also erase what it has 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:48.950
 written and put that m script 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.860
 900 s 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.610
 and now we simply click on the button 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.740
 menu and select save changes 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.810
 the file was saved it was made copy of 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.980
 file security and now it's going to 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.870
 appear here below the file is 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.960
 can follow backup now what 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.320
 The only thing we have to do is go to 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.670
 restart the phone and right now 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.880
 we continue with the video 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.950
 but those are the icons that brings a bit 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.069
 when restarting they will see the change 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.739
 you can restart the computer after 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.930
 have modified the public file already 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.000
 we can see that the bar icons 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.890
 are already changed and only see the 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.800
 galaxy s 5 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.250
 and when they are activated, they have a 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.410
 tone like green green phosphorescent 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.350
 lemon 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:49.020
 the moment of being inactive is a tone 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:53.760
 like bluish green a little more clarito 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.650
 we just have to follow the steps 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.480
 I 'll tell you anyway I'm going to 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.760
 leave all the steps to follow in the 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.970
 description in case the video is not 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.739
 very clear and very important thing always 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.950
 they have to have a backup of their 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:12.030
 fs folder that is where it contains the 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:15.299
 email from all of your team as well 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.840
 they have to have a samsung galaxy s 4 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:22.620
 be it the international model the and 9.500 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:29.430
 which is the octa cord or the quad core and 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:31.639
 and 9500 is the 5 oy 337 and 337 m in this 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.659
 case I have 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:39.590
 and 337 m I am in Mexico from the 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:41.479
 telcel company and I have version 4.4 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.479
 points 2 also this is very important 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.379
 they have to have version 4 points 4.2 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.110
 the official kitkat and I have not got it 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:53.560
 with 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.350
 with custom drums rooms cooked that 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.250
 be from kitkat and if you want it 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.620
 try at your own risk I do not 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.080
 I have tried, I guarantee that it works 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.400
 with the official version xk and with the 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.620
 above mentioned models any doubt 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.080
 leave a message and I will try to answer 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.380
 as quickly as possible and all 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.670
 necessary files will be in the 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.550
 description of the video so that 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.290
 gnaws download the explorer also 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.100
 I'm going to make a video on how to root 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.530
 to the models of galaxy s 4 also another 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:34.639
 thing that changes apart from the bar 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:37.710
 the icons is the recent tasks 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.770
 previously, if I remember correctly, they were 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.940
 in a tone like black half transparent 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:48.009
 and now it seems in the blue 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.529
 without any problem we can eliminate them 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.779
 and then that would be all this is how 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:56.110
 change the bar icons 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:59.020
 Samsung Galaxy S 4 Notifications 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.210
 original to the galaxy s 5 icons 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.149
 I hope you liked it and I follow the 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.409
 video and remember to like it and
