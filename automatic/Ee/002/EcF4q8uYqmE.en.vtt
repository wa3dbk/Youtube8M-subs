00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.870
 well let's do a demonstration 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.080
 explaining how the indicator is installed 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.220
 of the change 3 I will fall for the miguel and this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.500
 it's all we have to place 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.289
 we have the display where we are going to see the 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.779
 numbers that has a screw so that 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.300
 then hold it where they like it best 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.079
 to you the bulb that we have to 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.230
 change to take the marches and just 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.790
 you have to install two cables so 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.290
 let's proceed to disassemble the motorcycle if 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.129
 I have it pre-disassembled to do 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.129
 everything faster 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.990
 here we have the keel below we take out 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.990
 all the screws that you have to jump 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.280
 well we have the keel outside 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.290
 let's take out the opinion protector 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.410
 we take out the two screws that we have to 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.730
 take 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.260
 what are two 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.260
 with a tube with a lot of patience 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.560
 well once we take out the protector from 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.369
 opinion 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.369
 Down here 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.210
 down here we have the burrito we have 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.759
 to change for the new one first let's 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.429
 proceed to unplug the cable that is 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.170
 is the cable that indicates the point the point 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.719
 dead on the board the lights and is 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.420
 green the n if this cable is not 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:44.509
 connected the motorcycle will not start 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.390
 it is very important we take it from here that 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.940
 has the cable pass there 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.740
 and now with a very thick philippe 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.740
 we look for the screw and back and down 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.060
 and we loose 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.040
 first we take out the screw 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.259
 Now this is convenient for someone to 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.050
 have the bike for the other side or if 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.360
 they want to put a ball down 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.720
 because oil is going to fall a little bit is not 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.940
 true 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.530
 so if they have a friend who 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.530
 help woman the motorbike for the other side 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.680
 a bit like that 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.750
 leave the bike in neutral the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.220
 we stop we do not change anything 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.310
 that is in neutral do not forget 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.640
 of what is important 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.880
 we throw out and the bulb comes out 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.010
 inside it looks like it has followed and I 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.770
 I tell them it seems that to knock it down for the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.710
 other side 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.450
 in this has a badge 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.730
 is what makes the dough 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.620
 I do not know if you can see it from 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.610
 so it is important to be in point 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.250
 dead and this little paw is going to be 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.180
 for there that is if they are fixed has a 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.030
 gutter this 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.660
 they put it 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.720
 and be like that 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.300
 let's see if you see us focus a bit 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.970
 better there if you can appreciate how it is 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.830
 all right 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.880
 as it dries a little bit and the oil that is 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.880
 is sucking too much 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.920
 and that has to be fine in the center 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:35.760
 because if it does not fall there 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.760
 well we put the indicator bulb 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.000
 you have to enter the little hole 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.000
 medium 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.340
 and the little hole 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.340
 where the screw went 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.210
 we put the screw back 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.040
 we tighten well with the philippe 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.030
 I advise you to be a fil and great 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.230
 big tip because 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.230
 they will not round it 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.400
 we squeeze it well dry the oil that 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.400
 has made river 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.209
 and that's all there is to be done 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.440
 engine 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.239
 we passed the cable 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.490
 so he gets hooked and does not 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.639
 hook with the chain 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.050
 and we started to install the cables and or 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.030
 I'm going to put it like this again so that you 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.210
 See it 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.230
 let's connect the cable this bold 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.230
 that comes from here 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.100
 this after d 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.690
 they put them there as it goes and I would have to go 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.430
 here the cable quoted this that we disconnected 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.910
 that I told him that if the bike did not 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.910
 Starts 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.030
 I do not know if we connect there 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.240
 and then we have the table cited this 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.810
 Red 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.840
 this cable cited red goes to positive from the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.870
 ignition key I have a red wire 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.070
 here already with the positive contact 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.070
 I want to take it from here 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.610
 then I'm going to explain to you how 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.909
 you can get that cable out of where you are going to 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.909
 take 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.650
 and we connect the positive that that I 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.840
 I say with the cable cited red 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.050
 well that 's all the connection that there is 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.030
 make that cable that is for you to indicate 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.740
 the dead spot on the board that 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.900
 also indicated Antics 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.030
 and the positive cable that when 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.460
 you read the contact key 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.930
 so we can already try 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.930
 we give you leave the contact 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.940
 let's see that I turn on the red that 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.320
 turn on the neutral there 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.410
 and we can proceed 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.200
 the post of course they spend everything for 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.440
 there you come, you put a seal 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.940
 to the box that I provide them and what 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.750
 hook where you want most even 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.310
 You can even put one of those 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.410
 double-sided adhesives or if you want it 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.849
 do with the screw and I chapita 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.510
 I had put it here it was good 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.950
 well let's go with the first 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.950
 like the motorcycle because yes no 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.540
 there we have first 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.870
 the dead center of the mean and that already 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.030
 we know with good 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.940
 there we have the dead point that indicates 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.950
 the 0 k and the n there 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.490
 and I am I had already shown it 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.490
 the changes 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.990
 third 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.640
 4a 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.640
 while it 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.789
 we put the changes 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:13.360
 good as you can see it 's simple fast 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.280
 they do not have to do much and not 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.370
 it fails mostly because it is taking 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.440
 directly on the exchange box not 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.060
 it's like the others that have magnets that 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.460
 you have to put it magnet on the lever 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.110
 stuck what the lever moves is 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.810
 puts any change that they have that 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:32.680
 resist for standstill or the others 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:35.430
 which are much more expensive and take on the 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.710
 speed of each change and has a 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:42.090
 delay and it gets in first and the two 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.090
 second you see the first 

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:48.590
 so this is all I wanted 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.100
 show like this 

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.820
 they like it or not 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.820
 see you next
