00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 well found on the youtube channel of 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.400
 mobile world 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.760
 a greeting from simone for the first video 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.920
 of 2015 in fact we talk about the report cards 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:21.990
 regarding the year that just 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:23.789
 elapsed we start from the tenth place of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.939
 this then ranks from the bottom 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.189
 obviously do the sony xperia z3 that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.980
 put in tenth place not because it is a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.200
 bad phone of course but why 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.329
 in my opinion, he alone had to 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.239
 especially improve the system 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.680
 then operating the graphical interface 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.430
 the camera that was not up to par 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.340
 of the sony brand is the fact that sony has 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.399
 decided to release only six months 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.980
 too much the z2 that you actually have 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.670
 brought about very obvious improvements 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.949
 but honestly I would have expected a 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.840
 canon 12 months in ninth place instead 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.470
 going a little against the current respect 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.680
 to the other m samsung galaxy s 5 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.479
 unfortunately not because he is a villain 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.939
 absolutely nothing to say device 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.760
 but because of this the other 8 that 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.799
 they are above are a tad bit better and if 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.210
 5 that still pays the fluidity still not 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.509
 just optimal especially 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.229
 a graphic interface too heavy and 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.299
 graphically not really excellent e 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.890
 also finally a frequency of 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.740
 updates especially for what 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.159
 it's about lollipop that is struggling to arrive 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.060
 still on the samsung galaxy s 5 so not 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.689
 I have room for him 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.370
 eighth place for huawei s7 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.930
 why 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.720
 in this eighth place for the simple 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.810
 reason that now is at a price 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.900
 really withdrawn and brings with it 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.280
 even a new and motion eye 3.0 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.700
 that the new graphical interface 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.380
 huawei that improves it in all his 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.020
 parts for instance is the same 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.140
 interface that we return to mail set 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.150
 it is this pea already convinced 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.210
 at the beginning when he also did the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.460
 review by to see if you have it 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.740
 skipped and with the new update that 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.110
 I really tried a few days ago 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.420
 improved a lot in every respect 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.690
 then eighth position for profit 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.210
 seventh place instead for the only windows 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.530
 phone in the standings I'm talking about 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.300
 nokia lumia 930 the top of the house range 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.370
 not who really is no longer in 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.860
 we struggle with microsoft mobile mi 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.660
 sorry enough i have to say that with the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.540
 its aluminum frame with his 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.030
 distinction of having with him a 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.100
 really very handsome camera yes 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.930
 this position deserves quietly 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.459
 in the ranking if you have lost too 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.520
 I recommend this review 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.470
 he went to see why I have to say that I was 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.700
 really really enjoyed this one 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.310
 lumia 930 sixth place instead for 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.220
 motorola moto hicks who succeeds 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.430
 finally to enter the ranking with 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.940
 a device that is not top of the range 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.190
 it only has the name in fact I'm talking about 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.560
 of a device however with hardware 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.709
 of all respect is with the functions 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.150
 smart home motorola that they always have 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.580
 Gorge a little to everyone 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.110
 not last the update already 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.069
 arrived among the first plus for them 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.560
 5.0 which also leads to 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.030
 a certain value also on the market for i 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.459
 following months 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.349
 enter the top five and speak again 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.159
 probably would already have it 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:41.430
 understood fifth place for me it 7 home 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:45.239
 huawei precisely the tablet that manages to 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.459
 compete with 14 and not just how 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.489
 size in fact we are talking about a 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.599
 truly top of the range device that 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:57.480
 finally brings something to huawei 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.090
 innovative you do I'm talking about a 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.769
 device that haunted me because how 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.680
 we are value for money 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.419
 really like performance as functions 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.449
 also particular and above all not 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:11.879
 let's forget the battery really 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:15.389
 incredible of this 7 min then 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:18.239
 fifth place fourth instead for the 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:23.430
 home device top htc 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:25.500
 let's talk about the htc juan n 8 which it brings with 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.630
 so many new things 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.220
 unfortunately, the only thing is not thousands 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.620
 which I think may still be 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.380
 can be improved on that device is for 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.820
 which in fact did not put him at the 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.789
 first place I'm talking about 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.550
 camera that still remains that 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.139
 of the m 7 I always repeat if it were not 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.289
 was for the camera probably 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.509
 I would have immense in the first position No. 8 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.580
 super fluid to look at with a 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:54.240
 spectacular audio interface 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.470
 graphics worth seeing is enjoyed 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.470
 everyday 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.789
 in short, a device really 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.960
 excellent unfortunately a pity for the 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.409
 camera 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.970
 third place for the successor of that 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.009
 that I had elected as a device 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.960
 of the year last year I'm talking about 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.490
 lg g3 fainted 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.780
 even here by pure chance in this 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.340
 moment in the laugh really 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.080
 spectacular with an excellent camera 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.460
 in the display that was the first 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.880
 moreover to be in qeusti then in 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.490
 4k to be clear always with the 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.740
 philosophy of the back buttons set to 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.310
 laser fire that is truly innovative 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.530
 always very thin frames, in short, a 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.229
 device with a large display if a 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.370
 5.5 inch song but with a base 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:46.380
 very small which makes him a tablet 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.240
 really very content in 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.250
 size was very difficult 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.750
 choose the second the first place 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.150
 if I could put both of them on the first 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.509
 but probably because it is not so 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.020
 second place for samsung galaxy note 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:02.970
 4 the samsung tablet that is able to 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.229
 to put and to fuse together in a 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.289
 relatively good design device 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.090
 exceptional camera display 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.729
 beautiful pen functions that I am 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.289
 a battery show that returns to 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.080
 be as performing as the two notes 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:21.750
 in short, the best second device 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.820
 me for business use and not yes 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.259
 deserves first place only for one 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.750
 criticism that I do that is 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:30.599
 the graphical interface also on this no 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.360
 4 that damn samsung fail to 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:35.969
 make it light that it can turn well up 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.800
 a device with a processor 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.139
 kind but first place for what 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.830
 regards the smartphone ranking of the 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:46.229
 2014 if you have not yet understood go to 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.129
 apple iphone 6 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.020
 the device that is mine 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:52.239
 struck more than all 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.869
 others and above all that steps in 

00:06:52.239 --> 00:07:00.009
 forward bigger than his 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:02.739
 predecessor iphone 5s on this iphone 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:05.080
 6 is finally beginning to listen to 

00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:07.809
 on users in fact even at 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.330
 display diagonal and increasing it 

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:12.699
 up to 4.7 inches which I think the 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.309
 optimal size for a smartphone 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:16.959
 remains the characteristic design of the 

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:18.699
 of the iphone 

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:21.490
 the quality of the camera and the 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:24.339
 display and above all the speed of 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.129
 execution of all the commands is the 

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:30.159
 ease of use that will make this 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:33.669
 iphone 6 for me this year is the 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:37.449
 best smartphone came out in conclusion 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:39.249
 of these 2014 report cards 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:40.209
 I hope you enjoyed this video and 

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:42.189

 put me like commentate share 

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:46.869
