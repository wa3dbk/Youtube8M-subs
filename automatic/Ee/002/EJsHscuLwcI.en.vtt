00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
how to get that done so make sure you

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.880 
how to get that done so make sure you
get<00:00:33.210> your<00:00:33.390> phone<00:00:33.600> rooted<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> custom

recovery<00:00:35.070> before<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.850> proceed

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
recovery before you proceed

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.690 
recovery before you proceed
so<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> next<00:00:36.899> thing<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.530> said<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.550> need

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
so the next thing like I said you need

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.850 
so the next thing like I said you need
to<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> n9<00:00:39.570> double<00:00:39.870> O<00:00:39.960> 5<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.469> will<00:00:40.649> not

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
to have the n9 double O 5 this will not

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.340 
to have the n9 double O 5 this will not
work<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.280> other<00:00:41.399> models<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.329> how<00:00:43.140> do<00:00:43.200> you

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
work with other models so how do you

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.180 
work with other models so how do you
find<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.700> go<00:00:44.879> into<00:00:45.030> settings<00:00:46.190> about

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
find that just go into settings about

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.459 
find that just go into settings about
device<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.780> will<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.140> your<00:00:49.260> model

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
device and you will have your model

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.979 
device and you will have your model
number<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.219> make<00:00:50.910> sure<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.660> n9

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
number so make sure that it's a n9

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.410 
number so make sure that it's a n9
double<00:00:52.320> O<00:00:52.379> 5<00:00:52.649> before<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.129> proceed<00:00:53.420> so

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
double O 5 before you proceed so

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.240 
double O 5 before you proceed so
assuming<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> n9<00:00:55.710> double<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.070> fire

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
assuming you have a n9 double of fire

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
assuming you have a n9 double of fire
that's<00:00:56.460> rooted<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> custom<00:00:57.870> recovery

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
that's rooted with a custom recovery

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.049 
that's rooted with a custom recovery

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
to do next is go ahead hold the power

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.080 
to do next is go ahead hold the power
button<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.509> turn<00:01:19.409> off<00:01:19.590> your<00:01:19.799> Note<00:01:19.979> 3<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:23.090> once

the<00:01:24.270> capacitive<00:01:24.720> keys<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.080> gone<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:27.320> hold

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the capacitive keys have gone out hold

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560 
the capacitive keys have gone out hold
up<00:01:28.619> volume<00:01:28.979> power<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.850> home<00:01:30.090> at<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> same

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
up volume power and home at the same

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.060 
up volume power and home at the same
time<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.960> once<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:34.470> Galaxy<00:01:34.890> Note<00:01:35.040> 3

time so once you see Galaxy Note 3

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.030 
time so once you see Galaxy Note 3
displayed<00:01:35.640> again<00:01:35.880> let<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.030> keys<00:01:36.299> go

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.740 

so<00:01:43.490> this<00:01:43.850> will<00:01:44.030> take<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.330> your<00:01:44.420> custom

power key for selection so the first

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.810 
power key for selection so the first
thing<00:01:59.720> you<00:01:59.810> do<00:01:59.930> is<00:02:00.260> head<00:02:00.800> on<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.100> head<00:02:01.550> on<00:02:01.640> over

thing you do is head on to head on over

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.210
