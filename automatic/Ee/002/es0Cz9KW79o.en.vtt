00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
much better I think the reflections in

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.189 
much better I think the reflections in
the<00:00:52.140> water<00:00:53.480> particularly<00:00:54.480> good<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:54.960> just

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
tasty and I also really really love the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.939 
tasty and I also really really love the
way<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> Sun<00:01:03.030> looks<00:01:03.270> how<00:01:03.899> they<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.500> add<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
way the Sun looks how they like add a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.810 
way the Sun looks how they like add a
little<00:01:05.299> solar<00:01:06.299> flare<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.979> lens<00:01:08.250> flare<00:01:08.580> I

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
little solar flare and a lens flare I

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
little solar flare and a lens flare I
just<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> really<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.260> nice

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
just think that is a really really nice

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
just think that is a really really nice
effect<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.909> been<00:01:12.060> executed

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
effect and it's just been executed

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.200 
effect and it's just been executed
really<00:01:13.229> really<00:01:13.500> well<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:15.030> say

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
really really well in this and you say

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.330 
really really well in this and you say
obviously<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.960> others<00:01:16.229> also<00:01:16.740> look<00:01:16.950> quite

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
obviously the others also look quite

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.539 
obviously the others also look quite
good<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> nether<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:18.509> well<00:01:18.930> although

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
good in the nether as well although

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.800 
good in the nether as well although
perhaps<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.759> could<00:01:20.939> say<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.630> bit

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
perhaps you could say it's a little bit

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.260 
perhaps you could say it's a little bit
too<00:01:21.990> dark<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.490> long<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:23.670> you're<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
too dark but as long as you're in a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.410 
too dark but as long as you're in a
well-lit<00:01:24.720> area<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.670> will<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
well-lit area then these will have a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.230 
well-lit area then these will have a
really<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.259> nice<00:01:28.470> effect<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.460> obviously

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
really really nice effect and obviously

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.050 
really really nice effect and obviously
you<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:31.229> will<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.369> gives<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.850> own

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you see it will have I it gives my own

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.469 
you see it will have I it gives my own
character<00:01:33.659> my<00:01:33.900> own<00:01:34.049> shuttle<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.680> well<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.909> mobs

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
character my own shuttle as well as mobs

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.679 
character my own shuttle as well as mobs
and<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:38.040> overall<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:39.000> really

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
and it's just overall a really really

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.120 
and it's just overall a really really
nice<00:01:39.840> mode<00:01:40.140> there<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.409> some<00:01:40.740> things<00:01:40.979> which

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
nice mode there are some things which

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.760 
nice mode there are some things which
I'm<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.520> only<00:01:41.850> person<00:01:42.090> keen<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.259> sort

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
I'm not only person keen on and I sort

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.679 
I'm not only person keen on and I sort
of<00:01:43.829> don't<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.850> way<00:01:44.970> tall<00:01:45.329> grass

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
of don't really like the way tall grass

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.139 
of don't really like the way tall grass
looks<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.350> feel<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.159> might<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.579> little

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
looks I feel like it might be a little

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.899 
looks I feel like it might be a little
bit<00:01:48.329> too<00:01:48.540> dark<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:50.070> also<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.820> that

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
bit too dark and I also think that

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.249 
bit too dark and I also think that
always<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.450> I've<00:01:51.600> said<00:01:51.780> already<00:01:51.930> at

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
always like I've said already at

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.770 
always like I've said already at
nighttime<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:53.220> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.000> little<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.509> way

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
nighttime it's kind of a little bit way

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
nighttime it's kind of a little bit way
too<00:01:54.840> dark

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
too dark

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.700 
too dark
and<00:01:56.400> so<00:01:56.700> suddenly<00:01:56.990> very<00:01:57.990> difficult<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.440> see

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and so suddenly very difficult to see

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.980 
and so suddenly very difficult to see
maybe<00:01:58.950> something<00:01:59.370> which<00:01:59.520> could<00:01:59.760> improve<00:02:00.750> that

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
maybe something which could improve that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.780 
maybe something which could improve that
is<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.500> could<00:02:01.680> hold<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.010> torch<00:02:02.190> on<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.610> in

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
is if you could hold a torch on you in

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.480 
is if you could hold a torch on you in
your<00:02:02.820> inventory<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.350> actually<00:02:04.860> like

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
your inventory and it was actually like

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.430 
your inventory and it was actually like
light<00:02:05.790> up<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.120> area<00:02:06.450> around<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:07.050> as<00:02:07.260> long<00:02:07.410> as

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
light up the area around you as long as

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.810 
light up the area around you as long as
you<00:02:07.620> were<00:02:07.740> holding<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.280> your<00:02:08.399> hand<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.790> just

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
you were holding it in your hand I just

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.249 
you were holding it in your hand I just
think<00:02:09.090> that'd<00:02:09.210> be<00:02:09.330> quite<00:02:09.479> cool<00:02:09.780> thing<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> add

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
think that'd be quite cool thing to add

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.780 
think that'd be quite cool thing to add
