the first thing is they added more
languages<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:31.050> here<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.560> don't<00:00:31.769> really<00:00:32.130> know

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
languages in here I don't really know

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.340 
languages in here I don't really know
what<00:00:32.520> ones<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.969> read<00:00:33.180> about<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.450> they<00:00:34.140> added

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350

more<00:00:34.680> languages<00:00:35.250> into<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:36.290> somewhere<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.500> if

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
more languages into here somewhere if if

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.560 
more languages into here somewhere if if
wasn't<00:00:38.370> compatible<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:39.090> your<00:00:39.270> language

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
wasn't compatible with your language

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.290 
wasn't compatible with your language

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
before so the first thing we're gonna

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.779 
before so the first thing we're gonna
check<00:00:42.480> out<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:43.110> go<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.160> guess<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.670> can
