00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:05.799
 in knowing if you are mitigating gas reason through space and time can 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.799
 perceive the directly 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:14.369
 this phenomenon that we call extrasensory perception surely works 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.099
 a similar way 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.390
 physics has a name for this remote connection 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.009
 it's called intricate quantum 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.289
 for now it's just a theory applied electrons and molecules 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.099
 scientists still do not know if it can be applied to the brain 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.530
 but the finding that confirms the extrasensory perception could 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.530
 arrive earlier than expected 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.790
 it's very difficult to predict when these things are going to happen 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.680
 I believe that within 20 years between tomorrow and 20 years from now 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.310
 and if we could load our brains by machines 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.350
 and take the next evolutionary leap in a single generation instead of thousands 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.890
 of years 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.520
 the semi secret agency for advanced defense research projects in 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.140
 english darpa finances programs whose objective is radical innovation 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.150
 in fact its mission is to create a scientific storm of ideas 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.630
 for the national security sectors have developed technologies 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.099
 incredible that for us are common as internet the mouse of 

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:32.099
 computer and of course the invisible coffee 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.430
 to intervene the most outstanding scientists of the country and asks them to give 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 a jump of 30 to 40 years in science 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.090
 go giant steps 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.090
 the letter is funding one of these steps at the University of Columbia 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.410
 new York 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.130
 scientists are developing a computer program that helps the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.290
 brain to process visual information 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.690
 at lightning speed 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.240
 in our modern society they are bombarded with information either 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.180
 through television images on the internet is our work this begins 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.269
 to be excessive 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.650
 and we have to select which images can be discarded and that image 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.449
 we must pay attention 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:18.380
 the idea that is behind the computerized vision coupled to the cortex 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.999
 it consists in uniting the best of both 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.680
 the versatility of the human brain reinforced by the speed of a 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:28.339
 computer is very difficult to say a computer vision system that 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:32.059
 find something curious out of the ordinary or suspects is much more 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:33.689
 easy for a person to do 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.370
 Of course, computer vision systems are very fast then 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.589
 the question is how can we accelerate the human visual process 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.370
 in this example we see aerial photos of Seoul in South Korea 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.569
 the analyst looks for landing strips for helicopters 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:56.899
 the old method required a systematic analysis of thousands of photos 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:00.359
 individual before detecting the tracks 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.569
 with the new method the analyst uses an electroencephalogram cap 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.659
 now electrical brain activity can be detected under the skull 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.489
 through 'dozens of destruction 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.110
 in normal brain processing the visual cortex extracts details of a 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.170
 image the information is sent to the frontal lobes to make decisions 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:27.189
 then the cortex generates a response the click of a mouse as living 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:28.479
 ocular 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.909
 the prototype of the intercepted program henares filters brain activity 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.449
 superfluous and concentrates the subliminal moment of ansa 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.559
 when the eye detects the track 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:45.729
 in a few seconds the analyst can review thousands of images even if it is not 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:50.259
 aware of this his brain identifies with great accuracy the few photos 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.259
 that show clues that are then marked 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.829
 ap 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.379
 basically intercept the signals that have to do with making 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.819
 decisions if they detect something interesting the subject has to bother in the 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.150
 answer this we take advantage of to reorder by reorganizing the bases of 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
 image data to improve acoustics 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.120
 this enhanced vision technology helps the image analyst to 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.939
 work up to four times faster 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:27.119
 could be adapted to help pilots make better decisions in 

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:28.979
 fractions of a second 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.470
 or to improve the selection of police security recordings 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.009
 casual security 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.079
 there are also possibilities beyond defense and espionage 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.409
 a possible interesting application and with a lot of data exchange could 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.999
 be in the bag or trade sector 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:51.689
 Many investors assimilated distribution of different screens aspects can 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.539
 that they detect something but at that moment they can not make any transaction 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.039
 instead that information can be marked as of interest to the investor 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.039
 and be processed by another person in other states 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.139
 medical research may also be interested in these 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.020
 appliances 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.690
 and the marketing teams could use them to register the first 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.120
 reaction of people to a product 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.419
 a california video game company is already replacing engels quick by 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.789
 brain energy 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.469
 a device similar to the electroencephalogram registers the 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.710
 electrical activity of the brain and gestures of the facial muscles 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.419
 the dinner translates into orders to the screen 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.990
 players raise stones and they rotate the bad guys with a thought in 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.779
 one click place
