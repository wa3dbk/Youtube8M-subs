 playstation 4 compatible with playstation 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.780
 3 also but that we can use with 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.330
 play 4 which is the most interesting thing about 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.210
 this steering wheel is a steering wheel 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.040
 thrustmaster of 80 driver club edition 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.450

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.730
 the characteristics the size they have 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.300
 and its main functions 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.300
 we see 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.469
 here 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.190
 hold it explaining 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.680
 the steering wheel 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.620
 we have here a small manual that we 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.620
 will explain how to mount it 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.370
 in the real size 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.040
 we have the accelerator and the serene 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.830
 let's see the steering wheel 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.120
 we see here 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.360
 the finishes are very good 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.170
 have here let's give them rubber 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.890
 right there to hold it better we see 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.770
 the buttons above him 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.939
 of what would be a command 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.939
 and the change of gears 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.010
 like the flyers of formula1 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.009
 and the buttons 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.850
 we see that it connects through the usb to 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.640
 the console and the port to connect the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.270
 pedals 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.270

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.520
 not included 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.440
 hold it 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.239
 this we would do 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.239
 right here below 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.790
 it would be like this 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.790
 and then thanks 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.710
 we will treat them in the test 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.100
 and see 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.709
 that fits perfectly to the table what 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.709
 we squeeze 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.100
 and it is very well fixed to be 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.670
 pedals to the port that we have taught you 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.110
 and we would have the steering wheel mounted os 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.110
 I will teach another feature 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.890

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.160

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.620
