00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.350
 Well this time that 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.570
 I was made on the theme of the coach 6 type 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:14.930
 Among them 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.550
 Or even a person of the coach say little Naa not enough is something that has a training 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.140
 one more 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.380
 I want to narrow down the theme and strengthen 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.740
 A leader in trouble 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:31.619
 And without a lot of career he began to coach body 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:34.239
 It is seen in the Well many people or be a person of the coach that there is no soccer experience 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.460
 Or a new idea 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.130
 Well watch the kids play and the kids play good in the video 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.090
 Where you are 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.550
 By'll also look at the place that is the Aruiwama mistakes 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.350
 If you can refer to 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:56.010
 What is the base than in the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:02.480
 It is most connected to the growth of children that children try to be successful 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:08.510
 As we think that it becomes, what we should do is not to force something to do 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:11.540
 Let's bring up oneself to try oneself well 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:17.220
 It is a well thought how or attitude that 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.300
 The most important thing is how they work on their practice 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.430
 I want to think about the practice menu 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:29.890
 So do you also want to say that the menu I introduced this time 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:36.320
 It is a training that can not be established without thinking among the players 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:40.880
 If you do this and you want to make things better by devising something, you can say something can be done well 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:45.979
 I want you to think about something If you have this, you can do it absolutely because you can do it well 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:50.960
 Rather than that the players this may be referred to be the kana not go Once Ya' this need 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.400
 I think but that it is necessary to Tteyuu practice, such as get to feel the response 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.860
 By all means 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:02.780
 As we do various practice that we do, we have you refer to 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.890
 Also I would like to devise it and make an original one and get it to my team 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.890
 I think so
