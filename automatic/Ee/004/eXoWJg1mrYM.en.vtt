00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
go in the raid to get used to the

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.160 
go in the raid to get used to the
mechanics<00:06:04.240> in<00:06:04.360> the<00:06:04.480> game<00:06:04.630> because<00:06:04.780> a<00:06:04.930> lot<00:06:05.140> of

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170 
mechanics in the game because a lot of

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.150 
mechanics in the game because a lot of
raid<00:06:05.440> mechanics<00:06:06.070> come<00:06:06.640> from<00:06:06.970> dungeons<00:06:07.660> so

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
raid mechanics come from dungeons so

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.860 
raid mechanics come from dungeons so
your<00:06:09.160> experience<00:06:09.640> will<00:06:09.760> come<00:06:09.940> from<00:06:10.150> that<00:06:10.300> so<00:06:10.630> I

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
your experience will come from that so I

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.620 
your experience will come from that so I
would<00:06:11.560> highly<00:06:11.980> recommend<00:06:12.060> against<00:06:13.060> just

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
would highly recommend against just

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.120 
would highly recommend against just
buying<00:06:13.930> your<00:06:14.140> gear<00:06:14.440> and<00:06:14.590> going<00:06:14.800> right<00:06:14.980> into

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
buying your gear and going right into

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.920 
buying your gear and going right into
raids<00:06:15.460> because<00:06:16.000> you're<00:06:16.600> gonna<00:06:16.750> get
