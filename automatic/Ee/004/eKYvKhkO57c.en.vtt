really is creatively thinking in ways
that<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.399> didn't<00:00:50.940> even<00:00:51.000> know<00:00:51.239> imaginable<00:00:52.050> until

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
that I didn't even know imaginable until

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.939 
that I didn't even know imaginable until
I<00:00:52.320> walked<00:00:52.530> onto<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.890> set<00:00:54.829> Microsoft<00:00:55.829> has

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
I walked onto that set Microsoft has

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.740 
I walked onto that set Microsoft has
been<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.370> open<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.699> us<00:00:56.910> taking<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.390> into<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
been really open to us taking it into a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.590 
been really open to us taking it into a
very<00:00:58.350> vibrant<00:00:58.649> experimental<00:00:59.609> direction<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
very vibrant experimental direction a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689 
very vibrant experimental direction a
whole<00:01:01.020> new<00:01:01.170> look<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:02.190> we've<00:01:02.309> seen<00:01:02.550> from

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
whole new look then we've seen from

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.549 
whole new look then we've seen from
Windows<00:01:03.059> before<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.229> that's<00:01:04.379> been

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
Windows before and and and that's been

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.679 
Windows before and and and that's been
really<00:01:04.799> exciting<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.970> project's<00:01:06.420> all<00:01:06.479> about

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
really exciting the project's all about

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.570 
really exciting the project's all about
one-point<00:01:07.080> perspective<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:08.040> kind<00:01:08.520> of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
one-point perspective and kind of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.670 
one-point perspective and kind of
looking<00:01:09.150> at<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> logo<00:01:09.659> itself<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> portal

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
looking at the logo itself as a portal

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.820 
looking at the logo itself as a portal
that<00:01:11.070> was<00:01:11.220> allowing<00:01:11.580> us<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> look<00:01:12.030> into<00:01:12.210> space

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
that was allowing us to look into space

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.080 
that was allowing us to look into space
in<00:01:13.830> order<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.670> had<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.880> develop

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
in order to do that we had to develop

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.060 
in order to do that we had to develop
some<00:01:15.450> kind<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.720> weird<00:01:15.990> techniques<00:01:16.500> kind<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
some kind of weird techniques kind of a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
some kind of weird techniques kind of a
camera<00:01:17.430> mapping<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.210> logo<00:01:18.570> we're

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
camera mapping of the logo we're

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.830 
camera mapping of the logo we're
shooting<00:01:19.500> projections<00:01:20.220> isolated<00:01:21.030> from<00:01:21.390> lens

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
shooting projections isolated from lens

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.859 
shooting projections isolated from lens
flares<00:01:22.290> isolated<00:01:23.189> from<00:01:23.549> background<00:01:24.240> textures

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
flares isolated from background textures

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.289 
flares isolated from background textures
with<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.890> camera<00:01:26.340> mapping<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.850> allows<00:01:27.060> us<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
with that camera mapping it allows us to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.090 
with that camera mapping it allows us to
play<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> space<00:01:28.140> where<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.530> create<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
play in the space where we create a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.270 
play in the space where we create a
volumetric<00:01:29.700> area<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.840> lying<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.439> haze<00:01:31.770> and

aberrations<00:01:36.720> obviously<00:01:37.619> there's<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.860> ton<00:01:38.009> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
aberrations obviously there's a ton of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.760 
aberrations obviously there's a ton of
design<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:38.820> more<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:40.290> physical

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
design but it's more about the physical

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.620 
design but it's more about the physical
presence<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.670> really<00:01:41.850> paying

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
presence of it and really paying

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.270 
presence of it and really paying
attention<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.110> how<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> camera<00:01:43.799> captures

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
attention to how the camera captures

00:01:44.280 --> 00:02:03.280 
attention to how the camera captures
these<00:01:44.460> physical<00:01:44.939> objects

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.750 

I<00:02:04.000> love<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.120> idea<00:02:05.450> of<00:02:05.540> delivering<00:02:06.200> one

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
I love the idea of delivering one

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.630 
I love the idea of delivering one
perfect<00:02:07.760> pristine<00:02:07.970> steel
