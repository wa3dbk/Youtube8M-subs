00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
going to be an incredibly tough release

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.709 
going to be an incredibly tough release
if<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.609> limited<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.180> course<00:01:03.390> are<00:01:03.539> those

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
if it's limited of course are those

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.759

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
rumors that is going to be a general

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.330 
rumors that is going to be a general
release<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.640> still<00:01:06.360> surprise<00:01:06.659> me<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.170> um<00:01:07.409> but

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
release it still surprise me but um but

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.740 
release it still surprise me but um but
if<00:01:08.460> they<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:08.880> hopefully<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.659> us

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
if they do then hopefully a lot of us

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960 
if they do then hopefully a lot of us
will<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.650> mean<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.070> think<00:01:11.610> it'll<00:01:11.909> be

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
will get it but I mean I think it'll be

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.370 
will get it but I mean I think it'll be
a<00:01:12.060> general<00:01:12.390> release<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> ascent<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
a general release to the ascent like the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.750 
a general release to the ascent like the
space<00:01:13.590> jams<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> cool<00:01:14.369> greys<00:01:14.549> were

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
space jams or the cool greys were

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
space jams or the cool greys were
generally<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:15.810> them<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> lot<00:01:16.229> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
generally so you can get them a lot of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.570 
generally so you can get them a lot of
places<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.740> they're<00:01:17.009> still<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> sell

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
places but they're still going to sell
