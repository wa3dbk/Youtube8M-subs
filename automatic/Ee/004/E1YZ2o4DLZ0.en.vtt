00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.350
 but 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.740
 but 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.739
 hello the viewer of this video for gamepads 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.449
 at the microphone I am maxim and we continue 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.760
 pass gta vice city stories 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.920
 Immediately I want to say that you can today 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.839
 require armor especially those who are still 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.449
 not fully understood aiming 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.120
 take the flak jacket can tuning salon 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.280
 ascension of tooth or she still us 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.580
 will fall on the road in a small lane 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.920
 I will show you, and what about us in general today 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.229
 wants a brand he wants us to capture 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.930
 him business mexicans brothel 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.299
 to be exact for this he bought for 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.150
 us a shotgun shop man named 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.100
 jay we only need him to take 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.610
 Now I will give some tips on 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.400
 shooting 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.590
 I certainly do not know maybe it's out of my 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.840
 emulator and on the console everything is fine 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.050
 but the color of the sight shows the state 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.040
 health and character a bit delayed 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.480
 sometimes the whole shotgun freezes 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.050
 one shot is killed and not needed 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.490
 count how many rounds to connect the enemy 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.710
 shoot enough and right there 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.590
 switch to another with a gun 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.370
 everything is easier the enemy is dying 5 rounds so 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.480
 that after 5 shots switch 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.850
 switch to another target with 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.070
 automata will be more difficult will need 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 develop a habit for the finger which 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.580
 you have to hold the shot button on 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.250
 certain time but I will tell about it 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.340
 later while we purchased a shotgun and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.830
 not far from here between house fences 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.720
 is a bulletproof vest so if I don’t 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.720
 take settings take here just 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.550
 keep in mind that it has settings 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.050
 I 'm not giving that aunt over the radio 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.690
 which talk about bridges 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.730
 says okay today us 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.519
 get acquainted with the topic of business capture and 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.230
 the whole process consists of the following for 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.160
 In order to start the capture you need 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.020
 destroy vehicles standing nearby 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.510
 him then shoot all the enemies 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.390
 outside and after destroy the building all that 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.700
 breaks down and kill those who attack us 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.730
 today they are only partially acquainted with this 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.670
 I will also tell in part because we 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.610
 we still have time to talk about it 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.740
 and while we're driving, I 'll tell you a little more 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.810
 about the combat system in the game she is very 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.790
 looks a lot like sandres but k 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.980
 sorry here we can't crouch and and 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.840
 roll like the above with 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.610
 or fours if you can't 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.700
 roll in four not to me 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.010
 claims though in fours it's useless 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.820
 after all there is a system of shelters in contrast to 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.490
 other parts 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.500
 but we don’t need it enough 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.840
 adjust to auto aiming and you 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.920
 love missions with shootings by the way 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.540
 there is an interesting feature 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.630
 which no other parts 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.250
 Weber we don’t know about city ​​stories 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.160
 Unfortunately rarely works with horns 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.230
 much more often with simple 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.090
 bystanders if they get their belly they 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.340
 cling to him and slowly wallow 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.430
 to the ground like that just they 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.990
 die that is sometimes it turns out to kill 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.330
 with one shot from a pistol 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.950
 but compared to previous ones I draw 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.140
 attention is the word previous to not 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.660
 wrote about the top four here is the best system 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.240
 hand-to-hand combat which you observed in 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.170
 second mission is a pity that as in the four 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.480
 such a system 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.150
 need missions very rarely a couple of times over 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.610
 the whole game, unlike for example, pour in 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.740
 dogs where the whole game is built on fights 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.989
 notes and hand-to-hand fight about work 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.850
 much better and more interesting this game and 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.370
 praise for the combat system and for 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.470
 postrelushek just have gta and I 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.780
 very happy perfection system in the fifth 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.980
 parts and let it look like a system 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.680
 in max payne 3 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.930
 there she is great and i'm happy about that 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.270
 over time, we have selected business martin 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.709
 more precisely, I tried for a very long time to get there 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.900
 prologue here is well more precisely in the doorway here 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.140
 and 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.120
 March now you buy yourself this business 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.690
 later we will do all this ourselves 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.360
 and grab a business and buy them back but 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.250
 this later in the meantime, thank you all for 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.380
