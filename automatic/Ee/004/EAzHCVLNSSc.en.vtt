00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:14.369
 after the technical explanations of rigor that were made in the pavilion 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:15.430
 prince felipe 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.930
 the organization granted a verification schedule for each team in order to 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.930
 avoid agglomerations 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.560
 or hint that most of the applicants in the tests that 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.189
 would get the next day's exit in the prologue of the 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.860
 fifteenth edition of the low movistar the new official sponsor 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.860
 of this event 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.260
 the lands of huesca were the scenario chosen by the organizers 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.180
 for the celebration of the prologue 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.180
 after 15 years celebrating zaragoza 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.110
 it was a fast special with numerous attractive points in its ten 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.510
 kilometers of route between the polygon monzú yahel castle of 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.910
 montearagón the venue just an appetizer for the participants 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.310
 The bright sun and moderate winds favored the good development of the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.310
 test throughout the day 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.200
 finally the French driver lesser got the best time of the test 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.190
 prologue marking with its incomplete quad region 260 horses a rhythm 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.190
 superior to the rest of the competitors 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.380
 with the classification obtained by san luis le ceden is prologue although it 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.380
 I knew who would be on the grid the next day 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.170
 subsequently the participants raised great expectations 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.170
 all aspired to be placed in the top positions 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.610
 Miguel Prieto considered the race with philosophy and a great illusion 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.050
 before starting the test he stated that with his mitsubishi t2 everything was possible 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.050
 even canada falls 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.030
 the problems appeared and timely 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.179
 the mitsubishi montero of millions said 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.020
 had technical problems from the beginning 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.049
 obtained the fourth place in the classification of the prologue and 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.509
 mechanical problems chased him even when starting the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.509
 final final test 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:19.669
 However, his role was more than to emphasize him fighting at all times 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:23.819
 the first positions comparición the steering wheel and an intelligent regularity 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:29.099
 the high temperatures and the excess of dust were the general tonic 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.569
 will work with 98 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.009
 but the spirits were still too high to influence the pilots 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.859
 josé maría serviá the controls of the toyota 4runner I enjoy the speed 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.599
 during the prologue and declared to be willing to be near the drawer of the 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.379
 podium in the final 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.430
 the feeding problems suffered by his car caused him to lose 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.720
 a lot of time when I was struggling with closing the final test 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:26.159
 mar del plata meanwhile with its montero he rode well at the beginning and 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.169
 risked with intelligence maintaining regularity in all steps of 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.879
 control 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.260
 however, and very much to his regret his effort was not crowned with success 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.439
 had to leave due to electrical problems in the transmission of his 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.439
 mitsubishi that made him waste a lot of time 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.370
 and he had already warned him from the beginning he said he was afraid to break 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.370
 the engine and I did not know how far I could get 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.709
 maybe it's marena piloting a toyota land cruiser with carlos falcó de 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.410
 co-pilot 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.230
 He did his best for the first places 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.240
 but the sum of the inconveniences made it impossible to guide the 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.239
 first positions 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.569
 despite the good behavior of his satiate car auger was classified in the 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.709
 position 27 of the general will surely continue trying 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.839
 at the end of this fifteenth low Aragon move the forecasts are 

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:16.729
 they met 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.239
 and on Monday lesser scored the victory after having enjoyed a tour 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.449
 where everyone tested their piloting ability 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.650
 after him he finished the Italian chiambretti followed by Miguel Prieto and had to 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.580
 fight the whole test with your car without traction on two wheels
