okay<00:00:00.810> so<00:00:00.870> now<00:00:01.199> we're<00:00:01.319> going<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.469> talk<00:00:01.680> about

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
okay so now we're going to talk about

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.619 
okay so now we're going to talk about
the<00:00:02.129> spinal<00:00:02.610> cord<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:03.000> anatomy<00:00:03.510> of<00:00:03.540> the

is you know you can see the Tipsy your

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.130 
is you know you can see the Tipsy your
vertebrae<00:03:51.940> right<00:03:52.270> over<00:03:52.390> here<00:03:52.630> lower<00:03:52.840> down

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
vertebrae right over here lower down

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.140 
vertebrae right over here lower down
right<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:54.070> you<00:03:54.220> could<00:03:54.400> feel<00:03:54.670> if<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:54.970> put

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
right that you could feel if you put

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.820 
right that you could feel if you put
your<00:03:55.180> hand<00:03:55.420> along<00:03:55.540> your<00:03:55.690> back<00:03:56.050> so<00:03:56.650> we're

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
your hand along your back so we're

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.650 
your hand along your back so we're
looking<00:03:56.920> at<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.370> what<00:03:57.730> we<00:03:57.790> call<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:58.060> dorsal

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
looking at the what we call the dorsal

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.360 
looking at the what we call the dorsal
surface<00:03:59.020> right<00:03:59.560> here<00:03:59.770> right<00:03:59.950> this<00:04:00.100> is<00:04:00.250> the

back surface and you should note that
with<00:04:02.830> one<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.070> these<00:04:03.160> spinal<00:04:03.489> nerves<00:04:03.790> there's

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
with one of these spinal nerves there's

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.140 
with one of these spinal nerves there's
a<00:04:04.570> there's<00:04:05.080> this<00:04:05.470> kind<00:04:05.800> of<00:04:05.950> root<00:04:06.220> see<00:04:07.030> all

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
a there's this kind of root see all

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.880 
a there's this kind of root see all
these<00:04:07.239> little<00:04:07.420> projections<00:04:08.200> coming<00:04:08.500> in<00:04:08.590> here

root of the spinal nerve and the cell

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.150 
root of the spinal nerve and the cell
bodies<00:04:51.169> of<00:04:51.320> those<00:04:51.440> cells<00:04:51.710> are<00:04:51.860> actually

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
bodies of those cells are actually

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.900 
bodies of those cells are actually
located<00:04:52.400> in<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:53.389> ganglion<00:04:53.990> so<00:04:54.889> they're<00:04:55.039> located

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
located in a ganglion so they're located

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.020 
located in a ganglion so they're located
in<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.150> peripheral<00:04:56.720> nervous<00:04:56.810> system<00:04:57.560> so<00:04:58.430> you

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
in the peripheral nervous system so you

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.460 
in the peripheral nervous system so you
think<00:04:59.270> about<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.599> cells<00:04:59.870> that<00:04:59.990> are<00:05:00.080> carrying

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
think about the cells that are carrying

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.409 
think about the cells that are carrying
somatosensory<00:05:00.949> information<00:05:01.250> in<00:05:01.789> they

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
somatosensory information in they

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.810 
somatosensory information in they
actually<00:05:02.630> have<00:05:03.440> very<00:05:03.860> long<00:05:04.130> processes<00:05:04.580> that

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
actually have very long processes that

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.040 
actually have very long processes that
go<00:05:04.910> all<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.210> way<00:05:05.240> out<00:05:05.419> for<00:05:05.539> example<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:05.960> the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
go all the way out for example to the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.370 
go all the way out for example to the
tips<00:05:06.259> of<00:05:06.349> your<00:05:06.410> fingers<00:05:06.560> right<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:08.360> then<00:05:08.900> you

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
tips of your fingers right and then you

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.589 
tips of your fingers right and then you
know<00:05:09.500> something<00:05:09.919> out<00:05:10.039> here<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.599> stimulated

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
know something out here is stimulated

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.180 
know something out here is stimulated
that<00:05:11.720> sets<00:05:11.960> off<00:05:12.080> an<00:05:12.259> action<00:05:12.590> potential<00:05:12.860> start

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
that sets off an action potential start

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.310 
that sets off an action potential start
sending<00:05:13.729> it<00:05:13.820> back<00:05:13.970> along<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.539> long<00:05:14.750> process

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
sending it back along that long process

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.110 
sending it back along that long process
that<00:05:15.530> portion<00:05:15.919> of<00:05:16.009> the<00:05:16.070> nerve<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:16.520> then<00:05:17.030> it

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
that portion of the nerve and then it

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.990 
that portion of the nerve and then it
meets<00:05:17.419> its<00:05:17.690> cell<00:05:17.960> body<00:05:18.349> in<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:19.280> dorsal<00:05:19.580> root

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
meets its cell body in the dorsal root

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.390 
meets its cell body in the dorsal root
ganglion<00:05:20.630> okay<00:05:21.050> like<00:05:21.530> within<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.979> periphery

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400

uh you know functionally a dendrite I'm

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.570 
uh you know functionally a dendrite I'm
it's<00:05:47.360> a<00:05:47.419> really<00:05:47.750> long<00:05:48.080> dendrite<00:05:48.560> and<00:05:49.370> then<00:05:49.490> the

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
it's a really long dendrite and then the

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.029 
it's a really long dendrite and then the
cell<00:05:49.820> body<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:50.870> know<00:05:50.960> is<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.199> soma<00:05:51.440> located

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
root of the spinal nerve and then the

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.779 
root of the spinal nerve and then the
process<00:06:00.380> that's<00:06:00.800> post<00:06:01.039> soma<00:06:01.250> that's<00:06:01.520> heading

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
process that's post soma that's heading

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.689 
process that's post soma that's heading
in<00:06:01.940> is<00:06:02.150> really<00:06:02.960> technically<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.800> axon<00:06:04.220> so

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
in is really technically the axon so

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.820 
in is really technically the axon so
what<00:06:05.150> I<00:06:05.180> want<00:06:05.360> you<00:06:05.389> to<00:06:05.539> know<00:06:05.599> is<00:06:05.930> that<00:06:06.289> these

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
what I want you to know is that these

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.159 
what I want you to know is that these
spinal<00:06:07.669> nerves<00:06:07.940> actually<00:06:08.539> you<00:06:08.930> know<00:06:09.020> there

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
spinal nerves actually you know there

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.659 
spinal nerves actually you know there
are<00:06:09.199> 31<00:06:09.620> pairs<00:06:09.889> of<00:06:10.099> them<00:06:10.190> they're<00:06:10.370> divided

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
are 31 pairs of them they're divided

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.180
