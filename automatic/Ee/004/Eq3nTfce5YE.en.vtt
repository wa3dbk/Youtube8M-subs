apart<00:00:19.650> my<00:00:19.710> knife<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.250> found<00:00:20.580> out<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.420> of

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
apart my knife and found out that one of

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.310 
apart my knife and found out that one of
the<00:00:21.630> Omega<00:00:22.080> Springs<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.859> axis<00:00:23.760> lock<00:00:24.320> was

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.290 
the Omega Springs in the axis lock was
snapped<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.859> half

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
snapped in half

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.689 
snapped in half
so<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.330> took<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.010> put<00:00:29.400> my<00:00:29.429> knife

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
so I took it out and I just put my knife

so I took it out and I just put my knife
back<00:00:29.730> together<00:00:30.269> with<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.750> 1<00:00:31.050> Omega<00:00:31.410> spring

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
back together with the 1 Omega spring

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.630

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and well later it worked perfectly for

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.040
