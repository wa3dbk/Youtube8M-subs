right in the middle and he thought that

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.790 
right in the middle and he thought that
that<00:00:23.189> was<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> red<00:00:23.760> dot<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.420> death<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.740> I'm

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
completely I mean that the hard drive is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.550 
completely I mean that the hard drive is
not<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.310> all<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> way<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.720> fix<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.170> problem

not in all the way so to fix the problem

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.960 
not in all the way so to fix the problem
you<00:01:46.680> simply<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.220> go<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> bottom<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.850> the

you simply just go to the bottom of the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.210 
you simply just go to the bottom of the
console<00:01:48.329> push<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> little<00:01:49.259> tab<00:01:49.619> all<00:01:50.130> right

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
console push the little tab all right

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.999 
console push the little tab all right
like<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.850> then<00:01:51.509> take<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.020> hard<00:01:52.770> drive

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
like that and then take this hard drive

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.520 
like that and then take this hard drive
here<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.880> take<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> hard<00:01:54.360> drive<00:01:54.409> pull<00:01:55.409> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
here just take the hard drive pull it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.590 
here just take the hard drive pull it
out<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.430> kind<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:56.790> go<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
out and kind of just go like that and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.319 
out and kind of just go like that and
that<00:01:58.409> all<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> hard<00:02:00.030> drives

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
that all it is is that the hard drives

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.630 
that all it is is that the hard drives
not<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> way<00:02:01.530> perhaps<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:02.430> when

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
not in all the way perhaps you know when

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.920 
not in all the way perhaps you know when
it<00:02:02.790> was<00:02:02.909> shipped<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.630> or<00:02:03.750> whatever

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
shipped to store thing got bumped around

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.300 
shipped to store thing got bumped around
and<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.170> knocked<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.560> out<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.860> plant<00:02:08.129> out

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
and it knocked it out of the plant out

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.960 
and it knocked it out of the plant out
of<00:02:08.520> place<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.780> simple<00:02:10.259> easy<00:02:10.470> easy<00:02:11.190> fix<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
of place so simple easy easy fix and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.330 
of place so simple easy easy fix and
just<00:02:12.300> pop<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.750> terms

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
just pop it in terms

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.640 
just pop it in terms
so<00:02:13.550> on<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.150> had<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:14.870> working<00:02:15.080> -<00:02:15.349> what<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.500> was

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
so on I had it working - what I was

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.440 
so on I had it working - what I was
going<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.130> be<00:02:16.280> able<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.550> demonstrate<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.300> for

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
going to be able to demonstrate it for

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.320 
going to be able to demonstrate it for
you<00:02:17.569> with<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.870> red<00:02:18.080> light<00:02:18.290> itself<00:02:18.849> but<00:02:19.849> now<00:02:20.030> it

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
you with the red light itself but now it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.600 
you with the red light itself but now it
doesn't<00:02:20.599> appear<00:02:21.349> to<00:02:21.530> want<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.890> do<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.220> so

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
doesn't appear to want to do that so

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.699 
doesn't appear to want to do that so
well<00:02:23.540> just<00:02:23.569> I'm<00:02:24.050> going<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.260> leave<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.500> alone

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
well just I'm going to leave it alone

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.920 
well just I'm going to leave it alone
don't<00:02:24.890> want<00:02:25.099> to<00:02:25.190> actually<00:02:25.970> jack<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.630> up<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:26.840> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
don't want to actually jack it up in the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.540 
don't want to actually jack it up in the
process<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.989> it's<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.170> easy<00:02:30.470> easy<00:02:31.010> fix

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
process it and so it's a easy easy fix

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.729 
process it and so it's a easy easy fix
so<00:02:32.540> when<00:02:32.780> you're<00:02:32.900> if<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.290> have<00:02:33.319> pretty<00:02:33.620> good

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
red out of like don't go straight to

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.110 
red out of like don't go straight to
that<00:02:35.750> if<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.410> do<00:02:36.709> have<00:02:37.040> an<00:02:37.340> overheating

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
the red ring of death it used to be huge

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.240 
the red ring of death it used to be huge
on<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.000> 360s<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.380> that's<00:03:06.620> why<00:03:06.799> Microsoft

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
on the 360s and that's why Microsoft

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.280 
on the 360s and that's why Microsoft
made<00:03:07.610> this<00:03:07.790> new<00:03:07.970> model<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.569> new<00:03:08.840> model

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
made this new model so this new model

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.650 
made this new model so this new model
here<00:03:09.680> does<00:03:10.280> not<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:11.209> I'm<00:03:11.299> going<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.450> say<00:03:11.599> it

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
here does not and I'm going to say it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.650 
here does not and I'm going to say it
again<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:12.049> does<00:03:12.319> not<00:03:12.940> get<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.090> like<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.450> old

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
again it does not get it like the old

problem so it's like really guys there's
no<00:03:56.900> way<00:03:56.930> they're<00:03:57.350> going<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.530> let<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:57.739> happen

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829

no way they're going to let it happen
again<00:03:58.180> also<00:03:59.180> there's<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.720> safety<00:04:00.350> system<00:04:00.590> what

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
again also there's a safety system what

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.039 
again also there's a safety system what
it<00:04:01.639> does<00:04:01.819> is<00:04:01.970> if<00:04:02.120> your<00:04:02.269> console<00:04:02.690> starts

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
it does is if your console starts

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.229 
it does is if your console starts
getting<00:04:03.500> hot<00:04:03.530> even<00:04:04.130> starts<00:04:04.760> getting<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.150> the

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
getting hot even starts getting to the

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.030 
getting hot even starts getting to the
point<00:04:05.389> that<00:04:05.600> it<00:04:05.690> could<00:04:05.780> be<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:05.930> problem<00:04:06.200> the

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
point that it could be a problem the

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.979 
point that it could be a problem the
