taking really cool potshots enemies with
your<00:01:31.340> sniper<00:01:31.580> rifle<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.120> sometimes<00:01:32.659> you're

while I've got my thermal goggles on
so<00:04:26.439> that<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.620> know<00:04:26.680> where<00:04:27.009> this<00:04:27.159> dude<00:04:27.370> is<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:28.030> I

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
so that I know where this dude is and I

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.179 
so that I know where this dude is and I
can<00:04:28.389> do<00:04:28.509> exactly<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.930> same<00:04:28.990> with<00:04:29.199> these<00:04:29.409> the

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:30.189 
can do exactly the same with these the

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:31.679 
can do exactly the same with these the
thermals<00:04:30.669> only<00:04:31.000> lost<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.300> certain<00:04:31.509> amount<00:04:31.599> of

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:31.689 
thermals only lost a certain amount of

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.809 
thermals only lost a certain amount of
time<00:04:31.949> but<00:04:32.949> basically<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.340> whole<00:04:33.430> idea<00:04:33.639> of

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
time but basically the whole idea of

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.140 
time but basically the whole idea of
this<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.330> that<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:35.139> can<00:04:35.650> tag<00:04:35.889> them<00:04:36.099> and<00:04:36.310> then<00:04:36.610> so

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
this is that I can tag them and then so

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.719
