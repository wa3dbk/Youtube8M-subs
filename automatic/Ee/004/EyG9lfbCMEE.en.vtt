 good afternoon today we will do with 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.280
 you strawberry strawberry performed in 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.240
 different options but we will do it 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.889
 as a Christmas tree toy for strawberries for 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.220
 making strawberries we need 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:22.680
 fifty nine red modules and 13 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.449
 green modules means immediately we do 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.590
 three rows will lead 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:35.040
 each row should have 13 modules 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.390
 we make 3 rows of 13 modules all rows 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.739
 go long side up so here we are 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.469
 made 3 rows of 13 modules now 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.090
 tricks and rolls it upside down 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.180
 we need to turn it up with fire and 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.250
 turn out and so we had 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.170
 it turned out the short side out something 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.899
 we got a short side out and 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.460
 we go one more row now it turns out 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.270
 we need and calves short side 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.659
 out going through another row will do 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.000
 fourth row look you pay 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.900
 attention to the fact that modules need to be planted 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.110
 shallow and try to reduce them 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.790
 the middle here we will do another 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.420
 row 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:35.720
 but make all the modules set means 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.840
 we will put let's say one module 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.590
 insert one module and skip space 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.590
 for the second module 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.210
 so one module put 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:04.860
 and missed the place for the second set 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:07.640
 second module as I said, one 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.459
 missed the place to sink here please 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:16.170
 then put food and so we put 7 modules 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:19.290
 so that's what happened to us now 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:25.079
 need to make leaves insert green 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:28.579
 the first pocket of the first row of 13 modules 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:31.470
 we will be here like this 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:35.819
 We make a Christmas tree toy 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.880
 that is, we need to leave two modules not 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.579
 shoot against each other prepare 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.579
 such a paper clip 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.610
 bend prepare well a little bit 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:51.319
 shorten the end you need to shorten a little 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.319
 the ends have inspired long 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:02.090
 Well, on the other hand like this and holding 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:14.870
