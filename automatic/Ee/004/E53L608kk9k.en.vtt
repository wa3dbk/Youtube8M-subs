00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello everybody this is the world of electric 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.379
 In this video, we'll talk to you. 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.780
 about level sensor of vehicles brand 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.610
 more information and descriptions about this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.799
 product you find on the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.610
 manufacturer is below the description of the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:23.039
 video 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:25.619
 let's go personal in this video 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.900
 will show the use of two sensors 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.330
 level sensor and personal level sensor 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.210
 has some interesting advantages to 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.340
 it can be compared though it can 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.610
 use a system to connect and 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.110
 off a contactor contactor circuit is that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.960
 it can be used as an open contact 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.129
 closed contact inside the same 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.899
 component 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.789
 he is a person of low power what 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.520
 want to be a low-power sensor 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.289
 will not be used directly for me 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.620
 this new one for example a water pump 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.629
 which has a high power current that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.070
 works in the approximate power of 20 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.109
 great that will give a good stream 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.830
 low enough for you added 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.130
 contactor to select various relays is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.140
 you signal the lp or 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.790
 frequency inverter or even in the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.790
 ruin, however, it is also possible to 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.009
 Do something geared to 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.810
 arduino that she is sending a signal and 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.750
 it can not be interpreted by the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.240
 air inea to do several operations 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.570
 there but in this use that we are 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.030
 working here I've been pretending here 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.000
 two level sensors one level sensor 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.040
 and a minimum level sensor and a 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.890
 counter could park a bomb 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.119
 which in this case will be used to 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.460
 remove the water from a reservoir with 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.320
 this is the system that could be 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.049
 used for example in the artesian well for 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.820
 water withdrawal system or which system 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.810
 for withdrawal of water from the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.570
 subsoil 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.450
 the use is different, but not 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.930
 if he goes here he 's playing the part 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.600
 censors for withdrawal of water when 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.000
 My liquid it starts to rise 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.740
 it will trigger that my first 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.259
 level sensor with level sensor 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.090
 minimum of contact it is still in the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.580
 I was off and with my butt she 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.380
 would be here at that moment off 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.110
 as my link from the continuum 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.180
 coming up okay and my beautiful is still 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.830
 disconnected when it reaches the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.590
 maximum 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.860
 my contact is triggered and starts to 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.340
 water is withdrawn and the level tends to 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.920
 fall when the level drops it says 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.660
 March level sensor continues national 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.760
 You can have good contact with me and 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.980
 remains functional until you reach the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.970
 minimum when it says national level 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.040
 Minimum 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.590
 My contact says free means my 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.900
 pump will stop withdrawing the water the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.880
 my artesian well is interesting to talk about 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.400
 level sensor the issue of 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.400
 repeatability that this is how the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.250
 sensor will get stuck in the body of the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.220
 of the reservoir or within a system 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.720
 the prisoner and we do not have much vibration 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.450
 this vibration 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.000
 it keeps my system very unstable I 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.040
 I do not have much variation of the level 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.260
 would be the opposite of a float key that 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.770
 a b boy key it will depend on it's 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.480
 water and the key the buoy will come to 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.420
 have a number of other issues 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.370
 which can be approached in relation to 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.860
 difference between the buoy switch and the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.560
 level then the question of repeatability 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.630
 it shows that the point of 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.470
 Parking drive is well 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.780
 stable 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.240
 even though I have a ripple in the water 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.400
 this variation will be very small is the 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.250
 which is very different there from the float plate 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.470
 as we had said before 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.300
 that's it folks this was the video of 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.940
 Today I hope you enjoyed it if you have 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.130
 enjoyed a like ok gives a young man went to 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.930
 have any questions or concerns 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.340
 simply if you want to leave your 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.070
 opinion about the video leaves 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.750
 comments that we will answer if it is the 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.520
 first time on our channel 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.440
 sign up to receive the 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.190
 our updates 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.190
 thank you guys
