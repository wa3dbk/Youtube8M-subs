00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.410
 the dotcom archaeologist and they were me 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.379
 asking questions about the parquet tv the 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.290
 device to watch television in 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.050
 smartphones and tablets with android like this 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.030
 that it occurred to me to show you how 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.240
 it worked so we're going to see a 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.240
 glance 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.410
 that device that you can see here is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.980
 the extremely small asset as they can 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.699
 see has an antenna that we can 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.940
 disassemble or place in addition to this 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:43.460
 antenna the device comes with one of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.460
 bigger than you can see here 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.540
 we can also connect this with a 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.720
 cable 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.720
 extra 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.720
 the device for the border 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.960
 using on android is as simple as 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:07.200
 just have a device that 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.869
 have usb on-the-go support 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.549
 like this tablets note that we have to 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.039
 give what phones tried and not a 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.430
 problem and once downloaded the app 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:19.650
 the store we simply connect the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.350
 activate 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.810
 the tablet will ask us if it's going to 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.810
 launch the application we give ok 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.950
 and now you can see that it has already detected all 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.410
 the generals available this was a 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.909
 initial step that can be but is 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:42.240
 made more energy than when returning 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.240
 and there 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:54.250
 It is very good but it serves your proposition 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.630
 as I said of galernas is not very good 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.570
 but to have television 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.620
 on a tablet or smartphone without 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.210
 consume our data network is a 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.170
 good option 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.150
 and you can see the text or the quality of 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.200
 videos is not 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.840
 but for world football or even 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.340
 some open signal program in 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.879
 our 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.879
 t 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.660
 more than enough and you can see our 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.660
 Channel 7 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:52.130
 and good this device is active 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.130
 for android tablets and smartphones
