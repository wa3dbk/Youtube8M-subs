00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
main ship which obviously leads onto the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.569 
main ship which obviously leads onto the
map<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:49.020> guards<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.560> win<00:01:49.770> by<00:01:49.920> capturing<00:01:50.369> each

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
map the guards can win by capturing each

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.940

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
of the robbers twice so the second time

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.580 
of the robbers twice so the second time
they<00:01:53.159> catch<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.579> specific<00:01:54.299> robber<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:55.200> Robert

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
they catch a specific robber that Robert

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.969

ends<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.100> jail<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.750> obviously<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.770> other

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
ends up in jail and obviously the other

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.160 
ends up in jail and obviously the other
robbers<00:01:59.189> saw<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.909> fellow<00:02:00.149> robbers<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
robbers saw the fellow robbers and to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.080 
robbers saw the fellow robbers and to
that<00:02:01.350> person<00:02:01.619> who's<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.890> jail<00:02:01.920> under<00:02:02.460> guard<00:02:02.759> so

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that person who's in jail under guard so

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.240 
that person who's in jail under guard so
obviously<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.869> very<00:02:04.200> tricky<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.860> pull<00:02:05.070> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
obviously it's very tricky to pull that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.429 
obviously it's very tricky to pull that
