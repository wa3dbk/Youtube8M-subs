then there's this little lake it's
really<00:02:09.729> thin<00:02:10.090> cardboard<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:11.050> it's<00:02:11.230> like<00:02:11.350> paper

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
really thin cardboard so it's like paper

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.000 
really thin cardboard so it's like paper
board<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:13.300> it's<00:02:13.450> just<00:02:13.720> like<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.050> confetti

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
board and it's just like a confetti

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.559 
board and it's just like a confetti
like<00:02:15.849> shredded<00:02:16.180> up<00:02:16.360> paper<00:02:17.349> for<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.800> birds<00:02:18.569> sit

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
like shredded up paper for the birds sit

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.670 
like shredded up paper for the birds sit
on<00:02:19.660> top<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.780> I'm<00:02:22.780> gonna<00:02:22.959> attempt<00:02:23.379> to<00:02:23.530> get

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
on top of and I'm gonna attempt to get

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.710 
on top of and I'm gonna attempt to get
this<00:02:23.769> back<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.489> getting<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.269> back<00:02:25.300> in<00:02:25.569> it

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
this back in and getting it back in it

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.860 
this back in and getting it back in it
obviously<00:02:26.680> is<00:02:26.769> a<00:02:26.830> lot<00:02:26.950> easier<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.750> then<00:02:28.750> it

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
obviously is a lot easier and then it

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.470 
obviously is a lot easier and then it
has<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:28.989> little<00:02:29.230> life<00:02:29.410> test<00:02:29.650> logo<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.480> this

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
has a little life test logo and this

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.470 
has a little life test logo and this
