I<00:01:55.250> might<00:01:55.429> just<00:01:55.610> get<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.850> bugs<00:01:56.060> into<00:01:56.300> he<00:01:56.509> make

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
I might just get the bugs into he make

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:17.650 
I might just get the bugs into he make
it

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.110 

I'll<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.780> read<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.050> write<00:02:19.380> for<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:20.010> small<00:02:20.700> fish

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
I'll just read to write for a small fish

I'll just read to write for a small fish
powerful<00:02:21.930> maybe<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> environment<00:02:23.040> that

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
powerful maybe it's the environment that

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.000 
powerful maybe it's the environment that
they've<00:02:23.280> got<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.550> get<00:02:24.390> up<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.810> get<00:02:24.990> back<00:02:25.200> down

they've got to get up and get back down
quickly<00:02:26.340> bit
