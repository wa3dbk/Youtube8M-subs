00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 come to a new youtube video like 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.890
 you the two best installers 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.730
 Alternatives can excuse these 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.410
 are piquÃ© 25 and how much the only one 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.850
 problem with pp 25 is that is japanese 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.400
 Chinese or Korean what knows 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.539
 I know what kind of language that is 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.420
 In any case, it is neither German nor 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.490
 english but no fear i'll show you 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.680
 even the things that are so important 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.430
 the only thing she needs is 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.460
 julia either directly your device or 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.820
 already another tutorial on youtube 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.250
 on 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.340
 like her video on a new one each without 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.020
 job i do not want it 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.149
 we'll start chatting and talking 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.660
 the first thing that really matters 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.899
 is apps sync around the latest version 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.129
 to do so by the order the latest version 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.280
 to get from it 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:17.119
 Add each edit to edit 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:19.610
 and gives a reporter reto suri points 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:27.509
 Add 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:30.390
 anyway, now add the chance and 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.810
 what has to do now is often the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:43.470
 to go to reporters 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:46.070
 there then looked for in a to b 6 the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.070
 installed 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:04.810
 yes for that steadily once you have apps 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.910
 you have installed again 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:14.130
 manage swell 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:24.870
 then you go to edit add 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:28.209
 and there he gives a point 1 point com 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.340
 there is a source I add 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.120
 already added that's why I give up 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.190
 abort, stop 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:41.110
 yes this is what the wipo wanted here 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.930
 all the sources were worked 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.209
 adds the sources are all and 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.560
 the description so if you man 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.799
 could not come with is easy from 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:58.230
 read the description 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:03:04.019
 but now that we have added xls 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.019
 we would have to scroll down to 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:18.810
 there is woman michelle 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.850
 and now install a hobby for 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.500
 It's easy to use 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:39.760
 actually quite fast but not so 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:44.080
 fast as pp 25 and now i show 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:52.090
 you how you can study that you can 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:04:16.630
 opens and then they swell up 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:17.650
 edit there is there, however 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.150
 do not add any 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.790
 I 've already done so so I go 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.419
 should cancel now on like that 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.419
 ausschauen 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:41.070
 there goes sp and there looked for it pp 25 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:46.990
 install and install this here 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:51.610
 spp 25 that it installs here but we 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.340
 are already finished and yes I prefer 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:59.530
 pp 25 because it is simply essential 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:01.740
 Faster there it is easy 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.220
 Japanese for a bit again though 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.880
 it is not so complicated is to search 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:15.850
 and looking for some game 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:17.350
 and yes I now just right 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.669
 Just play the game here 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:26.050
 there goes on this case the right and 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:27.640
 then click this left button here 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:33.840
 It works that that is the download 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.840
 button and then download saxon 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.630
 and it installs by itself 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.700
 that means you do not need any 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.440
 make settings or it because the 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:48.300
 then she has rung in studied herself 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:52.200
 then I thank you too 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:56.060
 look and see you later 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.060
