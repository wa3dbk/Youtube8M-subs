grates<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.680> can<00:03:46.829> see<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.100> camera<00:03:47.340> stays<00:03:47.700> up

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
grates you can see the camera stays up

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.789 
grates you can see the camera stays up
outside<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.329> great<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.900> allows<00:03:49.230> me<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.560> track

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
outside the great and allows me to track

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.310 
outside the great and allows me to track
people<00:03:49.980> moving<00:03:50.489> up<00:03:50.609> above<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:52.019> I'm<00:03:52.140> going<00:03:52.290> to

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
people moving up above and I'm going to

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.900 
people moving up above and I'm going to
use<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.799> take<00:03:53.130> down<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.459> thug<00:03:53.730> here

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
use this to take down this thug here

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.190 
use this to take down this thug here
just<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.209> quick<00:03:54.390> look<00:03:54.540> around<00:03:54.630> there<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.079> make

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
just a quick look around there to make

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.020 
just a quick look around there to make
sure<00:03:55.260> no<00:03:55.560> one<00:03:55.680> else<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:55.980> around<00:03:56.100> in<00:03:56.489> groups<00:03:56.760> and

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
sure no one else is around in groups and

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.960 
sure no one else is around in groups and
as<00:03:57.299> he<00:03:57.390> moves<00:03:57.630> past<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:59.130> come<00:03:59.310> up<00:03:59.430> behind<00:03:59.579> him

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
as he moves past to come up behind him

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:10.590 
as he moves past to come up behind him
and<00:04:00.180> take<00:04:00.510> him<00:04:00.690> down<00:04:00.810> silently

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.120 

so<00:04:11.600> up<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.930> now<00:04:11.960> you<00:04:12.170> see<00:04:12.500> they've<00:04:12.710> been<00:04:12.890> quite

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
so up to now you see they've been quite

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.650 
so up to now you see they've been quite
patient<00:04:13.400> with<00:04:13.700> a<00:04:13.730> different<00:04:14.060> take<00:04:14.240> down<00:04:14.480> so

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
patient with a different take down so

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.360 
patient with a different take down so
I've<00:04:14.750> used<00:04:14.960> but<00:04:15.590> you<00:04:15.650> can<00:04:15.830> be<00:04:15.980> more<00:04:16.100> aggressive

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
I've used but you can be more aggressive

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.820 
I've used but you can be more aggressive
that's<00:04:16.760> totally<00:04:17.150> your<00:04:17.330> choice<00:04:17.680> let's<00:04:18.680> try

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
that's totally your choice let's try

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.440 
that's totally your choice let's try
more<00:04:19.070> aggressive<00:04:19.489> take<00:04:19.730> down<00:04:19.940> here<00:04:20.209> there's<00:04:20.390> a

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
more aggressive take down here there's a

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.970 
more aggressive take down here there's a
few<00:04:20.630> less<00:04:20.780> of<00:04:20.930> them<00:04:21.019> around<00:04:21.260> so<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:21.620> can<00:04:21.680> be<00:04:21.950> a

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
few less of them around so I can be a

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.980 
few less of them around so I can be a
little<00:04:22.160> bit<00:04:22.370> more<00:04:22.550> confident<00:04:23.210> than<00:04:23.330> the

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
little bit more confident than the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.660 
little bit more confident than the
different<00:04:24.290> tactics<00:04:24.650> i'll<00:04:24.830> use<00:04:25.100> so<00:04:25.400> i'll<00:04:25.490> try

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
different tactics i'll use so i'll try

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.700 
different tactics i'll use so i'll try
glide<00:04:26.000> take<00:04:26.270> down<00:04:26.450> here<00:04:26.690> on<00:04:26.810> this<00:04:26.960> guy<00:04:27.200> he's

you can see the bat icon above his head

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.780 
you can see the bat icon above his head
signifies<00:04:33.710> he's<00:04:33.980> in<00:04:34.130> range<00:04:34.280> for<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.610> glide

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
signifies he's in range for the glide

around and then i can drop down look
into<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.700> ground<00:04:41.740> that'll<00:04:42.740> only<00:04:42.830> standing

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
into the ground that'll only standing

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.650 
into the ground that'll only standing
for<00:04:43.370> a<00:04:43.430> while<00:04:43.580> so<00:04:43.760> i<00:04:43.850> need<00:04:44.000> to<00:04:44.030> move<00:04:44.300> up<00:04:44.510> and

for a while so i need to move up and
finish<00:04:44.900> him<00:04:45.050> off<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:46.340> then<00:04:46.400> again<00:04:46.820> grapple

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
finish him off and then again grapple

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.450 
finish him off and then again grapple
back<00:04:47.420> up<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:47.900> out<00:04:48.020> cuz<00:04:48.680> that's<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:49.010> very<00:04:49.250> noisy

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
back up and out cuz that's a very noisy

back up and out cuz that's a very noisy
take<00:04:49.880> down<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.210> glide<00:04:50.390> think<00:04:50.690> it's<00:04:50.810> going<00:04:50.930> to

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
take down the glide think it's going to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.990 
take down the glide think it's going to
attract<00:04:51.260> people<00:04:51.620> very<00:04:51.860> quickly<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:52.640> so<00:04:52.910> it

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
attract people very quickly to it so it

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.580 
attract people very quickly to it so it
is<00:04:53.060> a<00:04:53.090> dangerous<00:04:53.330> tactic<00:04:53.900> to<00:04:54.050> use<00:04:54.260> but<00:04:54.440> it's

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
is a dangerous tactic to use but it's

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.190 
is a dangerous tactic to use but it's
also<00:04:54.710> a<00:04:54.860> very<00:04:55.070> effective<00:04:55.430> tactic<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.120> use<00:04:59.200> so

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
also a very effective tactic to use so

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.450 
also a very effective tactic to use so
now<00:05:00.350> we're<00:05:00.500> down<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.680> just<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:01.070> couple<00:05:01.100> of

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
that you'll see their behavior starts to

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.180 
that you'll see their behavior starts to
change<00:05:05.870> as<00:05:06.110> well<00:05:06.290> as<00:05:06.440> they<00:05:06.590> become<00:05:06.860> more<00:05:06.920> and

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.750 
him and this again it's not something
that's<00:05:21.169> always<00:05:21.380> predictable<00:05:21.980> but<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.640> way

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
that's always predictable but the way

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.280 
that's always predictable but the way
their<00:05:22.940> behavior<00:05:23.419> changes<00:05:23.870> as<00:05:23.990> you<00:05:24.110> play

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290
