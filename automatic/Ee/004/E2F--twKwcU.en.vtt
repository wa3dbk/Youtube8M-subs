00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.970
 born in extreme poverty its president 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.909
 after a long 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.909
 as in the whole area 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.230
 Maradona 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.230
 and repeated 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.880
 p 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.830
 I worked 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.740
 now 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.780
 now 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.880
 it's very difficult to start talking about him 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.510
 from vigo from another place 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.720
 that is not poetry 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.740
 this 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.160
 no doubt and others 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.650
 type that can 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.230
 that they can talk about him from another point of view but usually I 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.230
 I consider those people I intuit that they will see in this video 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.400
 p 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.200
 people who in the genealogical tree of creativity are basket bug 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.279
 who live 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.919
 of what was the sap that live from what they go to their appointment that seeing that goes to the 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.919
 root they exceed what gives the air only has well from above 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.979
 but I lean towards the police 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:25.769
 yes maradona 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.769
 When you stop playing football, the police stop 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:33.039
 only in the year 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.039
 1927 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.239
 with the red star court here five blocks away 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:44.099
 he remembered that 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.749
 in that time no matter how much they rob us 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.319
 my dad would not let me out 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.079
 like the dialogue with the ball 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.419
 then I made my dad and I went to the court full red star bm a match 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.049
 large paddock and there 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.069
 where I saw life itself 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.750
 four hundred guys 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.690
 a luckily and one of them know me the bond problem another day 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.909
 and next to her and where is it because she knew him fuzzy at that moment p 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.159
 I had an exercise shirt 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.549
 was born on October 30, 1960 indications of crime 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.999
 Buenos Aires province 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:25.999
 thanks to the love and sacrifice of their parents 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.599
 he thought he never stopped being 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:32.879
 left 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.879
 the very large text 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.069
 you just have to leave 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.449
 dark night 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.449
 truths 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.669
 after the radio for television 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:54.159
 of 1970 although light began to play in ecosystems the service of 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.519
 Argentine juniors 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.680
 that era has proven an amazing skill for a child of 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.089
 10 years researchers 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.479
 as I explained that there is a much better one than me today 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.939
 He explained Monica from the glass and I said 'well I love Argentinian fluff 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:16.509
 in the papacy he made contact with a maradona and lemon so all this started 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.319
 when I see diego 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:20.539
 do these things cd 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.539
 let's not say against the minor 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:26.159
 sheet 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:28.009
 it has not happened 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.789
 nothing 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.330
 on stage 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
 the copper went up to 69 days 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.240
 the two goals 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.779
 it has not given details of the trip 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:41.999
 time after 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:45.419
 on October 20, 1976 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.419
 debuted in the first division of the fatherly team 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.859
 they will ask me this was joined by the skin 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.969
 it was not due mainly to the protest and to experts 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:02.129
 11 in the morning ten thirty 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.129
 will never do it from the place where they should 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.650
 Jun 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.080
 has been a symbol of the obvious is March 2 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.080
 in interview the lawyer 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.699
 but as now the letter 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.469
 there will also be two female players but what I do 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.990
 the first in the neighborhood of the parental nadal has a new idol diego 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.419
 arming maradona 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.229
 he was third with three days 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.729
 the airport of barajas efe 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.240
 this one from san jose 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.240
 this improvement will break the event rpdc 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:33.029
 that united to a big club in 1979 and in the juvenile world championship of japan argentinos 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:38.149
 was the champion and diego cuvi the undisputed figure manchester 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.169
 the cntv cn the day 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.169
 the head of state 

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:14.339
 remember 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:19.349
 but you will see 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:22.749
 that's why we think there's 

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:23.729
 p 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:27.870
 you have to bring a player from birth but you have to be born with 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.830
 the talent that once a football player is perfected 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.650
 but after that dozens of entities and then he said he always 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.650
 awaits the arrival of others yes of course 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.010
 the text says 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.429
 in one of the amendments of the bmv asur luso government 

00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:47.429
 He could be acting on many things 

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:51.699
 leaves this potential process 

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:52.370
 the cdc
