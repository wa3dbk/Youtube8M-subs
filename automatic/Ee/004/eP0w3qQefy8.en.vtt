00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:16.059
 Hello, I greet you readers and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.390
 here in Waldkirchen is already 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.070
 not a lot of work and snow 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.480
 me of course in winter mood and me 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.450
 Hope you well and I want to tell you 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.400
 Of course for the many defenses 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.669
 which we need in this colder 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.230
 season imagine a power woman 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:36.460
 So also really great again 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.790
 food what you can just help me 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.719
 to supply with vitamins which I with 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:47.859
 Provide antioxidants and easy 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.719
 also crisp and doing well and 21 of the 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.699
 wonderful just having it is so one 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.280
 real magnificent piece from what I here 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.789
 the april channel does not grow 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.050
 so we also have a fruit you 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.120
 to germany brings luck 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.789
 I really tell the absolute 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.720
 power fruit contains a lot of vitamin c 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:10.590
 the much calcium potassium iron and for that 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.700
 she is very well known 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.770
 Of course, it also becomes anti-inflammatory 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.020
 and all but she has a very high one 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.950
 proportion of antioxidants 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.230
 So it is what the fight of the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.980
 Free radicals are very concerned 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.070
 meaningful 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.130
 and now I want you this video 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.470
 like to show you how to make these little ones 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.060
 church back in there are these little ones 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.650
 red diamonds because I like them 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.640
 come back to it because many buy 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.440
 This book is not because it does not 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.330
 how do i get there or you 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.700
 always have everything unsprayed and it 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.810
 is a very simple way yes like you 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.070
 can take this fruit 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.260
 I'll show you I would be for that 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.570
 perspectives change so easily 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.950
 So be before I show you how 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.990
 it rises falls me another wants 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.270
 I like to tell you what to look for 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.770
 You should buy when you buy in Canada 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.710
 look at this I have in principle 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.950
 a real gem here so the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.990
 is really firm the skin is too 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.400
 important, so you do not see them 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.149
 somehow so that she shrank 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.670
 looks like they have really deep red 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.280
 and looks really really great 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.599
 should look at the pomegranate if you 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.720
 I would not be too bright now 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.430
 necessarily buy 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.520
 he is also really cute that is so 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.260
 not so sour but rather sweet and 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.739
 Thus, to buy optimally so as to buy 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.110
 We pay in the organic shop and pay 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.430
 depending on the cinema and I think the piece is 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.580
 not quite as chilly as that 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.040
 260 or so but it's real who that 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.660
 I tell you, as you yourselves times the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.959
 Perspective does not change me 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.140
 will not see me anymore but 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.140
 for slaughtering the channel 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.930
 Heinsohn ceramic knife also in the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:57.540
 In principle I am doing there I am now 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.700
 not so easy here 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.970
 turn down the water here once live 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.610
 snowing back here once you what 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.280
 her nowhere reddish 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.440
 speckled or otherwise and then you take 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.220
 Carefully with the knife and cuts 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.780
 here just a few cuts 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.030
 be careful not to get too deep 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.850
 if you cut too deeply you have that 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.970
 problem that everywhere the red juice 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.000
 runs out and I wanted to show and 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.410
 prove that on the one hand I want 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.640
 I do not want you to do that he wants me 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.380
 like to grate the 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.160
 pomegranate can open without that 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.750
 Now everything is fine and the other is the one 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.519
 of course, and that's the way it is 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.450
 So you can see quite well as in the car 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.570
 about all those little pieces there 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.340
 incised 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.410
 it basically does not do anything else now 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.970
 is already everywhere loose her than the 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.160
 to choose a pure tear and you see 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.630
 already opened it's so slow 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.900
 with the other hand in between and 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:05.069
 you just see that here and there 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.209
 are you clean and without being so big now? 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.209
 the knees 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.900
 do you have clean and without is big 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.040
 somehow well injected the 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.450
 open channel 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.660
 and now you basically can not do anything 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.530
 Do something other than or you only need 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.660
 You can say every single book 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.010
 escaped as every single juice too 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.470
 make and then you have so small 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.960
 Scheibchen we do it now 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.660
 sometimes puglisi that means I take 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.760
 so the pieces here and positions 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.810
 czech but that walls tricks can do it 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.639
 already happen that they inject too 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:43.100
 I'm going to open this one too soon 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:45.620
 and then cleanse eat a bit 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.120
 and good as I said right in the 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.910
 cold season is the real thing 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.889
 superfruit you at least for you 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.500
 Rich times to eat the week should know 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.470
 She even daily and she very much 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.790
 does very well and just tastes good 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.460
 and that is for the eye 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.880
 Red like the love I find a beautiful 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.310
 in front 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.919
 okay that was mine, I hope so 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.330
 could inspire again and the 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.870
 give helpful tips and the next 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.960
 honestly deserve to vote see 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.060
 we outside the Erzgebirge everything in the 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.890
 thickest saxony we are driving after 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.580
