connection<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.779> back<00:00:27.810> there<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.680> i'm

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
connection on the back there and i'm

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.730 
connection on the back there and i'm
going<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> connect<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.820> my<00:00:30.060> 2012<00:00:30.929> apple

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740

so<00:00:33.360> let's<00:00:33.480> get<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.780> connected<00:00:34.079> up<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:37.559> we

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
so let's get this connected up and we

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.380 
so let's get this connected up and we
just<00:00:37.980> pop<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.309> down<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> side<00:00:38.940> here<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
just pop it down to the side here and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.290 
just pop it down to the side here and
the<00:00:40.110> actual<00:00:40.440> application<00:00:41.219> i'm<00:00:41.700> using<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.180> do

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
run through just one more time this time

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.219 
run through just one more time this time
around<00:01:19.380> we're<00:01:19.619> getting<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.979> write<00:01:20.310> speed<00:01:20.729> of

three<00:01:29.689> megabytes<00:01:30.689> per<00:01:30.930> second<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.650> very<00:01:32.070> very

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
three megabytes per second so very very

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.510 
three megabytes per second so very very
good<00:01:32.820> performance<00:01:33.180> by<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.049> verbatim<00:01:34.799> store

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
good performance by the verbatim store

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.330 
good performance by the verbatim store
and<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:35.850> USB<00:01:36.420> 3<00:01:36.780> flash<00:01:37.049> drive<00:01:37.350> let's<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.250> this

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and go USB 3 flash drive let's get this

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.490 
and go USB 3 flash drive let's get this
disconnected<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.270> give<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:39.990> last<00:01:40.229> look
