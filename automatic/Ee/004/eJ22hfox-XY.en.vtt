00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.240
 hello everyone so this month we'll see 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.010
 how to tame euros a stand up this is 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.290
 to say how rowed right because on 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.849
 a pretty short clipboard and 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.500
 sisters in fact it will not be obvious 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.080
 necessarily one of ram is always the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 same side going right this is it can 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.590
 be helpful nevertheless to always rowed 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.660
 on the same side and bass rec on a small 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.029
 dive while waiting for it to necessarily go to 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.019
 right on the left we can the rights is 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.820
 always the same side there is a 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.890
 technique we're going back to you 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.630
 left then so stand up on a 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.100
 little board we often tend goes 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.600
 change all of ram next time 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.829
 to be able to go right because if we 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.930
 ream that on one side we tend to 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.340
 turn gradually 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.050
 so there's a little trick for you it's 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.010
 to say we will learn to row right 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.079
 always on the same side 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.090
 and yes it's possible it's actually 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.340
 taming Romandie 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.750
 so there is some technique we are going 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.190
 broken down into several stages 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.289
 so we're going to start actually not going 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.820
 bring the paddle back to you 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.379
 was doing the board we will bring back 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.969
 parallel to the board that will do that 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.500
 the board see our side a little 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.019
 and the taste we will end up with a movement 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.430
 drama backwards to the outside there 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.049
 will bring the board back to the other side 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.840
 so in the end we will be able to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.790
 go right by bringing in like that then 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.760
 so in fact when we row so on a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.890
 small board when not rowing 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.400
 really parallel to the board actually 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.950
 too cold 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.509
 well we tend to turn a bit 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.119
 in fact it's about starting 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.610
 so we shove the shovel 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.200
 in the board 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.299
 then we 'll do the board 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.460
 so there in these cases there the board 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.850
 it will turn on that side it's going to 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.729
 bring back 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.130
 then we will arm a little parallel to 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.360
 the board what will do a little 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.920
 returned the other way for 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.869
 slightly but then we end up with a 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.670
 outward movement of business 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.380
 brought back the board still meaning my 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.930
 final body the board she'll go 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.829
 right so inward all right 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.530
 and outside 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.579
 basically it's a bit of a myth 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.120
 so to start we 're actually going 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.680
 first not to practice doing that 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.980
 and inside to understand that the 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.650
 board she everything is then perfect 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.780
 the complete movement and we'll see that in 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.970
 before that right even keeping that a 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.250
 side of the train without necessarily internal 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.770
 and so that's useful when for example 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.420
 we have wind for example and that 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.370
 will you have to paddle from one side 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.160
 because otherwise we actually take the wind 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.290
 2 side fights that will make us 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.200
 really derived so sometimes forced to 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.970
 bring only the opposite side to the wind 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.970
 what is it useful to know
