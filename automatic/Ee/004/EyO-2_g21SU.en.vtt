00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
the coupling that's above it that will

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the coupling that's above it that will
also<00:01:09.970> cause<00:01:10.300> it<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.570> fall<00:01:10.720> into<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.080> lava<00:01:12.600> now

if you're going to shoot the coupling

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.660

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
use your hand gun because it takes about

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.340

forward<00:03:12.810> just<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.110> little<00:03:13.140> bit<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.850> on<00:03:14.850> some<00:03:15.180> of

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
forward just a little bit and on some of

forward just a little bit and on some of
the<00:03:15.300> practice<00:03:15.660> runs<00:03:15.900> even<00:03:16.620> though<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.920> was<00:03:17.070> safe

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.490 

now<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:27.269> they<00:03:27.390> do<00:03:27.450> get<00:03:27.750> too<00:03:27.959> close<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.409> you

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
now if they do get too close to you

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.410 
now if they do get too close to you
shoot<00:03:29.099> them<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.370> face<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.209> will

shoot them in the face and that will

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.479 
shoot them in the face and that will
make<00:03:30.540> them<00:03:30.690> stumble<00:03:31.019> backwards<00:03:31.530> usually<00:03:32.310> that

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
make them stumble backwards usually that

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.589 
make them stumble backwards usually that
will<00:03:32.610> put<00:03:32.790> them<00:03:32.909> right<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.239> way<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.510> the

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
will put them right in the way of the
