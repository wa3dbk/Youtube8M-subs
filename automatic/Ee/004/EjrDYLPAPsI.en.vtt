know 80 bucks and up really expensive

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.520 
know 80 bucks and up really expensive
computer<00:02:34.360> glasses<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.900> if<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.110> see<00:02:35.410> the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
computer glasses and if you see the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.180 
computer glasses and if you see the
reviews<00:02:35.890> they're<00:02:36.130> not<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.880> great<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:38.800> was

like now screw that I'm gonna spend that

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.700 
like now screw that I'm gonna spend that
much<00:02:41.830> money<00:02:42.070> on<00:02:42.160> some<00:02:42.370> computer<00:02:42.820> classes

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
much money on some computer classes

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.930 
much money on some computer classes
I'm<00:02:44.710> sure<00:02:44.950> there's<00:02:45.130> gonna<00:02:45.220> be<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.790> know<00:02:45.820> a

I'm sure there's gonna be you know a

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.000 
I'm sure there's gonna be you know a
better<00:02:46.300> option<00:02:46.600> with<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.470> more<00:02:47.710> affordable

price range right so I've found these

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.070 
price range right so I've found these
gamma<00:02:51.970> rays<00:02:52.240> from<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:53.740> you<00:02:54.010> know<00:02:54.100> 29.95<00:02:55.080> by

gamma rays from the you know 29.95 by
the<00:02:56.140> way<00:02:56.290> guys<00:02:56.470> I'll<00:02:56.920> be<00:02:57.100> posting<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.550> link<00:02:57.700> in

in this in this nice case right here in

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.090 
in this in this nice case right here in
a<00:03:28.330> nice<00:03:28.510> little<00:03:28.600> cloth<00:03:28.989> right<00:03:29.200> there<00:03:29.410> honestly

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
a nice little cloth right there honestly

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.710 
a nice little cloth right there honestly
I<00:03:30.400> didn't<00:03:30.640> really<00:03:30.820> like<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.000> cloth<00:03:31.390> it's<00:03:31.630> a

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
I didn't really like that cloth it's a

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.930 
I didn't really like that cloth it's a
little<00:03:32.350> bit<00:03:32.470> too<00:03:32.620> rough<00:03:32.860> on<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.489> clown<00:03:33.790> with

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
little bit too rough on the clown with

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.510 
little bit too rough on the clown with
lenses<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:35.350> isn't<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:35.920> clean<00:03:36.130> world<00:03:36.340> either

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
lenses it isn't the clean world either

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.750 
lenses it isn't the clean world either
so<00:03:37.360> I<00:03:37.390> had<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.750> go<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.110> get<00:03:38.320> some<00:03:38.620> another<00:03:39.040> soft

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
so I had to go and get some another soft

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.949 
so I had to go and get some another soft
cloth<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:41.440> came<00:03:41.709> with<00:03:41.950> um<00:03:42.600> that<00:03:43.600> came<00:03:43.810> with

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
cloth that came with um that came with

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.670 
cloth that came with um that came with
another<00:03:44.140> pair<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.500> glasses<00:03:44.739> I<00:03:45.010> got<00:03:45.220> more<00:03:46.680> then

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
another pair of glasses I got more then

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.290 
another pair of glasses I got more then
I<00:03:47.709> want<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.010> mess<00:03:48.130> up<00:03:48.280> these<00:03:48.430> glasses<00:03:48.640> 30<00:03:49.090> bucks

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
I want to mess up these glasses 30 bucks

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.790 
I want to mess up these glasses 30 bucks
is<00:03:49.480> still<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> good<00:03:49.959> amount<00:03:50.080> of<00:03:50.290> money<00:03:50.440> for<00:03:50.590> a

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
is still a good amount of money for a

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.380 
is still a good amount of money for a
pair<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.040> glasses<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.280> believe<00:03:54.790> I<00:03:55.120> mean

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
pair of glasses and so I believe I mean

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.880 
pair of glasses and so I believe I mean
I<00:03:55.480> don't<00:03:55.540> think<00:03:56.050> about<00:03:56.320> her<00:03:56.380> now<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.560> don't<00:03:56.800> know

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
I don't think about her now I don't know

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.590 
I don't think about her now I don't know
why<00:03:57.070> I<00:03:57.100> went<00:03:57.370> with<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.700> gamma<00:03:57.970> rays<00:03:58.209> instead

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
why I went with the gamma rays instead

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.850 
why I went with the gamma rays instead
of<00:03:58.720> these<00:03:59.080> since<00:03:59.890> these<00:04:00.010> are<00:04:00.190> more<00:04:01.530> more<00:04:02.530> you

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
of these since these are more more you

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.550 
of these since these are more more you
know<00:04:03.270> classical<00:04:04.270> looking<00:04:04.660> more<00:04:04.900> more<00:04:05.200> more

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
know classical looking more more more

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.170 
know classical looking more more more
nice<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.970> be<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.390> wear<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:08.020> guess<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:09.030> guess<00:04:10.030> they

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
nice to be to wear I guess I guess they

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:18.570 
nice to be to wear I guess I guess they
lived<00:04:10.390> you<00:04:10.570> know<00:04:13.019> more<00:04:14.019> classical<00:04:14.620> on<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:18.280> like

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
lived you know more classical on so like

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.909 
lived you know more classical on so like
I<00:04:18.760> guess<00:04:18.850> that<00:04:19.090> during<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.450> time<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.890> that<00:04:20.890> I

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
I guess that during the time that that I

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.130 
I guess that during the time that that I
was<00:04:21.100> looking<00:04:21.370> at<00:04:21.519> these<00:04:21.640> glasses<00:04:21.820> I<00:04:22.390> could

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
was looking at these glasses I could

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.240 
was looking at these glasses I could
have<00:04:23.229> sworn<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:23.680> these<00:04:23.950> were<00:04:24.100> more

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
have sworn that these were more

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.090 
have sworn that these were more
expensive<00:04:24.820> than<00:04:24.970> this

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
expensive than this

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.100 
expensive than this
but<00:04:26.910> I<00:04:26.940> guess<00:04:27.060> another<00:04:27.240> factor<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:27.750> that

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
but I guess another factor that that

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.700 
but I guess another factor that that
came<00:04:28.740> into<00:04:28.950> play<00:04:29.070> was<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:30.260> if<00:04:31.260> we<00:04:31.410> go<00:04:31.560> down

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
came into play was that if we go down
