Subaru<00:00:19.070> Impreza<00:00:19.550> just<00:00:20.540> a<00:00:21.730> kind<00:00:22.730> of<00:00:22.759> a<00:00:22.880> very

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
Subaru Impreza just a kind of a very

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.900 
Subaru Impreza just a kind of a very
subtle<00:00:24.790> kind<00:00:25.790> of<00:00:25.849> thud<00:00:26.320> that<00:00:27.550> went<00:00:28.550> along<00:00:28.670> with

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
subtle kind of thud that went along with

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.689 
subtle kind of thud that went along with
the<00:00:29.240> wheels<00:00:29.750> rotation<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:30.680> I<00:00:30.890> listened<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:31.430> I

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
the wheels rotation and I listened and I

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.689 
the wheels rotation and I listened and I
thought<00:00:32.510> it<00:00:32.689> might<00:00:32.720> be<00:00:33.080> the<00:00:33.680> CV<00:00:34.010> axle<00:00:34.190> now

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
thought it might be the CV axle now

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:35.830 
thought it might be the CV axle now
normally<00:00:35.090> when<00:00:35.180> these<00:00:35.269> things<00:00:35.390> go<00:00:35.660> they

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
normally when these things go they

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.509 
normally when these things go they
they're<00:00:36.350> pretty<00:00:36.710> loud<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:36.949> they<00:00:37.220> Clank

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
they're pretty loud and they Clank

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.920 
they're pretty loud and they Clank
pretty<00:00:37.879> bad<00:00:38.090> but<00:00:38.720> this<00:00:38.780> was<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:38.989> really<00:00:39.559> really

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
pretty bad but this was a really really

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.990 
pretty bad but this was a really really
subtle<00:00:41.930> kind<00:00:42.589> of<00:00:42.710> noise<00:00:42.890> very<00:00:43.280> easy<00:00:43.580> to<00:00:43.790> miss

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
subtle kind of noise very easy to miss

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.910 
subtle kind of noise very easy to miss
and<00:00:44.299> it's<00:00:44.420> only<00:00:44.570> I<00:00:44.839> only<00:00:45.170> heard<00:00:45.409> it<00:00:45.530> because<00:00:45.799> I

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
and it's only I only heard it because I

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.479 
and it's only I only heard it because I
kind<00:00:46.159> of<00:00:46.390> knew<00:00:47.390> what<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.839> listen<00:00:48.019> for<00:00:48.229> I<00:00:48.650> think

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
kind of knew what to listen for I think

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.549 
kind of knew what to listen for I think
it<00:00:49.640> was<00:00:49.760> very<00:00:49.790> quiet<00:00:50.180> but<00:00:50.449> today<00:00:51.170> I<00:00:51.199> finally

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
it was very quiet but today I finally

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.979 
it was very quiet but today I finally
had<00:00:51.680> a<00:00:51.710> chance<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.040> look<00:00:52.159> at<00:00:52.309> it

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.410 

getting<00:00:56.989> under<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.260> car<00:00:57.500> here<00:00:57.830> and<00:00:58.299> you<00:00:59.299> can

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
getting under the car here and you can

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.490 
getting under the car here and you can
see<00:00:59.629> here<00:01:00.350> is<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:01.089> the<00:01:02.089> busted<00:01:02.510> axle<00:01:02.690> boot<00:01:03.170> and

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
see here is the the busted axle boot and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.719 
see here is the the busted axle boot and
it's<00:01:03.650> obviously<00:01:04.070> been<00:01:04.250> this<00:01:04.339> way<00:01:04.489> for<00:01:04.699> a

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
it's obviously been this way for a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.310 
it's obviously been this way for a
little<00:01:04.940> while<00:01:05.089> but<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:05.449> can't<00:01:05.750> leave<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.140> car

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
little while but I can't leave the car

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.160 
little while but I can't leave the car
like<00:01:06.560> this<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:08.390> we<00:01:08.479> both<00:01:08.630> drive<00:01:08.930> long

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
like this and we both drive long

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.940 
like this and we both drive long
distance<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:09.979> I<00:01:11.020> am<00:01:12.020> going<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:12.409> replace<00:01:12.650> this

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
distance so I am going to replace this

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:24.460 
distance so I am going to replace this
today<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:22.540> just<00:01:23.540> want<00:01:23.840> over<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:24.020> autozone<00:01:24.380> to

other side here but basically yeah the

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.510 
other side here but basically yeah the
axle<00:01:47.300> nut<00:01:47.420> gets<00:01:47.570> pinned<00:01:48.940> into<00:01:49.940> this<00:01:51.490> into<00:01:52.490> this

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
axle nut gets pinned into this into this

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.980 
stand on the side with the wheel is
still<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.850> if<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.940> look<00:02:42.090> down<00:02:42.120> here<00:02:42.660> you

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
still on so if you look down here you

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.130 
still on so if you look down here you
can<00:02:43.020> see<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:44.280> that's<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.360> roll<00:02:45.570> pin<00:02:45.870> that

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
can see the that's the roll pin that

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.400 
can see the that's the roll pin that
goes<00:02:46.170> through<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.830> axle<00:02:47.280> into<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.410> stub

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
goes through the axle into the stub

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.080 
goes through the axle into the stub
shaft<00:02:49.440> coming<00:02:50.100> off<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.430> transmission<00:02:50.880> now

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
shaft coming off the transmission now

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.760 
shaft coming off the transmission now
you<00:02:51.150> want<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.600> pointing<00:02:52.170> straight<00:02:52.410> up<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
you want this pointing straight up and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.729 
you want this pointing straight up and
down<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:54.239> reason<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.690> that'll<00:02:54.989> make<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.170> a

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
down and the reason is that'll make it a

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.030 
down and the reason is that'll make it a
lot<00:02:56.040> easier<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.670> find<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.270> on<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:58.040> passenger

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
lot easier I find that on the passenger

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.820 
lot easier I find that on the passenger
side<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.550> the<00:03:00.450> car<00:03:00.660> here<00:03:00.989> it's<00:03:01.140> much<00:03:01.320> easier<00:03:01.709> to

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
side of the car here it's much easier to

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.670 
side of the car here it's much easier to
knock<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.160> roll<00:03:02.400> pin<00:03:02.640> out<00:03:02.820> from<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.270> top

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
knock that roll pin out from the top

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.830 
knock that roll pin out from the top
because<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.739> can<00:03:04.860> see<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:06.390> catalytic

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
because you can see the the catalytic

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.540 
because you can see the the catalytic
converter<00:03:06.900> running<00:03:07.380> directly<00:03:07.800> beneath<00:03:08.220> it

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
converter running directly beneath it

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.550 
converter running directly beneath it
otherwise<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.090> gotta<00:03:09.239> pull<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.540> exhaust<00:03:09.840> if

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
otherwise you gotta pull the exhaust if

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.690 
otherwise you gotta pull the exhaust if
you<00:03:10.650> do<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:10.980> way<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.250> can<00:03:11.430> leave<00:03:11.580> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
you do it this way you can leave the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.780 
you do it this way you can leave the
exhaust<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.540> do<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.520> driver's<00:03:14.520> side

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
exhaust on and do the driver's side

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.660 
exhaust on and do the driver's side
sorry<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.660> passenger<00:03:16.110> side<00:03:16.260> axle<00:03:16.769> with<00:03:17.519> the

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
sorry the passenger side axle with the

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.300 
sorry the passenger side axle with the
exhaust<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.180> place<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:19.200> driver's<00:03:19.799> side<00:03:19.980> it's

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
exhaust in place the driver's side it's

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.190 
exhaust in place the driver's side it's
actually<00:03:20.610> much<00:03:20.790> easier<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.450> access<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.049> roll

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
actually much easier to access the roll

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.420 
actually much easier to access the roll
pin<00:03:22.440> from<00:03:22.620> underneath<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.280> car<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:25.280> now<00:03:26.280> that

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
pin from underneath the car so now that

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.410 
pin from underneath the car so now that
I<00:03:26.459> see<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.880> straight<00:03:27.060> up<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.269> down<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
I see this is straight up and down I

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.860 
I see this is straight up and down I
don't<00:03:27.630> have<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.049> move<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.440> wheel<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.690> next

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
don't have to move the wheel so the next

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.070 
don't have to move the wheel so the next
thing<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.140> do<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:33.090> actually<00:03:33.360> get<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.930> wheel

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
thing to do is to actually get the wheel

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.710 
thing to do is to actually get the wheel
off<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.530> car<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.090> has<00:03:39.209> actually<00:03:39.330> gotten

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
off the car so this has actually gotten

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.300 
off the car so this has actually gotten
pretty<00:03:39.900> bad<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:40.260> can<00:03:40.380> see<00:03:40.530> axle<00:03:40.890> grease<00:03:41.100> kind

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
pretty bad you can see axle grease kind

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.039 
pretty bad you can see axle grease kind
of<00:03:41.370> all<00:03:41.489> over<00:03:41.700> everything<00:03:41.940> in<00:03:42.120> here<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:42.570> what

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
of all over everything in here so what

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.120 
of all over everything in here so what
I'm<00:03:43.110> gonna<00:03:43.230> do<00:03:43.380> right<00:03:43.500> now<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.739> going<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:43.920> clean

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
I'm gonna do right now is going to clean

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
this up a little bit with some degreaser

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.780 
this up a little bit with some degreaser
on<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.989> toothbrush<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.070> can<00:03:47.220> make<00:03:47.340> some<00:03:47.370> paint

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
on a toothbrush so I can make some paint

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.759 
on a toothbrush so I can make some paint
marks<00:03:48.090> now<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.450> top<00:03:48.690> bolt<00:03:51.530> now<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.680> I've

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
marks now this top bolt now that I've

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.160 
marks now this top bolt now that I've
got<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.160> grease<00:03:54.030> cleaned<00:03:54.360> off<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.870> can<00:03:54.989> see<00:03:55.140> I

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
got the grease cleaned off you can see I

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.990 
got the grease cleaned off you can see I
made<00:03:55.290> some<00:03:55.500> paint<00:03:55.709> marks<00:03:55.980> there<00:03:56.190> make<00:03:56.790> three

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
made some paint marks there make three

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.259 
made some paint marks there make three
marks<00:03:57.239> on<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.420> top<00:03:57.570> one<00:03:58.790> with<00:03:59.790> three<00:04:00.060> there

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
marks on the top one with three there

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.360 
marks on the top one with three there
that'll<00:04:00.690> be<00:04:00.840> pretty<00:04:01.230> easy<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.799> align<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.220> back

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
that'll be pretty easy to align it back

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.340 
that'll be pretty easy to align it back
to<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.549> way<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.730> was<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.180> one<00:04:03.989> on<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.200> bottom

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
to the way it was and one on the bottom

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.690 
to the way it was and one on the bottom
even<00:04:04.590> though<00:04:04.799> I'm<00:04:04.920> pretty<00:04:05.130> sure<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.459> bottom

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
even though I'm pretty sure the bottom

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.550 
even though I'm pretty sure the bottom
one<00:04:05.820> is<00:04:05.910> not<00:04:06.209> an<00:04:06.420> eccentric<00:04:06.900> bolt<00:04:07.110> but<00:04:07.410> better

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
one is not an eccentric bolt but better

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.479 
one is not an eccentric bolt but better
safe<00:04:07.799> than<00:04:07.950> sorry

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
safe than sorry

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.880 
safe than sorry
so<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:09.600> is<00:04:09.720> 19<00:04:10.140> millimeters<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.709> I'm<00:04:10.769> going

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
so this is 19 millimeters so I'm going

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.960 
so this is 19 millimeters so I'm going
to<00:04:10.950> get<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:13.079> wrench<00:04:13.650> on<00:04:13.829> here<00:04:14.190> an<00:04:14.549> open-ended

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
to get a a wrench on here an open-ended

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.759 
to get a a wrench on here an open-ended
wrench<00:04:15.150> on<00:04:15.269> here<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.540> counter<00:04:15.840> hold<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.229> then

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
wrench on here to counter hold and then

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.310 
wrench on here to counter hold and then
I'm<00:04:16.829> gonna<00:04:16.950> use<00:04:17.130> my<00:04:17.690> breaker<00:04:18.690> bar<00:04:18.959> with

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
I'm gonna use my breaker bar with

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.670 
I'm gonna use my breaker bar with
nineteen<00:04:20.100> millimeter<00:04:21.080> deep<00:04:22.080> socket<00:04:22.500> on<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
nineteen millimeter deep socket on the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.090 
nineteen millimeter deep socket on the
other<00:04:22.800> side

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.370 

okay<00:04:26.100> those<00:04:26.250> two<00:04:26.430> bolts<00:04:26.610> are<00:04:26.820> out<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.360> now<00:04:28.260> you

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
okay those two bolts are out so now you

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.680 
okay those two bolts are out so now you
can<00:04:28.530> pivot<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.430> axle<00:04:30.090> out<00:04:30.150> here<00:04:30.390> for<00:04:30.540> more

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
can pivot the axle out here for more

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.730 
can pivot the axle out here for more
room<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.280> remove<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.430> axle<00:04:32.730> nut<00:04:36.470> after<00:04:37.470> you

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
room and remove the axle nut after you

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.320 
room and remove the axle nut after you
have<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.010> axle<00:04:38.400> nut<00:04:38.520> off<00:04:38.700> and<00:04:38.970> pretty<00:04:39.210> much

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
have the axle nut off and pretty much

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.110 
have the axle nut off and pretty much
everything<00:04:39.600> else<00:04:39.690> taken<00:04:40.020> care<00:04:40.200> of<00:04:40.230> on<00:04:41.190> the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
everything else taken care of on the

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.120 
everything else taken care of on the
wheel<00:04:42.270> side<00:04:42.540> you're<00:04:42.900> going<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.050> want<00:04:43.230> to<00:04:43.320> knock

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
wheel side you're going to want to knock

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.190 
wheel side you're going to want to knock
out<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.400> roll<00:04:44.760> pin<00:04:45.030> which<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.750> pointed<00:04:46.140> out

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
out that roll pin which I pointed out

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.510 
out that roll pin which I pointed out
before<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.680> I'm<00:04:46.800> having<00:04:47.040> trouble<00:04:47.190> focusing

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
before and I'm having trouble focusing

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.370 
before and I'm having trouble focusing
on<00:04:47.820> right<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.240> second<00:04:49.070> sitting<00:04:50.070> in<00:04:50.190> there

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
on right this second sitting in there

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.640 
on right this second sitting in there
yeah

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
yeah

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.280 
yeah
so<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:54.150> basically<00:04:54.480> need<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.810> get<00:04:54.960> a<00:04:54.990> hammer

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
so you basically need to get a hammer

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.870 
so you basically need to get a hammer
and<00:04:55.530> punch<00:04:55.710> on<00:04:55.980> there<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.250> just<00:04:56.310> drive<00:04:56.640> that

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
and punch on there and just drive that

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.580 
and punch on there and just drive that
out<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.450> find<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.110> easiest<00:04:58.260> way<00:04:58.500> to

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
out and I find that the easiest way to

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.620 
out and I find that the easiest way to
do<00:04:58.800> that<00:04:58.830> is<00:04:59.490> actually<00:04:59.790> to<00:05:00.210> do<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.390> from<00:05:00.480> the

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
do that is actually to do it from the

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.070 
do that is actually to do it from the
top<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.550> take<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.700> air<00:05:02.850> intake<00:05:03.419> hose<00:05:03.660> off<00:05:03.900> the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
top and take the air intake hose off the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.570 
top and take the air intake hose off the
car<00:05:04.290> which<00:05:04.470> is<00:05:04.590> easy<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:05.010> do<00:05:05.160> so<00:05:05.340> I'm<00:05:05.400> going<00:05:05.490> to

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
car which is easy to do so I'm going to

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.700 
car which is easy to do so I'm going to
do<00:05:05.640> that<00:05:05.820> right<00:05:05.940> now<00:05:06.150> knock<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.140> pin<00:05:07.290> out<00:05:07.470> and

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
do that right now knock the pin out and

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.920 
do that right now knock the pin out and
hopefully<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.310> axle<00:05:08.700> will<00:05:08.910> come<00:05:09.180> out<00:05:09.300> easy

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.930 

okay<00:05:12.960> well<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.830> old<00:05:14.010> axle<00:05:14.400> is<00:05:14.490> out<00:05:14.610> of<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:14.790> car

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
okay well the old axle is out of the car

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.240 
okay well the old axle is out of the car
and<00:05:15.240> you<00:05:15.900> can<00:05:15.990> see<00:05:16.140> that's<00:05:16.230> in<00:05:16.470> really<00:05:16.770> bad
