00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.259
 see or better feel the amazing 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.450
 transformation that has undergone music 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.769
 in one of the most videogame sagas 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.840
 ever famous 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.849
 the legend of zelda but not to bore you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.920
 too we start immediately from an example one 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.600
 of the pieces one of the famous melodies 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.060
 more historical than the whole series 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.980
 it is without a doubt the theme of the over 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.990
 ward the one you are about to listen to is the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.990
 first version of this theme 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.340
 while the one you are about to hear 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.350
 now it's the latest rule version 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.490
 that strata on the occasion of the 25th 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.490
 anniversary of the series 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.760
 I would say one leg the change there 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.130
 believe it or not the composer is always 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.050
 was the same koji kondo that 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.390
 composer who practically gave 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.200
 life to many of the most famous music of 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.970
 home nintendo 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.950
 the great skill of this artist 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.380
 his own is out of the ordinary 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.450
 extraordinary ability to transform 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.910
 in less than 30 years it has passed since 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.100
 compose for a few and rudimentary 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.100
 pixellosis digital tools ad 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.660
 a supersonic symphony orchestra 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.280
 but not just the use it makes of it 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.470
 of the orchestra is not exclusively 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.810
 that of adding more and more sounds 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.509
 all together to give more and more 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.490
 epic is more and more grandiosity and sound 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.560
 and make a melody that maybe not 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.300
 has nothing in particular 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.850
 anyway something crazy 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.740
 he took the old 8 bit themes that 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.710
 He had composed himself and has them 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.570
 used as a starting point 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.119
 transforming them by turning them upside down 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.740
 there to make us feel all the possible 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.240
 imaginable variations that can be made 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.800
 do on that topic that already in itself 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.810
 very nice makes another example 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.819
 let's think about the topic we hear every now and then 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.990
 in the series when we approach one 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.990

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.490

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.530
 mainly two art these two harps 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.960
 they practically exchange a melody 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.030
 that at some point this is intertwined 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.120
 effect makes both water very well 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.720
 of the fountain that the magical element given 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.720
 from the fairies 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.090
