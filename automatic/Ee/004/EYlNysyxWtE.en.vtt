and it is the most phenomenal way of

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.599 
and it is the most phenomenal way of
doing<00:03:44.989> it<00:03:45.109> even<00:03:45.560> if<00:03:45.829> I'm<00:03:46.010> doing<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.310> t-zone

nothing moves this application will

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.909 
nothing moves this application will

really really beautifully and and I mean

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.690 
really really beautifully and and I mean
it<00:05:11.330> really<00:05:11.690> does<00:05:11.990> what<00:05:12.260> beautifully<00:05:12.680> it<00:05:13.370> can

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
it really does what beautifully it can

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.000

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
give it an a stone so I would really

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.010 
give it an a stone so I would really
recommend<00:05:48.410> it<00:05:48.800> against<00:05:49.310> these<00:05:49.840> unless<00:05:50.840> you
