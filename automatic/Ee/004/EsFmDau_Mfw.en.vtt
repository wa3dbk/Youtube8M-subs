00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.639
 of the 3 audi sv the q5 is the 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.889
 preferred and after it are given to 4 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.070
 currently the second most model 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.789
 important audio the q5 came out at 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.940
 market 4 years ago at the end of 2008 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.290
 now audi presents a renewed version 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.600
 new combinations of engines and boxes 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.260
 of changes increase efficiency in a 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.120
 15% plus all engines come from 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.300
 series with a stop system and 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.300
 start 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.790
 the co 5 is offered all over the world in 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.040
 many European markets is the most audio 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.860
 sold also in china and in usa 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.600
 bus 5 is also sold mostly 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.140
 because of its excellent capabilities 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.640
 off-road its distance to the ground is 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.980
 20 centimeters 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.670
 except the 10 the basic all 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.910
 variants come with 4x4 traction according to 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.000
 The Audi engine offers 2 gearboxes 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:14.790
 a 6-speed manual and an automatic 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.790
 of 7 or 8 speeds of your choice 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.200
 cosmetic changes are moderate the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.750
 grill now has a hexagonal shape 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.750
 like all the new audio models 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.930
 also the headlights were redesigned in 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.300
 optional on-day test on daylight 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.680
 comes integrated in the form of a line 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.680
 around the lighthouse 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.310
 the coupe- type roof is characteristic of 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.680
 the 3 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.030
 audi sv and highlight the character 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.030
 sports car 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.090
 the line of light from the front 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.700
 We also find again in the part 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.210
 later you can choose between six 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.240
 diesel three engines two gasoline and 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.590
 one hybrid we try the most powerful of 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.080
 gasoline a 3 liter v6 with compressor in 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.530
 comparison with its predecessor despite 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.640
 have 0 2 liters less displacement 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.590
 yields almost the same about 200 kilowatts 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.209
 the torque increased however 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.510
 notably going from 330 to 440 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.940
 newtons zero meter did the q5 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.180
 accelerates now a second faster than 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.070
 its predecessor and that with a consumption of 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.070
 0.8 liters less fuel 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.170
 how the q5 behaves in the city 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.150
 birgit and and he proves it for us 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.510
 we want to know how maneuverable it is with 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.450
 its 4 63 meters long and almost two 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.160
 tons of weight a big help is the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.700
 new electromechanical power steering 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.680
 that adapts to the speed when it 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.020
 move in a straight line do not consume 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.780
 energy which reduces the consumption of 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.350
 fuel in 0.2 liters per 100 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.350
 kilometer 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.120
 and I love how easy it is to handle it 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.430
 also visibility is good that's 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.890
 very important in the city is also 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.659
 I calm what I like a lot is that it has 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.810
 an essential reversing camera 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.329
 just in this big car is 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.750
 drive very comfortably and you have to 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.120
 also highlight the environmental protection 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.260
 At the traffic light the engine shuts down and one 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.620
 it does not notice it 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.260
 in synthesis very nice 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.319
 I am pleasantly surprised avast 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.680
 also in the interior the changes are 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.849
 minimal thin chrome surrounds 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.849
 now the instruments 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.390
 the cabin has abundant applications 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.530
 in wood, you can choose between three 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.530
 different designs 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.830
 audi also improved the module 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.560
 navigation that now has a guide 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.040
 new voice is also a radio receiver 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.040
 digital 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.760
 The audi drive select system allows 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.200
 choose between four driving modes 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.870
 one of them can be programmed 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.910
 freely the differences are found 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.610
 fundamentally in the characteristics 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.080
 of the acceleration and the point of entry 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.080
 of automatic gears 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.430
 a sense of luxury provides the 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.830
 leather seats and cup holders that 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.729
 keep the liquid cool or hot to 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.219
 choice 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.669
 a pause recommendation device 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:54.680
 comes as an optional series but very useful in 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.589
 the city is the radar system 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.330
 adaptive cruise control that regulates 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.819
 distance with respect to the car that goes 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.470
 go ahead and avoid crashes at speeds 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:09.340
 under 30 kilometers per hour 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:12.160
 and the demand for compact sv increases without 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.740
 cease with your q5 audi plays a role 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.500
 decisive in the premium segment is 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.260
 very successful model for that little 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.330
 has changed in the new version the q5 is 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.400
 behaves like the previous one and it's fine 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.410
 that is so it is very maneuverable and 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.730
 harmonious but also sporty though 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.730
 without reaching the foolishness
