00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.449

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.610

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.450
 Divided event café manager of us

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.440
 That was the man who is everything 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.730
 internal ends would have been around the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.840
 otherwise for the so for the for the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.730
 normal mortals not in this 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.379
 area are allowed if you continue like this 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.620
 Look at her all the time 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.940
 editors on readmore tracks like 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.860
 the whole page he has me a few 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.649
 names because not all there is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.840
 at sprouts, porz makers like 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.489
 Forster was not to forget too much 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.110

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.510

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.470
 you find the meanwhile father like that 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.380
 maybe then come one more 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.020
 few others just by chance and over 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.610
 add up then but still locally 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.409
 registered not what is so 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.939
 offered to an editor here on site 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.110
 yes, of course, the whole 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.030
 battery already presented 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.880
 very popular with our editorial staff 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.439
 again and again the monument already 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.360
 presented coffee and maybe but 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.090
 also normal drinks not coffee 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.070
 in terms of content we also have the cookies 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.979
 as a dictatorship game is built that 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.020
 you do not just stop playing carla and eleven 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.320
 Who's the last kick is the people 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.070
 here 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.259
 there are mainly all settled 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.310
 evans dogs from so you have to yes 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.390
 ghost on next bavarian but 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.979
 exhausting weekend another 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.810
 we also ask a little bit for the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.159
 coffee machine 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.159
 that would have been there, it's normal too 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.520
 is normal for me when I go hungry 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.520
 they go again 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.939
 That's an important question we have 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.640
 here always catering from the esl what 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.129
 by the way, it is topical and the little one 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.890
 smirk of cannibals 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:18.090
 By the way, completely positive is meant 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.260
 also quite a long time doing the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.489
 The sausages are always the same 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:29.970
 for ten years last year right 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:33.090
 is right a real meal so ours 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.170
 andres you know what i mean here 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.450
 maybe not right now 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.060
 spectators very good food and also the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.629
 Incidentally, coffee is premium quality 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.220
 military 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.310
 seriously milliliter but that 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.080
 not so bad or coffee stain ok 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.160
 I have to say I hate I hate 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.050
 Christmas still a bit of advertising 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.300
 for tenants but I had kafka 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.410
 think high 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.660
 but somehow I do not like it 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.660
 why the café the tagwerk two players 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.080

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:05.159
 By the way, in 1722 the show 25 and me 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.560

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.730
 is you are here every three days 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.319
 really understandable in any case okay 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.400
 today he hardly has that bacon 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.659
 only no colleagues go without that 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.830
 we were there a fourth game was the 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.760
 maintenance for these fans if that is the case 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.040
 the best case is everything 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.860

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.799
