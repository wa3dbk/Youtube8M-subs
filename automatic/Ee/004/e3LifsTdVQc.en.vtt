is<00:05:07.270> very<00:05:07.510> similar<00:05:07.750> to<00:05:07.960> what<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.290> iphone<00:05:08.710> 3gs

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
is very similar to what the iphone 3gs

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.820 
is very similar to what the iphone 3gs
got<00:05:09.790> included<00:05:10.510> with<00:05:10.630> it<00:05:10.660> so<00:05:11.560> now<00:05:11.650> your

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
got included with it so now your

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.650 
got included with it so now your
applications<00:05:12.520> will<00:05:12.700> load<00:05:12.850> faster<00:05:13.360> and

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
applications will load faster and

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.510 
applications will load faster and
internet<00:05:14.530> speeds<00:05:14.800> are<00:05:14.890> going<00:05:15.010> to<00:05:15.070> be<00:05:15.130> faster

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
internet speeds are going to be faster

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.980 
internet speeds are going to be faster
does<00:05:15.669> faster<00:05:16.030> performance<00:05:16.180> overall<00:05:16.780> it'll

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
does faster performance overall it'll

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.690 
does faster performance overall it'll
turn<00:05:17.140> on<00:05:17.290> fast<00:05:17.590> or<00:05:17.800> so<00:05:17.979> it's<00:05:18.310> going<00:05:18.430> to<00:05:18.580> be<00:05:18.669> a

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
turn on fast or so it's going to be a

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.690 
turn on fast or so it's going to be a
faster<00:05:19.180> device<00:05:19.740> that's<00:05:20.740> kind<00:05:21.310> of<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.580> nice

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
faster device that's kind of a nice

get the cameras fixed that might be

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.690 
get the cameras fixed that might be
completely<00:06:11.200> bullcrap<00:06:11.470> I<00:06:11.710> don't<00:06:11.979> know<00:06:12.130> I'm<00:06:12.430> not

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
completely bullcrap I don't know I'm not

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.640 
completely bullcrap I don't know I'm not
confirming<00:06:13.060> that<00:06:13.360> but<00:06:14.020> that<00:06:14.260> would<00:06:14.410> be<00:06:14.500> nice

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
confirming that but that would be nice

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.810 
confirming that but that would be nice
if<00:06:14.890> it<00:06:14.979> actually<00:06:15.130> made<00:06:15.370> a<00:06:15.400> third<00:06:15.669> generation

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
if it actually made a third generation

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.850 
if it actually made a third generation
ipod<00:06:16.419> touch<00:06:16.450> instead<00:06:16.990> of<00:06:17.110> just<00:06:17.289> making<00:06:17.530> an

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
ipod touch instead of just making an
