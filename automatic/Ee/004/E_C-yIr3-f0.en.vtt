00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:11.120
 I am Vladimir I am 22 years old and what I 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.119
 I have is a congenital amputation of 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.400
 some fingers of the hand together with the 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.970
 lack of one or another arm muscle 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.280
 prostheses that parts of hand does not 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.860
 they were compatible with my amputation according to 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.680
 I had understood then try 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.720
 do something like that outside I do not know a 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.010
 pirate's hook that will help me 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.370
 feel a little more comfortable with me 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.660
 same my dream would be to improve it I think 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.660
 that anything can be improved 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.859
 or the two versions 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.859
 d 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.290
 the designer of this hand communicated to 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.720
 us and wanted to deliver it then we did 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.280
 is like this crossing so that finally 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.830
 can deliver first of a prosthesis 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.480
 3 that will be used here in chile is 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.610
 what we are looking for with this is that 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.130
 the bird does not have more functionality to 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.990
 level here are manuals and manual 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.850
 of a and thick manuals like saying 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.550
 live this glass grade as louisiana's 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.830
 the table do things like in the day to day 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.780
 than the previous prostheses that he 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.090
 has made or with such a hand 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.510
 which in computing with Latin people does not 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.510
 can play 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.930
 it's like I won the Chinese because 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.320
 Like a Chilean who lives in another 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.549
 country that the US has contact with can 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.040
 have contact in any country of the 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.899
 world first chooses chile second of 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.780
 the 18 million people that we are 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.190
 choose as the telethon with institute and 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.659
 after the telethon of all the 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.509
 patients choose the same conditions as 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.220
 already as several draws of which it was 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.460
 as beneficiaries 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.560
 this gift this innovation opens us a 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.660
 door to us because probably 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.890
 many of our young children are 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.390
 thinking the same 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.820
 therefore telethon is opening a 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.650
 first road for 3d printing that 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.730
 allows us to do this and we're going to 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.370
 be able to do during your growth 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.040
 then children who had nothing to 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.960
 catch but they were adapted today 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.330
 they will have this option if they want it if 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.250
 they do not want it too, it 's fine but 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.790
 telethon he will not be able to have here in 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.790
 your house
