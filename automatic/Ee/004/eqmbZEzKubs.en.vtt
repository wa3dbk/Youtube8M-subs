00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
have you ever thought about building

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.070 
have you ever thought about building
your<00:00:01.740> own<00:00:01.860> pc<00:00:02.399> if<00:00:02.879> you<00:00:03.060> have<00:00:03.330> you<00:00:03.780> can<00:00:03.929> use<00:00:04.049> a

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
your own pc if you have you can use a

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.809 
your own pc if you have you can use a
screwdriver<00:00:04.410> then<00:00:05.220> all<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:05.520> need<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.759> a

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
screwdriver then all you need is a

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.940 
screwdriver then all you need is a
little<00:00:05.910> know-how<00:00:06.210> now<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.899> first<00:00:07.200> bit<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.740> can

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
little know-how now the first bit I can

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.860 
little know-how now the first bit I can
definitely<00:00:08.460> do<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.700> second<00:00:09.179> well<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.630> is

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
definitely do the second well that is

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.230 
definitely do the second well that is
what<00:00:10.050> I'm<00:00:10.230> here<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.469> find<00:00:10.620> out<00:00:10.980> stay<00:00:11.730> tuned<00:00:12.059> and

we'll take you through all the steps to
make<00:00:14.130> your<00:00:14.309> own<00:00:14.460> custom<00:00:15.000> pc<00:00:15.360> well<00:00:15.809> I've<00:00:15.960> never

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
make your own custom pc well I've never

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.590 
make your own custom pc well I've never
built<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.859> pc<00:00:17.070> before<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.670> I'm<00:00:17.789> pretty<00:00:18.210> excited

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
built a pc before so I'm pretty excited

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.830 
built a pc before so I'm pretty excited
so<00:00:19.410> let's<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.830> with<00:00:19.859> it

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.040 

I<00:00:25.930> am<00:00:26.680> totally<00:00:27.430> into<00:00:27.700> this<00:00:27.790> whole<00:00:28.000> pc<00:00:28.510> DIY

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
I am totally into this whole pc DIY

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.560 
I am totally into this whole pc DIY
thing<00:00:29.080> we've<00:00:29.500> got<00:00:29.530> going<00:00:29.740> on<00:00:30.070> but<00:00:30.520> so<00:00:30.790> far<00:00:31.119> this

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
thing we've got going on but so far this

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.380 
thing we've got going on but so far this
doesn't<00:00:31.900> really<00:00:32.169> look<00:00:32.439> much<00:00:32.500> like<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.160> PC<00:00:33.700> well

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
doesn't really look much like a PC well

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.120 
doesn't really look much like a PC well
once<00:00:34.870> we<00:00:35.020> put<00:00:35.170> it<00:00:35.230> in<00:00:35.320> a<00:00:35.380> case<00:00:35.620> hopefully

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
once we put it in a case hopefully

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.680 
once we put it in a case hopefully
things<00:00:36.460> will<00:00:36.640> start<00:00:36.910> to<00:00:37.030> look<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.390> little<00:00:37.540> more

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
things will start to look a little more

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.170 
things will start to look a little more
familiar<00:00:37.989> so<00:00:38.830> just<00:00:39.070> a<00:00:39.160> recap<00:00:39.309> in<00:00:39.700> our<00:00:39.850> first

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
familiar so just a recap in our first

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.060 
familiar so just a recap in our first
part<00:00:40.420> we<00:00:40.840> picked<00:00:41.170> our<00:00:41.320> components<00:00:41.890> and

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
part we picked our components and

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.590 
part we picked our components and
installed<00:00:42.460> them<00:00:42.580> in<00:00:42.670> our<00:00:42.790> chosen<00:00:42.970> motherboard

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
installed them in our chosen motherboard

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.630 
installed them in our chosen motherboard
now<00:00:44.110> that's<00:00:44.350> done<00:00:44.559> we<00:00:44.800> need<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:44.949> case<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:45.400> put<00:00:45.550> it

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
now that's done we need a case to put it

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.600 
now that's done we need a case to put it
in<00:00:45.760> so<00:00:46.330> will<00:00:46.510> any<00:00:46.629> case<00:00:46.930> do<00:00:47.260> pretty<00:00:47.680> much<00:00:47.890> they

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
in so will any case do pretty much they

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.610 
in so will any case do pretty much they
all<00:00:48.760> use<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:48.940> system<00:00:49.210> called<00:00:49.420> ATX<00:00:50.080> which<00:00:50.440> is<00:00:50.590> a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
all use a system called ATX which is a

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.410 
all use a system called ATX which is a
universal<00:00:51.250> standard<00:00:51.670> so<00:00:51.879> everything<00:00:52.300> will

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
universal standard so everything will

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.240 
universal standard so everything will
fit<00:00:52.570> together<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:53.559> only<00:00:53.830> thing<00:00:54.010> you<00:00:54.070> need<00:00:54.190> to

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
fit together the only thing you need to

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.250 
fit together the only thing you need to
look<00:00:54.400> out<00:00:54.520> for<00:00:54.580> is<00:00:54.910> micro<00:00:55.390> ATX<00:00:55.510> which<00:00:56.080> is<00:00:56.230> a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
look out for is micro ATX which is a

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.590 
look out for is micro ATX which is a
smaller<00:00:56.590> form<00:00:56.920> factor<00:00:56.980> you<00:00:57.940> can<00:00:58.059> put<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.239> micro

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
smaller form factor you can put a micro

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.990 
smaller form factor you can put a micro
ATX<00:00:58.690> board<00:00:59.230> in<00:00:59.440> an<00:00:59.559> ATX<00:00:59.950> case<00:01:00.190> but<00:01:00.700> not<00:01:00.880> the

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
ATX board in an ATX case but not the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.130 
ATX board in an ATX case but not the
other<00:01:01.090> way<00:01:01.210> around<00:01:01.239> there's<00:01:01.809> just<00:01:01.899> not<00:01:02.079> enough

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
other way around there's just not enough

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.620 
other way around there's just not enough
room<00:01:02.380> so<00:01:03.130> how<00:01:03.489> about<00:01:03.610> this<00:01:03.880> case<00:01:04.210> that<00:01:04.420> i<00:01:04.570> have

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
room so how about this case that i have

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.730 
room so how about this case that i have
here<00:01:06.210> yeah<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:08.560> works<00:01:09.330> excellent<00:01:10.330> so<00:01:10.740> what

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
here yeah that works excellent so what

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.090 
here yeah that works excellent so what
next<00:01:12.930> every<00:01:13.930> motherboard<00:01:14.320> has<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.560> different

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
next every motherboard has a different

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.889 
next every motherboard has a different
arrangement<00:01:15.250> of<00:01:15.610> ports<00:01:15.970> so<00:01:16.420> it<00:01:16.509> comes<00:01:16.660> with<00:01:16.840> a

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
arrangement of ports so it comes with a

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.800 
arrangement of ports so it comes with a
panel<00:01:17.380> like<00:01:17.530> this<00:01:17.770> called<00:01:18.670> an<00:01:18.729> i/o<00:01:18.880> shield<00:01:19.000> so

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
panel like this called an i/o shield so

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.749 
panel like this called an i/o shield so
it<00:01:19.869> can<00:01:19.990> work<00:01:20.170> with<00:01:20.410> your<00:01:20.500> specific<00:01:21.009> case<00:01:21.190> it's

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
it can work with your specific case it's

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.730 
it can work with your specific case it's
the<00:01:21.880> first<00:01:22.180> thing<00:01:22.300> is<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:22.840> click<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.380> into<00:01:23.649> the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
the first thing is to click it into the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.139 
the first thing is to click it into the
empty<00:01:24.070> space<00:01:24.310> at<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.670> rear<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.000> chassis

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
empty space at the rear of the chassis

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.420 
empty space at the rear of the chassis
so<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.050> better<00:01:26.320> do<00:01:26.530> this<00:01:26.740> just<00:01:27.009> in<00:01:27.130> case<00:01:27.280> you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
so I better do this just in case you

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.279 
so I better do this just in case you
break<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.700> nail<00:01:28.000> mm-hmm<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:33.520> right<00:01:33.670> that's<00:01:34.000> in

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
break a nail mm-hmm all right that's in

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.660 
break a nail mm-hmm all right that's in
okay<00:01:35.289> well<00:01:35.920> next<00:01:36.130> we<00:01:36.340> need<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.490> make<00:01:36.640> sure

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
okay well next we need to make sure

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.580 
okay well next we need to make sure
there's<00:01:37.119> a<00:01:37.179> gap<00:01:37.450> underneath<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:38.170> motherboard

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
there's a gap underneath the motherboard

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.380 
there's a gap underneath the motherboard
so<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:38.860> can't<00:01:39.130> all<00:01:39.369> circle<00:01:39.789> against<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.179> case

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
so it can't all circle against the case

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.719 
so it can't all circle against the case
you'll<00:01:41.080> either<00:01:41.229> find<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.619> pack<00:01:41.800> of<00:01:41.979> brass<00:01:42.190> rises

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
you'll either find a pack of brass rises

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.550 
you'll either find a pack of brass rises
in<00:01:42.849> the<00:01:42.910> box<00:01:43.090> with<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.300> case<00:01:43.539> or<00:01:43.780> some<00:01:44.380> have

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
in the box with the case or some have

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.440 
in the box with the case or some have
them<00:01:44.709> already<00:01:44.950> laid<00:01:45.220> out<00:01:45.399> for<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.849> in<00:01:46.030> our

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
them already laid out for you in our

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.389 
them already laid out for you in our

case we need to install these ourselves
lining<00:01:49.300> them<00:01:49.420> up<00:01:49.509> with<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.990> holes<00:01:50.200> on<00:01:50.530> the

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
lining them up with the holes on the

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.380 
lining them up with the holes on the
motherboard<00:01:50.830> you<00:01:51.640> need<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:51.880> make<00:01:52.000> sure<00:01:52.179> these

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
motherboard you need to make sure these

motherboard you need to make sure these
are<00:01:52.599> tight<00:01:52.840> our<00:01:53.380> case<00:01:53.740> came<00:01:54.009> with<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.190> special

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
are tight our case came with a special

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.980 
are tight our case came with a special
tool<00:01:54.789> for<00:01:54.970> doing<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.300> but<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:55.750> can<00:01:55.780> always

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
tool for doing this but you can always

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.940 
tool for doing this but you can always
use<00:01:56.110> a<00:01:56.259> pair<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.530> pliers<00:01:58.530> right<00:01:59.530> that<00:01:59.830> all

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
use a pair of pliers right that all

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.040 
use a pair of pliers right that all
looks<00:02:00.190> pretty<00:02:00.490> good<00:02:00.700> so<00:02:01.030> can<00:02:01.509> I<00:02:01.599> now<00:02:01.720> put<00:02:01.929> in

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
looks pretty good so can I now put in

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.139 
looks pretty good so can I now put in
the<00:02:02.140> motherboard<00:02:02.560> yes<00:02:02.979> indeed<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.670> important

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
the motherboard yes indeed the important

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.609 
the motherboard yes indeed the important
thing<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:04.300> remember<00:02:04.390> though<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.200> make<00:02:05.470> sure

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
thing to remember though is to make sure

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.499 
thing to remember though is to make sure
you<00:02:05.709> don't<00:02:05.950> scratch<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.310> motherboard<00:02:06.819> on<00:02:07.030> the

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
you don't scratch the motherboard on the

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.240 
you don't scratch the motherboard on the
brass<00:02:07.690> risers<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.349> come<00:02:08.800> in<00:02:08.920> at<00:02:09.009> an<00:02:09.069> angle

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
brass risers so come in at an angle

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.460 
brass risers so come in at an angle
aiming<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.119> ports<00:02:10.450> towards<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.200> i/o<00:02:11.380> shield

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.160 
aiming the ports towards the i/o shield
when<00:02:12.310> they're<00:02:12.550> in<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.790> right<00:02:12.910> place<00:02:13.180> slowly

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
when they're in the right place slowly

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.110 
when they're in the right place slowly
lower<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.500> motherboard<00:02:14.950> onto<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.550> risers

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.330 

now<00:02:19.120> use<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.720> round<00:02:20.050> head<00:02:20.319> screws<00:02:20.680> with<00:02:21.190> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
now use the round head screws with the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.520 
now use the round head screws with the
fine<00:02:21.640> thread<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.599> attach<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:23.050> motherboard<00:02:23.410> to

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
fine thread to attach the motherboard to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.800 
fine thread to attach the motherboard to
the<00:02:23.620> case<00:02:23.830> it's<00:02:24.489> best<00:02:24.730> only<00:02:25.120> loosely<00:02:25.480> tighten

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
the case it's best only loosely tighten

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.420 
the case it's best only loosely tighten
these<00:02:26.050> until<00:02:26.500> you've<00:02:26.620> got<00:02:26.650> all<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.040> screws<00:02:27.250> in

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
these until you've got all the screws in

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.309 
these until you've got all the screws in
place<00:02:27.459> before<00:02:28.209> going<00:02:28.599> round<00:02:28.840> for<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.110> final

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
place before going round for a final

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.710 
place before going round for a final
time<00:02:29.470> well<00:02:30.280> I'd<00:02:30.430> say<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:31.090> looking<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.599> lot

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
time well I'd say it's looking a lot

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.480 
time well I'd say it's looking a lot
more<00:02:31.780> like<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.170> pc<00:02:32.680> now<00:02:32.890> so

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
more like a pc now so

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.980 
more like a pc now so
what<00:02:33.580> does<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.850> need<00:02:33.880> net<00:02:34.270> well<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:34.840> gonna

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
what does it need net well it's gonna

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.690 
what does it need net well it's gonna
need<00:02:35.200> some<00:02:35.350> power<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.280> power<00:02:36.460> supply

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
need some power and the power supply

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:45.000 
need some power and the power supply
slides<00:02:37.630> in<00:02:37.840> here<00:02:43.350> then<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.440> need<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.680> screw

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
slides in here then you need to screw

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.860 
slides in here then you need to screw
this<00:02:45.130> into<00:02:45.310> place<00:02:47.340> right<00:02:48.340> got<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.510> I'm

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
this into place right got it so I'm

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.390 
this into place right got it so I'm
guessing<00:02:50.080> now<00:02:50.440> we<00:02:50.830> have<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.070> wire<00:02:51.250> everything

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
guessing now we have to wire everything

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.520 
guessing now we have to wire everything
up<00:02:51.730> that's<00:02:52.600> correct<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.230> we're<00:02:53.350> going<00:02:53.440> to

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
up that's correct so we're going to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.290 
up that's correct so we're going to
start<00:02:53.560> with<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:53.980> big<00:02:54.220> block<00:02:54.400> here<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.910> this

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
start with this big block here and this

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.520 
start with this big block here and this
smaller<00:02:55.630> one<00:02:55.750> we're<00:02:55.990> going<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.140> connect<00:02:56.410> these

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
smaller one we're going to connect these

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.990 
smaller one we're going to connect these
directly<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.160> motherboard<00:02:57.370> because<00:02:57.850> they

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
directly to the motherboard because they

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.670 
directly to the motherboard because they
supply<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.390> power<00:03:01.470> now<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.530> other

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
supply the power now the other

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.440 
supply the power now the other
connectors<00:03:03.250> are<00:03:03.460> four<00:03:03.580> different<00:03:03.730> components

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
connectors are four different components

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.000 
connectors are four different components
and<00:03:04.600> we'll<00:03:04.780> do<00:03:04.900> these<00:03:05.080> as<00:03:05.320> we<00:03:05.470> come<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.890> them

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
and we'll do these as we come to them

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.430 
and we'll do these as we come to them
and<00:03:06.220> now<00:03:06.910> we<00:03:06.970> come<00:03:07.240> to<00:03:07.300> perhaps<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.900> trickiest

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
and now we come to perhaps the trickiest

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.620 
and now we come to perhaps the trickiest
part<00:03:08.800> well<00:03:09.220> I'd<00:03:09.430> say<00:03:09.700> has<00:03:09.850> been<00:03:10.000> pretty<00:03:10.210> simple

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
part well I'd say has been pretty simple

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.400 
part well I'd say has been pretty simple
so<00:03:10.780> far<00:03:11.020> so<00:03:11.350> hit<00:03:12.100> me<00:03:12.130> well<00:03:12.850> these<00:03:13.360> cables<00:03:13.930> here

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
so far so hit me well these cables here

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.590 
so far so hit me well these cables here

leads with positive and negative markers

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.310 
leads with positive and negative markers
matchup<00:03:24.490> looks<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.270> bit<00:03:25.420> like<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.630> fiddly<00:03:26.080> job<00:03:26.110> I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
matchup looks a bit like a fiddly job I

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.740 
matchup looks a bit like a fiddly job I
mean<00:03:26.590> surely<00:03:27.070> there's<00:03:27.370> some<00:03:27.550> shortcuts<00:03:28.090> well

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
mean surely there's some shortcuts well

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.300 
mean surely there's some shortcuts well
you<00:03:28.990> do<00:03:29.200> need<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.440> keep<00:03:29.620> an<00:03:29.740> eye<00:03:29.830> on<00:03:29.860> what<00:03:30.100> goes

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
you do need to keep an eye on what goes

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.550 
you do need to keep an eye on what goes
where<00:03:30.610> but<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.390> zhuzh<00:03:31.630> board<00:03:31.900> does<00:03:32.290> come

trying<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.530> connect<00:03:38.800> everything<00:03:39.070> up<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.790> just

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
trying to connect everything up you just

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.580 
trying to connect everything up you just
plug<00:03:40.180> them<00:03:40.300> onto<00:03:40.540> here<00:03:40.720> first<00:03:41.050> and<00:03:41.380> then

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
plug them onto here first and then

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.880 
plug them onto here first and then
attach<00:03:41.830> them<00:03:42.010> all<00:03:42.100> in<00:03:42.220> one<00:03:42.370> go<00:03:43.440> okay<00:03:44.440> that's

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
attach them all in one go okay that's

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.800 
attach them all in one go okay that's
also<00:03:45.100> bad<00:03:45.400> anything<00:03:46.120> else<00:03:46.240> to<00:03:46.390> look<00:03:46.480> at<00:03:46.660> both

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
also bad anything else to look at both

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.600 
also bad anything else to look at both
them<00:03:46.960> in<00:03:47.050> here<00:03:47.230> well<00:03:47.740> if<00:03:47.980> there<00:03:48.130> are<00:03:48.190> any<00:03:48.280> USB

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610

then<00:03:51.310> we<00:03:51.430> need<00:03:51.580> to<00:03:51.700> connect<00:03:51.940> those<00:03:52.060> two<00:03:52.090> these

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
then we need to connect those two these

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.600 
then we need to connect those two these
are<00:03:53.050> a<00:03:53.080> small<00:03:53.410> block<00:03:53.680> now<00:03:53.980> there<00:03:54.130> be<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.250> missing

are a small block now there be a missing

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.780 
are a small block now there be a missing
pin<00:03:54.820> so<00:03:55.210> it'll<00:03:55.510> only<00:03:55.570> go<00:03:55.840> on<00:03:55.870> one<00:03:56.110> way<00:03:56.790> okay

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
pin so it'll only go on one way okay

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.950 
pin so it'll only go on one way okay
that's<00:03:58.390> done<00:03:58.630> so<00:03:59.200> what<00:03:59.800> next<00:03:59.980> fans<00:04:00.790> Wow<00:04:01.390> don't
