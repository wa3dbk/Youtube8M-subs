shoe move at all I want that thing

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.090 
shoe move at all I want that thing
locked<00:00:31.940> on<00:00:32.180> my<00:00:32.300> foot<00:00:32.570> and<00:00:33.050> it's<00:00:33.710> got<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:34.010> be

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
locked on my foot and it's got to be

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.090 
locked on my foot and it's got to be
really<00:00:34.430> really<00:00:34.760> super<00:00:34.969> tight<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:35.600> secure<00:00:36.409> so

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
really really super tight and secure so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.380 
really really super tight and secure so
that<00:00:37.429> was<00:00:37.550> one<00:00:37.699> of<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:37.850> first<00:00:37.940> things<00:00:38.239> we<00:00:38.359> did

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
that was one of the first things we did

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.270 
that was one of the first things we did
and<00:00:38.719> then<00:00:38.839> also<00:00:38.989> of<00:00:39.199> course<00:00:39.260> lightweight<00:00:39.859> this

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
and then also of course lightweight this

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.119 
and then also of course lightweight this
is<00:00:40.339> nebs<00:00:41.179> racing<00:00:41.989> flat<00:00:42.289> this<00:00:42.499> is<00:00:42.649> what<00:00:42.800> he<00:00:42.890> uses

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
is nebs racing flat this is what he uses

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.189 
is nebs racing flat this is what he uses
to<00:00:43.280> do<00:00:43.640> a<00:00:43.670> speed<00:00:43.969> working<00:00:44.359> and<00:00:44.539> what<00:00:44.659> he<00:00:44.780> races

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
to do a speed working and what he races

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.279 
to do a speed working and what he races
in<00:00:45.429> this<00:00:46.429> is<00:00:46.609> it<00:00:46.989> compared<00:00:47.989> to<00:00:48.079> our<00:00:48.170> other

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
in this is it compared to our other

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.250 
in this is it compared to our other
shoes<00:00:48.649> it's<00:00:48.920> much<00:00:49.159> firmer<00:00:49.550> this<00:00:50.120> is<00:00:50.269> a<00:00:50.300> 57c

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
shoes it's much firmer this is a 57c

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.919 
shoes it's much firmer this is a 57c
hardness<00:00:52.100> midsole<00:00:52.519> it's<00:00:53.420> quite<00:00:53.659> different

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
hardness midsole it's quite different

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.779 
hardness midsole it's quite different
than<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:54.319> go<00:00:54.589> run<00:00:54.859> and<00:00:55.069> the<00:00:55.129> ultra<00:00:55.519> and<00:00:55.579> some

than the go run and the ultra and some

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.590 
than the go run and the ultra and some
of<00:00:55.879> those<00:00:55.969> others<00:00:56.469> it's<00:00:57.469> a<00:00:58.059> it's<00:00:59.059> pretty<00:00:59.329> stiff

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
of those others it's a it's pretty stiff

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.419 
of those others it's a it's pretty stiff
there's<00:00:59.929> good<00:01:00.109> pop<00:01:00.409> -<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:00.769> is<00:01:00.949> what<00:01:01.159> we<00:01:01.249> hear

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
there's good pop - this is what we hear

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.219 
there's good pop - this is what we hear
from<00:01:01.609> them<00:01:01.819> and<00:01:02.299> also<00:01:02.389> runners<00:01:02.899> it's<00:01:03.079> got<00:01:03.199> a

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
from them and also runners it's got a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.500 
from them and also runners it's got a
real<00:01:03.469> nice<00:01:03.620> pop<00:01:03.949> to<00:01:04.159> this<00:01:04.280> shoe<00:01:04.519> that<00:01:05.150> is<00:01:05.210> it

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
real nice pop to this shoe that is it

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.360 
real nice pop to this shoe that is it
springs<00:01:05.840> back<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.380> just<00:01:06.500> gives<00:01:06.680> nice<00:01:06.860> energy

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
springs back and just gives nice energy

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.930 
springs back and just gives nice energy
return<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:08.630> rather<00:01:08.840> thick<00:01:09.280> we<00:01:10.280> actually

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
return it's rather thick we actually

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.490 
return it's rather thick we actually
felt<00:01:11.420> like<00:01:11.510> going<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.840> little<00:01:11.930> bit<00:01:12.080> lower<00:01:12.260> but

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
felt like going a little bit lower but

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.020 
felt like going a little bit lower but
meb<00:01:12.680> said<00:01:12.890> no<00:01:13.070> we<00:01:13.370> liked<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.670> cushioning<00:01:13.970> to

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
meb said no we liked the cushioning to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.670 
meb said no we liked the cushioning to
where<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:14.360> is<00:01:14.420> it's<00:01:14.720> 14<00:01:15.110> millimeters<00:01:15.590> in<00:01:15.650> the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
where it is it's 14 millimeters in the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.100 
where it is it's 14 millimeters in the
forefoot<00:01:16.190> it's<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:16.940> four<00:01:17.180> millimeter<00:01:17.360> offset

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
forefoot it's a four millimeter offset

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.730 
forefoot it's a four millimeter offset
so<00:01:18.800> 18<00:01:19.250> millimeters<00:01:19.790> in<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.060> deal<00:01:20.740> the

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
so 18 millimeters in the deal the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.650 
so 18 millimeters in the deal the
impulse<00:01:22.100> sensors<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.640> see<00:01:22.850> here<00:01:23.120> are<00:01:23.300> solid

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
impulse sensors you see here are solid

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.660 
impulse sensors you see here are solid
rubber<00:01:23.840> for<00:01:24.230> traction<00:01:24.260> and<00:01:24.860> very<00:01:25.370> lightweight

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
rubber for traction and very lightweight

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.360 
rubber for traction and very lightweight
traction<00:01:26.390> as<00:01:26.510> well<00:01:26.720> we<00:01:27.650> didn't<00:01:27.950> use<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.100> lot<00:01:28.340> of

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
traction as well we didn't use a lot of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.530 
traction as well we didn't use a lot of
rubber<00:01:28.670> because<00:01:28.880> we're<00:01:29.030> trying<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.300> make<00:01:29.420> this

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
rubber because we're trying to make this

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.960 
rubber because we're trying to make this
shoe<00:01:29.720> as<00:01:29.840> light<00:01:30.020> as<00:01:30.140> possible<00:01:30.640> this<00:01:31.640> shoe<00:01:31.820> is

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
shoe as light as possible this shoe is

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.580 
shoe as light as possible this shoe is
six<00:01:32.210> point<00:01:32.450> eight<00:01:32.630> ounces<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:34.360> it's<00:01:35.360> also<00:01:35.960> got

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
six point eight ounces and it's also got

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.280 
six point eight ounces and it's also got
some<00:01:36.620> a<00:01:36.890> nice<00:01:37.100> spine<00:01:37.520> -<00:01:37.760> it's<00:01:37.940> very

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
some a nice spine - it's very

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.020 
some a nice spine - it's very
torsionally<00:01:39.290> stable<00:01:40.250> through<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.640> mid<00:01:40.820> foot

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
torsionally stable through the mid foot

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.530 
torsionally stable through the mid foot
