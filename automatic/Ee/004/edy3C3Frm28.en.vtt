00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 for the livestock sector, let's talk about pasture 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.630
 is one of the main components of cattle production 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.930
 and it was one of the themes developed in the last world congress brangus by 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.380
 an international exhibitor that emerged and oriented on the pasture scenery 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.080
 and rejuvenation of the field his natives himself spoke about the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.080
 main issues that can be applied in the case 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.380
 in the framework of the global bush plan 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.200
 an Argentine professional made a dissertation on the seeding of 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.030
 pastures and the rejuvenation of natural fields for brangus rodeos 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.070
 The professional made a detailed presentation of these systems of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.520
 production based on experiences from specific regions of Argentina 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.820
 Paraguay and Uruguay 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.460
 tÃ©lam the best way to see the power of a race is through the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.290
 food that have their headquarters 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.679
 the ocampo of the argentina paraguay and uruguay 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.079
 percent america in general the pastoral system is based and therefore 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.060
 of forage grain production that indispensable element to do for 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.480
 strengthen the corpse each ration and that's why I think it's very good bullfighting 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.750
 ea has had the postwar period with so little experience p 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.099
 kent that this one had then two years both in the in Argentina in the north 

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.720
 as 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.010
 the paragua and that knows how it does to take better advantage of these 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.300
 soil resources basically the different environments trying to 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.480
 in fact public is a limitation yes against the return to generate the increase 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.530
 of production 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.690
 percent are hearsay testimonies 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.729
 The lecturer afloat environments where production can be improved 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.810
 achieving a transformation of the preexisting situation generating a 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.250
 significant increase in the value of the land by improving its condition 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.720
 the key is the reformulation of the tapestry 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.170
 allowing native and other incorporated species that adapt to the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.220
 soil conditions 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.760
 eye with the spaces that leave the weeds under control 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.329
 now the advantage basically have 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.369
 but a much more sustainable production concept with higher productivity 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:17.360
 according to the negotiator they older than love the lemma steers 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.639
 has more calves 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.379
 he basically is given you have to bet on the investment to the dedication 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.619
 the training 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:25.090
 him but we want him 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.730
 ee livestock as it stands has much more to improve 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.699
 that what then obviously has to travel that road 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:37.519
 explained that there are technological options applicable in different regions such as 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.829
 sown pastures in mountains invaded by weeds 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.479
 systematized and sown malezal 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.929
 natural field rejuvenated through the sowing of native species 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.829
 where production can be increased considerably 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.439
 and improve the conditions there 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.059
 the best use of the soil with valuable species without doubts or 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.149
 what else in the framework of rational grazing 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:05.499
 It sets a sustainable model that far exceeds the current management of 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.009
 these resources 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.079
 every environment 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.140
 badman cultivates different 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.150
 the important beyond the species each place 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.040
 this afternoon discover which environment needs to be improved 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.240
 the productivity 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.860
 of the natural field of that place 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.119
 percent and I put you sectarian colonial company and tanzania 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:29.810
 the infant pastor be with tom of cake issue is not the covenant but 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.919
 how to implant him as santa resisted the production 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.339
 He also talked about a new production model 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.829
 that is being implemented is the combination of agriculture with 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.139
 cattle raising 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.129
 expressed that in various types that only themselves 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.290
 not only can they coexist if what they will allow to express better 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.319
 Potentialities of available resources 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.369
 He said that it is a great alternative and at the same time a challenge for all those who 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:58.369
 are dedicated to developing this technological package 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.010
 in the new gallery comes 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.380
 from the hand of many places where you can 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.769
 comments relationship with agriculture not to generate grain 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.390
 to generate the established pact 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.240
 p to generate crop rotation so that the other is not possible 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.870
 and generate an increase in productivity that we are talking about 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.689
 and have another company that's why 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:20.849
 it's a cover 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.550
 a very big challenge because 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.470
 in general 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.360
 little is being done 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.069
 him but good I'm trying to continue I see him forced and I see the two and that's why 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:30.790
 what are we commenting
