00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.140

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 happy to meet you for a 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.130
 new video sorry guys for the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.809
 club world lately I have 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.730
 not too much the goty I think you 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.309
 can understand it a lot of people 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.500
 also before giving we'll say shhh 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.970
 15 a little bit in the last few weeks 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.230
 even a few months for the most 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.119
 late what is really a pity 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.199
 enjoy your holidays anyway if 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.720
 you may have missed watching 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.699
 videos on fifa know for face the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.650
 resume in many a lot there I 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 do not know what's left of exactly this 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.980
 week that's good I had watched 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.809
 the few days five weeks there 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.200
 analysis before the next shot for the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.510
 date that will come out on September 24th 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.860
 but after that, it's so much 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.469
 widely possible where the fate of the videos 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.270
 of the demo with him access will be a 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.570
 week to advanced videos 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.370
 really also for the civities for 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 to simply chase what will come out 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.660
 before and maybe it's also his 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 pes we will see the game I liked it well I 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.109
 so you would not worry about that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.609
 there I find you for a four laps 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.410
 on xbox that we could see 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.789
 Here it's been that it 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.960
 was proposing a video on xbox we are there 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.460
 why not enough the end of what he has 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.439
 15 I proposed you two tour clubs 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.360
 here are two that would be nice eh for 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.530
 start on xbox and then a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.470
 sequence on pie 4 wallah hop and the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.430
 rap link and then that's it's place 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.250
 on my xbox club is really 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.080
 a lot of players really actually 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.060
 it's the opposite on xbox I rather 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.799
 football players it is then that on 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.689
 identity must emerge all the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.520
 players short I show you you have 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.750
 a little understand and also wanted 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.610
 avoid you talk about guys not welded 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.280
 saw my last video the sergeant a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.229
 hard disk gear of fox heads 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.820
 yotov maybe traffic or not you guys 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.979
 go see the video I 'll put the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.270
 staffing I think to one side you the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.829
 will see it's a shame because 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.110
 that she did that 6000 view now 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.440
 on my channel if it's just that 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.390
 represents for me it's a little bit 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.770
 a normal video we will say on my 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.840
 youtube channel while I would rank 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.670
 rather this video as a video a 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.830
 video of the best on my early channel 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.000
 it's a bit of a pity here I have 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.340
 does a little bit of cooperation 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.120
 abroad of this kind of videos and the 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.560
 most of the time it really does 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.160
 many more views 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.350
 additional 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.970
 that was not the case and it is 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.930
 damage not been seen but you take away 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.040
 that there were really many lay people 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.090
 but that's not the rules at all 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.290
 you managed for their insureds have 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.400
 looked at it but soon the fact that a lot 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.670
 of people did not watch this 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.250
 video 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.540
 but here is a pity basin for 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.130
 seen guys that's expensive one thing it's you 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.740
 not leave for that but there has been 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.490
 a lot of work remains video is 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.630
 really a lot of time spent 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.190
 behind I'm doing editing too 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.540
 to the viken poles etc 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.090
 I spent time is a lot of 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.150
 time and left a little pity 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.320
 but get there like that at least I 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.030
 still a reason it's just that 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.860
 there are lately it's not 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.180
 why I have that I was less but 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.340
 there is a little bit in the harbor bosch 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.990
 to understand him too at that but by 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.340
 this moment because look at it finds 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.630
 do it the video this one she will have to 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.020
 pretty much in view so it's a small 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.580
 little damage 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.380
 in short, you understood what I wanted 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.460
 to say and I was a little disappointed by 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.600
 report to that but I do not blame you 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.800
 for sometimes not looking because 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.090
 that you his game happened what 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.760
 watch this video these are the real ones 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.350
 who is watching the video almost 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.820
 So I not want to make the 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.870
 you guys manage you are at the top 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.760
 in any case it is true that they have the 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.750
 time to look at my two res we're going 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.610
 you really want to take advantage of 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.590
 holiday it's okay going to start 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.390
 to show you the club has gone 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.650
 for which all receive bolton from 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.910
 mines sees it there you will see you 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.830
 already looked at a first time there is 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.180
 not really play that 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.310
 exceptional we all hurt and gendron 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.380
 zola here is the aipac and I have not done 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.150
 a lot of matches with I even know 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.800
 not so sure or that's it 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.790
 quickly the precipice then I got told 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.310
 know that most go to 86.95 good 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.560
 meaning it's from january easter and all 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.390
 the players are almost over 90% 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.860
 it is on these players that I had 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.390
 in the packs here I am not showing everything 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.550
 but frankly that's not it 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.900
 made the first pages that as soon 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.330
 monday handsome player sees himself most 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.430
 it's small players that cost 20 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.390
 25 30 thousand credit for the most part 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.550
 some 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.170
 15 may cry and voice but that's it 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.110
 always nice then we'll see at home 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:56.240
 good players apart ronaldo 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.530
 but here beautiful and ribery and it seems to me 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.420
 for opel 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.700
 Here is also as innocent as 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.980
 here I have everything else I have 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.630
 been forgotten one or two players that I do not 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.830
 did not make a big general like that 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.100
 but 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.560
 I do not think even though is network 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.420
 seaweb could also I have not here I am 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.370
 showed the players the real wide and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.790
 neymar train emerging and ski world 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.810
 ramos taboo and roger anyway too 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.060
 I was hunchbacked with things parents 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.640
 have been that it's the same turn and di 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.290
 Maria remains a brief stay tuned 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.820
 not too much but here is the 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.070
 market has evolved and that's it remains when 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.080
 even players now difficult to 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.080
 to have because the market has completely 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.210
 modified the epr etc 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.740
 that now proves to have to me 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.900
 credit is already huge 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.330
 So here is why bah is 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.220
 not exactly the same thing adds 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.990
 really huh guys I handed over to 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.430
 all the players were going to be them all 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.870
 simply and that is that players that 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.220
 I got a first time because I 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.560
 speak I looked I did not go back to 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.930
 empty I can very well go I believe 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.200
 I checked on page 5 years ago that there is 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.360
 always players at the rare here I 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.800
 shows you guys fast for 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.240
 show all players the quick choice 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.770
 because you do not put too much 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.710
 players but at the same time show you 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.430
 players at 110 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.660
 70 the general where 117 that's it's not 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.670
 very important but I show that 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.460
 I really have almost almost every 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.710
 apparatuses it apart if this red curve 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.960
 maybe wanting to miss a property 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.760
 sure we're going to get there a lot to 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.470
 last page here is that respect 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.380
 black players who in addition to people 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.340
 bach in all I have also here 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.640
 I did everything we could see 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.760
 go the only players to 82.2 general 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.920
 black and 4 I have them and the rest in the 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.380
 page or not giant all the players 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.470
 black gold also I showed you also the 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.660
 players 20 to ruland to show that 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.380
 I apprehended a lot of players 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.690
 not want to show you your 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.570
 questioning made there so much in a hurry 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.160
 to make you see the ember is not 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.750
 positioned because it would be useless 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
 but when we are less interesting 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.340
 but there are also those moments in good 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.350
 package to show you it's heaven 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.310
 for that I have almost 3000 players 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:09.200
 103 thousand items in my club 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.570
 people will get used to nothing because 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.400
 there is nothing but this little bronze player 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:18.830
 the jumenterie I think but consumables 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.830
 training but hey I'm not big 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.560
 something that is very dear to all sauce 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.810
 new positioning times he divided 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.750
 his charms in addition the styles to little 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.640
 near the same 31 etc 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.280
 but where it's better than all 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.560
 contracts 6 me against to provide 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.170
 I have contract I knew always seen it 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.980
 cost less 500 credit knowing that if 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.120

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.720
 is really nice enough not hiding 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.370
 it's not a golf club 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.009
 it's true but it's a club where there 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.889
 there are really a lot of players 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:06.900

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.130
 players that really makes a lot and to 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.900

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.699

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.169
 important for our a little less 

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.150

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:49.440
 the number of likes that provides the video 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.270
 because it encourages me to do better 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.889

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.099
 secondary chain that narrates the 

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.870
 destruction that might interest you 

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:04.580
