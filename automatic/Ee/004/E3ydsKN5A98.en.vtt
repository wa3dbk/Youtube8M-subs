these tracks and specifically here you
know<00:02:01.910> this<00:02:02.090> track<00:02:02.360> was<00:02:02.450> built<00:02:02.630> in<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.990> late

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
know this track was built in the late

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.749 
know this track was built in the late
70s<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:03.890> they've<00:02:04.040> been<00:02:04.130> doing<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.490> long

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
70s so they've been doing this a long
