go about teaching this is I will go

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.740 
go about teaching this is I will go
through<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:31.830> UV<00:00:32.550> projection<00:00:33.000> tool<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.510> wrap

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
through the UV projection tool on wrap

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
through the UV projection tool on wrap
and<00:00:34.050> peeler<00:00:34.940> at<00:00:35.940> first<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:37.140> will<00:00:37.260> explore

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
and peeler at first and I will explore

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.130 
and peeler at first and I will explore
how<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.090> used<00:00:39.360> how<00:00:39.629> these<00:00:39.780> tools<00:00:40.020> can

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
how it can be used how these tools can

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.470 
how it can be used how these tools can
be<00:00:40.260> used<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.800> UV<00:00:41.399> these<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:42.030> primitive

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
be used to UV these very primitive

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.400 
be used to UV these very primitive
shapes<00:00:43.460> now<00:00:44.460> once<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.030> through<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
shapes now once we get through the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.260 
shapes now once we get through the
process<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.559> giving<00:00:47.460> these<00:00:47.670> very<00:00:47.940> very

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
process of giving these very very

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.690 
process of giving these very very
primitive<00:00:48.480> shapes<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.200> explaining<00:00:49.680> why<00:00:49.890> it

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
primitive shapes and explaining why it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.410 
primitive shapes and explaining why it
is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.539> good<00:00:51.989> idea<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.440> UV<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.160> use<00:00:53.850> textures

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
is a good idea to UV and use textures

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.290 
is a good idea to UV and use textures
for<00:00:55.129> you<00:00:56.129> know<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.520> texturing<00:00:56.910> process

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
for you know for your texturing process

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.400 
for you know for your texturing process
instead<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.899> other<00:00:58.199> technologies<00:00:58.890> such<00:00:59.219> as<00:01:00.410> PT

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
other technologies out there once we get

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.630 
other technologies out there once we get
through<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.930> process<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.830> understand

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
through this process and you understand

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.140 
through this process and you understand
why<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.240> how<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:10.560> all<00:01:10.680> works<00:01:10.950> then<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.970> will

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
why and how it all works then we will

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090 
why and how it all works then we will
start<00:01:12.659> moving<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.409> more<00:01:13.650> intermediate

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
start moving on to more intermediate

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.749 
start moving on to more intermediate
shapes<00:01:14.520> such<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.030> these<00:01:15.360> objects<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:15.780> here

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
shapes such as these objects right here

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.090 
shapes such as these objects right here
now<00:01:17.840> by<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.900> time<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.200> reach<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.770> what<00:01:19.979> we

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
now by the time we reach here what we

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.740 
now by the time we reach here what we
were<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> start<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.330> we're<00:01:21.720> going

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
were going to start to do is we're going

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.429 
were going to start to do is we're going
to<00:01:21.930> start<00:01:22.700> combining<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:24.450> lot<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> previous

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
to start combining a lot of the previous

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.300 
to start combining a lot of the previous
tools<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.540> using<00:01:27.960> them<00:01:28.320> together<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.040> for

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
tools and using them together so for

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.880 
tools and using them together so for
example<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.509> cup<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.110> might<00:01:31.380> use<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
example on this cup here I might use the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.450 
example on this cup here I might use the
cylindrical<00:01:33.409> UV<00:01:34.409> projection<00:01:34.890> method<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.400> I

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
cylindrical UV projection method and I

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.910 
cylindrical UV projection method and I
might<00:01:35.610> use<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> unwrap<00:01:36.299> method<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.439> might

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
might use the unwrap method and I might

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.830 
might use the unwrap method and I might
use<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> planar

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
use the planar

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.310 
use the planar
Evi<00:01:39.840> project<00:01:40.259> tool<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:42.090> course<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:43.200> know

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
Evi project tool and of course you know

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990 
Evi project tool and of course you know
what<00:01:43.439> goes<00:01:43.560> without<00:01:43.770> saying<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.610> lot<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
what goes without saying that a lot of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.460 
what goes without saying that a lot of
the<00:01:45.149> different<00:01:45.479> tools<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.750> we<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.350> be

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the different tools that we have can be

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.310 
the different tools that we have can be
used<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.860> many<00:01:47.009> different<00:01:47.220> ways<00:01:47.899> now<00:01:48.899> once<00:01:49.200> we

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
used in many different ways now once we

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.240 
used in many different ways now once we
get<00:01:49.439> through<00:01:49.950> these<00:01:50.659> man-made<00:01:51.659> objects<00:01:52.290> we

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
get through these man-made objects we

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.670 
get through these man-made objects we
will<00:01:53.399> move<00:01:53.549> on<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.880> organics<00:01:54.630> such<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.290> said

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.649 

and<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:59.280> course<00:01:59.490> once<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.880> past<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.390> we

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and of course once we get past that we

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.260 
and of course once we get past that we
will<00:02:00.990> move<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.469> fuller<00:02:01.860> character<00:02:02.340> even

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
will move on to a fuller character even

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.969 
will move on to a fuller character even
though<00:02:03.360> he's<00:02:03.509> simple<00:02:03.869> he<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.560> idea<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.040> behind

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
though he's simple he the idea is behind

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.619 
though he's simple he the idea is behind
you<00:02:07.979> being<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> more<00:02:08.640> challenging<00:02:08.970> character

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
you being a more challenging character

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.339 
you being a more challenging character
is<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.259> same<00:02:10.849> so<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.330> think<00:02:12.480> he's<00:02:13.050> actually

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
is all the same so I think he's actually

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.820 
is all the same so I think he's actually
a<00:02:13.530> pretty

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
a pretty

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.640 
a pretty
example<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.230> course<00:02:16.440> once<00:02:16.590> we

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
example as it is and of course once we

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.850 
example as it is and of course once we
get<00:02:16.800> past<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.670> will<00:02:18.200> get<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.350> our<00:02:19.530> final

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
get past this we will get to our final

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
get past this we will get to our final
object<00:02:20.220> which<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:22.590> valve<00:02:22.830> over<00:02:23.040> here<00:02:23.250> now

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
object which is this valve over here now

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.610 
object which is this valve over here now
this<00:02:24.150> valve<00:02:24.390> will<00:02:24.690> utilize<00:02:25.230> pretty<00:02:25.500> much

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
this valve will utilize pretty much

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.140 
this valve will utilize pretty much
everything<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:26.220> learned<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.910> past

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
everything that we learned in the past

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.090 
everything that we learned in the past
and<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.290> previous<00:02:28.650> chapters<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:30.570> course

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
and the previous chapters and of course

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.010 
and the previous chapters and of course
by<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.160> time<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.460> get<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.090> chapter<00:02:33.510> here

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
by the time I get to this chapter here

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.140 
by the time I get to this chapter here
what's<00:02:34.890> going<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.160> happen<00:02:35.460> is<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:36.030> will

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
what's going to happen is it will

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.450 
what's going to happen is it will
actually<00:02:36.330> not<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:36.900> any<00:02:37.230> narration<00:02:37.890> just

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
actually not have any narration just

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.390 
actually not have any narration just
because<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:39.630> really<00:02:40.110> will<00:02:40.320> not<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.650> any<00:02:40.950> it

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
because it really will not be any it

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.110 
because it really will not be any it
will<00:02:41.580> not<00:02:41.730> have<00:02:41.910> any<00:02:42.060> new<00:02:42.300> information<00:02:42.840> that

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
will not have any new information that

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.400 
will not have any new information that
wouldn't<00:02:45.120> have<00:02:45.270> been<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.720> previous<00:02:46.050> chapters

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
wouldn't have been in previous chapters

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.850 
wouldn't have been in previous chapters
so<00:02:46.800> this<00:02:47.130> valve<00:02:48.030> will<00:02:48.360> really<00:02:48.780> serve<00:02:49.560> as<00:02:49.830> a

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
so this valve will really serve as a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.470 
so this valve will really serve as a
just<00:02:50.520> another<00:02:50.760> example<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:52.290> kind<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:54.360> know

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
to go through the primitive shapes and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.780 
to go through the primitive shapes and
you'd<00:03:09.630> be<00:03:09.780> something<00:03:10.110> like<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:11.250> finally
