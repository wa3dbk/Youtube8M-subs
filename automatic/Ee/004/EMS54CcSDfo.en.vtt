00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.990 

okay<00:00:01.469> so<00:00:01.530> what<00:00:01.890> we<00:00:01.979> have<00:00:02.159> here<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.460> an<00:00:02.610> asus

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay so what we have here is an asus

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.249 
okay so what we have here is an asus
motherboard<00:00:03.319> with<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.730> USB<00:00:05.730> issue<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.660> network

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
motherboard with a USB issue and network

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.669 
motherboard with a USB issue and network
card<00:00:07.529> issue<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.630> what<00:00:09.630> our<00:00:09.780> user<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.260> stating

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
card issue and what our user is stating

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.860 
card issue and what our user is stating
is<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:10.860> they<00:00:11.309> apply<00:00:11.849> pressure<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.540> Intel

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
is that they apply pressure to the Intel

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.670 
is that they apply pressure to the Intel
chip<00:00:12.900> here<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:14.130> causes<00:00:14.630> the<00:00:15.630> ports<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
chip here and it causes the ports to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.500 
chip here and it causes the ports to
start<00:00:16.949> working<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.609> what<00:00:18.029> we're<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.330> do

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
start working so what we're going to do

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.849 
start working so what we're going to do
is<00:00:18.690> take<00:00:18.900> your<00:00:19.020> put<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> machine

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
is take your put it on the machine

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.670 
is take your put it on the machine
and<00:00:23.000> take<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.300> heat<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.600> up<00:00:24.720> now<00:00:25.320> when<00:00:25.529> we

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
and take it and heat it up now when we

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.439 
and take it and heat it up now when we
received<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.519> was<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:29.449> we're

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
received it it was like this so we're

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.420 
received it it was like this so we're
just<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.840> go<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.439> hopefully<00:00:32.250> that

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
just going to go with it hopefully that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.280 
just going to go with it hopefully that
heat<00:00:32.669> pipe<00:00:32.880> doesn't<00:00:33.210> mess<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:34.100> for

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
heat pipe doesn't mess up but for

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.400 
heat pipe doesn't mess up but for
denotation<00:00:37.290> that's<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.730> p5e<00:00:38.730> deluxe<00:00:39.410> asus

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
denotation that's a p5e deluxe asus

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.619 
denotation that's a p5e deluxe asus
motherboard<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.250> we're<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.270> with<00:00:42.480> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
motherboard so we're going to go with it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.100 
motherboard so we're going to go with it
and<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:43.050> happens<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.899> we're<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
and see what happens so we're going to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.610 
and see what happens so we're going to
heat<00:00:46.230> everything<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.250> from<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.640> okay

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
heat everything up to go from there okay

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.850 
heat everything up to go from there okay
so<00:00:49.620> we're<00:00:50.039> allowing<00:00:50.370> our<00:00:50.700> board<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.210> get

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
so we're allowing our board to get

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.840 
so we're allowing our board to get
heated<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:55.190> we're<00:00:56.190> actually<00:00:56.340> going<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
heated up and we're actually going to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.500 
heated up and we're actually going to
have<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.180> probably<00:00:58.489> do<00:00:59.489> some<00:00:59.730> manipulation<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
have to probably do some manipulation to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
have to probably do some manipulation to
get<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:01.489> arm<00:01:02.489> over<00:01:02.820> top<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:04.670> we're

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
get this arm over top of it but we're

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.460 
get this arm over top of it but we're
going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> actually<00:01:06.030> allow<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.260> heat<00:01:07.439> up

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
going to actually allow this to heat up

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.359 
going to actually allow this to heat up
but<00:01:07.860> we've<00:01:08.299> put<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.510> cleaner<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:11.010> make

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
but we've put a cleaner on it to make

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.310 
but we've put a cleaner on it to make
sure<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.820> everything's<00:01:12.360> good<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:12.990> far<00:01:13.229> as

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
sure that everything's good as far as

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.510 
sure that everything's good as far as
that<00:01:13.470> goes<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.210> we're<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:16.520> start

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that goes so now we're going to start

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.730 
that goes so now we're going to start
the<00:01:17.670> warming<00:01:18.030> process<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.140> into<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the warming process to go into the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.760 
the warming process to go into the
actual<00:01:20.479> lighten<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.170> heating<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> with

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
actual lighten it up and heating it with

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.719 
actual lighten it up and heating it with
the<00:01:23.189> IR<00:01:24.090> system<00:01:24.570> okay<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.530> now<00:01:26.159> we've<00:01:26.430> started

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the IR system okay so now we've started

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.710 
the IR system okay so now we've started
the<00:01:26.970> heating<00:01:27.360> process<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:29.540> we're<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the heating process and we're going to

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.260 
the heating process and we're going to
allow<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.790> heat<00:01:32.790> as<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.000> normally<00:01:33.270> does<00:01:33.540> and

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
allow it to heat as it normally does and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.109 
allow it to heat as it normally does and
do<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.509> needs<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.500> actually<00:01:38.119> get

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
do what it needs to do to actually get

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.910 
do what it needs to do to actually get
this<00:01:39.299> system<00:01:41.450> heated<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:45.590> reset<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
this system heated up in reset for the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.660 
this system heated up in reset for the
reflow<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:49.020> notice<00:01:49.530> some<00:01:49.829> small

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
reflow so we do notice some small

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.649 
reflow so we do notice some small
amounts<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.770> smoke<00:01:52.770> coming<00:01:53.130> off<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:53.820> we

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
amounts of smoke coming off of it as we

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.060 
amounts of smoke coming off of it as we
could<00:01:54.810> see<00:01:55.020> coming<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> front<00:01:55.740> here

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
could see coming out the front here

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.770 
could see coming out the front here
that's<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> cleaner<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.840> we're<00:01:58.259> using

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
that's just the cleaner that we're using

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.060 
that's just the cleaner that we're using
that<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.930> use<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.409> prep<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> board

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
that we use to prep the board

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.490 
that we use to prep the board
prep<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.460> chipsets<00:02:04.120> so<00:02:04.990> we're<00:02:05.290> going<00:02:05.410> to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
prep the chipsets so we're going to

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
prep the chipsets so we're going to
allow<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:06.400> actually<00:02:07.740> burn<00:02:08.740> off<00:02:09.009> it's<00:02:09.340> not

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
allow that to actually burn off it's not

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.580 
allow that to actually burn off it's not
a<00:02:09.580> major<00:02:09.790> problem<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.570> we're<00:02:11.140> going<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.380> allow

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
a major problem and we're going to allow

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.050 
a major problem and we're going to allow
the<00:02:11.650> chipset<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.630> get<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:14.100> actual<00:02:15.100> flow<00:02:15.790> that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
the chipset to get the actual flow that

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.820 
the chipset to get the actual flow that
it<00:02:16.150> needs<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.690> get<00:02:19.900> what<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.200> needs<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.650> get

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
it needs and get what it needs to get

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.090 
it needs and get what it needs to get
done<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.460> we're<00:02:21.790> going<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.940> allow<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.390> to

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
done so we're going to allow this to

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.330 
done so we're going to allow this to
reflow<00:02:24.100> itself<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:25.590> do<00:02:26.590> what<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.860> needs<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.130> do

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
reflow itself and do what it needs to do

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.520 
reflow itself and do what it needs to do
and<00:02:28.150> then<00:02:28.330> we're<00:02:28.480> going<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.690> call<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.020> finish

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
and then we're going to call it finish
