00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
that being said I've actually made this

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.819 
that being said I've actually made this
point<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.269> forward<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:57.659> few<00:03:57.689> people<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.530> it

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
point the forward a few people and it

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.499 
point the forward a few people and it
actually<00:03:58.979> had<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> few<00:03:59.549> people<00:03:59.879> say<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.419> me

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:00.509 
actually had a few people say it to me

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.860 
actually had a few people say it to me
as<00:04:00.629> well<00:04:00.840> um<00:04:01.199> it<00:04:02.129> might<00:04:02.400> sound<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:03.060> bit<00:04:03.090> extreme

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
as well um it might sound a bit extreme

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.689 
as well um it might sound a bit extreme
but<00:04:04.229> when<00:04:04.439> you<00:04:04.500> think<00:04:04.739> about<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:05.189> just<00:04:05.340> think

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
but when you think about it just think

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.789 
but when you think about it just think
what<00:04:05.909> mr.<00:04:06.000> second<00:04:06.419> call<00:04:06.629> of<00:04:06.750> duty<00:04:06.989> 4<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.590> was

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
what mr. second call of duty 4 is was

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.830 
what mr. second call of duty 4 is was
quite<00:04:07.979> possibly<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.489> most<00:04:08.849> successful<00:04:09.449> call

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
quite possibly the most successful call

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.559 
quite possibly the most successful call
of<00:04:09.989> duty<00:04:10.319> ever<00:04:10.560> that's<00:04:11.220> just<00:04:11.549> because<00:04:11.819> it<00:04:12.329> was

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
of duty ever that's just because it was

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.780 
of duty ever that's just because it was
such<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.870> simple<00:04:13.500> game<00:04:13.530> they're<00:04:14.370> what<00:04:14.400> there

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
such a simple game they're what there

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.999 
such a simple game they're what there
wasn't<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.479> know<00:04:15.599> 20<00:04:15.989> attachments<00:04:16.650> for<00:04:16.769> every

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009

gun there wasn't 15 different
killstreaks<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:19.590> could<00:04:19.799> use<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.909> that<00:04:21.120> we're

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
killstreaks you could use it that we're

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.060 
killstreaks you could use it that we're
at<00:04:21.359> your<00:04:21.450> disposal

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
at your disposal

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.660 
at your disposal
there<00:04:22.670> was<00:04:22.880> two<00:04:23.420> like<00:04:23.690> maybe<00:04:24.020> like<00:04:24.920> snipers<00:04:25.460> we

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
there was two like maybe like snipers we

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.300 
there was two like maybe like snipers we
had<00:04:26.000> one<00:04:26.450> attachment<00:04:26.840> for<00:04:27.290> each<00:04:27.380> gun<00:04:27.680> while

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
had one attachment for each gun while

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.400 
had one attachment for each gun while
not<00:04:28.550> counting<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.000> regular<00:04:29.330> scope<00:04:29.630> then<00:04:30.290> we

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
not counting the regular scope then we

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.620 
not counting the regular scope then we
had<00:04:30.620> just<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:31.040> simple<00:04:31.310> red<00:04:31.550> dots<00:04:31.790> ounce<00:04:32.180> or<00:04:32.480> an

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
had just a simple red dots ounce or an

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.360 
had just a simple red dots ounce or an
acog<00:04:33.080> for<00:04:33.650> red<00:04:34.370> guns<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:35.830> there<00:04:36.830> was<00:04:37.010> three

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
acog for red guns and there was three

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.490 
acog for red guns and there was three
killstreaks<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.330> UAV<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.930> air<00:04:39.050> strike<00:04:39.290> and

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
killstreaks the UAV the air strike and

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.030 
killstreaks the UAV the air strike and
the<00:04:39.560> helicopter<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:40.430> think<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.540> would<00:04:41.660> be

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
the helicopter I think that it would be

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.530 
the helicopter I think that it would be
personally<00:04:43.040> my<00:04:43.220> opinion<00:04:43.640> I<00:04:43.790> feel<00:04:44.150> be<00:04:44.390> as

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
personally my opinion I feel be as

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.480 
personally my opinion I feel be as
strong<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.170> good<00:04:45.350> move<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.620> go<00:04:46.010> back<00:04:46.280> to

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
strong and a good move to go back to

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.960 
strong and a good move to go back to
that<00:04:46.580> simple<00:04:47.300> basis<00:04:47.840> just<00:04:48.190> you<00:04:49.190> know<00:04:49.310> minimal

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
that simple basis just you know minimal

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.720 
that simple basis just you know minimal
killstreaks<00:04:50.600> not<00:04:51.140> as<00:04:51.470> many<00:04:52.010> options<00:04:52.610> just

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
killstreaks not as many options just

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.330 
killstreaks not as many options just
certain<00:04:53.120> keep<00:04:53.300> it<00:04:53.480> simple<00:04:54.140> and<00:04:54.410> that's<00:04:55.100> what

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
certain keep it simple and that's what

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.130 
certain keep it simple and that's what
make<00:04:55.460> hauled<00:04:55.730> it<00:04:55.850> before<00:04:55.880> such<00:04:56.360> a<00:04:56.390> success<00:04:56.900> is

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
make hauled it before such a success is

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.170 
make hauled it before such a success is
that<00:04:57.440> it<00:04:57.530> was<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.650> simple<00:04:58.130> game<00:04:58.250> ya<00:04:58.670> didn't<00:04:59.090> have

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.970 
online and you're getting played sick um
but<00:06:41.630> yeah<00:06:41.750> I<00:06:41.780> was<00:06:41.900> definitely<00:06:42.290> so<00:06:42.590> much<00:06:42.740> that<00:06:42.950> I

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
but yeah I was definitely so much that I

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.580 
but yeah I was definitely so much that I
think<00:06:43.250> that<00:06:43.430> um<00:06:43.670> if<00:06:44.630> they<00:06:44.870> just<00:06:45.080> like<00:06:45.230> made<00:06:45.440> it

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
think that um if they just like made it

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.620 
think that um if they just like made it
so<00:06:45.710> you<00:06:45.770> couldn't<00:06:46.190> get<00:06:46.340> grenades<00:06:46.760> or<00:06:47.030> like<00:06:47.210> you

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
so you couldn't get grenades or like you

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.240 
so you couldn't get grenades or like you
know<00:06:47.660> grenade<00:06:48.200> launchers<00:06:48.650> whenever<00:06:49.070> you

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
know grenade launchers whenever you

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.470 
know grenade launchers whenever you
switch<00:06:49.400> the<00:06:49.610> class<00:06:49.820> and<00:06:50.060> that<00:06:50.090> is<00:06:50.300> something

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
switch the class and that is something

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.570
