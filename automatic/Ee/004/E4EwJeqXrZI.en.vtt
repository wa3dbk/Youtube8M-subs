if there's a break in the schedule
you'll<00:00:54.250> use<00:00:54.430> those<00:00:54.820> our<00:00:55.000> use<00:00:55.269> our<00:00:55.420> time<00:00:55.629> for<00:00:55.900> a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
you'll use those our use our time for a

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.689 
you'll use those our use our time for a
little<00:00:56.140> bit<00:00:56.260> more<00:00:56.470> skill<00:00:57.070> development<00:00:57.489> or

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
little bit more skill development or

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.060 
little bit more skill development or
conditioning<00:00:58.290> versus<00:00:59.460> versus<00:01:00.460> systems<00:01:01.120> so<00:01:02.070> we

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
conditioning versus versus systems so we

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.979 
conditioning versus versus systems so we
we<00:01:03.610> usually<00:01:03.850> adapt<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.390> what<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:04.720> situation

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
we usually adapt to what the situation

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.170 
we usually adapt to what the situation
is<00:01:05.470> but<00:01:05.710> overall<00:01:06.100> we<00:01:06.460> try<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:06.729> use<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.909> basic

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
is but overall we try to use a basic

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.240 
is but overall we try to use a basic
template<00:01:07.840> for<00:01:08.110> each<00:01:08.200> of<00:01:08.350> our<00:01:08.409> practices<00:01:09.010> and

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
players during a practice do you tend to

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.660 
players during a practice do you tend to
focus<00:02:47.090> as<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:48.200> team<00:02:48.770> when<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.190> comes<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.580> the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
drills or do you actually get to break

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.740 
drills or do you actually get to break
it<00:02:51.830> down<00:02:51.950> into<00:02:52.160> individuals<00:02:52.819> depending<00:02:53.360> on<00:02:53.510> I

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
it down into individuals depending on I

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.449 
it down into individuals depending on I
guess<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.110> type<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.709> type<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:54.920> skill<00:02:55.190> type

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
guess the type of the type of skill type

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.190 
guess the type of the type of skill type
of<00:02:55.580> drill<00:02:55.760> you're<00:02:56.120> going<00:02:56.360> through<00:02:56.600> well<00:02:57.140> I

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
of drill you're going through well I

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.840 
of drill you're going through well I
think<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.500> really<00:02:57.800> depends<00:02:58.130> on<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.670> type<00:02:58.820> of

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
think it really depends on the type of

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.190 
think it really depends on the type of
trail<00:02:59.440> certainly<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:01.220> know<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:02.510> can't<00:03:02.780> you

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
trail certainly you know you can't you

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.630 
trail certainly you know you can't you
know<00:03:03.290> one<00:03:03.530> drill<00:03:03.830> isn't<00:03:04.040> going<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.340> address

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
know one drill isn't going to address

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.229 
know one drill isn't going to address
the<00:03:04.940> needs<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.360> all<00:03:05.510> 20<00:03:05.840> players<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:07.130> yeah<00:03:07.850> you

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
guys but at the same time you try to you

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.000

offensively<00:03:19.910> for<00:03:20.000> forwards<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:21.230> want<00:03:21.650> to

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
offensively for forwards you want to

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.440 
offensively for forwards you want to
really<00:03:22.310> have<00:03:22.430> an<00:03:22.580> emphasis<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:23.120> every<00:03:23.300> time

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
really have an emphasis that every time

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.729

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
focusing on that as opposed to just

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.070 
focusing on that as opposed to just
taking<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:28.910> nonchalant<00:03:29.209> shot<00:03:29.570> trying<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:29.930> shoot

practice<00:03:34.700> at<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:34.880> higher<00:03:35.090> rate<00:03:35.330> of<00:03:35.390> speed<00:03:35.690> and

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
practice at a higher rate of speed and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.140 
practice at a higher rate of speed and
they<00:03:35.959> normally<00:03:36.380> would<00:03:36.560> so<00:03:37.550> they<00:03:37.640> can<00:03:37.820> transfer

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
they normally would so they can transfer

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.759 
they normally would so they can transfer
that<00:03:38.180> over<00:03:38.330> to<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.690> game<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:39.170> little<00:03:39.620> things

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769

taught on the pro level as opposed to
the<00:04:37.039> junior<00:04:37.370> level<00:04:37.520> I<00:04:37.990> don't<00:04:38.990> think<00:04:39.139> so<00:04:39.259> I

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
the junior level I don't think so I

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.110 
the junior level I don't think so I
think<00:04:39.349> you<00:04:39.860> know<00:04:39.979> overall<00:04:40.340> hockey's<00:04:40.880> hockey

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
think you know overall hockey's hockey

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.439 
think you know overall hockey's hockey
you<00:04:41.690> know<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.259> I<00:04:42.650> think<00:04:42.919> although<00:04:43.910> we're<00:04:44.180> far

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
you know and I think although we're far

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.870 
you know and I think although we're far
away<00:04:44.630> from<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.990> NHL<00:04:45.470> I<00:04:45.500> think<00:04:45.830> they<00:04:45.949> either

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
away from the NHL I think they either

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.400 
away from the NHL I think they either
things<00:04:47.300> that<00:04:47.449> you<00:04:47.599> can<00:04:47.750> bring<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.229> table

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
things that you can bring to the table

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.860 
things that you can bring to the table
here<00:04:48.949> that<00:04:48.979> the<00:04:49.310> pros<00:04:49.759> are<00:04:50.000> doing<00:04:50.240> as<00:04:50.389> well<00:04:50.569> as

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
here that the pros are doing as well as

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.580 
here that the pros are doing as well as
far<00:04:51.139> as<00:04:51.259> systems<00:04:51.650> are<00:04:51.830> concerned<00:04:53.500> gives<00:04:54.500> you

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
far as systems are concerned gives you

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.260 
far as systems are concerned gives you
that<00:04:54.710> much<00:04:54.740> more<00:04:54.919> of<00:04:55.160> an<00:04:55.220> advantage<00:04:55.669> so<00:04:55.849> I<00:04:55.880> try

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
that much more of an advantage so I try

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.790 
that much more of an advantage so I try
to<00:04:56.300> move<00:04:56.509> as<00:04:56.599> much<00:04:56.720> that<00:04:56.900> experience<00:04:57.349> as<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.560> can

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
to move as much that experience as I can
