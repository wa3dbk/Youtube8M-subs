00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
that's developed over the years that I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.469 
that's developed over the years that I
stripped<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.520> two<00:02:08.700> years<00:02:08.910> ago<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.360> it's

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
stripped is like two years ago so it's

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.899 
stripped is like two years ago so it's
just<00:02:09.599> been<00:02:09.810> sittin

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.619 

and<00:02:13.909> then<00:02:14.030> one<00:02:14.180> last<00:02:14.209> little<00:02:14.659> goodie<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:17.510> is

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
and then one last little goodie this is

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.890 
and then one last little goodie this is
a<00:02:17.659> stripping<00:02:18.019> disc<00:02:19.900> for<00:02:20.900> my<00:02:21.049> angle<00:02:21.950> grinder<00:02:21.980> I

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
a stripping disc for my angle grinder I

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.660 
a stripping disc for my angle grinder I
heard<00:02:23.900> good<00:02:24.079> things<00:02:24.140> about<00:02:24.409> these<00:02:24.769> I'll

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
heard good things about these I'll

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.089 
heard good things about these I'll
probably<00:02:25.879> need<00:02:26.269> more<00:02:26.329> than<00:02:26.629> one<00:02:26.810> but<00:02:27.349> one<00:02:27.950> to

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
probably need more than one but one to

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.599 
probably need more than one but one to
get<00:02:28.220> me<00:02:28.340> started<00:02:28.609> and<00:02:28.879> see<00:02:29.599> if<00:02:29.689> I<00:02:29.750> like<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.609> yeah

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
get me started and see if I like it yeah

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.789 
get me started and see if I like it yeah
and<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.819> guess<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.120> should<00:02:32.299> have<00:02:32.709> drained<00:02:33.709> the

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
and I guess I should have drained the

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.809 
and I guess I should have drained the
