look<00:00:13.110> at<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.260> e6<00:00:13.680> 22<00:00:14.459> find<00:00:14.699> out<00:00:14.879> if<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.180> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
look at the e6 22 find out if it's the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.850 
look at the e6 22 find out if it's the
perfect<00:00:15.539> camera<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.139> Olympus<00:00:16.500> really<00:00:16.710> say

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
perfect camera that Olympus really say

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.359 
perfect camera that Olympus really say
is<00:00:21.170> these<00:00:22.170> 620<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.769> has<00:00:22.859> twelve<00:00:23.130> point<00:00:23.339> three

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
is these 620 it has twelve point three

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.890 
is these 620 it has twelve point three
million<00:00:23.730> pixels<00:00:24.179> which<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.359> two<00:00:24.630> million

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
million pixels which is two million

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.900 
million pixels which is two million
pixels<00:00:25.230> more<00:00:25.470> than<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> e3<00:00:26.519> which<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
pixels more than the e3 which is the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.579 
pixels more than the e3 which is the
flagship<00:00:27.300> model<00:00:27.359> however<00:00:27.929> that<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.199> an<00:00:28.320> older

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
flagship model however that is an older

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.669 
flagship model however that is an older
camera<00:00:29.300> it's<00:00:30.300> also<00:00:30.509> the<00:00:30.779> same<00:00:30.990> resolution<00:00:31.380> as

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
camera it's also the same resolution as

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.470 
camera it's also the same resolution as
the<00:00:31.859> e30<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.880> seems<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.240> be<00:00:33.329> what

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the e30 and that seems to be what

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.030 
the e30 and that seems to be what
Olympus<00:00:33.840> are<00:00:33.930> capping<00:00:34.350> their<00:00:34.470> resolution<00:00:34.950> at

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
Olympus are capping their resolution at

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.470 
Olympus are capping their resolution at
at<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> moment<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.820> though<00:00:35.970> they<00:00:36.090> don't<00:00:36.210> think

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
at the moment as though they don't think

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.670 
at the moment as though they don't think
that<00:00:36.600> they<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.719> really<00:00:36.960> go<00:00:37.170> any<00:00:37.289> higher<00:00:37.350> on

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
that they can really go any higher on

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.770 
that they can really go any higher on
the<00:00:37.739> live<00:00:37.890> most<00:00:38.160> sensor<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.329> camera<00:00:39.690> has

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the live most sensor this camera has

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.470 
the live most sensor this camera has
also<00:00:39.930> got<00:00:40.230> seven<00:00:40.559> point<00:00:40.770> autofocus<00:00:41.300> which<00:00:42.300> has

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
also got seven point autofocus which has

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.470 
also got seven point autofocus which has
been<00:00:42.680> inspired<00:00:43.680> from<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.489> e3<00:00:44.670> focusing

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
been inspired from the e3 focusing

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.090 
been inspired from the e3 focusing
system<00:00:45.570> which<00:00:45.899> when<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.199> came<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.590> was<00:00:46.949> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
system which when that came out was the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.950 
system which when that came out was the
fastest<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> world<00:00:47.699> so<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> very<00:00:48.750> very

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
fastest in the world so it's a very very

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.009 
fastest in the world so it's a very very
fast<00:00:49.170> focusing<00:00:49.649> system<00:00:49.800> still<00:00:50.420> it's<00:00:51.420> got<00:00:51.629> five

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
fast focusing system still it's got five

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.220 
fast focusing system still it's got five
Evie<00:00:52.410> exposure<00:00:52.920> compensation<00:00:53.269> which<00:00:54.269> is<00:00:54.600> when

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
Evie exposure compensation which is when

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
Evie exposure compensation which is when
this<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.440> released<00:00:55.980> was<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> highest<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
this was released was the highest that

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.419 
this was released was the highest that
you<00:00:57.000> could<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.449> which<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.140> very<00:00:58.440> very<00:00:58.649> good<00:00:58.949> 5e

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
you could get which is very very good 5e

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.220 
you could get which is very very good 5e
V<00:00:59.609> plus<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.059> minus<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.539> third<00:01:01.019> or<00:01:01.199> half

V plus or minus in third or half
stair-step<00:01:02.100> increments<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.210> kind<00:01:03.390> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
stair-step increments and it kind of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
stair-step increments and it kind of
just<00:01:03.600> announced<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> D<00:01:04.230> 5000<00:01:05.040> which<00:01:05.129> has<00:01:05.280> got

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
just announced the D 5000 which has got

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.060 
just announced the D 5000 which has got
a<00:01:05.430> matching<00:01:05.760> exposure<00:01:06.420> compensation<00:01:06.800> so<00:01:07.800> he's

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
a matching exposure compensation so he's

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.370 
a matching exposure compensation so he's
not<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> best<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:10.050> but

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
not now the best that you can get but

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.500 
not now the best that you can get but
it's<00:01:10.590> still<00:01:10.770> very<00:01:10.980> very<00:01:11.130> good<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.150> here's<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
