take<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.620> pills<00:02:02.830> for<00:02:03.070> they<00:02:03.520> did<00:02:03.760> it<00:02:03.880> for<00:02:03.909> 12

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
take the pills for they did it for 12

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.230 
take the pills for they did it for 12
weeks<00:02:04.659> only<00:02:05.430> lets<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.550> work<00:02:06.700> yes<00:02:07.060> hey<00:02:07.180> you

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
weeks only lets you work yes hey you

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.830 
weeks only lets you work yes hey you
guys<00:02:07.330> interested<00:02:07.510> in<00:02:07.780> this

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
guys interested in this

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.449 
guys interested in this
so<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> raw<00:02:12.840> material<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.470> coffee

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
so this is a raw material for coffee

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.309 
so this is a raw material for coffee
that<00:02:15.060> we<00:02:15.150> drink<00:02:15.390> why<00:02:15.569> would<00:02:15.750> just<00:02:15.900> drinking

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
that we drink why would just drinking

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.320 
that we drink why would just drinking
coffee<00:02:16.530> do<00:02:16.800> this<00:02:16.950> yeah<00:02:17.340> because<00:02:17.640> when<00:02:18.030> with

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
coffee do this yeah because when with

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.509 
coffee do this yeah because when with
the<00:02:18.480> coffee<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:19.019> we<00:02:19.200> drank<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.830> roasted<00:02:20.370> and

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
the coffee that we drank is roasted and

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.940 
the coffee that we drank is roasted and
when<00:02:20.610> they<00:02:20.730> roast<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.209> they<00:02:21.360> roasted<00:02:21.780> at<00:02:21.950> 475

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
when they roast it they roasted at 475

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.509 
when they roast it they roasted at 475
degrees<00:02:24.110> Fahrenheit<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:25.980> changes<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
degrees Fahrenheit so it changes the

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.490 
degrees Fahrenheit so it changes the
color<00:02:26.760> turns<00:02:27.150> brown<00:02:27.510> changes<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.140> aroma

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
color turns brown changes the aroma

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.039 
color turns brown changes the aroma
changes<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.280> taste<00:02:29.549> changes<00:02:30.060> everything<00:02:30.330> but

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
changes the taste changes everything but

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.630 
changes the taste changes everything but
the<00:02:31.170> most<00:02:31.379> important<00:02:31.860> thing<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.099> does<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.400> it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
the most important thing it does is it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.960 
the most important thing it does is it
removes<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.599> chlorogenic<00:02:34.080> acid<00:02:34.920> that's<00:02:35.610> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
removes the chlorogenic acid that's the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.360 
removes the chlorogenic acid that's the
key<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.450> what<00:02:36.629> we're<00:02:36.810> talking<00:02:36.840> about<00:02:37.349> today<00:02:37.530> so

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
key to what we're talking about today so

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.910 
key to what we're talking about today so
how<00:02:38.459> does<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.610> work<00:02:38.730> well<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:39.989> amazing<00:02:40.290> it's

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
how does it work well it's amazing it's

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.009 
how does it work well it's amazing it's
what<00:02:41.099> we<00:02:41.190> call<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> triple<00:02:41.819> threat<00:02:41.849> okay<00:02:42.810> and

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
what we call a triple threat okay and

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.960 
what we call a triple threat okay and
it's<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.410> chlorogenic<00:02:43.769> acid<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.610> causes

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
it's the chlorogenic acid that causes

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.640 
it's the chlorogenic acid that causes
the<00:02:45.000> effect<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.599> it<00:02:45.690> works<00:02:45.900> three<00:02:46.200> ways<00:02:46.410> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the effect and it works three ways the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.309 
the effect and it works three ways the
first<00:02:46.860> way<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:48.150> goes<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:48.989> causes

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
first way is it goes in and it causes

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.979 
first way is it goes in and it causes
the<00:02:49.709> body<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.040> burn<00:02:50.400> glucose<00:02:51.120> or<00:02:51.329> sugar<00:02:51.420> and

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
the body to burn glucose or sugar and

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.979 
the body to burn glucose or sugar and
burn<00:02:52.650> fat<00:02:53.010> mainly<00:02:53.519> in<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.730> liver<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.599> second

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
burn fat mainly in the liver the second

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.869 
burn fat mainly in the liver the second
way<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.470> most<00:02:55.650> important<00:02:56.069> way<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.400> it

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
way in the most important way is it

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.839 
way in the most important way is it
slows<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.720> release<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.379> sugar<00:02:58.950> into<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
slows the release of sugar into the

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.150 
slows the release of sugar into the
bloodstream<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:01.230> when<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.530> don't<00:03:01.769> have<00:03:01.920> sugar

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
bloodstream so when you don't have sugar

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.100 
bloodstream so when you don't have sugar
building<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.879> bloodstream<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.840> don't

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
building up in the bloodstream you don't

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.589 
building up in the bloodstream you don't
have<00:03:04.319> fat<00:03:04.680> building<00:03:05.129> up<00:03:05.250> because<00:03:05.610> sugar<00:03:05.940> turns

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
have fat building up because sugar turns

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.440 
have fat building up because sugar turns
to<00:03:07.049> fat<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.590> everybody<00:03:08.190> must<00:03:08.549> remember<00:03:09.000> that

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
to fat and everybody must remember that

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.470 
to fat and everybody must remember that
when<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.440> two<00:03:10.650> are<00:03:10.680> combined<00:03:11.310> together<00:03:11.579> you

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
when the two are combined together you

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.809 
when the two are combined together you
get<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:12.870> synergistic<00:03:13.560> effect<00:03:14.250> that

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
get this synergistic effect that

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.629 
get this synergistic effect that
basically<00:03:15.329> burns<00:03:15.750> in<00:03:16.049> blocks<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.739> stops<00:03:17.130> fat

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
basically burns in blocks and stops fat

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:23.090 
basically burns in blocks and stops fat
but<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.600> also<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:19.639> natural<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:20.790> safe
