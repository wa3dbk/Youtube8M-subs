always thought records are there to be

broken<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.340> mean<00:00:23.490> honestly<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.630> didn't<00:00:26.420> have

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
broken I mean honestly I didn't have

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.509 
broken I mean honestly I didn't have
statistics<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.320> my<00:00:28.470> mind<00:00:28.769> when<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.279> racing

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
statistics in my mind when I was racing

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.730 
statistics in my mind when I was racing
it<00:00:30.179> was<00:00:30.390> always<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.660> consequence<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
it was always a consequence it was a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.650 
it was always a consequence it was a
nice<00:00:31.980> consequence<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.969> enjoyed<00:00:33.390> that

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
nice consequence I enjoyed that

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.170 
nice consequence I enjoyed that
afterwards<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:35.219> wasn't<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> reason<00:00:36.030> I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
afterwards but it wasn't the reason I

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.330 
afterwards but it wasn't the reason I
was<00:00:36.300> racing<00:00:36.480> Paul<00:00:37.969> there's<00:00:38.969> no<00:00:39.090> reason<00:00:39.450> why

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
was racing Paul there's no reason why

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.670 
was racing Paul there's no reason why
the<00:00:41.340> limits<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.910> set<00:00:42.239> will<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.140> will<00:00:43.649> be

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the limits I set will be will be

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.319 
the limits I set will be will be
different<00:00:44.129> at<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.370> point<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.210> whole

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
different at one point because the whole

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.700 
different at one point because the whole
environment<00:00:45.840> changes<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.379> mean<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> past

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
environment changes I mean in the past

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.270 
environment changes I mean in the past
we<00:00:47.100> had<00:00:47.420> 16<00:00:48.420> races<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.079> 20<00:00:49.379> races<00:00:49.590> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
we had 16 races now we have 20 races so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.860 
we had 16 races now we have 20 races so
it's<00:00:50.430> more<00:00:50.550> easy<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.969> win<00:00:51.090> more<00:00:51.300> races<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.809> a

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
it's more easy to win more races in a

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.090 
it's more easy to win more races in a
season<00:00:52.430> there's<00:00:53.690> various<00:00:54.949> statistics<00:00:55.949> they

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
season there's various statistics they

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.549 
season there's various statistics they
run<00:00:56.250> around<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.090> and<00:01:00.020> people<00:01:01.020> arrive<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> lot

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
run around so and people arrive a lot

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.560 
run around so and people arrive a lot
younger<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.190> these<00:01:02.399> days<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.760> Formula<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.300> so

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
younger in these days in Formula one so

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.000 
younger in these days in Formula one so
they<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> longer<00:01:04.170> time<00:01:04.530> they<00:01:04.830> can

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
they have a longer time they can

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.539 
they have a longer time they can
probably<00:01:05.309> spend<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.850> Formula<00:01:06.240> one<00:01:07.549> there's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
probably spend in Formula one there's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.289 
probably spend in Formula one there's
all<00:01:08.760> all<00:01:09.060> sorts<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.689> things<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.500> change

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
all all sorts of things that do change

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.630 
all all sorts of things that do change
so<00:01:12.860> it<00:01:13.860> was<00:01:14.070> different

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
so it was different

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.789 
so it was different
obviously<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.360> find<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.810> myself<00:01:16.409> because

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
obviously we find you in myself because

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.539 
obviously we find you in myself because
you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.640> compare<00:01:18.060> his<00:01:18.270> five<00:01:18.509> title<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:20.220> to

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
you can not compare his five title to to

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.320 
you can not compare his five title to to
the<00:01:20.790> seven<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:22.080> achieved<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
the seven that I have achieved and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.310 
the seven that I have achieved and
therefore<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:25.009> always<00:01:26.009> rig<00:01:26.400> always<00:01:27.240> made<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
therefore I always rig always made it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.730 
therefore I always rig always made it
clear<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.970> think<00:01:30.740> those

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
clear that that I think those

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.109 
clear that that I think those
achievements<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.810> woman<00:01:33.810> Fangio<00:01:34.850> was<00:01:35.850> able

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
achievements that woman Fangio was able

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
achievements that woman Fangio was able
to<00:01:36.150> achieve<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:37.290> his<00:01:37.500> time<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.400> they<00:01:38.549> are

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to achieve in his time I think they are

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.240 
to achieve in his time I think they are
so<00:01:39.000> unique<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.630> special<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.100> look

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so unique so special because if you look

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.710 
so unique so special because if you look
at<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> cars<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.030> been<00:01:42.210> occasionally

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
at the cars and I have been occasionally

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.289 
at the cars and I have been occasionally
sitting<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.170> those<00:01:43.290> cars<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.890> mean<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
sitting in those cars I mean I have the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.690 
sitting in those cars I mean I have the
greatest<00:01:45.329> respect<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.259> earth<00:01:46.409> for<00:01:47.369> what<00:01:47.549> those

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
greatest respect on earth for what those

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.969 
greatest respect on earth for what those
guys<00:01:47.939> were<00:01:48.479> doing<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.020> time<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.920> think

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
guys were doing at the time do you think

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.539 
guys were doing at the time do you think
that<00:01:50.220> am<00:01:50.520> Sebastian<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.380> almost<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.100> your

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
that am Sebastian is is almost in your

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.359 
that am Sebastian is is almost in your
seat<00:01:53.820> now<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.659> terms<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.320> how<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.829> German

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
seat now in terms of how the German

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.200 
seat now in terms of how the German
public<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.630> media<00:01:57.840> treat<00:01:58.290> him<00:01:58.610> he<00:01:59.610> is

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
public and media treat him he is

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.440 
public and media treat him he is
obviously<00:02:00.420> doing<00:02:00.750> his<00:02:01.049> own<00:02:01.200> theme<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.450> he

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
obviously doing his own theme and he

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.690 
obviously doing his own theme and he
does<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:03.990> his<00:02:04.020> own<00:02:04.259> character<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
does with his own character and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.130 
does with his own character and
therefore

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
therefore

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.309 
therefore
I<00:02:07.819> don't<00:02:08.819> think<00:02:08.880> there's<00:02:09.270> ever<00:02:09.509> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.899> a

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
I don't think there's ever going to be a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.370 
I don't think there's ever going to be a
full<00:02:11.069> comparison<00:02:11.750> possible<00:02:12.750> but<00:02:13.230> it's

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
full comparison possible but it's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.640 
full comparison possible but it's
probably<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.220> very<00:02:14.400> close
