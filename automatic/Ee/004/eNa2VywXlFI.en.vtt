00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
really cool but I remember I've played

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.369 
really cool but I remember I've played
this<00:00:50.219> map<00:00:50.399> before<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.120> sometimes<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.960> stuck

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this map before and sometimes get stuck

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.299 
this map before and sometimes get stuck
and<00:00:53.120> not<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.270> get<00:00:54.390> stuck<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and not to get stuck you have to like I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.160 
and not to get stuck you have to like I
have<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> fix<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> map<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.360> hopefully<00:00:57.719> this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
have to fix the map but hopefully this

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.010 
have to fix the map but hopefully this
doesn't<00:00:58.440> happen<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.430> time<00:00:59.489> for<00:01:00.420> example<00:01:00.840> now

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
doesn't happen this time for example now

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.680 
doesn't happen this time for example now
I<00:01:01.050> think<00:01:01.260> oh<00:01:01.770> no<00:01:01.980> no<00:01:02.190> no<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.850> doesn't<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.329> stuck

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
I think oh no no no it doesn't get stuck

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.719 
I think oh no no no it doesn't get stuck
but<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.140> remember<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.949> first<00:01:05.159> time<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.489> played

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
but I remember the first time I played

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.200 
but I remember the first time I played
this<00:01:05.850> map<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.299> got<00:01:06.420> stuck<00:01:07.189> let's<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.700> this

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
not fully functioning which is really

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.730 
not fully functioning which is really
annoying<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.360> example<00:02:06.719> now<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> mine<00:02:07.409> carts

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
annoying for example now to mine carts

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.910 
annoying for example now to mine carts
gets<00:02:08.090> got<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.539> normally<00:02:10.110> one<00:02:10.440> mine<00:02:10.619> cut<00:02:10.800> has

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
gets got in so normally one mine cut has

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.800 
gets got in so normally one mine cut has
to<00:02:11.039> get<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.520> pressure<00:02:11.910> plate<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.629> once

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
to get on this pressure plate and once

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.760 
to get on this pressure plate and once
it<00:02:12.930> happens

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
it happens

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.010 
it happens

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.580 
map and that's not working because of me
probably<00:03:23.280> I'm<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:24.240> giving<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.020> map<00:03:25.170> default

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
probably I'm just giving the map default

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.170 
probably I'm just giving the map default
but<00:03:25.800> that's<00:03:26.010> probably<00:03:26.340> not<00:03:26.490> really<00:03:26.940> and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
but that's probably not really and

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.850 
but that's probably not really and
probably<00:03:27.480> because<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.810> me<00:03:28.080> because<00:03:28.230> if<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.620> just

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
probably because of me because if I just

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.860 
probably because of me because if I just
don't<00:03:29.810> enter<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.870> map<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:32.150> try<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.209> help<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
don't enter the map and try and help the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.560 
don't enter the map and try and help the
things<00:03:34.500> around<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:35.550> probably<00:03:36.060> effing<00:03:36.390> would

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
things around here probably effing would

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.750 
things around here probably effing would
work<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:37.140> now<00:03:37.560> we<00:03:37.620> have<00:03:37.770> two<00:03:37.950> color<00:03:38.250> chips

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
work but now we have two color chips

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.810 
work but now we have two color chips
around<00:03:39.090> here<00:03:39.570> that<00:03:40.020> get<00:03:40.230> pushed<00:03:40.530> down

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
around here that get pushed down

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.030 
around here that get pushed down
probably<00:03:41.820> they<00:03:42.000> get<00:03:42.270> killed<00:03:42.920> probably<00:03:43.920> they

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
probably they get killed probably they

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.920 
probably they get killed probably they
will<00:03:44.070> drown<00:03:44.459> or<00:03:44.670> something<00:03:45.060> like<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.209> yeah<00:03:45.900> I

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
will drown or something like that yeah I

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.020 
will drown or something like that yeah I
think<00:03:46.080> they<00:03:46.350> would<00:03:46.530> round<00:03:46.830> once<00:03:47.520> they<00:03:47.670> drown

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
think they would round once they drown

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.440 
think they would round once they drown
the<00:03:48.480> roof<00:03:48.750> will<00:03:48.990> be<00:03:49.020> dropped<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:50.150> think<00:03:51.150> is

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
the roof will be dropped I think is

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.110 
the roof will be dropped I think is
there<00:03:52.230> boo<00:03:52.440> dropping<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.130> thing<00:03:53.370> rule<00:03:53.640> will<00:03:53.940> be

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
there boo dropping a thing rule will be

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.270 
there boo dropping a thing rule will be
dropped<00:03:54.540> around<00:03:54.720> here<00:03:55.260> which<00:03:55.800> will<00:03:55.980> activate

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
dropped around here which will activate

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.570 
dropped around here which will activate
something<00:03:56.820> so<00:03:57.360> this<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:57.720> pretty<00:03:58.020> pretty<00:03:58.650> set

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
something so this is pretty pretty set

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.370 
something so this is pretty pretty set
but<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.940> don't<00:04:00.360> want<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.600> wait<00:04:00.750> for<00:04:01.020> that<00:04:01.200> i'm

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
but I don't want to wait for that i'm

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.160 
but I don't want to wait for that i'm
just<00:04:01.410> lazy<00:04:01.770> ok<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.760> yeah<00:04:03.510> as<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.900> can<00:04:03.990> see<00:04:04.110> is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
just lazy ok so yeah as you can see is

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.220 
just lazy ok so yeah as you can see is
that<00:04:04.320> they're<00:04:04.470> cool<00:04:04.709> ok<00:04:05.250> we<00:04:05.670> get<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.820> whoo<00:04:06.230> we

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
that they're cool ok we get it whoo we

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.600 
that they're cool ok we get it whoo we
probably<00:04:07.530> have<00:04:07.740> to<00:04:07.830> wait<00:04:08.040> for<00:04:08.070> all<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
probably have to wait for all the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.300 
probably have to wait for all the
whoo-hoo<00:04:09.540> they're<00:04:09.780> all<00:04:09.959> time<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:10.800> so<00:04:11.010> sad

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
whoo-hoo they're all time this is so sad

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.680 
whoo-hoo they're all time this is so sad
but<00:04:11.489> i<00:04:11.550> have<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.730> get<00:04:11.850> on<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.060> pressure<00:04:12.360> placed

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
but i have to get on the pressure placed

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.720 
but i have to get on the pressure placed
around<00:04:12.870> here<00:04:13.320> so<00:04:13.709> want<00:04:13.890> every<00:04:14.430> pressure

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
around here so want every pressure

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.909 
around here so want every pressure
players<00:04:15.060> activated<00:04:15.720> we<00:04:15.810> need<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.260> wait<00:04:16.530> one

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
players activated we need to wait one

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.860 
players activated we need to wait one
more<00:04:17.160> which<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.580> going<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.239> be<00:04:18.330> activated<00:04:18.720> by

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
more which is going to be activated by

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.229 
more which is going to be activated by
this<00:04:19.020> purple<00:04:19.380> block<00:04:19.820> this<00:04:20.820> will<00:04:20.970> be<00:04:21.060> get

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
this purple block this will be get

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.910 
this purple block this will be get
activated<00:04:22.190> once<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.310> got<00:04:23.490> activated

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.450 

I'm<00:04:26.980> not<00:04:27.700> too<00:04:27.850> sure<00:04:28.000> what<00:04:28.210> will<00:04:28.360> happen<00:04:28.390> but

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
I'm not too sure what will happen but

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.180 
I'm not too sure what will happen but
but<00:04:30.780> for<00:04:31.780> some<00:04:31.960> reason<00:04:32.440> there's<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.950> guy<00:04:33.160> over

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
but for some reason there's a guy over

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.070 
but for some reason there's a guy over
here<00:04:33.640> we're<00:04:34.060> just<00:04:34.150> pushing<00:04:34.390> this<00:04:34.600> mine<00:04:34.810> cart

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
here we're just pushing this mine cart

here we're just pushing this mine cart
and<00:04:35.220> well<00:04:36.220> this<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:36.550> just<00:04:36.700> magic<00:04:37.240> let's<00:04:37.570> call

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
watching no one is watching this is

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.040 
watching no one is watching this is
probably<00:04:45.370> just<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.850> it's<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.240> really<00:04:46.480> good<00:04:46.720> map

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
probably just a it's a really good map

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.500 
probably just a it's a really good map
it<00:04:47.320> what's<00:04:47.830> really<00:04:48.520> frustrating<00:04:48.730> about<00:04:49.150> some

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
it what's really frustrating about some

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.320 
it what's really frustrating about some
app<00:04:49.660> is<00:04:49.870> dedham<00:04:50.680> come<00:04:51.280> on<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.640> I<00:04:51.970> probably

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
app is dedham come on and I probably

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.060 
app is dedham come on and I probably
have<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.630> take<00:04:52.810> a<00:04:52.840> lever<00:04:53.230> or<00:04:53.590> something<00:04:53.980> like

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
have to take a lever or something like

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.760 
have to take a lever or something like
that<00:04:54.130> let's<00:04:54.670> let's<00:04:55.060> take<00:04:55.750> a<00:04:55.780> lever<00:04:56.140> but<00:04:56.560> what's

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
that let's let's take a lever but what's

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.440 
that let's let's take a lever but what's
annoying<00:04:57.040> about<00:04:57.190> map<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.700> doesn't<00:04:57.850> it's<00:04:58.330> not

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
annoying about map is doesn't it's not

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.950 
annoying about map is doesn't it's not
functioning<00:04:59.170> hundred<00:04:59.440> percent<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.960> that's

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
functioning hundred percent and that's

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.720 
functioning hundred percent and that's
just<00:05:02.080> really<00:05:02.530> annoying<00:05:02.890> so<00:05:03.040> I<00:05:03.190> think<00:05:03.340> this<00:05:03.640> is

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
just really annoying so I think this is

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.730 
just really annoying so I think this is
the<00:05:03.850> last<00:05:04.000> part<00:05:04.450> because<00:05:04.780> TNT<00:05:05.170> will<00:05:05.320> break<00:05:05.530> now

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
the last part because TNT will break now

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.250 
the last part because TNT will break now
and<00:05:05.770> we'll<00:05:06.100> kill<00:05:06.310> Harry<00:05:06.610> O'Brien<00:05:06.730> I<00:05:07.120> think<00:05:07.420> yep

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
and we'll kill Harry O'Brien I think yep

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.800 
and we'll kill Harry O'Brien I think yep
there<00:05:09.190> we<00:05:09.280> go<00:05:09.430> so<00:05:09.790> her<00:05:09.910> vanish<00:05:10.240> kill<00:05:10.420> so<00:05:10.600> that's

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
there we go so her vanish kill so that's
