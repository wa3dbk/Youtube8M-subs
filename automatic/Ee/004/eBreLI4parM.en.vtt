kill<00:01:08.810> it<00:01:08.990> can<00:01:09.140> take<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.530> lot<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.799> bullets<00:01:10.219> to

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
kill it can take a lot of bullets to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.219 
kill it can take a lot of bullets to
kill<00:01:10.579> him<00:01:10.789> depending<00:01:11.479> on<00:01:11.600> what<00:01:11.780> weapon<00:01:12.140> you

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
kill him depending on what weapon you

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.399 
kill him depending on what weapon you
have<00:01:12.259> that's<00:01:13.009> why<00:01:13.250> he<00:01:13.520> is<00:01:13.729> in<00:01:14.000> at<00:01:14.240> number<00:01:14.719> 5<00:01:14.990> and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
have that's why he is in at number 5 and

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.170 
have that's why he is in at number 5 and
then<00:01:15.770> before<00:01:15.950> we<00:01:16.189> have<00:01:16.310> these<00:01:16.460> space<00:01:16.729> monkeys

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
then before we have these space monkeys

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.149 
then before we have these space monkeys
from<00:01:17.359> ascension<00:01:18.079> and<00:01:18.200> they<00:01:18.289> appear<00:01:18.619> every<00:01:18.890> 4

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
from ascension and they appear every 4

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.160 
from ascension and they appear every 4
to<00:01:19.189> 5<00:01:19.670> rounds<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.149> whilst<00:01:20.329> they<00:01:20.509> do<00:01:20.570> try<00:01:21.020> and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
to 5 rounds and whilst they do try and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.380 
to 5 rounds and whilst they do try and
kill<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:21.469> what<00:01:21.619> they<00:01:21.710> also<00:01:21.920> do<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.579> attempt<00:01:23.240> to

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
kill you what they also do is attempt to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.870 
kill you what they also do is attempt to
steal<00:01:23.929> your<00:01:24.320> purse<00:01:24.710> not<00:01:25.340> only<00:01:25.609> that<00:01:25.759> but

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
steal your purse not only that but

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.279 
steal your purse not only that but
because<00:01:26.000> they<00:01:26.240> are<00:01:26.359> so<00:01:26.570> small<00:01:26.869> they<00:01:27.049> can

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
because they are so small they can

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:28.959 
because they are so small they can
actually<00:01:27.439> be<00:01:27.710> hard<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.189> kill<00:01:28.340> if<00:01:28.549> your<00:01:28.700> aim<00:01:28.939> is

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
actually be hard to kill if your aim is

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.240 
actually be hard to kill if your aim is
not<00:01:29.210> accurate<00:01:29.990> like<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.170> said<00:01:30.469> they<00:01:30.829> don't<00:01:31.009> take

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
not accurate like I said they don't take

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.399 
not accurate like I said they don't take
many<00:01:31.549> bullets<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.210> kill<00:01:32.240> especially<00:01:33.140> in<00:01:33.259> the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
many bullets to kill especially in the

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.440 
many bullets to kill especially in the
early<00:01:33.710> rounds<00:01:34.039> but<00:01:34.399> if<00:01:34.520> your<00:01:34.670> accuracy<00:01:35.270> isn't

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
early rounds but if your accuracy isn't

by<00:02:42.400> shrieking<00:02:42.970> at<00:02:43.180> them<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.690> kind<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:43.990> acts

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
by shrieking at them so it kind of acts

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.950 
by shrieking at them so it kind of acts
like<00:02:44.380> you've<00:02:44.740> just<00:02:44.950> had<00:02:45.460> a<00:02:45.490> flashbang<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.450> a

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
like you've just had a flashbang and a

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.110 
like you've just had a flashbang and a

stun grenade thrown at you they actually
can't<00:02:49.540> appear<00:02:49.810> any<00:02:50.080> rounds<00:02:50.680> they<00:02:50.800> don't<00:02:51.040> have

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
can't appear any rounds they don't have
