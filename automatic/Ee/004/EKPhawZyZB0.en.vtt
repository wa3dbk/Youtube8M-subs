00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.799
 Hello everyone today I want to introduce you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.780
 with the soundtrack and us attack which 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.389
 adds shadows behind your icons and not 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.130
 only with icons and not only those not that 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.420
 there can be adjusted very subtly 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.940
 eat as you like and will look like 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.010
 if you didn't notice right away what 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.660
 now we kong no 10 no very well 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.820
 This effect I sought to those not 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 It was generally barely noticeable so that the icons 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.990
 had at least some traits not even 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.480
 slightly standing out they fell in love with me 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.130
 under the background, itâ€™s logical to agree when 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.989
 three-dimensional desktop when we cool 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.090
 our iphone and and the background are starting 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.340
 swim back and forth 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.870
 it is logical that all the same shadow shadow 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.460
 there must be they are somewhere in 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.350
 space is still a horse 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.820
 illuminate this residential drop what they 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.559
 We wanted to make and parallax effect 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.469
 accordingly some difference should 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.449
 to be and to receive such 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.949
 certain icon colors in one tone 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.809
 coincide with yourself that is not very 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.270
 great and you fly with me their folders at all 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.980
 some are so sticky or so 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.600
 the same text that is not visible for 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.039
 some icons and so let's 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.920
 look at what this species is capable of 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.280
 go on the terms after its installation 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 looking for him 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.560
 section is called again and to us attack 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.659
 here he comes and we look 1 and in reality 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.260
 clearly includes vip 2 usa and robert 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.710
 welch 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.439
 that is, he uses us overlap 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.990
 glass wool stick torus I was 6 that is 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.330
 And icons have such an effect of glass as 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.610
 perform ebbs play and so on then 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.770
 I advise you not to disconnect the thing 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.439
 looks really with total harmony 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.210
 7 but this is again the taste and color and us 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.549
 shadow in the board use i am not from 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.350
 I myself removed this myself in inter proud 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.060
 I was going to leave the speaker 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.030
 shadow that is use omichi skazt 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.890
 Irina and here are their settings 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.020
 but we'll be back here let's watch 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.100
 further control he 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.649
 show us what topics 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.229
 and combined with this cry and more 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.540
 he even shoved them into the board himself 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.369
 there is if you go to the topic you will see that 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.700
 here they are here actually so 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.890
 come back look and see 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.430
 come back where we have here aek on motik 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.160
 The following item repair black dog removes 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.950
 us blur on the bottom docks us device 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.020
 yes that is all here these 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.050
 blur that for 10 someone needs 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.550
 can dock on your dock 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.000
 return look further Remus ikon 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.849
 label 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.230
 deletes us and the caption that is, the signature to 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.780
 races that is, it is not at all clear what it is 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.580
 there will be an icon and what is it 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.130
 chrome nichrome world they will not get drunk 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.690
 The next item we have is apple very often 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.950
 have apply change in brackets to us 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.330
 find out what if we click on this 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.550
 the button will be warned and will 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.560
 respring hop sure what they want to do and 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.360
 click draw to see some 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.099
 snakes and foxes defaulted naturally 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.599
 resets the default settings and so 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.940
 let's go see how configured 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.680
 I personally like I said the shadow barely 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.330
 noticeably barely visible but just as 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.489
 I personally like so settings embers 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.290
 so that is the first of us 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.410
 to be responsible for 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.750
 corner radius i made my day radius 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.079
 shadows on 4 for example opacity 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.310
 transparency here is a leap generally prominent 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.599
 visibility so let's say this will be 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.200
 speak opacity but rather 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.989
 visibility 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.720
 brightness saturation and so on like 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.849
 see me this parameter and below us 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.140
 such an icon that helps 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.120
 imagine how it will actually be 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.760
 look like you want saransk you have 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.069
 both at least half darker than gray 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.780
 the gray standard color operations 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.310
 here 's what the icon shows at all 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.959
 useless that is if we are now we 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.310
 We stand here and thought that he 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.290
 ok so here it looks great 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.209
 we turn off doing respring and we 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.799
 such blackness will be legal therefore 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.810
 I want to say right away if you have any 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.389
 dark or even the average luminosity here 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.250
 how is my average board say you have 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.780
 it will be very dark here under her advise 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.030
 as little as possible here look me was 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:47.269
 15 in total, I managed to press 200 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.069
 firing exactly to 15 generally no matter how 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.410
 see the shadow here almost imperceptibly 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.040
 however, it is already possible here 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.530
 notice 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.170
 so look at your taste and color 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.019
 candles setting we mean you have it 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.040
 width that is how much it will be and 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.359
 if we go high, that is height 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.630
 next parameter let's opacity again 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:11.989
 Vlupim on all and see the coordinates 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.919
 xy look what good is this one 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.079
 tweak that is, let's say you don't want 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.940
 do shadows on the icon you only want to 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.750
 signatures done with a personal review 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.900
 stretching somewhere up to 60 m wide 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.900
 then lower 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.620
 Heights up to about this 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.419
 parameter by coordinates to stand at 0 or 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.300
 at -1 from it still happened just 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.090
 finger impossible to accurately hit and 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:39.900
 chase the y coordinates to this 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.430
 approximately parameter and probably and postinor 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.470
 tincture gangster here so well and actually 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.970
 this is how the icon will look like 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.820
 without a shadow but then a signature to her from behind 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.259
 will be visible and so accept 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.270
 changes we will need to click 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.820
 warm chingiz and actually after 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.350
 wrestling will see changes if you 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.310
 like this twix like 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.960
 subscribe to the channel 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.960
 I have it all bye
