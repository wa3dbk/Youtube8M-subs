be showing you how to program your cool
rider<00:00:08.460> chip<00:00:09.440> which<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.620> right<00:00:10.830> there<00:00:11.480> in<00:00:12.480> order

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
rider chip which is right there in order

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.470 
rider chip which is right there in order
to<00:00:12.780> do<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> reset<00:00:13.620> glitch<00:00:13.980> hack<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:15.179> I'll<00:00:15.299> be

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
to do the reset glitch hack that I'll be

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.849 
to do the reset glitch hack that I'll be
doing<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.900> with<00:00:16.109> there's<00:00:16.500> like<00:00:16.650> there's

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
doing this with there's like there's

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.820 
doing this with there's like there's
nine<00:00:17.160> backs<00:00:17.840> so<00:00:18.840> unfortunately<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.500> don't<00:00:19.650> have

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
nine backs so unfortunately I don't have

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.390 
nine backs so unfortunately I don't have
an<00:00:20.279> extra<00:00:20.490> coroner<00:00:21.680> chemist<00:00:22.680> or<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.010> full

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
an extra coroner chemist or a full

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.269 
an extra coroner chemist or a full
processing<00:00:23.939> program<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:25.650> I'm<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> show

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
processing program but I'm going to show

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.269 
processing program but I'm going to show
you<00:00:26.310> how<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:28.560> big<00:00:28.769> essentially

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
you how to do the big essentially

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.130 
you how to do the big essentially
basically<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.179> look<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.570> without<00:00:30.689> just

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
basically a look like without just

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.470 
basically a look like without just
without<00:00:32.070> actually<00:00:32.489> having<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.329> program<00:00:35.480> so

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
without actually having to program so

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.940 
without actually having to program so
it's<00:00:36.780> pretty<00:00:36.960> easy<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.380> first<00:00:37.559> thing<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.800> need

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
it's pretty easy the first thing we need

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.530 
it's pretty easy the first thing we need
to<00:00:37.980> do<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.520> course<00:00:38.550> update<00:00:39.239> your<00:00:39.420> name

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
to do is of course update your name

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.420 
to do is of course update your name

had a twist of fat let's switch to fat
when<00:01:38.479> you're<00:01:38.600> programming<00:01:38.780> it<00:01:39.319> you<00:01:39.500> want<00:01:39.709> it

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
when you're programming it you want it

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.559 
when you're programming it you want it
to<00:01:40.009> right<00:01:40.399> here<00:01:40.579> this<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:41.000> switch<00:01:41.299> what<00:01:41.539> a
