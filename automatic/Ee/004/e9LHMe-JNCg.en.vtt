package whatever item is that is your

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.270 
package whatever item is that is your
tracking<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:31.079> conveniently<00:01:31.650> fit

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
tracking this will conveniently fit

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.130 
tracking this will conveniently fit
inside<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.210> one<00:01:33.540> thing<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.840> keep<00:01:33.960> in

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
inside of it and one thing to keep in

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.440 
inside of it and one thing to keep in
mind<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.619> never<00:01:34.979> surrounded<00:01:35.729> completely<00:01:36.270> by

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
mind is never surrounded completely by

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.020 
mind is never surrounded completely by
metal<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.380> satellite<00:01:37.950> signals<00:01:38.490> cannot

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
metal because satellite signals cannot

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.240 
metal because satellite signals cannot
penetrate<00:01:39.299> metal<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.619> putting<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
penetrate metal so putting it in the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.130 
penetrate metal so putting it in the
trunk<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:42.000> car<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.450> probably<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.930> worst

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
trunk of a car is probably the worst

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.889 
trunk of a car is probably the worst
place<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.649> put<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.450> now<00:01:45.450> let's<00:01:45.689> take<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
place you can put it now let's take a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.510 
place you can put it now let's take a
look<00:01:46.110> at<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:46.470> bit<00:01:46.649> more<00:01:46.770> closely<00:01:47.130> as

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
look at it a little bit more closely as

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.230 
look at it a little bit more closely as
you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> gps<00:01:50.220> logger<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you can see this is a gps logger so you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.020 
you can see this is a gps logger so you
do<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.810> need<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.649> monthly<00:01:53.070> service<00:01:53.369> plan<00:01:53.729> for

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
do not need a monthly service plan for

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.690 
do not need a monthly service plan for
this<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.450> will<00:01:54.689> record<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.490> order

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
this this will record that and in order

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.990 
this this will record that and in order
to<00:01:56.850> see<00:01:57.270> where<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.770> device<00:01:59.130> has<00:01:59.159> traveled

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
to see where the device has traveled

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.240 
to see where the device has traveled
hence<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.780> person<00:02:01.170> you're<00:02:01.320> tracking<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
hence the person you're tracking or the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.609 
hence the person you're tracking or the
package<00:02:02.670> you're<00:02:02.880> tracking<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.420> travel<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
package you're tracking is travel it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.260 
package you're tracking is travel it
will<00:02:04.829> record<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.640> then

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
will record it and then

bottom we have what's like a rubber sole
this<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:56.010> you're<00:02:56.190> actually

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
this is so that if you're actually

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.520 
this is so that if you're actually
traveling<00:02:57.000> with<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> unit<00:02:57.599> in<00:02:57.780> your<00:02:57.930> car<00:02:58.200> and

you have it sitting on your dashboard it

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.720 
you have it sitting on your dashboard it
won't<00:03:00.420> slide<00:03:00.750> around<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.799> then<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.579> next

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
won't slide around and then the next

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.309 
won't slide around and then the next
step<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.180> we're<00:03:03.360> going<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> open<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.930> up<00:03:04.049> and

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
step is we're going to open it up and
