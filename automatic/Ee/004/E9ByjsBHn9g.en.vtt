00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 your transparent proclamation presents 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.180
 ideas that stick 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.100
 good here we are with the teacher Jorge 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.100
 rugby che normal good day 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.300
 breakfasting at home for all the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.420
 We will be accompanying at the end of 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.970
 breakfast calculation so far 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.329
 simply the candy surely 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.730
 We put ourselves as they are 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.730
 the sweet and everything we do 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.550
 good sweet home 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.260
 well we have a beautiful doll 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.059
 a little doll that really 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.530
 then you can expand the design not 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.820
 they can make it bigger if they wanted 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.280
 for some other things that they want 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.290
 occupy also in this case is huge 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.089
 has the idea as decoration of a 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.930
 cake for girls or they can make it 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.930
 also as a souvenir 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.390
 well let's do then this is this 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:23.360
 little doll for what we are going to use 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.990
 as I always tell you the wafers of 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.509
 telgopor and wafers is in our jargon 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 that we say wafer by the finitas 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.390
 what are they but is really a fan 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.429
 Spol fan of 1 2 3 and 5 millimeters here 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.229
 We are using one of a millimeter 2 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.619
 millimeters the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.479
 is to get the figure we cut it 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.380
 neatly with scissors for all his 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.899
 contour 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.579
 and only one policy plate is going to 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.520
 click with pins once the 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.530
 we have punctured we passed it directly 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.000
 by the heat cutter that can be 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 the little table machine that is a 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.789
 very simple home machine and can 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.470
 be the other cutter that carries batteries that 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.680
 it's manual that is best known for 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.080
 everyone once we cut 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.860
 in the piece of poli fam we are going to get 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.860
 in any case this type of court here 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.480
 they have the figure already ready I separate a 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.290
 Once I cut out I separate what is the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.670
 sheet and separated what is the polyphemus and 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.860
 then once I have everything ready 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.959
 I'm going to look at the sheet that things 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.570
 I have to be behind the design 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.270
 to be able to cut them and paste them on 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.280
 the first cut I made of polyphemus 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.050
 so in this picture I have the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.280
 back of what would be the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.370
 hat 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.320
 which is darker and one of those from 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.450
 little feet that is the little foot that is 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.420
 back that will be left then 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.270
 cut of the blade this I take these 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.459
 parts and I'm going to stick them in the cut that 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.890
 I made together with the sheet by 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.560
 first time is the first cut I hit the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.170
 back and the little foot that had 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.120
 which is behind the previous one once 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.580
 I have this what I have left over from 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.560
 I'm going to click on the mine again 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.320
 it's recurrent we go back to perform 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.060
 Exactly the same work I'm going to 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.540
 to click again I'm going to cut 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.400
 I'm going to separate and what I'm going to do is 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.860
 what I 'm left of the sheet that I just 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.040
 to cut out I'm going to fix what things are 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.920
 those that are further back to take them out and 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.069
 paste them in that cut in this case here 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.599
 this is the face with the hair if 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.610
 we would like nit we can 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.230
 pull the hair apart from the face 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.030
 one side and we're doing more volumes 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.580
 but in this case I wanted to do it quite 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.050
 synthetic so they can understand 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.050
 once I have the first two bases 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.270
 cut I'm going to use super avon 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.819
 transparent 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.670
 let's paste 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.209
 getting a little NomÃ¡s we have a 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.689
 glue spectacular I'm going to paste the 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.819
 second of the plates on the first and 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.189
 there we get 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.829
 the first part of the volume that 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.200
 we wanted to get we set ourselves 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.079
 that match if we do not have a 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.239
 total match after all the 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.099
 ways we're going to go over with the 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.949
 heat cutting tool so that 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.769
 the contours are all perfect 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:23.259
 after what I 'm going to cut 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.389
 the little dress with the little leg and I'm going 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:28.660
 stick the little leg alone in this cut 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.370
 then place it on top and note 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.990
 how the volume of the other starts 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.880
 allow with the previous 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.789
 then I'm hitting and we're getting 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.039
 greater volume and the feeling that this 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.919
 piece is not cropped but it is 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.760
 modeled because we are respecting what 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.040
 It was the mine tells us 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.680
 and then I have the hat on one side 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.080
 with the part of the hat brim and the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.510
 little dress in this case they were loose 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.690
 after trimming the face then 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:06.160
 I cut them and pasted the back 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.780
 of the hat the dress and I have here the 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.970
 part of the wing what I'm going to do is going to 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.640
 be the following I paste on what I already 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.560
 I had before first the piece that 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.800
 contains the back of the hat 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.780
 there and since I got rid of the fact 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.500
 of having to think that I have to put together 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:26.380
 the hat immediately after I hit 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.860
 the part of the wing 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.930
 there 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.150
 we stick there and see how he is doing 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.160
 shadow already 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.680
 about the previous pieces and we're going 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.350
 seeing the volume that the 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.030
 I have little dress in the piece that was left 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.600
 cropped then I will put here 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.540
 a little bit of glue 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.060
 and I'm going to place it and that's how we're growing 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.730
 in volume and I only need to place 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.470
 what would be the hose that the cut 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.890
 quoted directly no longer click it what 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.900
 hit and the rose also paste 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:05.449
 then I could put the hose 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.059
 on the part that corresponds 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.729
 you think that with this glue 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:16.120
 in 5 minutes everything is perfectly 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.120
 stuck and now I place winds 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.310
 we place the rosita there 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.000
 and once we finish drying that 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.190
 is dry with the cutter of the presidio 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.660
 hot we spent around 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.330
 we match all the layers and if 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.710
 we want to give a tone to the songs 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.750
 which corresponds to each part that 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.130
 make up the piece we put a little bit of 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.640
 free or we put a little bit of liquid 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.640
 transparent 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.470
 and then everyone makes their own 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.660
 recreation places you very dear to 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.110
 to place a baby ribbon a little bow 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.110
 little thing 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:07:05.220
 the doll yes clear 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:07.340
 very well we are seeing ourselves we are very 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.340
 all right
