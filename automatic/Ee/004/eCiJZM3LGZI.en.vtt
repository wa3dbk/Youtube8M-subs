00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.810
 Hello gta lovers with you warface 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.690
 and by popular demand or even 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.349
 I nevertheless succumbed to your pleadings and decided 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:35.410
 write down bugs and glitches for you in gta 5 a 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.739
 This is my first video in this format and 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.269
 Immediately make a reservation that below in the description 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.640
 there will be a link to the whole playlist 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.969
 created precisely on this subject by 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.690
 baham england than videos will be small 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.489
 that is, no more than five minutes, I think where 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.129
 I will show you various bugs and 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.379
 glitches can be hacking and some 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.770
 that all everything is all that is in this 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.020
 great game and so the first bug 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.259
 which I want to show you maybe 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.940
 even this is not so much buck boredom just 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:13.470
 flaw in the game flaw in the state 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.380
 which here is called passive mode 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.380
 Now we will wait for the train and I will give you 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.170
 I'll show it all in the hands of the canister 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.780
 I have for greater efficiency so let's say 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.720
 Well, fuck aliens in my 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.939
 give it some kind of charm 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.979
 some kind of kamasutra just look at 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:38.799
 It is an uproarity of 228 and now I hear 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.229

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.409
 need it just get in its back 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.850
 The part I think is that everyone can 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:52.299
 including me just climbing now 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.299
