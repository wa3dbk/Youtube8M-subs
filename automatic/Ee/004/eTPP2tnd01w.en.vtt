00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
couple keyboards back here let's start

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.810 
couple keyboards back here let's start
with<00:00:48.539> those<00:00:48.920> what<00:00:49.920> are<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.100> models<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.670> these

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
with those what are the models of these

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.420 
with those what are the models of these
and<00:00:51.149> then<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.809> they<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.039> well<00:00:53.039> these<00:00:53.219> are

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
guess most of your years should know the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.029 
guess most of your years should know the
the<00:00:59.520> Reyes<00:00:59.789> MK<00:01:00.480> pro<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.960> big<00:01:01.379> version<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the Reyes MK pro the big version so to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.399 
the Reyes MK pro the big version so to
say<00:01:02.309> definitely<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.809> CS<00:01:04.170> we

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
say definitely and here at CS we

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.000 
say definitely and here at CS we
introduced<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:05.519> new<00:01:05.549> versions<00:01:06.560> ten<00:01:07.560> key<00:01:07.799> less

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
introduced two new versions ten key less

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.300 
introduced two new versions ten key less
okay<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:09.270> why<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.750> called<00:01:09.810> bias<00:01:10.439> tkl

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
okay so that's why it's called bias tkl

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.570 
okay so that's why it's called bias tkl
ah<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.540> there's<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.170> basic<00:01:14.100> version<00:01:14.460> without

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
ah so there's one basic version without

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.330 
ah so there's one basic version without
lighting<00:01:15.090> okay<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> tkl

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
lighting okay and then we have the tkl

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.230 
lighting okay and then we have the tkl
pro<00:01:18.560> with<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.830> perky<00:01:20.189> lighting<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.909> already

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
pro with the perky lighting you already

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179 
pro with the perky lighting you already
know<00:01:21.420> from<00:01:21.630> from<00:01:21.960> its<00:01:22.140> big<00:01:22.350> brother<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> say

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
know from from its big brother so to say

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.380 
know from from its big brother so to say
the<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> rise<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:24.030> k<00:01:24.210> pro<00:01:24.450> okay<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:26.210> we<00:01:27.210> came

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the the rise I'm k pro okay but we came

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.109 
the the rise I'm k pro okay but we came
up<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.930> little<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:29.040> some<00:01:29.220> new<00:01:29.460> tweaks<00:01:29.820> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
up with a little with some new tweaks so

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.819 
up with a little with some new tweaks so
to<00:01:30.180> say<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.600> worked<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> MCU<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
to say we worked on the MCU and the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.310 
to say we worked on the MCU and the
software<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.250> bit<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.329> has<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> fading<00:01:34.170> effect

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
software a bit so it has a fading effect

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.219 
software a bit so it has a fading effect
that<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.790> combine<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.689> with<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
that you can combine with the with the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.260 
that you can combine with the with the
perky<00:01:37.650> lighting<00:01:38.159> okay<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.790> makes<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
perky lighting okay that makes the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.990 
perky lighting okay that makes the
lighting<00:01:39.570> effects<00:01:40.020> much<00:01:40.259> smoother<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
lighting effects much smoother and it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.510 
lighting effects much smoother and it
lets<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.240> do<00:01:42.450> more<00:01:42.479> advanced<00:01:43.350> lighting<00:01:44.220> I

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
lets you do more advanced lighting I

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.710 
lets you do more advanced lighting I
understand<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.180> that's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> bit<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
understand that that's a bit of a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.230 
understand that that's a bit of a
challenge<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:46.890> set<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.790> up<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.090> get

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
challenge to actually set that up to get

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.569 
challenge to actually set that up to get
that<00:01:48.390> nice<00:01:48.630> smooth<00:01:49.020> fade<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.500> LEDs<00:01:49.950> yeah

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that nice smooth fade with LEDs yeah

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.819 
that nice smooth fade with LEDs yeah
that's<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.180> our<00:01:51.450> technique<00:01:51.869> guys<00:01:52.079> say<00:01:52.409> so

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
that's what our technique guys say so

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.850 
that's what our technique guys say so
then<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.759> believe<00:01:54.149> there<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> same<00:01:55.079> alright

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
then I believe there is the same alright

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.289 
then I believe there is the same alright
so<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.189> has<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> really<00:01:56.520> cool<00:01:56.729> lighting<00:01:56.939> effect

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
so it has a really cool lighting effect

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.810 
so it has a really cool lighting effect
you<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.200> set<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.189> reactive<00:01:59.640> so

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
you can set it up so it's a reactive so

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.999 
you can set it up so it's a reactive so
as<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.180> type<00:02:00.420> each<00:02:00.600> key<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.079> key<00:02:01.560> lights<00:02:01.799> up

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
as you type each key the key lights up

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.709 
as you type each key the key lights up
and<00:02:02.159> instead<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.399> kind<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.909> slowly<00:02:03.180> fades<00:02:03.570> away

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
and instead of kind of slowly fades away

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.139 
and instead of kind of slowly fades away
gives<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.469> really<00:02:04.560> cool<00:02:04.829> effect<00:02:04.969> and<00:02:05.969> an

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
gives it a really cool effect and an

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.869 
gives it a really cool effect and an
excellent<00:02:06.540> smaller<00:02:07.439> board<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:08.399> folks<00:02:08.729> out

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
excellent smaller board for folks out

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.260 
excellent smaller board for folks out
there<00:02:09.000> who<00:02:09.060> might<00:02:09.270> not<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.810> ten<00:02:10.170> key

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
there who might not like ten key

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.000 
there who might not like ten key
then<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.750> guys<00:02:11.870> have<00:02:12.260> opted<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.710> go<00:02:12.740> with<00:02:12.830> a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
then you guys have opted to go with a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.490 
then you guys have opted to go with a
fixed<00:02:13.520> wrist<00:02:14.360> rest<00:02:14.660> which<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.990> actually<00:02:15.110> really

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
fixed wrist rest which I actually really

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.990 
fixed wrist rest which I actually really
like<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.860> rarely<00:02:16.070> see<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.370> on<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.730> smaller

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
like you rarely see that on the smaller

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.300 
like you rarely see that on the smaller
models<00:02:17.390> but<00:02:17.630> i<00:02:17.810> always<00:02:18.170> use<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> wrist<00:02:18.800> rest<00:02:19.070> so

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
models but i always use a wrist rest so

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.670 
models but i always use a wrist rest so
having<00:02:20.090> an<00:02:20.150> attack<00:02:20.330> but<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:21.560> know

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.500 
having an attack but it's so you know
the<00:02:21.890> feedback<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.460> we<00:02:22.700> get<00:02:22.850> from<00:02:22.910> from<00:02:23.390> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
the feedback that we get from from the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.850 
the feedback that we get from from the
guys<00:02:23.660> using<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.170> keyboard<00:02:24.350> is<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.740> they

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
guys using the keyboard is that they

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.890 
guys using the keyboard is that they
really<00:02:25.100> like<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.850> big<00:02:26.000> risk<00:02:26.270> best<00:02:26.540> and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
really like the the big risk best and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.050 
really like the the big risk best and
it's<00:02:27.080> not<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:27.560> much<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:28.040> save<00:02:28.340> space<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.970> know

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
it's not so much to save space you know

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.390 
it's not so much to save space you know
in<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:29.510> direction<00:02:29.690> but<00:02:30.650> with<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.010> 10<00:02:31.220> key

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
in this direction but with the 10 key

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.580 
in this direction but with the 10 key

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.800 
that depending on area you can adjust it
so<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.860> can<00:03:37.100> control<00:03:37.520> you<00:03:37.970> know<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.330> height

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
so you can control you know the height

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.400 
so you can control you know the height
so<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.260> say<00:03:39.590> when<00:03:40.250> when<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.780> sensors<00:03:41.780> stops

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
so to say when when the sensors stops

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.650 
so to say when when the sensors stops
working<00:03:42.680> basically<00:03:43.070> okay<00:03:43.520> so<00:03:44.090> there<00:03:44.510> are

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
working basically okay so there are

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.140 
working basically okay so there are
different<00:03:45.290> heights<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:46.070> people<00:03:46.459> prefer<00:03:46.820> for

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
different heights that people prefer for

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.060 
different heights that people prefer for
their<00:03:47.270> pickup<00:03:47.540> flight<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:48.020> with<00:03:48.920> this

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
their pickup flight and with this

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.400 
their pickup flight and with this
optical<00:03:49.850> cone<00:03:50.270> exit<00:03:50.600> II<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.810> can<00:03:50.990> adjust<00:03:51.110> that

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
optical cone exit II you can adjust that

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.430 
optical cone exit II you can adjust that
excellent<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.250> also<00:03:52.790> some<00:03:53.000> LEDs<00:03:53.420> on<00:03:53.630> there<00:03:53.870> I

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
excellent and also some LEDs on there I

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.020 
excellent and also some LEDs on there I
saw<00:03:54.800> a<00:03:54.830> couple<00:03:55.070> different<00:03:55.430> colors<00:03:55.670> on<00:03:55.820> here

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
saw a couple different colors on here

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.500 
saw a couple different colors on here

million colors okay so yeah but that's
that's<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.640> let's<00:04:05.540> say<00:04:05.660> usual<00:04:06.160> konec<00:04:07.160> city

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
that's the let's say usual konec city

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.070 
that's the let's say usual konec city
yeah<00:04:07.610> sure<00:04:07.820> keep<00:04:08.120> up<00:04:08.300> with<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.600> rocky<00:04:08.959> theme

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
yeah sure keep up with the rocky theme

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.110 
yeah sure keep up with the rocky theme
of<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.470> customization<00:04:10.310> of<00:04:10.400> colors<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:11.000> can

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
of the customization of colors you can

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.090 
of the customization of colors you can
really<00:04:11.360> choose<00:04:11.780> any<00:04:11.959> color<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:12.350> want<00:04:12.380> program

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
really choose any color you want program

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.870 
really choose any color you want program
first<00:04:13.310> there's<00:04:13.580> also<00:04:15.310> also<00:04:16.310> true<00:04:16.609> for<00:04:16.640> the

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
first there's also also true for the

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.060 
first there's also also true for the
optical<00:04:17.239> version<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:17.690> also<00:04:18.560> important<00:04:18.919> to

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
optical version and also important to

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.960 
optical version and also important to
mention<00:04:19.520> we<00:04:19.820> improve<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.690> weight<00:04:20.870> system

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
mention we improve the the weight system

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.510 
mention we improve the the weight system
so<00:04:23.910> it's<00:04:24.910> more<00:04:25.360> how<00:04:26.020> do<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.200> say<00:04:26.380> stiff<00:04:26.890> okay

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
so it's more how do you say stiff okay

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.990 
so it's more how do you say stiff okay
so<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.380> weights<00:04:29.620> won't<00:04:29.950> move<00:04:30.160> inside<00:04:30.700> us

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
so the the weights won't move inside us

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.330 
so the the weights won't move inside us
or<00:04:31.480> you<00:04:31.660> don't<00:04:31.900> have<00:04:31.990> you<00:04:32.410> no<00:04:32.500> no<00:04:32.800> no<00:04:33.010> no

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
or you don't have you no no no no

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.710 
or you don't have you no no no no
jiggling<00:04:33.550> or<00:04:33.820> rattling<00:04:34.180> going<00:04:34.390> on<00:04:34.480> in<00:04:34.600> there

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
jiggling or rattling going on in there

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.120 
jiggling or rattling going on in there
yes<00:04:34.900> all<00:04:35.170> right<00:04:35.260> so<00:04:35.500> keeping<00:04:35.800> everything<00:04:35.980> a

yes all right so keeping everything a

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.790 
yes all right so keeping everything a

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
want to yes overall the the design and

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.370 
want to yes overall the the design and
the<00:05:51.400> build<00:05:51.729> is<00:05:52.000> this<00:05:52.180> is<00:05:52.450> the<00:05:52.630> same<00:05:52.900> compared

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
the build is this is the same compared

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.850 
the build is this is the same compared
to<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:54.390> to<00:05:55.390> the<00:05:55.419> digital<00:05:55.660> version<00:05:56.110> so<00:05:56.590> it<00:05:56.620> has

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
to the to the digital version so it has

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.969 
to the to the digital version so it has
three<00:05:57.160> draw<00:05:57.430> driver<00:05:57.790> units<00:05:58.210> per<00:05:58.419> side<00:05:58.979> 12

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
three draw driver units per side 12

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.030 
three draw driver units per side 12
angle<00:06:00.430> for<00:06:00.970> better<00:06:01.680> braking<00:06:02.680> sound

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
angle for better braking sound

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.700 
angle for better braking sound
recognition<00:06:03.280> so<00:06:03.729> to<00:06:03.790> say<00:06:04.030> the<00:06:04.990> EGR<00:06:05.320> your

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
recognition so to say the EGR your

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.170 
recognition so to say the EGR your
questions<00:06:06.100> are<00:06:06.310> a<00:06:06.340> little<00:06:06.550> bit<00:06:06.760> different

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
questions are a little bit different

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.159 
questions are a little bit different
they<00:06:07.540> are<00:06:07.600> not<00:06:07.810> made<00:06:08.050> from<00:06:08.169> leather<00:06:08.440> okay<00:06:10.169> but

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
they are not made from leather okay but

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.490 
they are not made from leather okay but
yeah<00:06:11.380> basically<00:06:12.630> overall<00:06:13.630> it's<00:06:14.050> it's<00:06:14.290> the

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
yeah basically overall it's it's the

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.040 
yeah basically overall it's it's the
same<00:06:14.710> design<00:06:15.430> very<00:06:15.910> nice<00:06:16.060> and<00:06:16.300> these<00:06:16.930> have

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
same design very nice and these have

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.360 
same design very nice and these have
more<00:06:17.260> from<00:06:17.350> open<00:06:17.680> design<00:06:17.919> so<00:06:18.130> you're<00:06:18.220> going<00:06:18.310> to

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
more from open design so you're going to

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.310 
more from open design so you're going to
be<00:06:18.490> able<00:06:18.520> to<00:06:18.729> hear<00:06:18.910> the<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.930> sounds<00:06:20.229> around

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
be able to hear the the sounds around

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.520 
be able to hear the the sounds around
you<00:06:20.740> right<00:06:21.190> under<00:06:21.700> is<00:06:22.390> that<00:06:22.630> does<00:06:22.870> that<00:06:23.050> better

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
you right under is that does that better

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.450 
you right under is that does that better
for<00:06:23.830> the<00:06:23.890> 5.1<00:06:24.490> configuration<00:06:25.180> right<00:06:25.919> i<00:06:26.919> mean

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
for the 5.1 configuration right i mean

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.480 
for the 5.1 configuration right i mean
this<00:06:27.820> this<00:06:28.270> is<00:06:28.750> a<00:06:29.260> hard<00:06:29.590> percent<00:06:29.890> dedicated<00:06:29.979> to

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
this this is a hard percent dedicated to

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.060 
this this is a hard percent dedicated to
gaming<00:06:30.970> and<00:06:31.120> for<00:06:31.360> example

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
gaming and for example

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.670 
gaming and for example
intruder<00:06:34.070> games<00:06:34.340> you<00:06:34.580> know<00:06:35.320> knowing<00:06:36.320> where<00:06:36.530> we

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
intruder games you know knowing where we

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.600 
intruder games you know knowing where we
are<00:06:36.770> where<00:06:37.310> your<00:06:37.690> opponent<00:06:38.690> is<00:06:38.840> yeah<00:06:39.610> it's

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
are where your opponent is yeah it's

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.590 
are where your opponent is yeah it's
critical<00:06:41.060> so<00:06:42.370> the<00:06:43.370> the<00:06:44.030> open<00:06:44.449> bill<00:06:45.039> doesn't

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
critical so the the open bill doesn't

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.870 
critical so the the open bill doesn't
reflect<00:06:47.600> the<00:06:48.320> sound<00:06:48.620> okay<00:06:49.100> so<00:06:49.430> it's<00:06:49.639> more

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
reflect the sound okay so it's more

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.879 
reflect the sound okay so it's more
clear<00:06:50.240> where<00:06:50.570> the<00:06:50.600> sound<00:06:50.900> is<00:06:51.050> coming<00:06:51.259> from<00:06:51.380> if

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 
clear where the sound is coming from if

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.550 
clear where the sound is coming from if
it<00:06:52.430> was<00:06:52.610> closed<00:06:53.030> then<00:06:53.479> it<00:06:53.690> would<00:06:53.840> reflect<00:06:54.020> the

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
it was closed then it would reflect the

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.560 
it was closed then it would reflect the
the<00:06:54.860> sound<00:06:55.340> wave<00:06:55.580> so<00:06:55.820> to<00:06:55.880> say<00:06:56.150> and<00:06:56.440> distort

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
the sound wave so to say and distort

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.050 
the sound wave so to say and distort
yeah<00:06:59.570> excellent<00:07:00.470> all<00:07:00.620> right<00:07:00.770> so<00:07:01.610> that's<00:07:01.759> sort

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
yeah excellent all right so that's sort
