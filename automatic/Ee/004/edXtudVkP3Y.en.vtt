 animal approximately 20 centimeters 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.750
 the unit is turned on and with the control technique the power is adjusted 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.340
 necessary until immobilized fore limbs 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.360
 always use the lowest possible power to relax the animal 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.049
 an adjustment of the level between the values ​​3 and 6 in the control expertise is usually 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.360
 enough to relax a medium-sized animal 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.040
 at the end of tasks 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.040
 the control expertise is placed in the min position 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.140
 the animal will return immediately to normal
