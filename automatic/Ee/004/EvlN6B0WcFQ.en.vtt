00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.879
 Y 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.070
 hello everyone here we are 13 days 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.590
 then what is what more or less has 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.500
 lasted the previous video manicure 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.290
 with the new products of s 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.480
 and well, many of you were interested 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.619
 in the product and I had a lot of interest there 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.300
 in knowing how it worked and good now 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.599
 I'll leave here a photo for you to see 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.599
 as it has the enamel 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.260
 and good as you have seen has the nail 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.539
 grown up has a little bit worn by 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.909
 The tip is nail suffered an accident 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.379
 a couple of days ago looking at a piece of furniture 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.450
 that it was raised a little bit 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.050
 hooked and that's why he has it 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.410
 but good the others the normal grown 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.500
 after three days 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:06.600
 13 days since it is not bad 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.650
 Well, the other hand and I have removed it and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.120
 It is super easy to remove 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.000
 well I'm going to help with a 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.830
 cuticle pusher 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.830
 and we raise 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.490
 a little bit 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.670
 when we have it 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.670
 we have to throw 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.160
 and the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.160
 the enamel 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.750
 well then another way also the one that does not 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.940
 we can remove this enamel is getting 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.060
 well I'm going to stick my finger in this 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.660
 instant Maltese twine boat worth what 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.690
 we will have little time there is a tuck 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.370
 but if you do not have this little boat so 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.610
 you can make a wrap with a 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.460
 biscuit and albal mojadita paper in 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.890
 acetone you forget your little finger and leave it 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.580
 a few minutes like that 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.960
 well I'll leave two minutes like this 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.960
 and now we take it off 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.020
 good when they have already passed a couple of 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.550
 minutes we take out 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.940
 the crime 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:13.940
 and look how it has already come off 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.940
 little bit of the nail and 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.210
 from the bottom it seems that it has 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.890
 gone a little bit more but here it's like 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.630
 a little more hooked let's go back 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.580
 the mind was here because it seems like that 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.910
 it comes off in a little bit 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.950
 less aggressive than pulling the sheet 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.340
 and that's it, so let's put another 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.340
 bit 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.590
 well let's take out the little finger again 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.469
 and we would have a clean nail 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.770
 I'm going to finish I'm going to put a 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:32.970
 little bit of cuticle oil 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.970
 and it is already 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.470
 we would have finished and in conclusion the 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.080
 product, I think it works 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.110
 pretty well I liked it and yes 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.530
 what would you recommend? 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:51.460
 it's a little bit hard to remove but 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.700
 well it really gives you many days of 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.260
 bring your hands arranged without 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.450
 mistreat the umh a lot and I do not expect anything 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.860
 I have liked you to like it 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.030
 interesting and see you in the next 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.030
 goodbye video
