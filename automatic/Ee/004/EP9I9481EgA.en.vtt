00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.820 
and muting the strings with it um a lot
of<00:00:30.750> times<00:00:30.929> we've<00:00:31.140> probably<00:00:31.349> worked<00:00:31.529> on

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
of times we've probably worked on

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.830 
of times we've probably worked on
meeting<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.489> our<00:00:32.669> left<00:00:32.880> hand<00:00:33.210> I'm<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
vibrating but what we're going to do is

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170 
vibrating but what we're going to do is
we<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:38.040> our<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.370> hand<00:00:38.700> let's

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
we can do that with our right hand let's

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.150 
we can do that with our right hand let's
go<00:00:39.329> ahead<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.510> take<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> look<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> pretty

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
go ahead and take a look at that pretty

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.860 
go ahead and take a look at that pretty
simply<00:00:41.640> put<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> show<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.719> basic

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
simply put just to show you a basic

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.020 
simply put just to show you a basic
example<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.610> palm<00:00:44.820> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
example what you can do with palm you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.430 
example what you can do with palm you
can<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> lot<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.690> different<00:00:45.780> things<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
can do a lot of different things with it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.410 
can do a lot of different things with it
but<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> basic<00:00:47.250> example<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:48.030> plane<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
but a basic example is your plane the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.369 
but a basic example is your plane the
string<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.500> muting<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.039> your<00:00:50.190> paw

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.840 

this<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.590> give<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.890> staccato<00:00:56.250> tone<00:00:56.610> or

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
this can give you a staccato tone or

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
this can give you a staccato tone or
give<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> something<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> you're<00:00:58.199> looking

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
for that maybe you can't do with your

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.090 
for that maybe you can't do with your
left<00:00:59.789> hand<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.359> changing<00:01:00.780> chords
