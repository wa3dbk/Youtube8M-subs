00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
the 98 Chevy Tahoe and let's make up a

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.740 
the 98 Chevy Tahoe and let's make up a
hypothetical<00:00:52.320> problem<00:00:53.239> let's<00:00:54.239> say<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
hypothetical problem let's say that the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.950 
hypothetical problem let's say that the
horns<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:55.590> work<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.969> our<00:00:57.149> Tahoe<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
horns do not work on the our Tahoe and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.470 
horns do not work on the our Tahoe and
we've<00:00:58.680> checked<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> fuse<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.030> fuse<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
we've checked the fuse and the fuse is

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.340 
we've checked the fuse and the fuse is
good<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.550> find<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.149> wiring<00:01:03.449> diagram<00:01:03.629> I'll

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
good so to find a wiring diagram I'll

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
good so to find a wiring diagram I'll
just<00:01:04.559> go<00:01:04.739> ahead<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.369> search<00:01:05.610> function<00:01:06.150> and

this circuit and the method that I use

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.840 
this circuit and the method that I use
for<00:01:37.670> all<00:01:38.689> electrical<00:01:39.689> diagnosis<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.920> we'll<00:01:41.700> go

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
for all electrical diagnosis is we'll go

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.870 
for all electrical diagnosis is we'll go
ahead<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.420> I'll<00:01:42.840> start<00:01:43.439> at<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.710> load<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.700> I

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
ahead and I'll start at the load and I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.639 
ahead and I'll start at the load and I
will<00:01:45.090> work<00:01:45.299> my<00:01:45.540> way<00:01:45.689> back<00:01:46.049> towards<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
will work my way back towards the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.850 
will work my way back towards the
battery<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.540> this<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.990> fuse<00:01:49.290> right<00:01:49.560> here

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
battery and this is the fuse right here

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.530 
battery and this is the fuse right here
and<00:01:50.070> there's<00:01:50.369> no<00:01:50.549> problem<00:01:50.909> with<00:01:50.970> checking<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and there's no problem with checking the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.469 
and there's no problem with checking the
fuse<00:01:51.840> first<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:52.439> easy<00:01:52.680> enough<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.329> like<00:01:54.329> I

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
fuse first that's easy enough but like I

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.350 
fuse first that's easy enough but like I
said<00:01:54.540> our<00:01:55.079> fuse<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.619> good<00:01:55.829> yet<00:01:56.549> our<00:01:56.729> horns<00:01:57.149> do

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
said our fuse is good yet our horns do

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.810 
said our fuse is good yet our horns do
not<00:01:57.540> blow<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.680> what<00:01:59.100> I'll<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.399> I'll<00:01:59.790> start

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
not blow so what I'll do is I'll start

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.230 
not blow so what I'll do is I'll start
at<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.689> load<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.380> when<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.280> say<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> word<00:02:02.880> load

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
at the load and when I say the word load

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.530 
at the load and when I say the word load
this<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.810> either<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.469> light<00:02:04.950> or<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.820> horns<00:02:06.299> or<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
this is either a light or the horns or a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.430 
this is either a light or the horns or a
speaker<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.890> basically<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
speaker but basically the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.980 
speaker but basically the
and<00:02:09.530> part<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.640> circuit<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.630> I'll<00:02:11.810> have

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
and part of the circuit so I'll have

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.170 
and part of the circuit so I'll have
somebody<00:02:12.260> push<00:02:12.860> on<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.280> horn<00:02:13.490> pad<00:02:13.760> and

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
somebody push on the horn pad and

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.350 
somebody push on the horn pad and
activate<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.990> horns<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.530> I'll<00:02:15.620> check<00:02:15.890> for<00:02:16.360> 12

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
activate the horns and I'll check for 12

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.810 
activate the horns and I'll check for 12
volts<00:02:17.720> here<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:19.010> can<00:02:19.160> just<00:02:19.310> use<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.490> test

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
volts here and I can just use a test

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.780 
volts here and I can just use a test
light<00:02:20.090> since<00:02:20.330> it's<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.720> 12<00:02:21.170> volt<00:02:21.440> system<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.130> I

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
light since it's a 12 volt system and I

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.940 
light since it's a 12 volt system and I
will<00:02:22.940> check<00:02:23.210> for<00:02:23.240> power<00:02:23.780> here<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.500> if<00:02:24.740> I<00:02:24.920> have

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
will check for power here and if I have

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.780 
will check for power here and if I have
power<00:02:25.700> here<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.990> have<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.230> good<00:02:27.500> ground<00:02:27.920> well

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
power here and I have a good ground well

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.400 
power here and I have a good ground well
then<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.180> means<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.080> horns

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
then that means that the horns

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.950 
then that means that the horns
themselves<00:02:31.160> have<00:02:31.850> failed<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.540> need<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.810> be

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
themselves have failed and need to be

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.560 
themselves have failed and need to be
replaced<00:02:33.640> but<00:02:34.640> for<00:02:34.820> argument's<00:02:35.390> sake<00:02:35.510> let's

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
replaced but for argument's sake let's

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.960 
replaced but for argument's sake let's
say<00:02:36.020> that<00:02:36.170> we<00:02:36.710> check<00:02:37.040> for<00:02:37.070> power<00:02:37.430> here<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
say that we check for power here and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.750 
say that we check for power here and
there<00:02:38.210> is<00:02:38.450> no<00:02:38.480> power<00:02:39.080> well<00:02:39.830> then<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.070> will<00:02:40.490> start

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
there is no power well then I will start

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.060 
there is no power well then I will start
to<00:02:40.970> head<00:02:41.180> back<00:02:41.540> towards<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.380> battery<00:02:42.770> and

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
to head back towards the battery and

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.340 
to head back towards the battery and
we'll<00:02:43.760> see<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.240> first<00:02:44.510> thing<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.840> come<00:02:45.110> to

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
we'll see that the first thing I come to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.310 
we'll see that the first thing I come to
here<00:02:45.770> is<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.010> connector<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.780> connector

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
here is a connector and this connector

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.160 
here is a connector and this connector
has<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> number<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.640> we<00:02:49.970> can<00:02:50.150> go<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.330> component

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
has a number and we can go to component

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.310 
has a number and we can go to component
location<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:51.980> it'll<00:02:52.160> show<00:02:52.190> us<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.640> picture<00:02:52.820> of

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
location and it'll show us a picture of

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.620 
location and it'll show us a picture of
exactly<00:02:54.320> where<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.160> connector<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:55.730> but<00:02:56.510> I'll

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
exactly where this connector is but I'll

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.290 
exactly where this connector is but I'll
go<00:02:56.750> ahead<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.170> check<00:02:57.350> for<00:02:57.410> power<00:02:57.830> on<00:02:58.300> both

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
go ahead and check for power on both

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.390 
go ahead and check for power on both
sides<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.840> this<00:03:00.020> connector<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.770> if<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.220> have

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
sides of this connector and if I have

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.970 
sides of this connector and if I have
power<00:03:01.670> on<00:03:01.970> one<00:03:02.180> side<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.840> no<00:03:03.320> power<00:03:03.560> on<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
power on one side and no power on the

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.580 
power on one side and no power on the
other<00:03:04.130> well<00:03:04.910> then<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.120> have<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.590> corroded

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
other well then I have a corroded

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.130 
other well then I have a corroded
connection<00:03:07.190> or<00:03:07.460> a<00:03:07.490> poor<00:03:07.940> or<00:03:08.210> loose<00:03:08.510> connection

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
connection or a poor or loose connection

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.500 
connection or a poor or loose connection
but<00:03:09.860> let's<00:03:10.040> say<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.520> have<00:03:10.820> no<00:03:11.090> power<00:03:11.360> here

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
but let's say that I have no power here

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.260 
but let's say that I have no power here
I<00:03:11.990> will<00:03:12.260> continue<00:03:12.620> back<00:03:13.100> towards<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.880> battery

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
I will continue back towards the battery

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.660 
I will continue back towards the battery
and<00:03:14.540> this<00:03:15.140> brings<00:03:15.440> us<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.620> another<00:03:15.800> connector

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
and this brings us to another connector

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.940 
and this brings us to another connector
and<00:03:16.910> again<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:17.390> will<00:03:17.750> check<00:03:17.990> for<00:03:18.200> power<00:03:18.350> on<00:03:18.709> both

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
and again I will check for power on both

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.640 
and again I will check for power on both
sides<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:19.910> let's<00:03:20.900> say<00:03:21.050> there's<00:03:21.260> no<00:03:21.320> power

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
sides but let's say there's no power

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.160 
sides but let's say there's no power
here<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.250> will<00:03:22.760> continue<00:03:23.090> back<00:03:23.510> towards<00:03:24.020> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
here I will continue back towards the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.460 
here I will continue back towards the
battery<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:25.790> brings<00:03:26.150> us<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:27.020> horn

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
battery and this brings us to the horn

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.640 
battery and this brings us to the horn
relay<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.610> again<00:03:29.600> we<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:29.900> find<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.350> in<00:03:30.620> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
relay and again we can find this in the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.840 
relay and again we can find this in the
component<00:03:31.300> location<00:03:32.530> diagram<00:03:33.530> but<00:03:34.490> I<00:03:34.520> will

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
component location diagram but I will

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.060 
component location diagram but I will
check<00:03:35.090> for<00:03:35.150> power<00:03:35.630> here<00:03:36.080> coming<00:03:36.470> out<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.830> the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
check for power here coming out of the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.520 
check for power here coming out of the
relay<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.730> we'll<00:03:38.540> say<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.750> we<00:03:38.930> have<00:03:39.230> no

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
relay and we'll say that we have no

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.640 
relay and we'll say that we have no
power<00:03:39.860> here<00:03:40.330> what<00:03:41.330> I<00:03:41.360> will<00:03:41.480> do<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.290> will

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
power here what I will do is I will

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.520 
power here what I will do is I will
again<00:03:43.370> head<00:03:43.790> back<00:03:44.120> towards<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.840> battery<00:03:45.260> and

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
again head back towards the battery and

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.160 
again head back towards the battery and
check<00:03:46.130> for<00:03:46.160> power<00:03:46.489> on<00:03:46.910> this<00:03:47.300> side<00:03:47.600> of<00:03:47.840> the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
check for power on this side of the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.340 
check for power on this side of the
relay<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:48.860> if<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.910> have<00:03:50.120> power<00:03:50.390> coming<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:51.050> and

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
relay and if I have power coming in and

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.240 
relay and if I have power coming in and
no<00:03:52.340> power<00:03:52.670> coming<00:03:53.239> out<00:03:53.480> of<00:03:53.840> this<00:03:54.650> relay<00:03:55.070> this

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
no power coming out of this relay this

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.370 
no power coming out of this relay this
is<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.489> good<00:03:55.760> indication<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.420> this<00:03:56.720> relay<00:03:57.140> may

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
is a good indication that this relay may

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.270 
is a good indication that this relay may
have<00:03:57.590> failed<00:03:58.060> but<00:03:59.060> we'll<00:03:59.209> have<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.540> check<00:04:00.280> the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
have failed but we'll have to check the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.310 
have failed but we'll have to check the
rest<00:04:01.520> of<00:04:01.730> this<00:04:01.910> relay<00:04:02.360> so<00:04:02.690> again<00:04:02.989> I'll<00:04:03.140> head

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
rest of this relay so again I'll head

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.380 
rest of this relay so again I'll head
back<00:04:03.350> towards<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.010> battery<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.760> we'll<00:04:05.150> see

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
back towards the battery and we'll see

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.840 
back towards the battery and we'll see
that<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.840> relay<00:04:06.290> has<00:04:06.500> power<00:04:06.950> coming<00:04:07.340> in<00:04:07.640> on

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
that the relay has power coming in on

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.330 
that the relay has power coming in on
two<00:04:08.510> points<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.230> I'll<00:04:09.350> check<00:04:09.560> for<00:04:09.590> power<00:04:09.920> here

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
two points so I'll check for power here

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.540 
two points so I'll check for power here
and<00:04:10.540> I'll<00:04:11.540> check<00:04:11.750> for<00:04:11.810> power<00:04:12.170> here<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:12.739> if<00:04:13.430> we

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
and I'll check for power here and if we

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.280 
and I'll check for power here and if we
have<00:04:13.730> power<00:04:13.940> coming<00:04:14.420> in

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
have power coming in

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.920 
have power coming in
nothing<00:04:15.920> coming<00:04:16.250> out<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.790> want<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.720> go<00:04:17.810> ahead

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
nothing coming out I want to go ahead

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.990 
nothing coming out I want to go ahead
and<00:04:18.139> check<00:04:18.470> this<00:04:18.650> last<00:04:18.979> remaining<00:04:19.340> terminal

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
and check this last remaining terminal

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.870 
and check this last remaining terminal
and<00:04:20.209> this<00:04:20.959> terminal<00:04:21.100> at<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.130> relay<00:04:22.610> heads

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
and this terminal at the relay heads

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.080 
and this terminal at the relay heads
directly<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.750> horn<00:04:23.990> switch<00:04:24.410> so<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.910> it

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
directly to the horn switch so and it

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.180 
directly to the horn switch so and it
applies<00:04:26.419> a<00:04:26.449> ground<00:04:26.990> here<00:04:27.350> that<00:04:27.380> activates

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
applies a ground here that activates

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.520 
applies a ground here that activates
this<00:04:28.400> relay<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.840> can<00:04:29.990> see<00:04:30.199> that<00:04:30.410> the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
this relay and you can see that the

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.620 
this relay and you can see that the
relay<00:04:30.860> has<00:04:30.889> a<00:04:31.100> switch<00:04:31.490> here<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.030> these<00:04:32.240> lines

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
relay has a switch here and these lines

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.529 
relay has a switch here and these lines
indicate<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.199> magnetic<00:04:33.860> field<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.490> when<00:04:35.300> we

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
indicate a magnetic field and when we

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.170 
indicate a magnetic field and when we
apply<00:04:35.690> ground<00:04:36.320> here<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:36.979> it<00:04:37.100> energizes<00:04:37.729> this

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
apply ground here and it energizes this

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.290 
apply ground here and it energizes this
coil<00:04:38.539> and<00:04:38.810> pulls<00:04:39.530> this<00:04:39.800> switch<00:04:40.100> closed<00:04:40.580> so

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
coil and pulls this switch closed so

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.810 
coil and pulls this switch closed so
I'll<00:04:41.510> check<00:04:41.810> for<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:42.080> good<00:04:42.350> ground<00:04:42.650> here<00:04:43.130> if<00:04:43.280> I

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
I'll check for a good ground here if I

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.080 
I'll check for a good ground here if I
have<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.060> good<00:04:44.419> ground<00:04:44.750> at<00:04:45.050> this<00:04:45.740> point<00:04:46.090> power

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
have a good ground at this point power

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.029 
have a good ground at this point power
coming<00:04:47.570> in<00:04:47.720> to<00:04:47.930> these<00:04:48.139> two<00:04:48.380> points<00:04:48.620> and

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
coming in to these two points and

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.550 
coming in to these two points and
nothing<00:04:49.699> coming<00:04:49.970> out<00:04:50.240> well<00:04:50.720> then<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:51.199> have<00:04:51.530> a

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
nothing coming out well then I have a

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.360 
nothing coming out well then I have a
relay<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:52.250> has<00:04:52.460> failed<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:54.160> just<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.250> let

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
relay that has failed and just to let

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.330 
relay that has failed and just to let
you<00:04:55.430> know<00:04:55.580> what<00:04:56.510> I<00:04:56.539> find<00:04:56.960> most<00:04:57.380> of<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.770> time<00:04:57.800> is

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
you know what I find most of the time is

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.600 
you know what I find most of the time is
that<00:04:59.120> when<00:04:59.570> I<00:04:59.600> use<00:04:59.870> this<00:05:00.050> method<00:05:00.260> and<00:05:00.650> I<00:05:01.160> start

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
that when I use this method and I start

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.120 
that when I use this method and I start
at<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:02.240> load<00:05:02.479> and<00:05:02.900> work<00:05:03.229> towards<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.800> battery

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
at the load and work towards the battery

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.300 
at the load and work towards the battery
I<00:05:04.370> find<00:05:05.270> my<00:05:05.479> problem<00:05:06.020> here<00:05:06.380> on<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:06.530> very<00:05:06.889> first

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
I find my problem here on the very first

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.750 
I find my problem here on the very first
step<00:05:07.610> more<00:05:07.910> often<00:05:08.360> than<00:05:08.570> not<00:05:08.600> it<00:05:09.199> is<00:05:09.979> just<00:05:10.010> more

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
step more often than not it is just more

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.730 
step more often than not it is just more
common<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.419> have<00:05:11.600> a<00:05:11.630> problem<00:05:11.960> with<00:05:12.229> the<00:05:12.500> load

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
common to have a problem with the load

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.920 
common to have a problem with the load
on<00:05:13.010> the<00:05:13.039> circuit<00:05:13.460> than<00:05:13.940> it<00:05:14.090> is<00:05:14.270> with<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.720> rest

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
on the circuit than it is with the rest

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.100 
on the circuit than it is with the rest
of<00:05:15.229> the<00:05:15.500> circuit<00:05:15.949> so<00:05:16.669> again<00:05:17.479> using<00:05:17.990> this

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
of the circuit so again using this

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.400 
of the circuit so again using this
method<00:05:18.590> you<00:05:19.220> may<00:05:19.460> find<00:05:19.789> your<00:05:20.000> problem<00:05:20.510> with

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
method you may find your problem with

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.560 
method you may find your problem with
the<00:05:21.500> very<00:05:21.710> first<00:05:22.039> step<00:05:22.340> but<00:05:22.940> if<00:05:23.090> you<00:05:23.210> apply

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
the very first step but if you apply

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.050 
the very first step but if you apply
this<00:05:23.630> same<00:05:24.169> technique<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.770> every<00:05:25.400> automotive

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
this same technique to every automotive
