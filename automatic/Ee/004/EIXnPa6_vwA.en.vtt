00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.860
 that this channel server is the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.690
 called by brazil roche so let's go 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.329
 We'll go to the site here in Brazil. 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.640
 hostin dot net is leaving the link in 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.460
 description reminding them that they do not 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.320
 sponsor a channel or anything but it is 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.829
 I heard about the company a company 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.850
 good and that has character so to speak and the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.550
 consolidated 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.829
 Come on, I'll click here on the day. 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.230
 the plans 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 they make available that several 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.379
 servers and that at least the most 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.199
 popular 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.760
 type the team must have safe in w3c 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.470
 strong was the 10 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.270
 but in my case here I'll get it here 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.860

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.920

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.659
 get this plan here look de 30 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.990
 vacancies even just because I want to make a 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.229
 test for now he has here from 1990 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.770
 so far I think a special 8 gb 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.900
 costs $ 200 vacancies that we can 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.939

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.420
 I'll get this one right here for 40 reais and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.659

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.490
