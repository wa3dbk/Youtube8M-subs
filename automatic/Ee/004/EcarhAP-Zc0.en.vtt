00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.759
 Hello friends 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.780
 I want to make this video small 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.810
 job review 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.590
 heater stop 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.590
 iveco cars 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:24.550
 he has his own features different from 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.550
 other european cars 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.039
 at least on which I 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:37.470
 the judge is the difference is that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.470
 heater control here 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.190
 double 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.579
 one key 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.579
 appliances 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 pressing this key turns on 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.730
 heater 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.730
 for two hours 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.660
 and at maximum 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.590
 heating 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.380
 adjustable 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.190
 This is such a warm-up mode 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.740
 let's say people came in the morning 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.630
 after the weekend 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.630
 and you need to warm up the car quickly 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.860
 him 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.680
 taught 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.430
 this key 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.520
 and you can start the car either first 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.500
 start then turn it on 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.500
 on the keypad you can 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.060
 run the heater by the heater 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.009
 after all 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.200
 but after two hours she will turn off 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.579
 or you can also turn off the keys 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.579
 and there are 2 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.240
 the control unit is a mini computer on 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.240
 sleeping compartment 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.590
 faces 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.500
 and he manages 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.690
 color in the cabin 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.210
 sleeping area 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.210
 in the cabin windows 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.580
 cabins 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.150
 door lock 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.110
 curtains on 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.520

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.690

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.870
 disco but 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.540
 need to 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.019
 here is such 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.019
 computer 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.300
 and here are such manipulations here 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.600
 suppressed 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.220
 to the heater icon 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.610

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.770
 maximum autonomous enable 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.840
 from the sleeping compartment for 9 hours we 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.330
 she make 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.160
 we have less arrow but no longer 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.050
 it will turn out here on 9 ok 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.840
 and already arrows 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.750
 you can set any 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.850
 tour 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:02.160
 and again ok you press all he is a heater 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.020

 turn off 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.530
 you can turn off the keys and also again 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.490
 control unit 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.490
 from the sleeping compartment 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:22.220
 what are the cons of this such here 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.990
 control heater -1 and essential 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.980
 England 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:31.240
 I donâ€™t really like it but of course 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.260
 go the thing is that even if you have 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.530
 the heater is on from the key on the panel 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.530
 appliances 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.489
 that 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.040
 when you turn off the ignition turn off 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.689
 engines 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.689
 the heater also turns off 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.450
 from the sleeping compartment if off 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.750
 engine 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.900
 only you can run it exposed 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.050
 run autonomous temperature 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.230
 the heater in the cabin is warm and well he 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.650
 works and let's say that's on boot on 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.030
 unloading it is necessary to drive off there drive 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.250
 for a few minutes 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.320
 you start the car 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.320
 and the heater turns off 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.240
 moved 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.580
 and have to wait for now 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.580
 cool boiler happy stove 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.180
 then re-enable 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.970
 wait again while the display candles are warming up 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.970
 the police cabin at this time freezes and 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.940
 and very comfortable even in the sense that 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.670
 extra power on 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.689
 glow plugs for for 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.390
 fuse 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:58.730
 nozzles 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.730
 takes a lot of energy 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.920
 battery from this 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.410
 Neil is not getting better when she 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.260
 constantly running slowly blowing in 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.070
 the cabin is warm and not so much energy 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.129
 takes how much 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.080
 if its constant 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.900
 on-off 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.990
 nak candle on galina heating incandescent 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.960
 very much ahead 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.520
 stress on yourself 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.520
 such features 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.820
 Well 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.340
 video requested yet 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.849
 tell you about the minuses what the car and 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.529
 i.e 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.529
 cons in every car there 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.460
 don't know me 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.380
 with stove 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.390
 uncomfortable of course 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.390
 with a heater so -called 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.640
 but more I 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.000
 more than two years did not go 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.050
 and centuries 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.720
 like me cars 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.470
 soft comfortable 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.470
 spacious 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.920
 and the fact that in a minus and minuses on any 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.920
 car can be found 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.320
 if you look good 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.340
 here 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.850
 I finish my short review 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.850
 bye everyone
