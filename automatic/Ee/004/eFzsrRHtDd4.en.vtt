00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.840
 how about youtube thanks for being a 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.840
 once again in this called grand and word 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.220
 and this time we will talk about the 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.800
 movie abraham lincoln a hunter 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.980
 bandits the genre of this movie is 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.720
 between fantasy fantasy and thriller and the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.820
 story is based on a book the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.650
 same name of seth grahame smith 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.050
 narrating the history of abraham lincoln 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.720
 since he was a child and loses his 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.940
 mother because of murderer so 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.460
 he will seek revenge a few more years 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.680
 go ahead and realize that the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.260
 murderer was a vampire the script is 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.450
 quite simple and does not go into much depth 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 the story we only have the basics that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.649
 is abraham lincoln's motivation for 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.780
 avenge his mother and then later more 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.910
 forward in the story to save his 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.500
 country but the film focuses a lot on 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.260
 what battles are with vampires 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.390
 and even there it's simple because we have this 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.970
 series of confrontations that feel 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.830
 generic like vampires with 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.200
 which I'm going to art design 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.330
 makeup and characterization I think that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.610
 the vampires were well characterized 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.580
 using a make-up and some 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.860
 effects 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.740
 such they looked good but the bad 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.010
 is that they did not take advantage of them in the way 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.440
 correct as they arrived and left 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.590
 none highlighted the makeup of the 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.360
 other characters was not so good if you 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.890
 they gave the feeling that they were going 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.800
 increasing in age they are going 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.230
 aging but you could tell it enough 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.750
 all the dust they put on them and 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.850
 this detracted credibility 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.150
 costumes went according to the time and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.610
 There was one or another set or location 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.710
 fairly interesting in terms of 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.080
 special effects leave a lot that 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.270
 wish you notice that they try to cover what 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.190
 little worked that are mostly in 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.290
 the battles some things look very 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.540
 planed and are also used 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.390
 some camera movements something 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.690
 unstable with which they treat 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.690
 to disguise the bad of the effects what 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.470
 what helps a lot is the music that is 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.090
 the best of the movie are very good 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.100
 musicized the action scenes and you 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.810
 it gives emotion to the battles there are also 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.310
 good sound effects but in 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.400
 Sometimes you get to buzz 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.770
 of the scares caused by blows of 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.750
 music and shouting there is also something that the 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.150
 against strange and I do not know if someone else 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.489
 has happened to him and it is that at the moment in 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.770
 that they changed from one scene to another in 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.340
 many times they made a kind of 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.989
 almost imperceptible transition that I 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.230
 it seemed like the characters 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.970
 they were remembering something but not the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.120
 story was still in regards to the 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.550
 performances there is nothing to note as well 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.739
 that if you are going to see this movie 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.750
 trying to find something similar to the 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.700
 real story of abraham lincoln or 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.489
 thinking that you will see a great romance between 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.280
 vampires great special effects or 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.019
 a very deep story 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.330
 definitely this movie is not for 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.489
 you if you want to see some medium palomero 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.230
 with several battles against vampires 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.739
 well musicalized and nothing else you can 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.739
 see her 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.720
 and with this we come to the end of the video 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.240
 on this occasion I remind you that 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.160

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.770

 dismissal my name is from andy and this was 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.440
 the old
