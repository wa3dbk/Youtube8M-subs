time is to show Scott's furniture and

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:12.649 
time is to show Scott's furniture and
how<00:01:10.320> many<00:01:10.560> times<00:01:10.829> he's<00:01:11.040> moved<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.700> oh<00:01:12.149> gosh

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.020 
think he's moved six or seven times but
we<00:01:16.799> bought<00:01:16.979> him<00:01:17.130> brand-new<00:01:17.430> furniture<00:01:17.729> when

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
we bought him brand-new furniture when

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.429 
we bought him brand-new furniture when
he<00:01:18.090> first<00:01:18.270> moved<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> first<00:01:19.020> time<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
he first moved out the first time and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.749 
he first moved out the first time and
we've<00:01:19.560> used<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.039> six<00:01:20.280> or<00:01:20.399> seven<00:01:20.430> different

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
we've used it in six or seven different

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.340 
we've used it in six or seven different
home<00:01:20.939> every<00:01:21.299> time<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.630> looks<00:01:21.780> different<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
home every time it looks different and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.560 
home every time it looks different and
it<00:01:22.530> looks<00:01:22.680> amazing<00:01:22.829> and<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:24.270> been<00:01:24.450> really

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it looks amazing and it's been really

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.200

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
fun so it's a kind of a cool idea for a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.830 
fun so it's a kind of a cool idea for a
video<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:28.140> show<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.409> how<00:01:28.649> for<00:01:29.039> example<00:01:29.840> if

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
video to show you how for example if

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.179 
video to show you how for example if

you're in the military and you move
often<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.000> think<00:01:33.210> we're<00:01:33.450> only<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.780> two
