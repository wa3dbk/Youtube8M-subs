which<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.480> good<00:00:27.720> question<00:00:28.609> in<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.699> situation

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
which is a good question in a situation

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.999 
which is a good question in a situation
where<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> economy<00:00:31.140> continues<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.830> go<00:00:31.980> down

where the economy continues to go down

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.979 
where the economy continues to go down
which<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.550> think<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.850> will<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.239> continue<00:00:33.750> to

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
which I think it will just continue to

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.069 
which I think it will just continue to
slowly<00:00:34.380> grind<00:00:34.920> away<00:00:35.480> there's<00:00:36.480> more<00:00:36.540> break-ins

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
slowly grind away there's more break-ins

slowly grind away there's more break-ins
more<00:00:37.739> burglaries<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> dog<00:00:39.239> will<00:00:39.510> be<00:00:39.660> helpful

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
more burglaries so a dog will be helpful

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
might not be good for security but it

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.119 
might not be good for security but it
will<00:00:48.780> alert<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.350> hey<00:00:49.559> something's<00:00:50.010> not

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
which dogs can actually do something

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.790 
which dogs can actually do something
after<00:02:27.300> retreat<00:02:27.810> err<00:02:27.840> at<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.110> homestead<00:02:28.290> which

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
after retreat err at the homestead which

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.410 
after retreat err at the homestead which
ones<00:02:29.040> are<00:02:29.160> profitable<00:02:29.550> which<00:02:29.730> ones<00:02:29.940> are<00:02:30.239> there

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420

hunting

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
hunting

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.839 
hunting
I<00:02:32.610> figured<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.630> out<00:02:33.660> now<00:02:34.040> also<00:02:35.040> consider

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
I figured that out now also consider

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.449 
I figured that out now also consider
children<00:02:36.300> if<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.260> family<00:02:37.800> pet<00:02:38.190> you're

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
children if that's a family pet you're

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.270 
children if that's a family pet you're
not<00:02:38.610> going<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.940> want<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.239> get<00:02:39.360> rid<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.780> dog

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
not going to want to get rid of that dog

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.160 
not going to want to get rid of that dog
so<00:02:41.280> think<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.000> children<00:02:42.269> in<00:02:42.569> their<00:02:42.720> mental

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
so think of children in their mental

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.309 
so think of children in their mental
stability<00:02:43.549> that<00:02:44.549> dog<00:02:44.790> could<00:02:45.120> be<00:02:45.330> a

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
stability that dog could be a

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.330 
stability that dog could be a
stabilizing<00:02:47.250> factor<00:02:47.700> during<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.720> crisis

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
stabilizing factor during the crisis

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.280 
stabilizing factor during the crisis
maybe<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.489> can<00:02:50.610> give<00:02:50.760> give<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.750> dog<00:02:51.959> away<00:02:52.140> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
maybe you can give give the dog away to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.720 
maybe you can give give the dog away to
a<00:02:52.440> neighbor<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.860> doesn't<00:02:53.099> have<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> dog<00:02:53.459> so

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
a neighbor that doesn't have a dog so

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.000 
a neighbor that doesn't have a dog so
think<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.560> worst-case<00:02:55.560> scenario<00:02:55.980> you

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
think of that worst-case scenario you

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.370 
think of that worst-case scenario you
might<00:02:56.190> have<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.430> put<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.610> few<00:02:56.819> dogs<00:02:57.000> down<00:02:57.380> you'll

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
might have to put a few dogs down you'll

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.080 
might have to put a few dogs down you'll
be<00:02:58.530> making<00:02:58.799> a<00:02:58.860> lot<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.220> hard<00:02:59.400> decisions<00:02:59.519> in<00:03:00.030> a

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
be making a lot of hard decisions in a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.970 
be making a lot of hard decisions in a
raw<00:03:00.269> situation<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.260> will<00:03:01.410> just<00:03:01.530> be<00:03:01.680> one

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
raw situation and this will just be one

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.289 
raw situation and this will just be one
of<00:03:02.130> them<00:03:02.989> let's<00:03:03.989> talk<00:03:04.140> about<00:03:04.230> food<00:03:05.299> typically

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
of them let's talk about food typically

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.449 
of them let's talk about food typically
the<00:03:06.510> manufacturers<00:03:07.140> say<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.319> dried<00:03:07.709> dog<00:03:08.040> food

going to need they usually have sharps

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.849 
going to need they usually have sharps

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.240 
probably take about 6 cups and the other
will<00:03:49.200> take<00:03:49.380> about<00:03:49.470> 8<00:03:49.769> cups

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
that one's a Great Dane and the other

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.710 
that one's a Great Dane and the other
ones<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:52.920> German<00:03:53.220> Shepherd<00:03:53.549> mix<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:54.209> they<00:03:54.540> eat<00:03:54.690> a

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
ones a German Shepherd mix so they eat a

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.360 
ones a German Shepherd mix so they eat a
lot<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:55.049> food<00:03:56.030> typically<00:03:57.109> one<00:03:58.109> pound<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.160> food

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
lot of food typically one pound of food

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.589 
lot of food typically one pound of food
will<00:03:59.670> is<00:03:59.880> four<00:04:00.299> cups<00:04:00.799> so<00:04:01.799> this<00:04:02.519> bag<00:04:03.329> right<00:04:03.540> here

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
will is four cups so this bag right here

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.870 
will is four cups so this bag right here
40<00:04:04.139> pound<00:04:04.380> bag<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.650> large<00:04:04.950> bag<00:04:05.040> will<00:04:05.579> be<00:04:05.609> about

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
40 pound bag a large bag will be about

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.670 
40 pound bag a large bag will be about
20<00:04:06.239> days<00:04:06.389> for<00:04:06.660> my<00:04:06.810> large<00:04:07.019> dog

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
20 days for my large dog

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.940 
20 days for my large dog
so<00:04:08.250> my<00:04:09.000> large<00:04:09.299> dog<00:04:09.630> would<00:04:09.959> take<00:04:10.200> about<00:04:10.319> seven

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
so my large dog would take about seven

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.009 
so my large dog would take about seven
hundred<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.609> thirty<00:04:11.910> pounds<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.630> dog<00:04:12.959> food

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
hundred and thirty pounds of dog food

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.159 
hundred and thirty pounds of dog food
for<00:04:13.650> one<00:04:13.919> dog<00:04:14.389> and<00:04:15.389> my<00:04:15.630> other<00:04:15.780> dog<00:04:16.019> will

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
for one dog and my other dog will

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.949 
for one dog and my other dog will
probably<00:04:16.440> take<00:04:16.530> about<00:04:16.560> 500<00:04:17.370> pounds<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.840> we're

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
probably take about 500 pounds so we're

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.599 
probably take about 500 pounds so we're
looking<00:04:19.169> at<00:04:19.200> about<00:04:19.410> 1,200<00:04:20.070> pounds<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.459> dog

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
looking at about 1,200 pounds of dog

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.570 
looking at about 1,200 pounds of dog
food<00:04:20.669> per<00:04:21.329> year<00:04:21.650> so<00:04:22.650> it's<00:04:22.890> something<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.370> we

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
food per year so it's something that we

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.909 
food per year so it's something that we
need<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.820> consider<00:04:24.270> now<00:04:24.590> that's<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.710> lot<00:04:25.890> of

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
need to consider now that's a lot of

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.050 
need to consider now that's a lot of
storage<00:04:26.220> space

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
storage space

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.430 
storage space
and<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.420> need<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.600> buy<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.200> need<00:04:28.320> to

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
and you need to buy it and you need to

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.710 
and you need to buy it and you need to
rotate<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.920> what<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.000> want<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.240> do<00:04:30.330> is<00:04:30.450> leave

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
rotate it what you want to do is leave

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.350 
rotate it what you want to do is leave
the<00:04:30.750> dog<00:04:31.080> food<00:04:31.290> in<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.560> original<00:04:31.920> container

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
the dog food in the original container

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.690 
the dog food in the original container
these<00:04:33.360> have<00:04:34.080> plastic<00:04:34.560> liners<00:04:34.920> that<00:04:35.220> keeps<00:04:35.580> the

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
these have plastic liners that keeps the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.240 
these have plastic liners that keeps the
oxygen<00:04:35.850> oxygen<00:04:36.690> is<00:04:37.050> probably<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.070> worst

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
oxygen oxygen is probably the worst

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.700 
oxygen oxygen is probably the worst
thing<00:04:38.400> for<00:04:38.820> dog<00:04:39.240> food<00:04:39.510> so<00:04:40.170> leave<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.500> in<00:04:40.590> the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
thing for dog food so leave it in the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.760 
thing for dog food so leave it in the
container<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.370> then<00:04:41.850> place<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.330> in<00:04:42.510> a

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
container and then place this in a

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.390 
container and then place this in a
garbage<00:04:43.770> can

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400

galvanized garbage can or a 55-gallon

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.810 
galvanized garbage can or a 55-gallon
drum<00:04:46.350> but<00:04:46.890> leave<00:04:47.040> it<00:04:47.070> in<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.340> original

container<00:04:49.010> they<00:04:50.010> put<00:04:50.280> stuff<00:04:50.970> in<00:04:51.180> this<00:04:51.360> to

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
container they put stuff in this to

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.730 
container they put stuff in this to
preserve<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:53.540> preservatives<00:04:54.540> so<00:04:55.170> you<00:04:55.230> need<00:04:55.650> to

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
preserve it preservatives so you need to

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.560 
preserve it preservatives so you need to
look<00:04:55.860> on<00:04:56.010> your<00:04:56.160> label<00:04:56.340> vitamin<00:04:57.120> E<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.420> the

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
look on your label vitamin E is the

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.810 
look on your label vitamin E is the
natural<00:04:57.620> preservative<00:04:58.620> it<00:04:58.920> will<00:04:59.070> not<00:04:59.280> last<00:04:59.580> as

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
natural preservative it will not last as

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.080 
natural preservative it will not last as
long<00:05:00.030> as<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.390> chemical<00:05:01.490> preservatives<00:05:02.490> it's

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
long as the chemical preservatives it's

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.190 
long as the chemical preservatives it's
probably<00:05:03.480> a<00:05:03.510> little<00:05:03.570> bit<00:05:03.690> better<00:05:03.840> for<00:05:04.110> your

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200

the topic you guys are thinking about

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.360 
the topic you guys are thinking about
but<00:06:11.280> it's<00:06:11.460> probably<00:06:12.120> just<00:06:12.600> as<00:06:12.750> important<00:06:13.370> as

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
but it's probably just as important as

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.500

know forget about these things for a

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.620 
know forget about these things for a
little<00:06:20.340> bit<00:06:20.460> and<00:06:20.700> concentrate<00:06:21.360> on<00:06:21.479> the

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
little bit and concentrate on the

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.590 
little bit and concentrate on the
logistics<00:06:22.020> the<00:06:22.410> the<00:06:23.010> bread<00:06:23.280> and<00:06:23.430> butter<00:06:23.610> of<00:06:23.880> if

logistics the the bread and butter of if

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.760 
logistics the the bread and butter of if
you're<00:06:24.810> going<00:06:24.960> to<00:06:25.050> make<00:06:25.200> it<00:06:25.350> through
