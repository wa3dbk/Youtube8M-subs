00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.260
 the final of the international games fair in Essen and presented 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.540
 Stefan Stadler one of the two authors of the gates of the world a game on the 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.469
 based on the novel by Ken Follett 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.559
 exactly per meter 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.320
 as already said 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.320
 Literature is playing out and offering 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.619
 is the continuation of the pillars of the earth 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.609
 JPY 200 years later but also all figures that there is also the demand for 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.240
 whether art is normal 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.760
 I play an important role many 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.760
 from a and o 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.280
 because Roman or know 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.130
 the first game 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.109
 who caught Minden Much, of course, somehow 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:45.990
 Process gets underway 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.600
 better rooted Oppermann Brauksiepe not know by name 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.730
 it is 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.300
 in the game 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.580
 that actually has no parallels except Martin Kitze's setting speaks 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.450
 same place Kingsbridge pointed to the earth 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.570
 other game mechanics to completely different 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.480
 and how does the problem work on web users eg only and what there 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.940
 Doubt if watch noticed 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.130
 you have to play two very well and you can play as many as four players 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.240
 take part 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.880
 It takes so long 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.920
 Ben Arfa Monkey Group learns Robert is 90 minutes 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.969
 the game mechanisms 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.730
 or the whole thing relatively easy 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.730
 At the beginning of each round, one will be far better 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.760
 lived 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.650
 it is called the first of the text read and this event affects everyone 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.020
 player 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.020
 after that, the star player is able to get on the game board 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.270
 depending on who is hosting the card 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.600
 there is a come for every player that means you would adjust 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.320
 Piety Smart Connect and 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.040
 I am an apartment of players to a proper dress and to my left 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.940
 A stone 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.340
 I'm completely free in the decision I want to align here 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.280
 I prefer to put the card in the cereal 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.790
 of course 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.010
 next is looked 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.220
 this little arrows on the map 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.070
 therefore, a number is aligned that is the figure on the art 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.860
 achievements moves so much later and I get the appropriate art 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.860
 this attempt 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.389
 Turntable album played on an action page 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.309
 the action 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.459
 it is actually relatively self-explanatory for example here 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.459
 a split 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.669
 or 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.919
 Bantle Touch Germany will probably be in Touch Rome 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.919
 Percent actions are very easy to understand 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:42.029
 there are 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.129
 as in the book also committed four major in the game 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.069
 at the end of each chapter 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.079
 Mustache the various influence Bruckmann Kingsbridge 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.239
 To give an account of Blasik that means I have to 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.849
 then forms besides proves speaks 2 piety brand leave 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:04.719
 I have to feed my people speak two drinks percent give grain 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.899
 another parallel to pillars of the earth i have to pay taxes 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.839
 Of course, I'm royally with 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:14.759
 What if you can not do it? 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.549
 then you lose it 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.679
 And not only that, moreover, there is still a delicate punishment 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.699
 which is often much worse than the dumb victory points 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.929
 The goal of the game is of course to get back the most victory points 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.749
 and doing after a certain period of time or you can 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.249
 that's before he's not right back at the beginning of the game though 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.480
 is there something you can do with Lehman or more 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.569
 won in the first quarter of the championship 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:41.849
 more 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.749
 four passes are played each round consists of six rounds 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:50.019
 that means 24 actions paper then the game 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.759
 then the best game is change who then has the most points 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.699
 OT course in the lantern
