00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.430 
going on there isn't a lot of evidence
of<00:03:50.280> their<00:03:51.280> effect<00:03:51.700> on<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:52.390> city<00:03:52.600> maybe<00:03:53.200> that's

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
of their effect on the city maybe that's

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.500 
of their effect on the city maybe that's
just<00:03:53.620> because<00:03:53.800> Arkham<00:03:54.610> City<00:03:54.640> was<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:55.240> run<00:03:55.480> down

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
just because Arkham City was so run down

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:18.470 
just because Arkham City was so run down
to<00:03:55.750> begin<00:03:56.140> with

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.479 

and<00:04:19.480> it's<00:04:19.720> just<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.930> matter<00:04:19.959> of<00:04:20.340> continuing<00:04:21.340> to

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
and it's just a matter of continuing to

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:39.860 
and it's just a matter of continuing to
fly<00:04:21.730> round<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.570> scan<00:04:27.090> returning<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.180> base

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.250 

this<00:04:40.870> one's<00:04:41.110> got<00:04:41.320> it

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
this one's got it

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.900 
this one's got it
so<00:04:42.530> will<00:04:42.680> download<00:04:42.920> the<00:04:43.130> master<00:04:43.550> control

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
so will download the master control

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.690 
so will download the master control
program<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:45.380> that<00:04:45.650> will<00:04:45.860> die<00:04:46.040> citizen<00:04:46.550> under

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
program and that will die citizen under

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.290 
program and that will die citizen under

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
I've got the code i'm heading to wonder

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.460 
I've got the code i'm heading to wonder
tower<00:04:54.849> good<00:04:55.419> you're<00:04:55.840> doing<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.110> right<00:04:56.229> thing

tower good you're doing the right thing
the<00:04:57.310> code<00:04:57.610> should<00:04:57.879> let<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.150> interview<00:04:58.509> the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
the code should let you interview the

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.529 
the code should let you interview the
guard<00:04:59.020> room<00:04:59.229> near<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.560> main<00:04:59.830> gate<00:05:00.360> don't<00:05:01.360> lose

tell you a signal when I'm finished in

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.300 
tell you a signal when I'm finished in
the<00:05:03.909> tower<00:05:04.120> I'm<00:05:04.449> going<00:05:04.659> after<00:05:04.870> her<00:05:05.310> she

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
the tower I'm going after her she

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.610 
the tower I'm going after her she
doesn't<00:05:06.669> know<00:05:06.879> Joker<00:05:07.360> she's<00:05:08.319> out<00:05:08.470> of<00:05:08.500> her
