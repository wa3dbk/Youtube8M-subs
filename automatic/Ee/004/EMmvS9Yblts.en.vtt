00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
right kind of solve it on the tail but

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.639 
right kind of solve it on the tail but
kind<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> hanging<00:00:38.940> off<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> edge<00:00:39.469> is<00:00:40.469> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
kind of hanging off the edge is that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.180 
kind of hanging off the edge is that
when<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.860> get<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.640> spin<00:00:42.079> like<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.290> what

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
when you get the spin like that what

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.490 
when you get the spin like that what
your<00:00:44.280> foot<00:00:44.430> kind<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:44.850> comes<00:00:45.030> off<00:00:45.500> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
your foot kind of just comes off and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.319 
your foot kind of just comes off and
just<00:00:46.620> spin<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:48.510> very<00:00:48.750> end<00:00:50.030> look<00:00:51.030> something

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
just spin on the very end look something

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:01.400 
just spin on the very end look something
like<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:59.120> now<00:01:00.120> definitely<00:01:00.989> make<00:01:01.170> sure

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.340 

came<00:01:52.040> up<00:01:52.160> short<00:01:52.460> there<00:01:52.970> but<00:01:53.930> when<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.050> caught<00:01:54.320> it
