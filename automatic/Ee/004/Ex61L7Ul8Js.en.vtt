okay<00:00:00.930> I'm<00:00:01.230> gonna<00:00:01.469> draw<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.949> sign<00:00:02.220> up<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.669> now

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.170 
okay I'm gonna draw a sign up this now

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:10.660 
okay I'm gonna draw a sign up this now
here<00:00:04.170> we<00:00:04.319> go

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.520 

droid<00:00:11.670> green<00:00:12.150> marker<00:00:12.570> pen<00:00:12.780> because<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.200> won't

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
droid green marker pen because it won't

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:28.560 
droid green marker pen because it won't
be<00:00:13.740> bit<00:00:14.089> that's<00:00:15.089> hard<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:16.109> see<00:00:17.720> okay

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.260 

thank<00:00:29.570> us<00:00:29.750> moving<00:00:32.950> these<00:00:33.950> things<00:00:34.430> on<00:00:34.700> dry<00:00:34.880> hair

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
thank us moving these things on dry hair

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:48.080 
thank us moving these things on dry hair
there<00:00:35.540> are<00:00:35.660> receptors

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.520 

and<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.900> here<00:00:49.560> is<00:00:49.800> an<00:00:50.550> auto<00:00:50.850> receptor<00:00:51.750> is

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and this here is an auto receptor is

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:02.060 
and this here is an auto receptor is
easy<00:00:53.400> to<00:00:53.910> synaptic<00:00:54.500> vesicles<00:00:59.930> okay<00:01:00.930> though<00:01:01.860> we

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
easy to synaptic vesicles okay though we

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.150 
easy to synaptic vesicles okay though we
label<00:01:02.610> it<00:01:03.620> say<00:01:04.620> full<00:01:05.190> panel<00:01:05.790> my<00:01:05.940> round<00:01:07.130> okay

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
label it say full panel my round okay

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.490 
label it say full panel my round okay
this<00:01:08.550> here<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.730> dendrite<00:01:11.930> may<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.140> value

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
this here is the dendrite may be a value

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.340 
this here is the dendrite may be a value
for<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.830> capital<00:01:14.520> de<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:17.000> right-wing<00:01:18.890> spell

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
for this capital de and right-wing spell

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:36.760 
for this capital de and right-wing spell
dendrite<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:26.479> is<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.700> m3<00:01:30.080> tick<00:01:33.500> stop

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.040 

tender<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.070> dope<00:01:38.430> okay

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:51.700 

these<00:01:43.050> as<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.440> just<00:01:43.680> said<00:01:44.180> that's<00:01:45.180> very<00:01:47.509> sector

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:03.370 

receptor<00:01:54.320> this<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:56.810> also<00:01:57.810> receptor<00:01:59.240> Auto

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:18.130 

reset<00:02:05.360> tour<00:02:08.869> these<00:02:09.869> are<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.690> know<00:02:13.970> take

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:28.030 

vesicles<00:02:21.830> these<00:02:22.830> little<00:02:23.250> dots<00:02:23.520> here<00:02:24.110> see<00:02:25.110> this

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.240 

these<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:30.810> actual<00:02:31.560> round<00:02:31.830> thing<00:02:32.340> here<00:02:33.110> is

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
these this actual round thing here is

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:44.240 
these this actual round thing here is
the<00:02:36.200> axon<00:02:37.640> terminal<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:43.020> absolute<00:02:43.530> terminal

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
the axon terminal the absolute terminal

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.570 
the axon terminal the absolute terminal
and<00:02:45.120> all<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.290> space<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.680> here<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:50.570> the

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
and all this space in here is the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:02.720 
and all this space in here is the
synaptic<00:02:54.890> why<00:02:55.890> not<00:02:56.360> take<00:02:57.500> crap<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.460> do<00:03:02.700> that

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
synaptic why not take crap so to do that

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.870 
synaptic why not take crap so to do that
again<00:03:03.120> these<00:03:03.690> are<00:03:04.070> these<00:03:05.070> little<00:03:05.130> dots<00:03:05.670> in

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
again these are these little dots in

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.970 
again these are these little dots in
here<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.210> synaptic<00:03:06.650> vesicles<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:08.580> isn't
