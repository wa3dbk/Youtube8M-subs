00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
flip the template around like so along

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.230 
flip the template around like so along
the<00:01:54.990> way<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.380> cut<00:01:56.130> out<00:01:56.159> nine<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> large

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the way I cut out nine of the large

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.440 
the way I cut out nine of the large
petals<00:01:57.570> six<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> medium<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.369> ten<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
petals six of the medium and ten of the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.330 
petals six of the medium and ten of the
little<00:02:00.719> ones<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.950> use<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
little ones you don't have to use the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.389 
little ones you don't have to use the
same<00:02:02.700> exact<00:02:03.270> amount<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.960> use<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.130> just

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
same exact amount I use this is just

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.169 
same exact amount I use this is just
what<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.790> felt<00:02:06.030> worked<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.600> me<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.140> get<00:02:07.710> free

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
what I felt worked for me so get free

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.359 
what I felt worked for me so get free
and<00:02:08.359> do<00:02:08.929> whatever<00:02:09.109> you<00:02:09.289> like<00:02:09.769> but<00:02:09.979> this<00:02:10.219> is

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
and do whatever you like but this is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.849 
and do whatever you like but this is
just<00:02:10.399> my<00:02:10.819> foundation<00:02:11.510> on<00:02:11.629> how<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.409> get<00:02:12.680> started

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
just my foundation on how to get started

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.410 
just my foundation on how to get started
so<00:02:15.859> now<00:02:16.040> it's<00:02:16.219> time<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.519> start<00:02:16.879> building<00:02:17.329> up

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
so now it's time to start building up

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.140 
so now it's time to start building up

of the angles sticking out repeat this

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.690 
of the angles sticking out repeat this
for<00:02:39.139> the<00:02:39.170> other<00:02:39.319> two<00:02:39.560> petals<00:02:42.310> next<00:02:43.310> it's<00:02:43.519> time

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
for the other two petals next it's time

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.379 
for the other two petals next it's time
to<00:02:44.180> layer<00:02:44.659> one<00:02:45.169> on<00:02:45.379> top<00:02:45.829> of<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.159> other<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.700> will

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
to layer one on top of the other I will

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.839 
to layer one on top of the other I will
be<00:02:47.510> forming<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.049> bud<00:02:48.290> as<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:49.099> can<00:02:49.280> see<00:02:49.549> I'm

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
be forming a bud as you can see I'm

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.750 
be forming a bud as you can see I'm
taking<00:02:50.209> each<00:02:50.599> cone<00:02:51.079> I<00:02:51.349> made<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.919> topping<00:02:52.639> it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
taking each cone I made and topping it

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.050 
taking each cone I made and topping it
one<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.389> the<00:02:53.659> other<00:02:53.840> almost<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.919> a<00:02:54.950> tulip<00:02:55.400> you

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
one on the other almost like a tulip you

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.030 
one on the other almost like a tulip you
want<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.329> petal<00:02:56.659> to<00:02:56.689> be<00:02:56.900> placed<00:02:57.200> evenly<00:02:57.799> all

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
want the petal to be placed evenly all

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.429 
want the petal to be placed evenly all
around<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.700> base<00:03:01.419> as<00:03:02.419> I'm<00:03:02.689> going<00:03:02.900> towards<00:03:03.379> the

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
around the base as I'm going towards the

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.530 
around the base as I'm going towards the
center<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.829> the<00:03:04.040> bud<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.609> want<00:03:04.939> to<00:03:05.120> make<00:03:05.359> a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
center of the bud I want to make a

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.589 
center of the bud I want to make a
smaller<00:03:06.079> triangle<00:03:06.889> so<00:03:07.129> that<00:03:07.159> way<00:03:07.579> the<00:03:08.090> inside

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
smaller triangle so that way the inside

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.229 
smaller triangle so that way the inside
of<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.049> bud<00:03:09.230> can<00:03:09.500> look<00:03:09.709> smaller<00:03:10.099> so<00:03:10.730> basically

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
of the bud can look smaller so basically

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.360 
of the bud can look smaller so basically
what<00:03:11.569> you<00:03:11.689> will<00:03:11.810> need<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:11.989> do<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.530> just<00:03:12.919> trim

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
what you will need to do is just trim

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.520 
what you will need to do is just trim
your<00:03:13.579> existing<00:03:14.060> triangle<00:03:14.629> to<00:03:15.049> make<00:03:15.079> it<00:03:15.379> look

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
your existing triangle to make it look

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.520 
your existing triangle to make it look
smaller<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:17.239> I'm<00:03:17.359> basically<00:03:17.540> doing<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.260> same

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
smaller so I'm basically doing the same

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.500 
smaller so I'm basically doing the same
thing<00:03:18.799> here<00:03:19.099> except<00:03:19.519> I'm<00:03:19.639> just<00:03:19.879> making<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.359> in

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
thing here except I'm just making it in

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.439 
thing here except I'm just making it in
a<00:03:20.629> smaller<00:03:21.049> form<00:03:21.500> as<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:22.280> go<00:03:22.519> in<00:03:22.760> toward<00:03:23.359> the

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
a smaller form as I go in toward the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:27.009 
a smaller form as I go in toward the
center<00:03:24.609> now<00:03:25.609> it's<00:03:25.909> time<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.209> take<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.659> rest<00:03:26.870> of

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
center now it's time to take the rest of

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.379 
center now it's time to take the rest of
the<00:03:27.109> small<00:03:27.349> triangles<00:03:27.979> put<00:03:28.639> two<00:03:28.849> dabs<00:03:29.150> of<00:03:29.329> hot

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
the small triangles put two dabs of hot

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.929 
the small triangles put two dabs of hot
glue<00:03:29.720> on<00:03:30.079> the<00:03:30.169> inside<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:30.949> triangle<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.699> then

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
glue on the inside of triangle and then

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.629 
glue on the inside of triangle and then
pinch<00:03:32.389> the<00:03:32.479> sides<00:03:32.959> in<00:03:33.290> together<00:03:33.650> just<00:03:34.129> like

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
pinch the sides in together just like

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.999 
pinch the sides in together just like
how<00:03:34.970> I'm<00:03:35.030> doing<00:03:35.419> it<00:03:35.510> right<00:03:35.689> here<00:03:36.049> this<00:03:36.829> will

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:37.009 
how I'm doing it right here this will

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.839 
how I'm doing it right here this will
give<00:03:37.189> the<00:03:37.400> petal<00:03:37.699> volume<00:03:38.269> and<00:03:38.479> texture<00:03:39.849> after

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
give the petal volume and texture after

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.550 
give the petal volume and texture after
making<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.180> petals<00:03:41.540> glue<00:03:42.019> them<00:03:42.259> to<00:03:42.530> the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
making the petals glue them to the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.460 
making the petals glue them to the
bottom<00:03:42.979> of<00:03:43.129> the<00:03:43.280> flower<00:03:43.549> cup<00:03:44.449> one<00:03:44.840> by<00:03:45.169> one

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
bottom of the flower cup one by one

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.249 
bottom of the flower cup one by one
alternating<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.489> tops<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:47.209> make<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.930> look

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:48.259 
alternating the tops to make it look

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.999 
alternating the tops to make it look
like<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.919> flower<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.909> can<00:03:50.900> also<00:03:51.169> do<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:51.949> by

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:52.009 
like a flower you can also do this by

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:54.219 
like a flower you can also do this by
flipping<00:03:52.639> the<00:03:52.819> bud<00:03:53.000> upside<00:03:53.449> down<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:54.019> then

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:54.229 
flipping the bud upside down and then

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:58.850 
flipping the bud upside down and then
glue<00:03:54.650> around<00:03:54.979> the<00:03:55.069> bottom<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.579> it

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:16.020 

you
