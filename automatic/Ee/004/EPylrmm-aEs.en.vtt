out<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.170> me<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.590> it'll<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.460> easier<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.090> manage

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420

lubricated
while<00:00:40.950> I'm<00:00:41.250> doing<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> other<00:00:42.000> twists<00:00:42.920> slash

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.020 
while I'm doing the other twists slash
braids<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.480> sometimes<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.020> twists<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
braids but sometimes I do twists and

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.330 
braids but sometimes I do twists and
this<00:00:48.030> routine<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.660> very<00:00:48.719> similar<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.559> my<00:00:50.010> old

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
this routine is very similar to my old

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
this routine is very similar to my old
LOC<00:00:50.879> methods<00:00:51.390> I've<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.870> changed<00:00:52.320> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
LOC methods I've just changed it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.189 
LOC methods I've just changed it
slightly<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> changes<00:00:54.239> we

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
slightly this is one of the changes we

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.369 
slightly this is one of the changes we
just<00:00:55.500> put<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> moisturizer<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.820> over

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
just put in the moisturizer all over

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
just put in the moisturizer all over
doing<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.530> method<00:00:58.949> also<00:00:59.129> helps<00:00:59.579> me<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.879> to

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
doing this method also helps me not to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.819 
doing this method also helps me not to
be<00:01:00.149> too<00:01:00.420> heavy-handed<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:01.530> I've<00:01:01.649> noticed

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
be too heavy-handed because I've noticed

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.700 
be too heavy-handed because I've noticed
when<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> applied<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.210> leave-in<00:01:03.899> section<00:01:04.559> by

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.010 
section I use quite a lot of products on
that<00:01:07.860> section<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.510> trying<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that section so I'm just trying to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.399

improve<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:12.060> low<00:01:12.270> porosity<00:01:12.540> hair<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.290> it

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
improve I have low porosity hair so it

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.899 
improve I have low porosity hair so it
takes<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.740> while<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.220> perks<00:01:14.490> are<00:01:14.610> actually

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
takes a while for the perks are actually

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.030 
takes a while for the perks are actually
absorbed<00:01:15.689> into<00:01:15.780> my<00:01:15.990> hair<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.740> does

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
absorbed into my hair so it does

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.899 
absorbed into my hair so it does
actually<00:01:17.220> sit<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.820> top<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.150> my<00:01:19.340> strands<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
takes what actually penetrate but it's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.070
