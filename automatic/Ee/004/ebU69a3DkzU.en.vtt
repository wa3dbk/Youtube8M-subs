 to hear it he does not use the trip 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.960
 yet it is necessary in a 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.390
 car the clutch is located between the

 the pedal 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.909
 this one rocks leads the cables that

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.039
 crashes against the spring the spring gets 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.549
 deforms and pushes the pressure disc 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:14.470
 releasing the clutch disc the wheels 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.640
 stops while the motor continues 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.620
 to turn 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.750
 releasing the pedal mechanism 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.240

 new engine-related year trips 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.990
 also allow to handle the box of 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.930
 speeds it allows to spend the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.450
 speeds to speed up and slow down the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.220
 first is used to start and the second 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.530
 allows to give enough speed for 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.800
 go into third and at that time 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.550
 accelerated there mister dupont should 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.259
 really spend the second 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.650
 but definitely Mr. dupont and 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.650
