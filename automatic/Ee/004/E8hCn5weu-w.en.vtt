you have the research to vibranium frag
grenade<00:01:53.650> in<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:54.130> lab<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:55.300> going<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.750> take

grenade in the lab it's going to take

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.460 
grenade in the lab it's going to take
eight<00:01:56.200> hours<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:56.980> forty<00:01:57.640> unstable<00:01:58.330> a<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:58.480> also

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
eight hours and forty unstable a so also

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.270 
eight hours and forty unstable a so also
you<00:01:59.950> will<00:02:00.280> need<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:00.520> item<00:02:00.970> for<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.210> later<00:02:01.450> task
