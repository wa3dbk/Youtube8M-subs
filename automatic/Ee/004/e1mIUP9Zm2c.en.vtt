 interior and justice in our 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.290
 president is very aware of 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.360
 been in communication asking how 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.740

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.979
 the two sectors of government ordering 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.050
 supporting her to care for people who are 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.650
 the fundamental thing we have more than nine thousand 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.820
 affected families we have those are some 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.280
 36 thousand people approximately but it is 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.630
 a problem 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.240
 atypical a flood here in the year 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.540
 2002 but this has a characteristic 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.119
 different is greater the flood is greater 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.340
 well we are working we just 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.330
 make a flyover by the river bolus 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.630
 salares and arauca we saw what 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.310
 we have felt that it is descending very 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.620
 slowly but it 's descending from 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.780
 water level however is 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.240
 leaving water for some places and still 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.850
 is entering by another but we 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.070
 we think that in the next few hours this 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.380
 should stabilize and should start then 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.860
 the eviction of water 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.520
 and the attention that comes after that 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.470
 because it is necessary to contribute with the 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.010
 people to repair their houses to 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.010
 clean it we are going to make a 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.530
 proposition we already told the colonel that 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.620
 is that steals color savings in a 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.830
 proposition to our president for 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.190
 carry with color values ​​so 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.190
 Massive then attend the class saves
