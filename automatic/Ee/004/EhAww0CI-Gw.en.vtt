solo<00:01:40.420> lead<00:01:40.600> climbing<00:01:40.930> is<00:01:41.170> basically<00:01:41.560> just<00:01:41.710> a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
solo lead climbing is basically just a

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.490 
solo lead climbing is basically just a
small<00:01:42.340> step<00:01:42.610> below<00:01:42.820> free<00:01:43.270> solo<00:01:43.689> so<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.229> would

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
small step below free solo so I would

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.370 
small step below free solo so I would
recommend<00:01:45.219> actually<00:01:45.460> having<00:01:46.060> some<00:01:46.270> real<00:01:46.990> easy

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
recommend actually having some real easy

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.499 
recommend actually having some real easy
free<00:01:48.009> solo<00:01:48.250> experience<00:01:48.549> which<00:01:49.090> gives<00:01:49.390> you

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
free solo experience which gives you

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.109 
free solo experience which gives you
that<00:01:49.649> mentality<00:01:50.649> of<00:01:50.979> how<00:01:51.009> not<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.399> fall<00:01:51.789> and

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
that mentality of how not to fall and

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.649 
that mentality of how not to fall and
how<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.689> remain<00:01:53.110> calm<00:01:53.469> in<00:01:54.060> slightly<00:01:55.060> dangerous

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
how to remain calm in slightly dangerous

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.020 
how to remain calm in slightly dangerous
situations<00:01:56.320> but<00:01:56.829> if<00:01:57.460> you<00:01:57.640> do<00:01:57.759> everything

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
situations but if you do everything

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.490 
situations but if you do everything
right<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:59.380> relatively<00:02:00.009> safe<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:01.659> all<00:02:02.320> right

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
right it's relatively safe but all right

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.240 
right it's relatively safe but all right
let's<00:02:03.159> get<00:02:03.310> to

all right so here's a gear list of

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.070 
all right so here's a gear list of
basically<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> minimalist<00:02:13.880> setup<00:02:14.330> for<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> rope

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
basically a minimalist setup for a rope

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.990 
basically a minimalist setup for a rope
so<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.620> need<00:02:15.740> your<00:02:15.950> shoes<00:02:16.280> chalk

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
harness rope I like a 60 meter rope with

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.910 
harness rope I like a 60 meter rope with
a<00:02:21.500> ten<00:02:22.190> point<00:02:22.430> something<00:02:22.970> it's<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.390> good

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
a ten point something it's a good

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.350 
a ten point something it's a good
diameter<00:02:24.920> that'll<00:02:25.220> work<00:02:25.790> well<00:02:26.030> with<00:02:26.240> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
diameter that'll work well with the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.250
