00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
going inside of that but in fact you

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.400 
going inside of that but in fact you
just<00:02:50.519> push<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.060> into<00:02:51.889> this<00:02:52.889> gap<00:02:53.190> right<00:02:54.180> here

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
just push it into this gap right here

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.069

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.039 
the selected cap now you place the two
jokers<00:03:16.859> again<00:03:17.220> facing<00:03:17.519> out<00:03:17.760> on<00:03:17.880> top<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.389> as
