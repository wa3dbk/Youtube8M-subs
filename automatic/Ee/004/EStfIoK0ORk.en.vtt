00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
completely crazy so I think I might have

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.300 
completely crazy so I think I might have
broken<00:02:47.310> down<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.730> tears<00:02:47.910> at<00:02:48.270> one<00:02:48.420> point<00:02:49.310> but

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
broken down in tears at one point but

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.190 
broken down in tears at one point but
they<00:02:50.700> really<00:02:50.880> say<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.570> if<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.870> cannot

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
they really say that if you cannot

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.130 
they really say that if you cannot
handle<00:02:52.710> a<00:02:52.950> wait<00:02:53.520> time<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.720> need<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.990> just

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
handle a wait time that you need to just

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.620 
handle a wait time that you need to just
hit<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.650> order<00:02:56.070> button<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.700> just<00:02:57.090> forget

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
hit that order button and just forget

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
my mind I was screaming running around

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.660 
my mind I was screaming running around
the<00:03:35.730> house<00:03:35.940> carrying<00:03:36.690> her<00:03:36.990> around<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.860> I

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
the house carrying her around and I

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.910 
the house carrying her around and I
didn't<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.330> want<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.959> put<00:03:40.170> her<00:03:40.200> down<00:03:40.560> when

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
didn't like want to put her down when

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.830 
didn't like want to put her down when
she<00:03:40.980> was<00:03:41.280> finally<00:03:41.520> home<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.240> did<00:03:42.420> not<00:03:42.540> want<00:03:42.780> to

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
she was finally home I did not want to

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.710 
she was finally home I did not want to
wake<00:03:42.930> up<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.820> think<00:03:44.820> that<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.150> was<00:03:45.270> a<00:03:45.330> really

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
wake up and think that it was a really

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.230 
wake up and think that it was a really
bad<00:03:45.930> dream<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.920> was<00:03:47.130> one<00:03:47.430> time<00:03:47.790> whenever

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
bad dream so that was one time whenever

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.890 
bad dream so that was one time whenever
I<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:48.720> obsessed<00:03:49.530> over<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:50.010> doll<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.900> that's

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
I just obsessed over a doll and that's

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.330 
I just obsessed over a doll and that's
probably<00:03:52.230> not<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.440> best<00:03:52.560> way<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.070> go<00:03:53.310> about

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
probably not the best way to go about

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.910 
probably not the best way to go about
waiting<00:03:53.850> but<00:03:54.180> some<00:03:54.420> people<00:03:54.750> really<00:03:55.050> like<00:03:55.470> that

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
waiting but some people really like that

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.890 
waiting but some people really like that
period<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.490> time<00:03:56.670> before<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.360> doll<00:03:57.540> is<00:03:57.570> home

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
period of time before the doll is home

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.290 
period of time before the doll is home
because<00:03:58.740> you<00:03:58.770> get<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.220> plan<00:03:59.490> how<00:03:59.880> you<00:03:59.940> want

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
because you get the plan how you want

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.330 
because you get the plan how you want
the<00:04:00.390> doll<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.810> look<00:04:01.080> what<00:04:01.830> kind<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.100> clothes

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
the doll to look what kind of clothes

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.460 
the doll to look what kind of clothes
you're<00:04:02.580> going<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.760> buy<00:04:02.910> for<00:04:02.970> them<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:04.050> get<00:04:04.290> to

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
you're going to buy for them you get to

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.320 
you're going to buy for them you get to
bond<00:04:04.830> with<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.340> doll<00:04:05.580> before<00:04:05.820> they're<00:04:06.300> even

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
bond with the doll before they're even
