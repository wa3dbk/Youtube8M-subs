it<00:00:46.800> since<00:00:46.829> probably<00:00:47.250> i<00:00:47.700> want<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> say<00:00:48.090> day<00:00:48.300> one

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
it since probably i want to say day one

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.270 
it since probably i want to say day one
I<00:00:48.570> guess<00:00:49.489> GTA<00:00:50.489> 5<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.840> declining<00:00:51.920> mainly<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.129> has

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I guess GTA 5 is declining mainly it has

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.520 
I guess GTA 5 is declining mainly it has
to<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> fact<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.719> DLCs<00:00:55.320> have

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
to do with the fact that the DLCs have

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.150 
to do with the fact that the DLCs have
been<00:00:55.739> very<00:00:56.239> mediocre<00:00:57.239> at<00:00:57.719> best<00:00:57.829> at<00:00:58.829> least<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
been very mediocre at best at least the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.560 
been very mediocre at best at least the
past<00:00:59.370> two<00:00:59.760> have<00:01:00.149> been<00:01:00.359> pretty<00:01:00.780> bad<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:02.570> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
past two have been pretty bad and it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.700 
past two have been pretty bad and it
seems<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.140> don't<00:01:04.260> know<00:01:04.439> what's<00:01:04.619> gonna

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
seems like we don't know what's gonna

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.530 
seems like we don't know what's gonna
happen<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.159> GTA<00:01:05.489> 5<00:01:05.760> now<00:01:06.000> some<00:01:06.180> people<00:01:06.299> are

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
getting repetitive to the point where

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.120 
getting repetitive to the point where
all<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.140> really<00:01:25.409> go<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:25.890> money

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
you know pretty much getting over it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.440 
you know pretty much getting over it
within<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.860> matter<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.399> two<00:01:44.759> hours<00:01:44.939> I

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
within the matter of about two hours I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.090 
within the matter of about two hours I
was<00:01:45.630> over<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.289> I<00:01:46.380> thought<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.740> was<00:01:46.860> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
was over it and I thought it was a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.219 
was over it and I thought it was a
terrible<00:01:48.000> DLC<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> didn't<00:01:48.929> think<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.170> was

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
terrible DLC I didn't think it was

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.980 
terrible DLC I didn't think it was
anything<00:01:49.560> great<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.299> feel<00:01:51.960> that

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
anything great and I really feel that

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.029 
anything great and I really feel that
for<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.500> next<00:01:52.530> update<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.759> one<00:01:54.030> point<00:01:54.679> 17<00:01:55.679> I

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
for the next update for one point 17 I

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.249 
for the next update for one point 17 I
really<00:01:56.880> feel<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.090> Rockstar<00:01:57.659> needs<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.049> pull

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
really feel that Rockstar needs to pull

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.950 
really feel that Rockstar needs to pull
out<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> big<00:01:58.649> guns<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.280> unload<00:01:59.700> a<00:02:00.030> massive

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
they haven't been this great quality so

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.689 
they haven't been this great quality so
my<00:04:25.880> question<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.360> you<00:04:26.539> is<00:04:26.900> what<00:04:27.889> what<00:04:28.400> type<00:04:28.669> of

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
my question to you is what what type of

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.420 
my question to you is what what type of
DLC<00:04:29.419> and<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:30.050> don't<00:04:30.229> mean<00:04:30.349> just<00:04:30.409> like<00:04:31.130> an

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
DLC and I don't mean just like an

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.149 
DLC and I don't mean just like an
expanded<00:04:32.180> DLC<00:04:32.690> but<00:04:32.990> like<00:04:33.139> sort<00:04:33.380> of<00:04:33.470> give<00:04:33.949> me<00:04:33.979> a

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:34.159

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:36.339 
expanded DLC but like sort of give me a
better<00:04:34.460> idea<00:04:34.699> of<00:04:35.000> what<00:04:35.360> you<00:04:35.539> guys<00:04:35.690> want<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.169> see

as<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.970> DLC<00:04:37.970> that<00:04:38.180> would<00:04:38.389> be<00:04:38.570> really<00:04:38.840> big<00:04:39.289> and<00:04:39.560> be

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
as a DLC that would be really big and be
