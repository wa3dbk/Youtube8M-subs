and<00:00:01.110> then<00:00:01.350> what<00:00:01.890> we<00:00:01.979> do<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.340> we<00:00:02.850> just<00:00:03.030> very

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
and then what we do is we just very

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.720 
and then what we do is we just very
simply<00:00:03.540> we<00:00:03.840> know<00:00:04.080> what<00:00:04.859> these<00:00:05.009> are<00:00:05.069> now<00:00:05.400> where

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
simply we know what these are now where

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.860 
simply we know what these are now where
the<00:00:05.790> placeholders<00:00:06.299> are<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.629> we're<00:00:06.750> just

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
the placeholders are and we're just

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.900 
the placeholders are and we're just
going<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.109> really<00:00:07.379> easily<00:00:07.589> convert<00:00:08.099> them<00:00:08.280> so

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
going to really easily convert them so

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.180 
going to really easily convert them so
very<00:00:09.330> simply<00:00:09.599> 128<00:00:10.590> we're<00:00:10.830> going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> use<00:00:11.160> that

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
very simply 128 we're going to use that

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.070 
very simply 128 we're going to use that
we<00:00:11.550> won't<00:00:11.730> use<00:00:11.880> 64<00:00:12.210> will<00:00:12.599> use<00:00:12.719> 32<00:00:13.670> 32<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.120> 16<00:00:15.990> we

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
we won't use 64 will use 32 32 and 16 we

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.390 
we won't use 64 will use 32 32 and 16 we
won't<00:00:16.199> use<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.529> will<00:00:16.650> use<00:00:16.770> 8<00:00:17.330> we<00:00:18.330> will<00:00:18.480> use<00:00:18.600> for

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
won't use we will use 8 we will use for

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.920 
won't use we will use 8 we will use for
ok<00:00:20.400> that's<00:00:20.670> an<00:00:20.789> eight<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> writing's<00:00:21.779> not

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
ok that's an eight and the writing's not

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.500 
ok that's an eight and the writing's not
very<00:00:22.109> good<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:23.279> will<00:00:23.460> use<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.330> won't

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
very good and we will use to we won't

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.630 
very good and we will use to we won't
use<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> one<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.800> very<00:00:26.070> simply<00:00:26.250> add

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
use a one and you just very simply add

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.819 
use a one and you just very simply add
them<00:00:27.330> up<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.779> these<00:00:27.930> 26<00:00:29.420> ok<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.720> then<00:00:31.820> 14<00:00:32.820> 16

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
them up so these 26 ok and then 14 16

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:44.119 
them up so these 26 ok and then 14 16
plus<00:00:34.829> 8<00:00:35.300> you<00:00:36.300> get<00:00:36.450> 24<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:39.710> ok<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.800> then<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:43.129> 71

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
plus 8 you get 24 so ok and then for 71

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:54.819 
plus 8 you get 24 so ok and then for 71
74<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.950> 174<00:00:47.180> is<00:00:48.379> equivalent<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.469> 10<00:00:50.460> 10<00:00:50.899> 11<00:00:51.899> 10

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.619 

ok<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.610> that's<00:00:56.850> how<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.090> convert<00:00:57.360> back

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
ok so that's that's how you convert back

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.410 
ok so that's that's how you convert back
so<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.590> back<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.070> even<00:00:59.309> easier<00:00:59.520> than

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
so it's going back is even easier than

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
so it's going back is even easier than
converting<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.140> binary<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.980> from

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
converting to binary so going from

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.380 
converting to binary so going from
buying<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.670> teacher<00:01:02.850> gives<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> binary

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
buying if the teacher gives you a binary

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.390 
buying if the teacher gives you a binary
number<00:01:03.840> great<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.680> put<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
number great you just put it in and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.980 
number great you just put it in and
gives<00:01:05.760> your<00:01:05.909> decimal<00:01:06.330> number<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.750> by<00:01:06.840> using

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
gives your decimal number just by using

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.750 
gives your decimal number just by using
your<00:01:07.200> chart<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.729> remember

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
your chart and all you have to remember

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.880 
your chart and all you have to remember
for<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> chart<00:01:09.540> good<00:01:10.049> way<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> remember<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.590> so

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
for the chart good way to remember it so

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.750 
for the chart good way to remember it so
you<00:01:11.100> don't<00:01:11.130> forget<00:01:11.400> very<00:01:12.240> simply<00:01:13.220> base<00:01:14.220> 2<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you don't forget very simply base 2 to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.060 
you don't forget very simply base 2 to
the<00:01:14.790> power<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.090> 0<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.390> 1<00:01:15.680> double<00:01:16.680> every<00:01:16.890> time

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the power of 0 is 1 double every time

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.950 
the power of 0 is 1 double every time
keep<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.939> keep<00:01:18.060> Dublin<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:18.810> all

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
keep going just keep Dublin that's all

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.620 
keep going just keep Dublin that's all
you<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.860> very<00:01:20.009> fast<00:01:20.630> using

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
you do and this is very fast using

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.870 
you do and this is very fast using
division<00:01:22.140> i<00:01:22.259> found<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.369> when<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.700> into

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
division i found that when you get into

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.789 
division i found that when you get into
more<00:01:24.119> advanced<00:01:24.390> topics<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.020> use<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> vision

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
more advanced topics and use the vision

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.039 
more advanced topics and use the vision
to<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.040> these<00:01:26.189> kinds<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.610> things<00:01:26.900> division<00:01:27.900> is

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
to do these kinds of things division is

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.770 
to do these kinds of things division is
too<00:01:28.409> slow<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.159> too<00:01:29.400> messy<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.060> when

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
too slow and it's too messy to when

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.940 
too slow and it's too messy to when
you're<00:01:30.900> dividing<00:01:31.200> I've<00:01:31.500> seen<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:31.799> other

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you're dividing I've seen some other

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.499 
you're dividing I've seen some other
some<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> videos<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.119> what<00:01:33.270> my

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
some of the videos and this is what my

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.149 
some of the videos and this is what my
teacher<00:01:33.689> taught<00:01:33.960> me<00:01:34.140> originally<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
teacher taught me originally to to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.620 
teacher taught me originally to to
divide<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.520> well<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.000> don't<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:36.570> that's

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
divide as well but I don't think that's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.030 
divide as well but I don't think that's
a<00:01:36.750> good<00:01:36.780> idea<00:01:36.960> when<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.740> into<00:01:37.890> more

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
a good idea when you get into more

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.469 
a good idea when you get into more
advanced<00:01:38.400> classes<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.880> take<00:01:39.090> more<00:01:39.270> advanced

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
advanced classes you take more advanced

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.149 
advanced classes you take more advanced
computer<00:01:39.869> science<00:01:40.140> classes<00:01:40.350> you're<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
computer science classes you're going to

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.160 
computer science classes you're going to
see<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> division<00:01:41.729> takes<00:01:41.909> too<00:01:42.119> long<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.570> it's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
see a division takes too long and it's

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.410 
see a division takes too long and it's
too<00:01:43.350> error-prone<00:01:43.710> whereas<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.060> method

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
too error-prone whereas this this method

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.580 
too error-prone whereas this this method
here<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.799> know<00:01:46.890> very<00:01:47.100> simple

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
here with just you know very simple

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.929 
here with just you know very simple
addition<00:01:49.590> subtraction<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.520> convert<00:01:50.820> between

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
addition subtraction to convert between

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.569 
addition subtraction to convert between
them<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.450> extremely<00:01:52.290> easy<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.799> also<00:01:53.340> too<00:01:53.399> if

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
them is extremely easy and also too if

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.580 
them is extremely easy and also too if
you<00:01:53.670> want<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> convert<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.390> hexadecimal<00:01:55.020> it's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you want to convert to hexadecimal it's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.800 
you want to convert to hexadecimal it's
it's<00:01:56.520> extremely<00:01:57.149> easy<00:01:57.270> once<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it's extremely easy once you have a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.690 
it's extremely easy once you have a
number<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.140> binary<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.040> did<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.399> all<00:01:59.520> my

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
number in binary what I did in all my

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.050 
number in binary what I did in all my
classes<00:01:59.759> when<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> had<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.200> convert<00:02:01.439> numbers

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
classes when I had to convert numbers

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.219 
classes when I had to convert numbers
between<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.479> would<00:02:03.659> always<00:02:03.840> put<00:02:04.020> them<00:02:04.140> in

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
between I would always put them in

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.539 
between I would always put them in
binary<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.829> then<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.130> read<00:02:05.310> them<00:02:05.399> off

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
binary and then just read them off

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.399 
binary and then just read them off

convert<00:02:07.799> from<00:02:08.069> from<00:02:09.000> decimal<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.420> hexadecimal

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
convert from from decimal to hexadecimal

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.290 
convert from from decimal to hexadecimal

it's extremely easy once you get the
number<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.659> binary<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.470> use<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.830> for

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
number in binary you just use this for

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.160 
number in binary you just use this for
the<00:02:17.159> hexadecimal<00:02:17.549> representation<00:02:18.269> but<00:02:19.049> i'll
