the hideous amalgamation off tank should
tank<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> corrupted<00:00:57.480> Bloods<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
tank all of the corrupted Bloods that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.279 
tank all of the corrupted Bloods that
spawn<00:00:58.820> thereafter<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.600> once<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.930> kill<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.230> of

the one of the tentacles basically the
first<00:01:03.239> thing<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> happen<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
first thing is going to happen is the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.570 
first thing is going to happen is the
hideous<00:01:04.559> amalgamation<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> show<00:01:05.430> up

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
hideous amalgamation is going to show up

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550 
hideous amalgamation is going to show up
then<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> will<00:01:06.240> repeatedly<00:01:06.600> spawn<00:01:07.020> corrupted

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
then it will repeatedly spawn corrupted

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
then it will repeatedly spawn corrupted
Bloods<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.150> over<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
corrupted Bloods up here and once they

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
corrupted Bloods up here and once they
die<00:01:12.689> they<00:01:12.960> live<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> little<00:01:13.380> pool<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.580> can

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700

see<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.210> am<00:01:15.360> dragging<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.990> amalgamation

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
see here I am dragging the amalgamation

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.310 
see here I am dragging the amalgamation
over<00:01:16.979> those<00:01:17.130> pools<00:01:17.689> once<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.810> cryptid<00:01:19.170> blood

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
over those pools once a cryptid blood

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.980 
over those pools once a cryptid blood
dies<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.890> leaves<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.250> little<00:01:20.460> pool<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.990> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
dies it leaves a little pool and the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.170 
dies it leaves a little pool and the
amalgamation<00:01:22.560> absorbs<00:01:23.220> those<00:01:23.400> pools<00:01:23.700> what

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
amalgamation absorbs those pools what

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.550 
amalgamation absorbs those pools what
you<00:01:24.299> want<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> do<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.020> want<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.470> the

you want to do is you want to get the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.120 
you want to do is you want to get the

here's<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:29.720> good<00:03:29.840> rule<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.560> thumb<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:31.010> get<00:03:31.670> it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
here's a good rule of thumb you get it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.090 
here's a good rule of thumb you get it
down<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.329> about<00:03:32.480> twenty-five<00:03:33.110> percent<00:03:33.290> as

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
down to about twenty-five percent as

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.310 
down to about twenty-five percent as
soon<00:03:34.430> as<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.640> hits<00:03:34.790> 25%<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.630> run<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:35.989> over<00:03:36.079> to

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
soon as it hits 25% you run it over to

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.360 
soon as it hits 25% you run it over to
where<00:03:36.440> all<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.680> bloods<00:03:37.010> are<00:03:37.160> dying

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
where all the bloods are dying

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.660 
where all the bloods are dying
supposedly<00:03:38.299> all<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.780> Bloods<00:03:39.790> should<00:03:40.790> be

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
supposedly all the Bloods should be

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.770 
supposedly all the Bloods should be
elsewhere<00:03:43.670> in<00:03:43.820> the<00:03:43.880> fight<00:03:44.060> now<00:03:44.570> here's

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
elsewhere in the fight now here's

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.960 
elsewhere in the fight now here's
something<00:03:45.019> that's<00:03:45.290> stupid<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:46.400> somebody

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
something that's stupid so somebody

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.120 
something that's stupid so somebody
killed<00:03:47.209> an<00:03:47.359> extra<00:03:47.690> tentacle<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.320> this<00:03:48.440> what

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
killed an extra tentacle and this what

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.340 
killed an extra tentacle and this what
happens<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.820> second<00:03:50.450> amalgamation<00:03:51.170> has

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
happens is a second amalgamation has

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.009 
happens is a second amalgamation has
spawned<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:53.030> second<00:03:53.690> amalgamation<00:03:54.260> will

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
spawned the second amalgamation will

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.259 
spawned the second amalgamation will
suck<00:03:57.019> up<00:03:57.049> more<00:03:57.440> bloods<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:57.950> thus<00:03:58.579> screw<00:03:59.180> up

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
suck up more bloods and thus screw up

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.729 
suck up more bloods and thus screw up
the<00:03:59.390> fight<00:03:59.570> and<00:03:59.750> make<00:03:59.959> everybody<00:04:00.200> stupid

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
the fight and make everybody stupid

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.349 
the fight and make everybody stupid
because<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.459> is<00:04:01.609> one<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.880> hardest<00:04:02.060> thing

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
because this is one of the hardest thing

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.190 
because this is one of the hardest thing
so<00:04:03.640> what<00:04:04.640> I'm<00:04:04.730> going<00:04:04.820> to<00:04:04.880> do<00:04:05.060> now<00:04:05.269> is<00:04:05.299> I'm<00:04:05.900> going

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.580 
it up and you have to do it all over
again<00:05:11.020> so<00:05:12.020> please<00:05:12.500> kill<00:05:12.979> the<00:05:13.100> tendon<00:05:14.440> this<00:05:15.440> is

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
again so please kill the tendon this is

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.500 
again so please kill the tendon this is
a<00:05:15.620> rinse<00:05:15.979> and<00:05:16.190> repeat<00:05:16.340> fight<00:05:16.880> you<00:05:17.300> basically

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
a rinse and repeat fight you basically

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.930 
a rinse and repeat fight you basically
know<00:05:17.900> these<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.470> basic<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.340> basic<00:05:19.370> idea<00:05:19.880> is

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
know these the basic the basic idea is

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.400 
know these the basic the basic idea is
that<00:05:20.060> there's<00:05:20.330> an<00:05:20.419> amalgamation<00:05:20.900> you<00:05:21.169> want<00:05:21.320> to

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
that there's an amalgamation you want to

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.990 
that there's an amalgamation you want to
get<00:05:21.500> it<00:05:21.590> to<00:05:21.680> 9<00:05:21.860> stacks<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.520> make<00:05:22.669> it<00:05:22.790> blow<00:05:22.970> up

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
get it to 9 stacks and make it blow up

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.180 
get it to 9 stacks and make it blow up
at<00:05:23.300> the<00:05:23.539> armor<00:05:23.870> if<00:05:24.380> you<00:05:24.560> don't<00:05:24.830> make<00:05:24.950> it<00:05:25.010> blow

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
at the armor if you don't make it blow

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.580 
at the armor if you don't make it blow
up<00:05:25.280> at<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.460> armor<00:05:25.760> it<00:05:26.000> will<00:05:26.810> not<00:05:27.020> be<00:05:27.440> doing

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
up at the armor it will not be doing

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.690 
up at the armor it will not be doing
armor<00:05:27.890> you<00:05:28.010> have<00:05:28.130> to<00:05:28.220> do<00:05:28.310> another

they don't do much damage or anything
special<00:05:38.600> like<00:05:38.870> that<00:05:39.080> you<00:05:39.169> don't<00:05:39.320> have<00:05:39.380> to

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
special like that you don't have to

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.969 
special like that you don't have to
worry<00:05:39.680> about<00:05:39.800> it<00:05:40.070> but<00:05:40.789> you<00:05:41.720> you<00:05:42.470> have<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:42.710> get

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
worry about it but you you have to get

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.219 
worry about it but you you have to get
up<00:05:43.100> to<00:05:43.220> 9<00:05:43.430> stacks<00:05:43.880> so<00:05:44.240> that<00:05:44.390> it<00:05:44.479> can<00:05:44.600> blow<00:05:44.780> up<00:05:44.960> if

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
up to 9 stacks so that it can blow up if

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.590 
up to 9 stacks so that it can blow up if
it<00:05:45.710> if<00:05:46.010> it<00:05:46.190> dies<00:05:46.370> before<00:05:46.640> it<00:05:46.910> gets<00:05:47.060> to<00:05:47.180> 9<00:05:47.330> stacks

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
it if it dies before it gets to 9 stacks

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.779 
it if it dies before it gets to 9 stacks
nothing<00:05:48.050> happens<00:05:48.380> if<00:05:48.590> it<00:05:48.740> dies<00:05:48.860> after<00:05:49.070> not<00:05:49.610> all

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
nothing happens if it dies after not all

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:51.670 
nothing happens if it dies after not all
right<00:05:49.880> what<00:05:50.060> if<00:05:50.330> it<00:05:50.479> gets<00:05:50.660> to<00:05:50.990> 9<00:05:51.139> stacks<00:05:51.410> it

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
right what if it gets to 9 stacks it

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.640 
right what if it gets to 9 stacks it
starts<00:05:51.919> doing<00:05:52.160> AoE<00:05:52.430> damage<00:05:53.229> so<00:05:54.229> I'm<00:05:54.380> basically

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
starts doing AoE damage so I'm basically

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.760 
starts doing AoE damage so I'm basically
just<00:05:54.889> repeating<00:05:55.460> myself<00:05:55.610> here<00:05:56.180> you<00:05:56.720> get<00:05:57.680> the

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
just repeating myself here you get the

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.560 
just repeating myself here you get the
amalgamation<00:05:58.220> main<00:05:58.729> tank<00:05:58.970> gets<00:05:59.120> this<00:05:59.360> off

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
amalgamation main tank gets this off

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.050 
amalgamation main tank gets this off
tank<00:05:59.900> gets<00:06:00.020> all<00:06:00.260> the<00:06:00.650> Bloods<00:06:00.889> and<00:06:01.220> any<00:06:01.550> excess

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
tank gets all the Bloods and any excess

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.140 
tank gets all the Bloods and any excess
of<00:06:02.650> amalgamations<00:06:03.650> if<00:06:03.830> somebody<00:06:04.520> stupid<00:06:04.940> and

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
of amalgamations if somebody stupid and

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.360 
of amalgamations if somebody stupid and
a<00:06:05.389> second<00:06:05.780> amalgamation<00:06:06.260> spawns<00:06:06.770> you

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
a second amalgamation spawns you

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.840 
a second amalgamation spawns you
definitely<00:06:07.610> want<00:06:07.910> the<00:06:08.000> off<00:06:08.150> tank<00:06:08.539> to<00:06:08.720> grab<00:06:08.930> it

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
definitely want the off tank to grab it

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.830 
definitely want the off tank to grab it
you<00:06:10.850> definitely<00:06:11.030> want<00:06:11.300> the<00:06:11.360> off<00:06:11.479> tank<00:06:11.750> to

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
you definitely want the off tank to

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.320 
you definitely want the off tank to
always<00:06:12.139> just<00:06:12.350> grab<00:06:12.500> it<00:06:12.650> no<00:06:13.280> reason<00:06:13.550> for<00:06:13.729> it<00:06:13.760> so

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
always just grab it no reason for it so

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.800 
always just grab it no reason for it so
there<00:06:14.450> you<00:06:14.479> go<00:06:14.950> so<00:06:15.950> nuclear<00:06:16.700> blast<00:06:17.000> and<00:06:17.270> kill

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
there you go so nuclear blast and kill

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.750 
there you go so nuclear blast and kill
the<00:06:17.930> tendons<00:06:18.289> that's<00:06:19.160> it<00:06:19.370> you<00:06:19.520> really<00:06:19.639> can't

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
the tendons that's it you really can't

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.240 
the tendons that's it you really can't
do<00:06:19.970> anything<00:06:20.150> about<00:06:20.300> the<00:06:20.450> tendons<00:06:20.810> if<00:06:21.250> pray

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
do anything about the tendons if pray

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.390 
do anything about the tendons if pray
that<00:06:22.460> your<00:06:22.580> dps<00:06:22.940> is<00:06:23.120> good<00:06:23.539> enough<00:06:23.840> to<00:06:24.470> kill<00:06:25.280> the

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
that your dps is good enough to kill the

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.290 
that your dps is good enough to kill the
tendons<00:06:25.729> and

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
tendons and

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.930 
tendons and
think<00:06:26.539> the<00:06:27.139> tendon<00:06:27.590> dies<00:06:27.740> then<00:06:28.190> you<00:06:28.400> win<00:06:28.580> if

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
think the tendon dies then you win if

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.100 
think the tendon dies then you win if
you<00:06:29.090> do<00:06:29.210> it<00:06:29.300> the<00:06:29.389> third<00:06:29.629> time<00:06:29.659> this<00:06:29.960> is<00:06:30.050> the

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
you do it the third time this is the

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.589 
you do it the third time this is the
third<00:06:30.259> time<00:06:30.289> so<00:06:30.620> it<00:06:30.710> should<00:06:30.889> die<00:06:31.009> and<00:06:31.599> that's

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
third time so it should die and that's

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.540 
third time so it should die and that's
it<00:06:32.930> I<00:06:33.169> mean<00:06:33.560> it's<00:06:33.800> a<00:06:33.860> straightforward<00:06:34.129> fight

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
it I mean it's a straightforward fight

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.119 
it I mean it's a straightforward fight
but<00:06:34.729> it's<00:06:34.759> so<00:06:35.150> hard<00:06:35.479> to<00:06:35.710> get<00:06:36.710> this<00:06:36.889> right

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.129 
but it's so hard to get this right

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:39.749 
but it's so hard to get this right
because<00:06:37.159> it<00:06:37.729> depends<00:06:38.060> on<00:06:38.180> so<00:06:38.389> many<00:06:38.569> people

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 
because it depends on so many people

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:42.580 
because it depends on so many people
yeah<00:06:40.759> skip<00:06:41.120> that<00:06:41.270> skip<00:06:41.539> it<00:06:41.659> skip<00:06:41.690> it<00:06:41.960> and<00:06:42.199> there

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
yeah skip that skip it skip it and there

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.430 
yeah skip that skip it skip it and there
we<00:06:42.650> go<00:06:42.680> that<00:06:43.340> is<00:06:43.490> the<00:06:43.610> end<00:06:43.729> of<00:06:43.819> the<00:06:43.909> fight

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
we go that is the end of the fight

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.350 
we go that is the end of the fight
