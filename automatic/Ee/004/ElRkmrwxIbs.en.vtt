have<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.420> actual<00:02:16.599> mass<00:02:17.080> right<00:02:17.500> here<00:02:18.180> that's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
have the actual mass right here that's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.690 
have the actual mass right here that's
to<00:02:19.390> go<00:02:19.540> take<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> look<00:02:20.019> at<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.709> seconds<00:02:21.430> we

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
look at main events so we got that out

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.600 
look at main events so we got that out
of<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.269> way<00:02:43.329> and<00:02:43.780> we're<00:02:44.620> looking<00:02:44.739> at<00:02:45.069> the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
of the way and we're looking at the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.520 
of the way and we're looking at the
synology<00:02:47.220> ds1<00:02:48.220> 12j<00:02:48.970> right<00:02:49.239> here<00:02:49.480> look<00:02:50.290> at<00:02:50.380> this

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
synology ds1 12j right here look at this

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.839 
synology ds1 12j right here look at this
sleek<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.579> sign<00:02:51.849> solji<00:02:52.810> logo<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.380> side<00:02:53.849> on

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
sleek the sign solji logo on the side on

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.670 
sleek the sign solji logo on the side on
both<00:02:55.269> sides<00:02:55.599> right<00:02:55.840> here<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.260> have<00:02:56.500> the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
both sides right here and you have the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.850 
both sides right here and you have the
two<00:02:56.860> USB<00:02:57.370> drives<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:58.030> ethernet<00:02:58.840> output<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.829> uh

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
two USB drives and ethernet output so uh

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.190 
two USB drives and ethernet output so uh
this<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.880> basically<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.840> synology

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
this is basically the synology

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.319 
this is basically the synology
diskstation<00:03:03.810> 112<00:03:04.810> j<00:03:05.260> it's<00:03:05.650> pretty<00:03:06.489> cool<00:03:06.940> I

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
diskstation 112 j it's pretty cool I

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.500 
diskstation 112 j it's pretty cool I
gotta<00:03:07.900> say<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.440> have<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.829> course<00:03:09.069> in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
gotta say and you have of course in

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.300 
gotta say and you have of course in
front<00:03:10.510> right<00:03:10.690> here<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:11.440> power<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.130> have

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
front right here the power and you have

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.340 
front right here the power and you have
some<00:03:12.609> LEDs<00:03:13.269> right<00:03:13.569> here<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:13.870> you<00:03:13.959> can<00:03:14.109> see<00:03:14.139> the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
some LEDs right here so you can see the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.770 
some LEDs right here so you can see the
status<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:14.980> it's<00:03:15.130> working<00:03:15.670> if<00:03:16.299> it's<00:03:16.540> connected

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
status if it's working if it's connected

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.050 
status if it's working if it's connected
to<00:03:16.989> land<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.709> if<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.190> disc<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.670> working

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
to land and if the disc is working

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.580 
to land and if the disc is working
properly<00:03:19.299> so<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:20.019> has<00:03:20.109> been<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.319> quick

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
properly so this has been the quick

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.580 
properly so this has been the quick
unboxing<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:21.160> physiology<00:03:21.989> 112g<00:03:22.989> we<00:03:23.410> can't

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
unboxing of physiology 112g we can't

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.670 
unboxing of physiology 112g we can't
wait<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.889> get<00:03:24.040> get<00:03:24.880> working<00:03:25.329> with<00:03:25.450> SD<00:03:25.840> and

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
wait to get get working with SD and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.199 
wait to get get working with SD and
playing<00:03:26.950> around<00:03:27.220> with<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.549> and<00:03:27.730> trying<00:03:28.030> out

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
playing around with it and trying out

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.180 
playing around with it and trying out
all<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.660> cool<00:03:29.079> features<00:03:29.319> that<00:03:29.500> follows<00:03:30.040> with

is<00:03:30.340> these<00:03:30.639> kind<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.299> disc<00:03:32.109> stations<00:03:32.829> and

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
is these kind of disc stations and

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.699 
is these kind of disc stations and
NASA's<00:03:34.239> alright<00:03:34.780> guys<00:03:34.930> has<00:03:35.109> just<00:03:35.380> been<00:03:35.560> my
