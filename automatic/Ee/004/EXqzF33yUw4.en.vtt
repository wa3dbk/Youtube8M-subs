00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:18.279
 the wanderer is a 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.949
 instrument, we could say, that is dangerous for the child. 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.029
 We do not recommend it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.130
 because 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.929
 can cause injury and death, in some cases described in the United States, 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.160
 by its use. 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.130
 The child who spends on the spider learns to go wrong: this is one of the 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.100
 first steps because it does not make the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.730
 normal steps, it makes 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.860
 as if you were paddling and so you do not learn 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.540
 the correct way to walk. 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.250
 In addition, you have the possibility to reach many sites 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.650
 and many things 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.410
 for which you are not prepared, and therefore you are much more likely to have 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.640
 accidents. 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.090
 In addition, if the spider for some reason 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.450
 hangs and the child falls 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.040
 always falls head over heels and the trauma 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.520
 cranioencephaly is one of the most dangerous that the child may suffer 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.480
 in a fall. 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.360
 The reported cases of deaths of this type of injury were 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.830
 produced by this mechanism, 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.130
 especially in homes where there may be a gap or where there may be 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.030
 carpets or things that cause these falls. 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.690
 Therefore, we would say that the spider does not give benefits to the child, 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.090
 and it carries risks, so it's a 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.230
 device that I would say we should not have at home. 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.090
 Another thing is those wanderers in which the child supports and he walks, 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090
 serve as a walking stick. This is 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.070
 a totally different thing, 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.100
 but the spider we put the child in there 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.850
 and let him walk, 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.770
 is a gadget that should not be in our homes.
