00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.009 

we<00:00:08.820> hope<00:00:09.059> there<00:00:09.269> spend<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.599> lot<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.840> time

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
we hope there spend a lot of time

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.810 
we hope there spend a lot of time
choosing<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.590> fabrics<00:00:10.980> for<00:00:11.190> our<00:00:11.280> quilts<00:00:11.670> in

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
choosing the fabrics for our quilts in

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.669 
choosing the fabrics for our quilts in
fact<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.120> lot<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.360> us<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.960> many<00:00:13.049> fabrics<00:00:13.530> we

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
fact a lot of us have so many fabrics we

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.350 
fact a lot of us have so many fabrics we
don't<00:00:13.830> know<00:00:13.889> what<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.190> with<00:00:14.309> them<00:00:14.429> but<00:00:15.240> we

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
don't know what to do with them but we

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.000 
don't know what to do with them but we
rarely<00:00:15.660> spend<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.170> much<00:00:16.320> time<00:00:16.379> thinking<00:00:16.800> about

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
rarely spend as much time thinking about

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.800 
rarely spend as much time thinking about
the<00:00:17.310> negative<00:00:17.520> space<00:00:17.940> for<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> backgrounds

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
the negative space for the backgrounds

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.810 
the negative space for the backgrounds
that<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:19.020> choose<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.439> our<00:00:19.560> quilts<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.160> that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
that we choose for our quilts and that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.640 
that we choose for our quilts and that
negative<00:00:21.210> space<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.779> just<00:00:22.050> as<00:00:22.140> important

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
negative space can be just as important

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.859 
negative space can be just as important
as<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.039> space<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.939> occupies<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.390> design

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
as the space that occupies the design

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.470 
as the space that occupies the design
area<00:00:25.099> so<00:00:26.099> when<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.400> choose<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> background<00:00:27.029> we

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
area so when we choose a background we

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.849 
area so when we choose a background we
need<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.689> make<00:00:27.840> sure<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.320> background

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
need to make sure that that background

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.650 
need to make sure that that background
is<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.550> behave<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.119> way<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:30.510> can

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
is going to behave in a way that we can

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.170 
is going to behave in a way that we can
expect<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.520> often<00:00:32.520> our<00:00:32.610> choices<00:00:32.880> are

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
expect it to often our choices are

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.310 
expect it to often our choices are
either<00:00:33.210> black<00:00:33.630> or<00:00:33.690> white

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
either black or white

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.049 
either black or white
sometimes<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.920> use<00:00:35.040> grey<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.489> sometimes<00:00:35.880> we

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
sometimes we use grey and sometimes we

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.180 
sometimes we use grey and sometimes we
use<00:00:36.090> light<00:00:36.870> or<00:00:36.899> dark<00:00:37.230> versions<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> colors

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
use light or dark versions of the colors

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.220 
use light or dark versions of the colors
that<00:00:38.340> we're<00:00:38.489> using<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> quilt<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.480> want<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
that we're using in the quilt I want to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.720 
that we're using in the quilt I want to
talk<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> little<00:00:40.559> bit<00:00:40.800> about<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.190> choice<00:00:41.489> of

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
talk a little bit about that choice of

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.760 
talk a little bit about that choice of
black<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.210> white<00:00:42.270> when<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.350> look<00:00:43.500> at<00:00:43.590> this

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
black and white when we look at this

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.619 
black and white when we look at this
piece<00:00:44.010> right<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.059> see<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.450> have

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
piece right here we can see that we have

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.049 
piece right here we can see that we have
lots<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.020> bright<00:00:46.289> colors<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.100> then<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
lots of bright colors and then we have a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.500 
lots of bright colors and then we have a
white<00:00:48.300> background<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.590> black<00:00:49.890> border<00:00:50.510> what

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
white background and a black border what

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.479 
white background and a black border what
happens<00:00:51.840> when<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.079> use<00:00:52.110> white<00:00:52.559> with<00:00:52.800> bright<00:00:53.129> is

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
happens when we use white with bright is

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.119 
happens when we use white with bright is
that<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.879> competition<00:00:54.390> gets<00:00:54.780> formed<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.949> white

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
that a competition gets formed the white

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.400 
that a competition gets formed the white
is<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.340> brightest<00:00:57.239> lightest<00:00:57.930> inherent

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
is the brightest lightest inherent

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.560 
is the brightest lightest inherent
valued<00:00:58.829> color<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.340> entity<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.969> use<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
valued color or entity that we use and

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.389 
valued color or entity that we use and
it<00:01:01.079> wants<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> compete<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:01.949> every<00:01:02.280> other

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it wants to compete with every other

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.420 
it wants to compete with every other
color<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.210> wants<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.870> come<00:01:04.080> forward<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.369> to

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
color it wants to come forward and so to

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.670 
color it wants to come forward and so to
make<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:06.030> back<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.170> really<00:01:07.439> quilt

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
make it go back we have to really quilt

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.190 
make it go back we have to really quilt
it<00:01:07.830> heavily<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.090> only<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.510> good<00:01:09.689> choice<00:01:09.930> if

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
it heavily so it's only a good choice if

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.630 
it heavily so it's only a good choice if
we<00:01:10.260> know<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.799> we're<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> quilt<00:01:11.430> our

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
we know that we're going to quilt our

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.899 
we know that we're going to quilt our
background<00:01:12.060> very<00:01:12.330> very<00:01:12.570> heavily<00:01:13.909> otherwise

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
background very very heavily otherwise

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.620 
background very very heavily otherwise
black<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> better<00:01:15.840> choice<00:01:17.270> when<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.390> look<00:01:18.540> at

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
black is a better choice when we look at

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.590 
black is a better choice when we look at
this<00:01:18.869> quilt<00:01:19.170> versus<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.220> quilt<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.390> one

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
this quilt versus this quilt on this one

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.030 
this quilt versus this quilt on this one
we<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> colors<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.799> really

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
we can see that the colors are really

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.800 
we can see that the colors are really
coming<00:01:23.430> forward<00:01:23.909> they're<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.210> jumping<00:01:24.540> off

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
coming forward they're just jumping off

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.410 
coming forward they're just jumping off
the<00:01:24.990> surface<00:01:25.409> black<00:01:26.280> allows<00:01:26.670> bright<00:01:27.060> colors

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the surface black allows bright colors

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
the surface black allows bright colors
to<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.170> sits<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> negative<00:01:29.280> space

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
to do that it sits in the negative space

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.700 
to do that it sits in the negative space
really<00:01:29.880> nicely<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:31.049> doesn't<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.619> be

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
really nicely and it doesn't have to be

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.490 
really nicely and it doesn't have to be
quilted<00:01:32.130> quite<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.460> heavily<00:01:33.170> black<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.380> white

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
quilted quite as heavily black and white

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.069 
quilted quite as heavily black and white
will<00:01:34.680> also<00:01:35.040> affect<00:01:35.490> how<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> colors<00:01:36.840> look

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
will also affect how the colors look

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.440 
will also affect how the colors look
size-wise<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.850> look<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.240> piece

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
size-wise when we look at this piece

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.870 
size-wise when we look at this piece
I've<00:01:39.689> split<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.140> background<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.040> part

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
I've split the background so that part

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.429 
I've split the background so that part
of<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.090> white<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.299> part<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.840> black<00:01:43.079> and

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
of it is white and part is black and

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.440 
of it is white and part is black and
then<00:01:43.950> those<00:01:44.100> bright<00:01:44.369> colors<00:01:44.399> are<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.149> from

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
then those bright colors are going from

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.749 
then those bright colors are going from
either<00:01:45.659> black<00:01:45.930> into<00:01:46.320> white<00:01:46.350> or<00:01:46.770> white<00:01:47.399> into

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
either black into white or white into

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
either black into white or white into
black<00:01:47.970> when<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.049> look<00:01:49.259> at<00:01:49.409> them<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.619> can

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
black when we look at them we can

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.639 
black when we look at them we can
actually<00:01:50.220> see<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.060> change<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.899> physical<00:01:52.350> change

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
actually see a change of physical change

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.760 
actually see a change of physical change
in<00:01:52.860> size<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.479> red<00:01:54.750> strip<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
in size here we have this red strip and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.319 
in size here we have this red strip and
it<00:01:55.920> goes<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.549> goes<00:01:56.670> into<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> white<00:01:57.119> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
it goes as it goes into the white it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.999 
it goes as it goes into the white it
looks<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.990> thinner<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.590> it's

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
looks like it's thinner and it's

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.800 
looks like it's thinner and it's
actually<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> same<00:01:59.640> exact<00:02:00.060> size<00:02:00.329> as<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.689> is

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
actually the same exact size as it is

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.679 
actually the same exact size as it is
over<00:02:00.960> here<00:02:01.520> whereas<00:02:02.520> here<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.390> blue

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
over here whereas here we have this blue

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.899 
over here whereas here we have this blue
strip<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.890> looks<00:02:05.070> smaller<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> white

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
strip and it looks smaller in the white

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.429 
strip and it looks smaller in the white
but<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.630> goes<00:02:06.750> into<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.049> black<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.409> looks

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
but when it goes into the black it looks

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.100 
but when it goes into the black it looks
larger<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.819> negative<00:02:09.179> space<00:02:09.450> will<00:02:09.690> really

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
larger the negative space will really

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.380 
larger the negative space will really
affect<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.649> colors<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.790> affect<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
affect the colors and really affect the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.949 
affect the colors and really affect the
things<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.810> are<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:12.959> positive<00:02:13.500> space

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
things that are in positive space

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.690 
things that are in positive space
finally<00:02:15.959> sometimes<00:02:16.890> we're<00:02:17.069> not<00:02:17.099> using<00:02:17.519> bright

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
finally sometimes we're not using bright

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.520 
finally sometimes we're not using bright
colors<00:02:17.730> we're<00:02:18.209> using<00:02:18.329> tones<00:02:18.689> or<00:02:18.989> shades<00:02:19.260> or

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
colors we're using tones or shades or

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.890 
colors we're using tones or shades or
tints<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.099> this<00:02:20.939> piece<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.390> have<00:02:21.569> mostly

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
tints in this piece we have mostly

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.440 
tints in this piece we have mostly
shades<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.620> those<00:02:22.769> are<00:02:23.209> colors<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.360> have

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
shades and those are colors that have

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.750 
shades and those are colors that have
black<00:02:24.750> or<00:02:25.019> gray<00:02:25.260> added<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.220> there<00:02:26.670> are

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
black or gray added in this there are

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.000 
black or gray added in this there are
tones<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.209> here<00:02:27.239> also<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.959> they're<00:02:28.829> being

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
tones in here also and they're being

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.979 
tones in here also and they're being
affected<00:02:29.159> differently<00:02:29.909> by<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.239> white<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
affected differently by the white in the

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.920 
affected differently by the white in the
gray<00:02:31.230> here<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.519> actually<00:02:32.730> see<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.269> crisper

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
gray here you can actually see a crisper

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.920 
gray here you can actually see a crisper
line<00:02:34.220> against<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> white<00:02:35.540> whereas<00:02:36.540> here

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
line against the white whereas here

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.780 
line against the white whereas here
those<00:02:37.140> grayed<00:02:37.409> out<00:02:37.440> colors<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.250> move<00:02:38.610> into

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
those grayed out colors just move into

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.180 
those grayed out colors just move into
that<00:02:39.030> gray<00:02:39.299> or<00:02:39.510> dark<00:02:39.540> black<00:02:40.019> or<00:02:40.290> dark<00:02:41.010> gray<00:02:41.159> or

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
that gray or dark black or dark gray or

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.580 
that gray or dark black or dark gray or
black<00:02:41.459> fabric<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.810> here<00:02:43.140> we're<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.379> see

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
black fabric so here we're going to see

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.059 
black fabric so here we're going to see
a<00:02:43.620> nice<00:02:44.599> line<00:02:45.599> or<00:02:45.840> demarcation<00:02:46.409> where<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
a nice line or demarcation where the

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.160 
a nice line or demarcation where the
beginning<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.640> negative<00:02:48.209> space<00:02:48.329> begins<00:02:48.870> and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
beginning of negative space begins and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.680 
beginning of negative space begins and
positive<00:02:49.680> spaces<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.940> for<00:02:51.150> tones<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.629> shades

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
positive spaces so for tones and shades

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.199 
positive spaces so for tones and shades
white<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> really<00:02:52.859> good<00:02:53.010> option<00:02:53.220> whereas

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
white is a really good option whereas

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.809 
white is a really good option whereas
the<00:02:54.569> gray<00:02:54.780> or<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.989> black<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.470> not<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.639> next

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
the gray or the black is not so next

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.309 
the gray or the black is not so next
