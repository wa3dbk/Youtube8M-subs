00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
finding where they want to slide very

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.319 
finding where they want to slide very
frequently<00:01:08.319> you'll<00:01:09.100> hear<00:01:09.340> them<00:01:09.520> say<00:01:09.850> that

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
frequently you'll hear them say that

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.929 
frequently you'll hear them say that
they're<00:01:10.509> sliding<00:01:10.950> adjacent<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.189> that<00:01:12.700> means

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
they're sliding adjacent and that means

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.209 
they're sliding adjacent and that means
that<00:01:13.149> if<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.689> balls<00:01:14.109> here<00:01:14.439> with<00:01:14.649> number<00:01:14.979> two

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
that if the balls here with number two

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.330 
that if the balls here with number two
number<00:01:16.149> three's<00:01:16.749> defenseman<00:01:17.649> would<00:01:17.920> be<00:01:18.100> the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
number three's defenseman would be the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.480 
number three's defenseman would be the
slide<00:01:18.700> guy<00:01:19.030> if<00:01:19.719> number<00:01:20.109> two<00:01:20.380> dodged<00:01:20.770> with<00:01:21.340> his

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
slide guy if number two dodged with his

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.660 
slide guy if number two dodged with his
right<00:01:21.729> hand

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
right hand

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.239 
right hand
when<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:24.850> occurs<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.749> you<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:27.100> that

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
when this occurs and you know that

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.249 
when this occurs and you know that
you're<00:01:27.369> going<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.520> get<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:27.880> slide<00:01:28.270> just

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
you're going to get that slide just

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.199 
you're going to get that slide just
clear<00:01:29.560> number<00:01:29.859> one<00:01:30.369> through<00:01:30.759> to<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.969> crease

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:31.209 
clear number one through to the crease

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.539 
clear number one through to the crease
and<00:01:31.569> put<00:01:32.200> number<00:01:32.499> three<00:01:32.799> up<00:01:32.979> in<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.159> shooting

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
and put number three up in a shooting

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.359 
and put number three up in a shooting
spot<00:01:33.909> his<00:01:34.479> defender<00:01:35.229> gets<00:01:35.560> ready<00:01:35.889> to<00:01:36.069> slide

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
spot his defender gets ready to slide

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.690 
spot his defender gets ready to slide
and<00:01:36.729> now<00:01:37.359> number<00:01:38.079> two<00:01:38.380> can<00:01:38.619> dodge<00:01:38.829> and<00:01:39.249> simply

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
and now number two can dodge and simply

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.550 
and now number two can dodge and simply
move<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.119> ball<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.359> number<00:01:40.630> three<00:01:40.959> who's

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
move the ball to number three who's

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.899 
move the ball to number three who's
already<00:01:41.770> getting<00:01:42.069> a<00:01:42.100> good<00:01:42.219> shooting<00:01:42.579> spot

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
already getting a good shooting spot

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.499 
already getting a good shooting spot
it's<00:01:43.689> a<00:01:43.719> nice<00:01:43.899> way<00:01:44.109> to<00:01:44.170> exploit<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:45.509> confusion

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
it's a nice way to exploit the confusion

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.690 
it's a nice way to exploit the confusion
among<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.229> defenders<00:01:47.799> as<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.249> where<00:01:48.490> they're

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
among the defenders as to where they're

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.029 
among the defenders as to where they're
sliding<00:01:48.999> from<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.749> where<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.380> openings<00:01:50.829> are

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
sliding from and where the openings are

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.669 
sliding from and where the openings are
that's<00:01:51.700> why<00:01:51.909> we<00:01:52.149> call<00:01:52.389> circle<00:01:53.109> offense<00:01:53.499> we

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
that's why we call circle offense we

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.120 
that's why we call circle offense we
