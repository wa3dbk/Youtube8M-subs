this one is really neat it's called the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.250 
this one is really neat it's called the
vortex<00:00:16.500> order<00:00:17.240> so<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.330> start<00:00:18.750> by<00:00:18.840> going<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
vortex order so you start by going to

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.689

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.330 
but the best one that I found so far is
the<00:00:49.079> vortex<00:00:49.469> order<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.809> scroll<00:00:52.260> down<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.800> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the vortex order so scroll down and you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.110 
the vortex order so scroll down and you
should<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.730> blue<00:00:54.449> vortex<00:00:55.140> story<00:00:55.969> once<00:00:56.969> you've

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
should see blue vortex story once you've

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.060 
should see blue vortex story once you've
found<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.539> click<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.469> drag<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.920> to

it'll take a second to load and you
might<00:01:08.850> want<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> try<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> close<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.850> gallery<00:01:12.060> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
might want to try to close the gallery a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.850 
might want to try to close the gallery a
little<00:01:12.570> bit<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.110> don't<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.650> so

little bit so that you don't see it so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.609 
little bit so that you don't see it so
much<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:15.479> edit<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.020> activity<00:01:18.560> there's<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
much to edit this activity there's a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
much to edit this activity there's a
little<00:01:19.950> box<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.310> says<00:01:20.520> edit<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.540> can

little box that says edit and you can
click<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.320> it'll<00:01:22.530> let<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.890> change<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
click it and it'll let you change the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.359 
click it and it'll let you change the
labels<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.570> an<00:01:24.900> example<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.680> an<00:01:25.890> activity<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
labels so an example of an activity that

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.890 
labels so an example of an activity that
would<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.939> would<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.270> really<00:01:27.420> good<00:01:27.720> for

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
would be this would be really good for

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.280 
would be this would be really good for
would<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.770> urban<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.159> rural<00:01:29.310> communities

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
would be for urban and rural communities

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.440 
would be for urban and rural communities
so<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.770> cut<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.220> vortex<00:01:32.729> label<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
so in one cut and vortex label one you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.319 
so in one cut and vortex label one you
could<00:01:33.600> type<00:01:33.780> urban<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:35.310> vertex<00:01:35.700> label<00:01:36.119> two

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
could type urban and in vertex label two

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.109 
could type urban and in vertex label two
you<00:01:36.659> could<00:01:36.810> type<00:01:37.020> rural<00:01:37.549> now<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.700> only<00:01:38.850> going

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
you could type rural now I'm only going

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.969 
you could type rural now I'm only going
to<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> few<00:01:39.600> labels<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.439> an<00:01:40.530> example

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
to do a few labels just for an example

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.130 
to do a few labels just for an example
but<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:42.000> many<00:01:42.210> labels<00:01:42.659> as<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.960> can

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
but you can do many labels as you can

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.530 
but you can do many labels as you can
see<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.640> urban<00:01:45.030> I'll<00:01:45.240> type<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.810> city<00:01:47.540> bus

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
see so for urban I'll type in city bus

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.670 
see so for urban I'll type in city bus
and<00:01:49.140> car<00:01:50.570> for<00:01:51.619> rural<00:01:52.619> I'll<00:01:52.890> type<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.460> farm

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
and car for rural I'll type in farm

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.600 
and car for rural I'll type in farm
tractor<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.479> horse<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.770> those<00:01:58.979> are<00:01:59.130> my<00:01:59.250> urban

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
tractor and horse so those are my urban

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.730 
tractor and horse so those are my urban
and<00:01:59.969> rural<00:02:00.060> um<00:02:00.619> Kaddi

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and rural um Kaddi

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.200 
and rural um Kaddi
or<00:02:02.100> or<00:02:02.729> my<00:02:03.030> urban<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.479> rural<00:02:03.630> labels<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
or or my urban and rural labels if you

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.449 
or or my urban and rural labels if you
want<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.630> make<00:02:06.780> an<00:02:06.930> even<00:02:07.170> meter<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.160> click

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
given in class they can test their

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.979 
given in class they can test their
knowledge<00:02:44.879> and<00:02:45.030> see<00:02:45.209> if<00:02:45.299> they<00:02:45.420> understand

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
knowledge and see if they understand

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
interesting because the vortices will

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.149 
interesting because the vortices will
not<00:02:51.299> accept<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> ones<00:02:52.019> that<00:02:52.230> are<00:02:52.349> not<00:02:52.530> mine
