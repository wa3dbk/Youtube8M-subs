00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
pilferers here not so much because I

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.950

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
like white black as i said i don't but

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
like white black as i said i don't but
just<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:22.289> it's<00:01:22.560> splash<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:22.950> well<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.580> it

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
just because it's splash as well and it

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.630

goes into ratha gattex pretty well

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.190 
goes into ratha gattex pretty well
because<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.149> you<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.509> clear<00:01:27.960> things

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200

overall<00:01:38.640> pretty<00:01:38.819> weak<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.300> i<00:01:39.330> think<00:01:39.569> just

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
overall pretty weak but i think just

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.999 
overall pretty weak but i think just
taking<00:01:40.020> pilfers<00:01:40.319> here<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.710> strongest

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.130 
taking pilfers here as the strongest

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
and there's some green now but it's

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.619 
and there's some green now but it's
still<00:05:40.430> not<00:05:40.550> worth<00:05:40.729> jumping<00:05:41.210> into<00:05:41.330> at<00:05:41.539> this

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:41.629

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.339

doubt<00:05:47.059> it<00:05:47.210> the<00:05:47.509> question<00:05:47.809> is<00:05:47.930> would<00:05:48.080> we<00:05:48.199> take

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
doubt it the question is would we take

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.379 
doubt it the question is would we take
otherwise<00:05:48.729> it's<00:05:49.729> probably<00:05:49.939> gonna<00:05:50.059> be<00:05:50.120> cool

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
otherwise it's probably gonna be cool
