00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
but the entire upper maybe I can cast a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.799 
but the entire upper maybe I can cast a
shadow<00:00:30.200> or<00:00:30.559> something<00:00:30.860> is<00:00:31.300> it's<00:00:32.300> leather<00:00:32.599> but

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
pebbles looking thing lizard embossed as

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.250 
pebbles looking thing lizard embossed as
what<00:00:37.610> I'll<00:00:37.700> call<00:00:37.879> it<00:00:38.059> it's<00:00:38.180> very<00:00:38.750> similar<00:00:39.020> to

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
what I'll call it it's very similar to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.960 
what I'll call it it's very similar to
the<00:00:39.379> stripes<00:00:39.710> that<00:00:39.829> are<00:00:39.920> on<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.160> jordan<00:00:40.430> 12<00:00:41.500> so

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
the stripes that are on the jordan 12 so

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.710 
the stripes that are on the jordan 12 so
that's<00:00:43.970> pretty<00:00:44.240> cool

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
that's pretty cool

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.590 
that's pretty cool
it's<00:00:45.200> a<00:00:45.320> it's<00:00:45.470> a<00:00:45.590> split<00:00:45.890> grain<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.060> you<00:00:47.180> can<00:00:47.390> see

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
it's a it's a split grain so you can see

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.560 
it's a it's a split grain so you can see
there<00:00:48.160> how<00:00:49.160> thin<00:00:49.460> it<00:00:49.610> is<00:00:49.730> it's<00:00:49.940> not<00:00:50.090> very<00:00:50.150> thick

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
there how thin it is it's not very thick

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.200 
there how thin it is it's not very thick
at<00:00:50.690> all<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:51.350> it<00:00:51.440> is<00:00:51.470> a<00:00:51.590> leather<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.250> that's

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
at all but it is a leather so that's

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.390 
at all but it is a leather so that's
nice<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.320> then<00:00:54.350> we<00:00:54.530> have<00:00:54.680> this<00:00:54.890> ballistic

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
nice and then we have this ballistic

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.060 
nice and then we have this ballistic
style<00:00:55.640> mesh<00:00:55.850> here<00:00:56.290> this<00:00:57.290> I<00:00:57.560> thought<00:00:57.860> was

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
style mesh here this I thought was

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.160 
style mesh here this I thought was
dynamic<00:00:58.340> fly<00:00:58.790> wire<00:00:59.030> I<00:00:59.300> mean<00:00:59.540> it<00:00:59.720> is<00:00:59.870> dynamic

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
dynamic fly wire I mean it is dynamic

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.810 
dynamic fly wire I mean it is dynamic
fly<00:01:00.590> wire<00:01:00.770> but<00:01:01.040> like<00:01:01.220> I<00:01:01.340> don't<00:01:01.399> know<00:01:01.550> if<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:01.730> has

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
fly wire but like I don't know if it has

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.119 
fly wire but like I don't know if it has
an<00:01:01.940> actual<00:01:02.180> function<00:01:02.600> because<00:01:02.920> it's<00:01:03.920> like

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
an actual function because it's like

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.130 
an actual function because it's like
stitched<00:01:04.489> on<00:01:04.699> everywhere<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.899> doesn't

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
stitched on everywhere so it doesn't

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.550 
stitched on everywhere so it doesn't
really<00:01:06.259> move<00:01:06.530> it's<00:01:06.829> not<00:01:07.030> dynamic<00:01:08.439> dynamic<00:01:09.439> is

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
really move it's not dynamic dynamic is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.139 
really move it's not dynamic dynamic is
supposed<00:01:09.799> to<00:01:09.829> be<00:01:09.950> kind<00:01:10.189> of<00:01:10.310> like<00:01:10.430> free-flowing

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
supposed to be kind of like free-flowing

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.149 
supposed to be kind of like free-flowing
that<00:01:11.509> way<00:01:11.600> when<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:11.840> lace<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:12.439> tighten<00:01:12.860> it<00:01:12.950> it

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
that way when you lace and tighten it it

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.219 
that way when you lace and tighten it it
you<00:01:13.759> know<00:01:13.790> cinches<00:01:14.329> and<00:01:14.479> stuff<00:01:14.659> doesn't

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
you know cinches and stuff doesn't

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.830 
you know cinches and stuff doesn't
really<00:01:15.440> do<00:01:15.620> that<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:15.940> they<00:01:16.940> do<00:01:17.000> fit<00:01:17.299> fine<00:01:17.570> but

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
really do that so they do fit fine but

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.740 
really do that so they do fit fine but
you<00:01:18.140> know<00:01:18.229> I<00:01:18.260> just<00:01:18.740> thought<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:18.920> was<00:01:18.979> weird<00:01:19.750> and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
you know I just thought it was weird and

like older style Jordans like the sevens
and<00:01:58.939> eights<00:01:59.150> six<00:01:59.900> is<00:02:00.049> also<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:00.619> then<00:02:00.740> kind<00:02:01.700> of

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
and eights six is also and then kind of

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.520 
and eights six is also and then kind of
pattern<00:02:02.060> like<00:02:02.240> that<00:02:02.270> Air<00:02:02.509> Jordan<00:02:02.869> 10<00:02:03.049> I<00:02:03.259> know

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
pattern like that Air Jordan 10 I know

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.710 
pattern like that Air Jordan 10 I know
it's<00:02:03.770> gonna<00:02:03.920> be<00:02:04.100> hard<00:02:04.939> to<00:02:04.970> see<00:02:05.180> because<00:02:05.299> it's<00:02:05.540> a

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
it's gonna be hard to see because it's a

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.740 
it's gonna be hard to see because it's a
clear<00:02:06.259> sole<00:02:06.470> but<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.790> then<00:02:08.179> also<00:02:08.329> there's

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
clear sole but and then also there's

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.719 
clear sole but and then also there's
herringbone<00:02:09.229> too<00:02:09.439> which<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.769> an<00:02:10.039> updated

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
herringbone too which is an updated

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.809 
herringbone too which is an updated
feature<00:02:11.030> which<00:02:11.329> is<00:02:11.480> cool<00:02:11.689> so<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:13.069> will<00:02:13.730> be

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
feature which is cool so I will be

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.280 
feature which is cool so I will be
performance<00:02:14.299> testing<00:02:14.569> these<00:02:14.659> eventually

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
performance testing these eventually

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.039 
performance testing these eventually
once<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.560> get<00:02:15.829> through<00:02:16.040> with<00:02:16.099> I<00:02:16.400> got<00:02:16.670> like<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:17.120> got

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
look really cool they're a mixture

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.320 
look really cool they're a mixture
between<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.340> 11s<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.580> tens<00:02:35.850> there's

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
between the 11s and the tens there's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.820 
between the 11s and the tens there's

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
don't know if these are actually

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.520 
don't know if these are actually
functional<00:02:57.210> too<00:02:57.360> cuz<00:02:57.570> he's<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:57.960> our<00:02:58.140> little

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
functional too cuz he's just our little

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.840 
functional too cuz he's just our little
place<00:02:58.830> there's<00:02:59.130> one<00:02:59.280> here<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.610> then<00:02:59.820> one

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
place there's one here and then one

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.940 
place there's one here and then one
there<00:03:00.750> but<00:03:00.930> they<00:03:00.990> don't<00:03:01.110> run<00:03:01.410> underneath

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
there but they don't run underneath

there but they don't run underneath
which<00:03:02.250> i<00:03:02.340> think<00:03:02.490> is<00:03:02.790> kind<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.090> weird<00:03:04.340> but<00:03:05.340> uh

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
which i think is kind of weird but uh

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.450 
which i think is kind of weird but uh
you<00:03:06.330> know<00:03:06.420> whatever<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.080> yeah<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.160> think<00:03:08.250> these

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
you know whatever so yeah I think these

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.310 
you know whatever so yeah I think these
things<00:03:08.610> are<00:03:08.760> crazy<00:03:08.970> dope<00:03:09.300> though<00:03:09.540> especially

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
things are crazy dope though especially
