00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.310 
measuring our progress measuring the
results<00:02:06.310> of<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.460> investments<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:07.210> get<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.780> as

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
results of the investments we get and as

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.139 
results of the investments we get and as
we<00:02:08.470> find<00:02:08.770> out<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.369> really<00:02:09.610> does<00:02:09.940> make

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
we find out that this really does make

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.930 
we find out that this really does make
sense<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.750> terms<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:11.110> cost<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:11.620> benefit<00:02:12.250> then

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
sense in terms of cost and benefit then

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.520 
sense in terms of cost and benefit then
it<00:02:13.120> really<00:02:13.420> moves<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.870> sustainability

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
it really moves the sustainability

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.250 
it really moves the sustainability
effort<00:02:14.980> forward<00:02:15.600> we've<00:02:16.600> seen<00:02:16.900> some

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
effort forward we've seen some

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.560 
effort forward we've seen some
commonalities<00:02:18.130> with<00:02:18.160> respect<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.270> cities

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
commonalities with respect to the cities

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.870 
commonalities with respect to the cities
who<00:02:19.750> seem<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.140> be<00:02:20.260> faring<00:02:20.680> very<00:02:20.890> well<00:02:21.220> they

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
who seem to be faring very well they

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.330 
who seem to be faring very well they
have<00:02:22.209> policies<00:02:23.020> often<00:02:23.410> also<00:02:24.070> have

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
have policies often also have

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.210 
have policies often also have
sustainability<00:02:25.000> offices<00:02:25.840> we've<00:02:26.590> also<00:02:26.800> seen

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
sustainability offices we've also seen

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.740 
sustainability offices we've also seen
that<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.459> lot<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.790> cities<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.270> have<00:02:28.480> a

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
that a lot of cities that have a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.500 
that a lot of cities that have a
comprehensive<00:02:29.320> approach<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:30.220> sustainability

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
comprehensive approach to sustainability

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.750 
comprehensive approach to sustainability
it's<00:02:31.510> about<00:02:31.890> livability<00:02:32.890> it's<00:02:33.220> about<00:02:33.549> the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
it's about livability it's about the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.490 
it's about livability it's about the
health<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.239> citizens<00:02:34.450> it's<00:02:35.080> certainly

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
health of the citizens it's certainly

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.289 
health of the citizens it's certainly
about<00:02:35.830> economic<00:02:36.610> growth<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.209> economic

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
about economic growth and economic

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.840 
about economic growth and economic
sustainability<00:02:37.989> I<00:02:38.890> think<00:02:39.280> cities<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.790> states

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
sustainability I think cities and states

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.670 
sustainability I think cities and states
are<00:02:40.120> really<00:02:40.390> leading<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.750> way<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.410> mayors

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
are really leading the way the mayors
