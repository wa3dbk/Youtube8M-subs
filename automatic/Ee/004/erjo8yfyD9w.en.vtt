00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
going to see it everywhere when we look

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.130 
going to see it everywhere when we look
at<00:00:54.850> things<00:00:55.030> like<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.629> way<00:00:55.749> that<00:00:55.929> other

nations are developing the driverless
vehicle<00:00:58.659> technology<00:00:59.260> it's<00:00:59.469> really<00:00:59.710> important

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
vehicle technology it's really important

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.619 
vehicle technology it's really important
that<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.339> UK<00:01:00.640> stays<00:01:00.940> ahead<00:01:01.120> of<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.420> game

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
that the UK stays ahead of the game

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.420 
that the UK stays ahead of the game
that's<00:01:02.050> what<00:01:02.559> Lux<00:01:02.949> Pathfinder<00:01:03.879> is<00:01:04.030> all<00:01:04.420> about

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.100 

the<00:01:08.430> three<00:01:08.640> Lots<00:01:08.940> Pathfinder<00:01:09.540> pods<00:01:09.750> are

the three Lots Pathfinder pods are

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.140 
the three Lots Pathfinder pods are

the<00:01:34.140> catapult<00:01:34.500> program<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.100> here<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:46.400> the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
the catapult program is here to do the

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.130 
the catapult program is here to do the
future<00:01:47.910> of<00:01:48.090> cars<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.750> personal

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
future of cars and personal

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.109 
future of cars and personal
transportation<00:01:49.440> is<00:01:50.160> in<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> community

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
transportation is in a community

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.170 
transportation is in a community
transport<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.930> community<00:01:52.800> assets<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.970> so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
transport and community assets and so

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
transport and community assets and so
individual<00:01:55.020> driverless<00:01:55.530> vehicles<00:01:56.070> are

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
individual driverless vehicles are

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.370 
individual driverless vehicles are
hugely<00:01:56.729> important<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.330> that<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.810> for<00:01:58.110> Britain

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
hugely important to that and for Britain

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.990 
hugely important to that and for Britain
to<00:01:58.470> have<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> piece<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.220> market<00:01:59.790> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
to have a piece of that market to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.999 
to have a piece of that market to
dominate<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.930> market<00:02:00.990> hopefully<00:02:01.470> in<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
dominate that market hopefully in the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.130 
dominate that market hopefully in the
future<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.670> actually<00:02:02.910> huge<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.570> billions<00:02:03.990> of

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
future is actually huge it's billions of

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:17.220 
future is actually huge it's billions of
pounds<00:02:04.320> off<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.649> Industry

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.860 

and<00:02:18.230> we'll<00:02:18.350> be<00:02:18.440> using<00:02:18.920> live<00:02:19.640> sensor<00:02:20.270> data<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
and we'll be using live sensor data and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.870 
and we'll be using live sensor data and
it<00:02:21.110> will<00:02:21.140> be<00:02:21.260> comparing<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:21.950> view<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.670> gets

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
it will be comparing the view it gets

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.810 
it will be comparing the view it gets
from<00:02:23.150> its<00:02:23.270> cameras<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:23.900> its<00:02:24.410> lasers<00:02:24.890> as<00:02:25.550> its

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.310 
project is really a technology testbed
assuming<00:02:38.240> that<00:02:38.450> we<00:02:38.570> can<00:02:38.600> develop<00:02:39.080> the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
assuming that we can develop the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.960 
assuming that we can develop the
technology<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:39.980> allow<00:02:40.190> these<00:02:40.370> vehicles<00:02:40.700> to

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
technology and allow these vehicles to

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.240 
technology and allow these vehicles to
operate<00:02:41.150> in<00:02:41.570> this<00:02:41.660> environment<00:02:42.040> then<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.070> think

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
operate in this environment then I think

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.740 
operate in this environment then I think
there's<00:02:43.460> a<00:02:43.520> vision<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.880> we<00:02:44.150> would<00:02:44.180> have<00:02:44.450> lots

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
there's a vision that we would have lots

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.010 
there's a vision that we would have lots
of<00:02:44.990> these<00:02:45.170> vehicles<00:02:46.000> providing<00:02:47.020> really

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
of these vehicles providing really

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.380 
of these vehicles providing really
reliable<00:02:48.710> transport<00:02:49.490> to<00:02:49.580> get<00:02:49.700> people<00:02:50.120> from<00:02:50.240> A

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
reliable transport to get people from A

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.680 
reliable transport to get people from A
to<00:02:50.420> B<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:54.500> catapult<00:02:54.980> launches<00:02:55.580> things<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.540> so

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
to B the catapult launches things and so

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.970 
to B the catapult launches things and so
what<00:02:56.930> it's<00:02:57.050> launched<00:02:57.500> here<00:02:57.800> is<00:02:57.950> a

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
what it's launched here is a

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.520 
what it's launched here is a
relationship<00:02:58.760> between<00:02:59.330> the<00:03:00.110> mobile<00:03:00.260> robotics

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
relationship between the mobile robotics

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.610 
relationship between the mobile robotics
group<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.370> our<00:03:01.880> DM<00:03:02.210> which<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:03.080> don't<00:03:03.230> think<00:03:03.410> we

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
group and our DM which I don't think we

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.590 
group and our DM which I don't think we
would<00:03:03.800> have<00:03:03.830> found<00:03:04.100> without<00:03:04.970> them<00:03:05.240> that's

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
would have found without them that's

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.490 
would have found without them that's
just<00:03:05.720> great

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
just great

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.410 
just great
really<00:03:06.950> really<00:03:07.100> important<00:03:07.640> couldn't<00:03:08.300> have

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
really really important couldn't have

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.480 
really really important couldn't have
done<00:03:08.540> that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.550
