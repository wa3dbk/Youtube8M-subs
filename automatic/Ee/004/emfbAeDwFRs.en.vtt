00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.920 
is discontinuing the model all together
but<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.279> underpinnings<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.420> car<00:00:21.660> are

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
but the underpinnings of this car are

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.099 
but the underpinnings of this car are
the<00:00:22.289> same<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.460> Mazda<00:00:23.880> 3<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> Ford

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
car and then it has a Volvo's t5 engine

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.310 
car and then it has a Volvo's t5 engine
and<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.570> means<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
and that just means that it's a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.469 
and that just means that it's a
turbocharger<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.460> has<00:01:35.610> five<00:01:35.939> cylinders

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
turbocharger and it has five cylinders

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.780 
turbocharger and it has five cylinders
the<00:01:36.869> five<00:01:37.079> cylinders<00:01:37.619> are<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.979> course<00:01:38.189> inline

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the five cylinders are of course inline

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.330 
the five cylinders are of course inline
and<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.960> one<00:01:40.140> has<00:01:40.320> an<00:01:40.560> 18-inch

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and so this one has an 18-inch

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.330 
and so this one has an 18-inch
five-spoke<00:01:42.180> alloy<00:01:42.360> wheels<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.140> nice<00:01:43.439> looking
