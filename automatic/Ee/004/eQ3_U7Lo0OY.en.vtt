when they walk through the inner door it
will<00:00:18.869> send<00:00:19.170> them<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.590> room<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.340> another

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
will send them to a room in another

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.740 
will send them to a room in another
world<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.689> room<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.590> 12<00:00:23.070> x<00:00:23.369> 12<00:00:23.730> x<00:00:23.820> 12<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
world to this room is a 12 x 12 x 12 and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810 
world to this room is a 12 x 12 x 12 and
basically<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:25.980> their<00:00:26.070> own<00:00:26.099> personal

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
basically this is for their own personal

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.089 
basically this is for their own personal
space<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.779> they<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.050> store<00:00:28.320> whatever<00:00:28.980> they

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
space so they can store whatever they

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.919 
space so they can store whatever they
want<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.760> they<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.210> kind<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:30.750> this

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
want in here they can kind of have this

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.229 
want in here they can kind of have this
as<00:00:31.140> their<00:00:31.320> own<00:00:31.500> little<00:00:31.890> private<00:00:32.130> room<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.000> this

as their own little private room so this

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.120 
as their own little private room so this
