00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Imagine living in a house that can be 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.160
 taken to other places in a 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.840
 possible change it exists are the houses 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.059
 made in containers 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.370
 the new model is another option in 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.060
 construction and there are already people investing 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.070
 in this new model just from the outside 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.539
 many people thought it was a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.880
 deposit 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.730
 from the inside it is easy to understand the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.220
 concept beyond the reuse of five 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.940
 containers with more than 20 years of use 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.820
 the ottoman is made of barrel the macaws are 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.460
 bus railing still has the floor of the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.190
 deck that is rice husk to 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.370
 sustainability helps attract customers 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.989
 this concept of sustainability ends 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 drawing the attention of our customers 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.800
 a public profile merged between 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.829
 young né and adults all the public 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.989
 but it adds a lot of value to the goods, right? 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.449
 helps us in publicizing the brand of 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.890
 all goods also from the store. 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.879
 construction is going to be a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.010
 convenience 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.860
 already in the finishing phase is difficult 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.860
 believe but the structure is container 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.990
 when you arrived yesterday we give a 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.229
 sustained but now with the finish 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.580
 very satisfied she fit my 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.740
 space here and will be well differentiated 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.130
 the choice of renata was for practicality 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.860
 because of the agility of the deadline 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.600
 delivery and because of the cost né 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.610
 the structure is being thought of not only 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.890
 to meet the trade you already have 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.130
 imagine living in a container and if I 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.439
 show you this house and it's only 60 days 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.920
 to get ready with the leisure area 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.070
 are 130 square meters living room kitchen 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.100
 bathroom social service area three 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.360
 rooms a suite built in two 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.270
 containers 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.969
 the roof is galvanized steel windows 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.430
 guarantee the quality and circulation of air 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.049
 the temperature control is done by the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.540
 wall cladding 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.620
 we do not even need this 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.740
 using air conditioning right? 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.200
 besides the people are picking up correctly 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.890
 the natural ventilation system has 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.990
 also the natural lighting system and 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.190
 sometimes in certain places people 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.010
 extends the wall right for us capture by 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.200
 ventilation and lighting is 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.330
 possible to finish for all 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.120
 and the general economy of the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.430
 comparing with a masonry house 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.740
 reaches 40% is what guarantees the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.180
 responsible for the project also has the 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.530
 ecological advantage 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.320
 we are using containers 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.550
 seafarers who worked the ship 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.800
 transport for 15 years and 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.170
 these contracts were not previously 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.970
 used today they are being 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.510
 used worldwide in the condition 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.510
 stores Hotel home only in cases 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.340
 the foundation needs to be established. 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.040
 which means that if the owner wants to change 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.250
 address is to take the house with you 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.530
 with the house on top of a platform that 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.840
 going to change is wherever you want 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.790
 leads to this possibility in a way 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.160
 safe and quiet without sacrificing 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.160
 indication comes certainly makes us 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.989
 preparation before making the 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.350
 transport to be able to take 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.350
 other location
