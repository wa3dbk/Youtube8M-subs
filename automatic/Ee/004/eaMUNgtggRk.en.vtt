ink holder your impact holder so if

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.190 
ink holder your impact holder so if
let's<00:03:51.790> say<00:03:51.909> if<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.209> stack<00:03:52.510> them<00:03:52.689> like<00:03:52.750> this

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
let's say if you stack them like this

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.530 
let's say if you stack them like this
which<00:03:53.799> is<00:03:53.829> usually<00:03:54.519> what<00:03:54.669> people<00:03:54.700> do<00:03:55.180> and
