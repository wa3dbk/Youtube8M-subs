00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
through it up here but it's only coming

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.450 
through it up here but it's only coming
out<00:02:12.020> right<00:02:12.200> there<00:02:12.410> okay<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.950> reloading<00:02:13.340> is

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
out right there okay the reloading is

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.010 
out right there okay the reloading is
very<00:02:13.730> simple<00:02:14.000> all<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.330> have<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.600> do<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.870> just

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
very simple all you have to do is just

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.540 
very simple all you have to do is just
grab<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> dart<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.770> put<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.070> in<00:02:16.190> one<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.370> these

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
grab a dart and put it in one of these

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.310 
grab a dart and put it in one of these
little<00:02:16.910> holes<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:18.820> now<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:20.060> can<00:02:20.210> unload<00:02:20.690> six

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
little holes so now you can unload six

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.590 
little holes so now you can unload six
on<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:22.130> side<00:02:22.370> at<00:02:23.270> once<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.980> then<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:26.480> have

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
on this side at once and then you have

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.680 
on this side at once and then you have
to<00:02:26.720> rotate<00:02:27.320> it<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:28.300> then<00:02:29.300> there's<00:02:29.510> those

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
to rotate it and then there's those

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.900 
to rotate it and then there's those
other<00:02:29.960> four<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.830> we<00:02:31.370> didn't<00:02:31.640> get

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
other four that you we didn't get

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.650 
other four that you we didn't get
because<00:02:32.360> they<00:02:32.540> were<00:02:32.600> inside<00:02:33.200> by<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.680> wheels

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
because they were inside by the wheels

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.000 
because they were inside by the wheels
so<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:35.690> put<00:02:35.960> those<00:02:36.080> foreign<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.620> now<00:02:36.830> it's

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
so you put those foreign and now it's

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.820 
so you put those foreign and now it's
probably<00:02:37.310> reload<00:02:38.260> now<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.320> pros<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.650> cons

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
probably reload now the pros and cons

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.220 
probably reload now the pros and cons

which<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:55.040> don't<00:02:55.190> know<00:02:55.250> why<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.430> would<00:02:55.610> be

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
which I don't know why it would be

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.320 
which I don't know why it would be
because<00:02:56.230> definitely<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.530> primary<00:02:58.010> gun<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:59.150> can

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
because definitely a primary gun you can

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.060 
because definitely a primary gun you can
just<00:02:59.510> put<00:02:59.630> that<00:02:59.690> on<00:02:59.900> your<00:03:00.020> back<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.680> that's

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
just put that on your back and that's

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.670 
just put that on your back and that's
good<00:03:01.520> or<00:03:01.760> if<00:03:02.060> you're<00:03:02.180> out<00:03:02.330> cons<00:03:02.959> about<00:03:03.290> this

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
good or if you're out cons about this

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.699 
good or if you're out cons about this
gun<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.670> reload<00:03:05.000> time<00:03:05.030> is<00:03:05.660> pretty<00:03:06.410> slow

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
gun the reload time is pretty slow

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.009 
gun the reload time is pretty slow
unless<00:03:07.100> you're<00:03:07.310> good<00:03:07.459> like<00:03:07.610> me<00:03:07.910> it's<00:03:08.269> kind<00:03:08.870> of

loud<00:03:09.320> so<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.220> can't<00:03:10.730> really<00:03:10.850> go<00:03:11.269> stealthy<00:03:11.930> but

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
loud so you can't really go stealthy but

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.910 
loud so you can't really go stealthy but
that's<00:03:12.830> okay<00:03:13.160> because<00:03:13.630> everybody<00:03:14.630> just<00:03:15.200> loves
