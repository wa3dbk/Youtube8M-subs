that I'm using for secondary skills or

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.100 
that I'm using for secondary skills or
passive<00:03:39.790> skills<00:03:40.000> are<00:03:40.180> grave<00:03:40.390> injustice<00:03:40.720> and

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
passive skills are grave injustice and

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.370 
passive skills are grave injustice and
vision<00:03:41.410> quest<00:03:43.080> obviously<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.230> reason

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
vision quest obviously the reason

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.250 
vision quest obviously the reason
they're<00:03:44.709> being<00:03:45.070> mana<00:03:45.850> regen<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.600> just

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
they're being mana regen and just

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.199 
they're being mana regen and just
efficiency<00:03:47.830> of<00:03:47.980> farm<00:03:48.310> are<00:03:48.580> really<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.180> two

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
efficiency of farm are really the two

efficiency of farm are really the two
main<00:03:49.540> reasons<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:50.110> you<00:03:50.170> want<00:03:50.530> those<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
main reasons that you want those the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.460 
main reasons that you want those the
nice<00:03:52.180> thing<00:03:52.450> about<00:03:52.480> this<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:52.900> i<00:03:53.080> found<00:03:53.320> an

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
nice thing about this is i found an

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.910 
nice thing about this is i found an
offhand<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.070> actually<00:03:54.640> redirects<00:03:55.500> any<00:03:56.500> of

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
offhand that actually redirects any of

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.820 
offhand that actually redirects any of
my<00:03:57.390> or<00:03:58.390> twenty-five<00:03:58.840> percent<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:59.140> my<00:03:59.290> damage

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
my or twenty-five percent of my damage

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.460 
my or twenty-five percent of my damage
to<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.160> zombie<00:04:00.520> dogs<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.510> i<00:04:01.900> don't<00:04:02.050> even<00:04:02.320> have

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
to the zombie dogs so i don't even have

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.830 
to the zombie dogs so i don't even have
to<00:04:02.890> use<00:04:02.920> many<00:04:03.520> survivability<00:04:04.180> talents<00:04:04.750> with

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
to use many survivability talents with

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.060 
to use many survivability talents with
this<00:04:04.959> bill<00:04:05.170> especially<00:04:05.350> with<00:04:05.740> the<00:04:05.890> offhand

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
this bill especially with the offhand

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.310 
this bill especially with the offhand
that<00:04:06.340> I<00:04:06.459> have<00:04:06.700> which<00:04:07.570> I've<00:04:07.750> actually<00:04:07.930> scroll

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
that I have which I've actually scroll

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.990 
that I have which I've actually scroll
through<00:04:08.530> in<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:08.709> video<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:09.580> keep<00:04:09.820> that<00:04:09.850> in

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
through in this video so keep that in

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.190 
through in this video so keep that in
mind<00:04:10.240> that<00:04:10.450> that's<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.750> reason<00:04:10.990> that<00:04:11.020> the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
mind that that's the reason that the

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.690 
mind that that's the reason that the
survivability<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.740> the<00:04:12.070> spec<00:04:12.250> is<00:04:12.370> so<00:04:12.490> high<00:04:12.640> for

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
survivability of the spec is so high for

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.430 
survivability of the spec is so high for
me<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.450> do<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.780> fact<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.110> the<00:04:14.260> offhand

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
me to do to the fact that the offhand

piranha<00:05:44.590> nado<00:05:44.920> again<00:05:45.520> what<00:05:46.300> I'll<00:05:46.420> do<00:05:46.570> there<00:05:46.750> is

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
piranha nado again what I'll do there is

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.180 
piranha nado again what I'll do there is
that<00:05:46.990> way<00:05:47.080> you<00:05:47.140> can<00:05:47.350> suck<00:05:47.590> everything<00:05:47.830> and

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
that way you can suck everything and

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.430 
that way you can suck everything and
throw<00:05:48.430> your<00:05:48.550> grasp<00:05:48.850> down<00:05:49.210> and<00:05:49.720> then<00:05:49.990> ask<00:05:50.260> the

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
throw your grasp down and then ask the

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.590 
throw your grasp down and then ask the
cloud<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.890> that's<00:05:51.070> going<00:05:51.310> to<00:05:51.370> give<00:05:51.430> you<00:05:51.760> quite

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
cloud and that's going to give you quite

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.930 
cloud and that's going to give you quite
a<00:05:52.660> bit<00:05:52.900> more<00:05:53.050> concentrated<00:05:53.920> DPS<00:05:54.400> I<00:05:54.640> believe

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
a bit more concentrated DPS I believe

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.250 
a bit more concentrated DPS I believe
then<00:05:55.480> maybe<00:05:55.930> just<00:05:56.460> you<00:05:57.460> know<00:05:57.900> vengeful<00:05:58.900> spirit

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
then maybe just you know vengeful spirit

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.140 
then maybe just you know vengeful spirit
by<00:05:59.380> itself<00:05:59.710> so<00:05:59.980> i<00:06:00.160> will<00:06:00.460> probably<00:06:00.610> go<00:06:00.940> that

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
by itself so i will probably go that

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.700 
by itself so i will probably go that
route<00:06:01.330> and<00:06:01.540> then<00:06:01.630> for<00:06:01.780> the<00:06:01.840> fourth<00:06:02.110> talent<00:06:02.590> i

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
route and then for the fourth talent i

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.410 
route and then for the fourth talent i
would<00:06:03.040> probably<00:06:03.190> ask<00:06:03.610> you<00:06:03.880> can<00:06:04.030> summon<00:06:04.300> a

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
would probably ask you can summon a

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.410 
would probably ask you can summon a
fourth<00:06:04.720> zombie<00:06:05.200> dog<00:06:05.410> or<00:06:06.000> use<00:06:07.000> the<00:06:08.910> or<00:06:09.910> use<00:06:10.270> the

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
fourth zombie dog or use the or use the

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.850 
fourth zombie dog or use the or use the
one<00:06:10.540> that<00:06:10.720> gives<00:06:10.990> all<00:06:11.230> your<00:06:11.380> zombie<00:06:11.680> dogs
