guys<00:03:56.130> have<00:03:56.340> asked<00:03:56.670> me<00:03:57.050> when<00:03:58.050> I<00:03:58.110> videotape<00:03:59.570> with

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
guys have asked me when I videotape with

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.890 
guys have asked me when I videotape with
my<00:04:00.720> GoPro<00:04:00.960> you<00:04:01.290> know<00:04:01.530> what<00:04:01.710> do<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:01.970> set<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.090> at<00:04:03.240> so

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
my GoPro you know what do I set it at so

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.010 
my GoPro you know what do I set it at so
when<00:04:04.050> I'm<00:04:04.140> diving<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:04.770> usually<00:04:05.370> shoot<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:05.670> at

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
when I'm diving I usually shoot it at

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.890 
when I'm diving I usually shoot it at
720<00:04:07.020> and<00:04:07.230> 60<00:04:08.130> frames<00:04:08.340> per<00:04:08.520> second<00:04:09.120> because

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
720 and 60 frames per second because

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.400 
720 and 60 frames per second because
it's<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.230> low<00:04:10.440> light<00:04:11.930> function<00:04:12.930> on<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.200> GoPro

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
it's a low light function on the GoPro

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.800 
it's a low light function on the GoPro
so<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.370> really<00:04:14.610> helps<00:04:14.970> out<00:04:15.150> when<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.510> get<00:04:15.630> down

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
so it really helps out when you get down

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.130 
so it really helps out when you get down
below<00:04:16.200> where<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:17.250> lighting<00:04:17.610> isn't<00:04:17.790> is<00:04:18.140> bright

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
below where the lighting isn't is bright

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.320 
below where the lighting isn't is bright
and<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:20.010> really<00:04:20.250> pops<00:04:20.549> out<00:04:20.730> a<00:04:20.790> little<00:04:20.940> bit<00:04:21.120> more

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
and it really pops out a little bit more

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.800 
and it really pops out a little bit more
so<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:21.540> shoot<00:04:21.780> at<00:04:22.430> 720<00:04:23.430> sixty<00:04:24.390> frames<00:04:24.510> per

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
so I shoot at 720 sixty frames per

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.620 
so I shoot at 720 sixty frames per
second<00:04:25.230> low<00:04:25.950> light<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:27.180> works<00:04:27.450> out<00:04:27.570> really

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
second low light and it works out really

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.420 
second low light and it works out really
well<00:04:28.020> with<00:04:28.500> with<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:29.490> setting<00:04:30.030> and

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
well with with that setting and

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.220 
well with with that setting and
