00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
spark plug all that stuff so this is

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.860 
spark plug all that stuff so this is
what<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.789> starts<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.210> now

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:35.020 

what<00:01:11.440> really<00:01:11.860> has

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.160 

they're<00:01:35.420> filter<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:38.060> increase

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.480 

greased<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.350> all<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> connections<00:01:44.370> without

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
greased up all the connections without

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.000 
greased up all the connections without
dielectric<00:01:45.360> grease<00:01:47.750> about<00:01:48.750> fitting<00:01:49.050> new

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
dielectric grease about fitting new

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.730 
dielectric grease about fitting new
there

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:02.580 

yes<00:01:54.780> very<00:01:55.780> good

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.490 

but<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:03.159> guess<00:02:03.549> I<00:02:03.820> really<00:02:04.360> can<00:02:04.780> really<00:02:05.079> do<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.259> lot

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
but I guess I really can really do a lot

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.270 
but I guess I really can really do a lot
of<00:02:05.530> this<00:02:05.710> video<00:02:06.009> but<00:02:06.310> it's<00:02:06.909> good<00:02:07.090> now
