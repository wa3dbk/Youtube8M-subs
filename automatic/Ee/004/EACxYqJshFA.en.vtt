00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.130 
okay if you don't understand pinched
harmonics<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.180> think<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.630> lesson<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.020> my

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
harmonics I think I have a lesson on my

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.980 
harmonics I think I have a lesson on my
channel<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.620> pinched<00:02:28.860> harmonics<00:02:29.000> next<00:02:30.000> part

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:41.090 

that's<00:02:33.990> gonna<00:02:34.200> go<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:38.570> think<00:02:39.570> eight<00:02:40.050> times<00:02:40.100> it's

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
that's gonna go I think eight times it's

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.340 
that's gonna go I think eight times it's
for<00:02:41.340> eight<00:02:41.520> times<00:02:41.780> bar<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.960> fifth<00:02:43.140> fret<00:02:43.290> on

pick in other words down up down so

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.160 
pick in other words down up down so
actually<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.030> down<00:02:51.330> up

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
actually just down up

not a trip it's down up palm-muted then
middle<00:02:56.110> fingers<00:02:56.350> gonna<00:02:56.500> do<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.830> 6th<00:02:57.190> fret

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370

barred on the ena lift the palm off for

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.640 
barred on the ena lift the palm off for
that<00:03:00.580> so

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
that so

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.240 
that so
and<00:03:03.129> then<00:03:03.640> from<00:03:03.849> there<00:03:04.060> it's<00:03:05.069> back<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.159> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
and then from there it's back to the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.449 
and then from there it's back to the
fifth<00:03:06.459> fret<00:03:06.580> on<00:03:07.030> muted<00:03:07.780> on<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.500> ena<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.010> then

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
fifth fret on muted on the ena and then

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.160 
back to the sixth fret of the middle
finger<00:03:11.200> no<00:03:11.530> palm<00:03:11.769> here<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:13.420> it's<00:03:13.510> an<00:03:13.599> excellent

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
finger no palm here so it's an excellent

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.289 
finger no palm here so it's an excellent

exercise for palm muting system of down

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.479 
exercise for palm muting system of down
you<00:03:17.080> know<00:03:17.200> kind<00:03:17.409> of<00:03:17.440> like<00:03:17.650> Metallica<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.370> the

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
you know kind of like Metallica in the

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.490 
you know kind of like Metallica in the
sense<00:03:18.730> at<00:03:19.299> least<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.599> early<00:03:19.629> Metallica<00:03:20.110> where

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
sense at least the early Metallica where

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.930 
sense at least the early Metallica where
there's<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.739> lot<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.040> bounciness<00:03:21.519> with<00:03:21.819> the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
there's a lot of bounciness with the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.030 
there's a lot of bounciness with the
palm<00:03:22.120> muting<00:03:22.420> system<00:03:22.989> of<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.170> Down's<00:03:23.379> notorious

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
palm muting system of a Down's notorious

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.319 
palm muting system of a Down's notorious
for<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.519> they're<00:03:24.610> very<00:03:24.640> good<00:03:24.970> at<00:03:25.180> it

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
for it and they're very good at it

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.530 
for it and they're very good at it
so<00:03:25.840> here's<00:03:26.440> one<00:03:26.709> time<00:03:29.549> so<00:03:30.549> after<00:03:30.849> you<00:03:30.909> go<00:03:31.090> down

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
so here's one time so after you go down

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.280 
so here's one time so after you go down
up<00:03:31.750> down

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
up down

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.160 
up down
this<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.590> alternate<00:03:33.069> picked<00:03:33.280> by<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.489> way<00:03:34.170> well

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
this is alternate picked by the way well

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.869 
this is alternate picked by the way well
partially<00:03:35.620> down<00:03:36.340> up<00:03:36.549> down<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:39.519> rest<00:03:39.700> are

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
partially down up down and the rest are

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:46.890 
partially down up down and the rest are
down<00:03:40.060> strokes<00:03:40.390> actually<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:42.540> they'll<00:03:43.540> be<00:03:45.900> back

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
down strokes actually so they'll be back

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.570 
down strokes actually so they'll be back
to<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.109> five

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.150 

three<00:03:53.330> times<00:03:53.570> after<00:03:53.960> that<00:03:53.990> call<00:03:54.710> that<00:03:54.920> one

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
three times after that call that one

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.710 
three times after that call that one
time<00:03:55.490> and<00:03:55.760> play<00:03:56.360> it

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
time and play it

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
time and play it
I<00:03:56.750> believe<00:03:57.230> this<00:03:57.380> number<00:03:57.530> down<00:03:57.740> does<00:03:57.980> eight

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.680 

what<00:04:03.740> four<00:04:04.040> times<00:04:04.070> of<00:04:04.490> this<00:04:04.670> I<00:04:04.940> know<00:04:05.000> that<00:04:05.120> they

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
what four times of this I know that they

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.050 
what four times of this I know that they
go<00:04:08.950> that's<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:10.160> quarter<00:04:10.400> of<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.910> whole

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
go that's a quarter of the whole

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.090 
go that's a quarter of the whole
progression<00:04:11.270> do<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:12.020> three<00:04:12.320> more<00:04:12.350> times<00:04:12.530> and

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
progression do that three more times and

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.040 
progression do that three more times and
you'll<00:04:13.430> have<00:04:13.580> exactly<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.480> same<00:04:14.510> amount<00:04:14.750> on

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
you'll have exactly the same amount on

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:23.150 
you'll have exactly the same amount on
this<00:04:15.230> system

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.400 

I'm<00:04:23.820> gonna<00:04:23.970> show<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.210> another<00:04:24.840> part<00:04:25.050> too<00:04:25.230> but

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
I'm gonna show you another part too but
