showing<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.290> guys<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.980> tweaks<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.180> has

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
showing you guys the tweaks that it has

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.840 
showing you guys the tweaks that it has
all<00:02:29.780> put<00:02:30.530> together<00:02:30.769> to<00:02:31.250> make<00:02:31.430> springtomize

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
all put together to make springtomize

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.590 
all put together to make springtomize
for<00:02:32.330> example<00:02:32.720> mock<00:02:33.500> seconds<00:02:34.120> walks<00:02:35.120> against

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
for example mock seconds walks against

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.500 
for example mock seconds walks against
this<00:02:35.870> box<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.830> basically<00:02:37.820> already<00:02:38.060> live<00:02:38.450> there

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
this box is basically already live there

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.300 
this box is basically already live there
and<00:02:38.750> also<00:02:38.900> fake<00:02:39.170> operator<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.920> all<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.160> those

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
and also fake operator and all of those

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.509 
and also fake operator and all of those
springtomize<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.360> basically<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.140> seguir<00:02:42.519> cydia

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
springtomize is basically a seguir cydia

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.060 
springtomize is basically a seguir cydia
tweaks<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:44.269> lot<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:44.900> cydia<00:02:45.170> tweets<00:02:45.440> or<00:02:45.739> maybe<00:02:45.980> a

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
tweaks a lot of cydia tweets or maybe a

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.430 
tweaks a lot of cydia tweets or maybe a
couple<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.459> say<00:02:46.610> eight<00:02:46.760> weeks<00:02:47.440> putting

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
couple of say eight weeks putting

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.080 
couple of say eight weeks putting
together<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.900> really<00:02:50.900> awesomely<00:02:51.880> yeah<00:02:52.880> i

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
together and really awesomely yeah i

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.670 
together and really awesomely yeah i
guess<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.480> could<00:02:53.600> say<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:54.230> I'll<00:02:54.380> have<00:02:54.530> an

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
guess you could say that so I'll have an

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.370 
guess you could say that so I'll have an
annotation<00:02:54.799> I'm<00:02:55.790> showing

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
annotation I'm showing

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.540 
annotation I'm showing
maybe<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:58.010> few<00:02:58.430> or<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.850> couple<00:02:59.270> or<00:03:00.130> maybe<00:03:01.130> if<00:03:01.430> I'm

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
maybe a few or a couple or maybe if I'm

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.280 
maybe a few or a couple or maybe if I'm
familiarized<00:03:02.210> with<00:03:02.480> all<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.780> cydia<00:03:03.020> tweaks

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
familiarized with all the cydia tweaks

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.340 
familiarized with all the cydia tweaks
then<00:03:03.620> I'll<00:03:04.280> have<00:03:04.460> all<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:05.120> tweets<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:05.720> it

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
then I'll have all the tweets that it

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.720 
then I'll have all the tweets that it
has<00:03:06.560> put<00:03:07.220> into<00:03:07.550> springtomize<00:03:08.530> okay<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:10.580> that's

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
has put into springtomize okay so that's

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.720
