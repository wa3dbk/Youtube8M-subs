surprising<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.849> be<00:00:11.940> able<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.210> say<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.389> I

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
surprising to be able to say that I

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.820 
surprising to be able to say that I
think<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:12.870> time<00:00:13.049> last<00:00:13.230> year<00:00:13.410> when<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.620> came

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
think this time last year when we came

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.350 
think this time last year when we came
here<00:00:14.009> with<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.309> really<00:00:14.549> well<00:00:14.670> for<00:00:14.759> 45<00:00:15.150> minutes

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
here with is really well for 45 minutes

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.660 
here with is really well for 45 minutes
and<00:00:15.599> then<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.990> struggle<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:16.920> today<00:00:17.250> for<00:00:17.460> 90

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
and then and struggle but today for 90

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.040 
and then and struggle but today for 90
minutes<00:00:17.850> we<00:00:18.060> were<00:00:18.150> excellent<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
minutes we were excellent on the for the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.230 
minutes we were excellent on the for the
chances<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.650> created<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.550> think

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
chances that we created and I think

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.519 
chances that we created and I think
apart<00:00:21.449> from<00:00:21.570> probably<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> last<00:00:22.050> 10<00:00:22.350> minutes

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
apart from probably the last 10 minutes

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.650 
apart from probably the last 10 minutes
15<00:00:22.920> minutes<00:00:22.949> where<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.369> think<00:00:23.699> quite<00:00:24.240> naturally

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
15 minutes where I think quite naturally

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.759 
15 minutes where I think quite naturally
for<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.840> players<00:00:25.109> they've<00:00:25.380> come<00:00:25.529> into<00:00:25.680> the

it<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:33.930> refreshing<00:01:34.140> when<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> spoke<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> him<00:01:35.070> in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it was refreshing when I spoke to him in

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.850 
it was refreshing when I spoke to him in
a<00:01:35.250> summer<00:01:35.460> about<00:01:35.640> coming<00:01:35.970> into<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> club<00:01:36.860> he

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
a summer about coming into the club he

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.170 
a summer about coming into the club he
had<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> lot<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> big<00:01:38.460> clubs<00:01:38.700> around<00:01:38.820> Europe

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
had a lot of big clubs around Europe

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.960 
had a lot of big clubs around Europe
looking<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.659> him<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.930> wanting<00:01:40.439> him<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:40.970> it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
looking at him and wanting him but it

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.100 
looking at him and wanting him but it
wasn't<00:01:42.210> about<00:01:42.270> money<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.689> was<00:01:42.780> about<00:01:42.930> football

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
wasn't about money it was about football

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
wasn't about money it was about football
and<00:01:43.350> he's<00:01:43.890> very<00:01:43.979> football<00:01:44.490> orientated<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and he's very football orientated and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.880 
and he's very football orientated and
then<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.079> from<00:01:46.200> his<00:01:46.320> family<00:01:46.740> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
then I think that's from his family that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.350 
then I think that's from his family that
he<00:01:46.950> gets<00:01:47.310> down<00:01:47.460> he<00:01:47.610> was<00:01:47.700> refreshing<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.119> hear

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
he gets down he was refreshing to hear

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.609 
he gets down he was refreshing to hear
and<00:01:48.540> when<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> spoke<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.990> him<00:01:49.079> he<00:01:49.110> was<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.439> keen

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and when I spoke to him he was so keen

that<00:02:49.030> belief<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:49.569> then<00:02:49.690> look<00:02:50.319> it's<00:02:50.500> one<00:02:50.620> game

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
that belief and then look it's one game

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.309 
that belief and then look it's one game
it's<00:02:51.129> one<00:02:51.280> point<00:02:51.629> if<00:02:52.629> we<00:02:52.780> don't<00:02:52.930> back<00:02:53.019> this<00:02:53.170> up

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
it's one point if we don't back this up

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.080 
it's one point if we don't back this up
the<00:02:53.470> following<00:02:53.769> week<00:02:53.920> then<00:02:54.190> we<00:02:54.220> know<00:02:54.430> we're

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
the following week then we know we're

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.869
