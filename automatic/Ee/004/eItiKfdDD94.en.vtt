00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.849
 quite a lot of interesting things well 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.849
 let's get everything in order 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.130
 there were many lectures in the cabin and 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.570
 workshops and master classes it was all 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.849
 timed to the main theme 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.560
 new education architecture we 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.419
 attended a seminar called 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.090
 lego educational robotics 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.829
 mindstorms education ev3 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.750
 led or about maxim vasilyev 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.210
 certified trainer lego food geisha 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.100
 Academy was hard for us to believe but with 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.230
 help sets lego mae storm 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.210
 you can assemble a robot in absolutely for 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.579
 different goals of course all this 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.019
 programmed by computer yes 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.869
 and there are special instructions on 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.369
 certain robots the main thing is that 

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:57.140
 education these kits give very 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:00.100
 diverse approach to mastering 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.110
 robotics children in school 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.580
 space sets were also shown 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.210
 as well as the ability to program 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.369
 robots through the plates in the system if ios 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.650
 viper tires than before is different from 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.630
 usual lego usually rega this is how we all 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.710
 we know plastic in a regular box plus 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.619
 some instructions 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.270
 wild tire is always educational 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.110
 approach accordingly it is not entertainment 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.700
 children in the truest sense of the word for 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.550
 work snowmen that always need some 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.590
 tender ie it is either a caregiver or 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.360
 teacher any trainer either 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.920
 for example the parent himself who wants 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.050
 child pull on computer science whether 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.020
 the English language solution themselves 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.700
 educational oleg different from those 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.600
 what we can wear baby or any 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.370
 another store 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.780
 not just the presence of some kind of plastic 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.430
 a large number but first 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.070
 thoughtful teaching materials 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.960
 by key subject by key 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.590
 competences for children of various 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.440
 ages 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.970
 responsibly with courses with lessons giants 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.070
 world technology also could not get around 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.840
 party to this event for example 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.750
 microsoft showed its tablets on the base 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.909
 windows 10 ayatollah not only showed but 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.470
 and talked about the different technologies that 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.179
 can be used in education 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.190
 most of all we liked 3d 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.840
 face scan with special 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.099
 cameras 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.810
 embedded itself in two or monoblock 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.060
 many scientific papers were presented 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.040
 different universities of the country for example bicycles 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.470
 race cars and various other 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.810
 exhibits are collected in students of different 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.379
 Ages are still shown everywhere. 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.200
 printers 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.879
 their possibilities were the latest 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.099
 and very interesting specimens with 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.950
 possibility of printing at once in two types 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.660
 plastics of course very impressions 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.879
 driving simulators and 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.430
 motorcycle is very realistic 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.989
 designs that transmit vibration and 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.190
 other driving sensations 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.620
 whole Moscow International Salon 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.519
 Education turned out to be interesting and 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.170
 varied 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.480
 everyone could do something for himself 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.459

 like to write comments about 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.860
 what robot volume would you make of 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.410
 mindstorms lego set 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.190
 well and on the channel you should have ears
