 Y 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.259
 which will cost the because it is very 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.459
 well today here uruguay and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.959
 welcome gentlemen to this video tutorial 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.509
 of origins in which I'm going to teach you 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.099
 how to get the short-range weapon 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.259
 special that highlights two in a fist 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.910
 of kung fu or some strange martial art 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.500
 this is achieved in a very easy way 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.470
 gentlemen but let's say they need 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.210
 in meeting some requirements in 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.230
 let's just say that the only 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.610
 requirements that they have to do is 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.620
 fill these chests there will be four 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.360
 chests around the map one of them 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.420
 will be behind juger we will 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.860
 be coming down from the excavation where with 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.989
 the foot the good giant indeed in 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.050
 all places the giant in step out there 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.460
 in another is in this mine and another is 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.960
 before the church then these are 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.940
 the four chests and what they have to 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.559
 to do is kill 40 zombies near each 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.289
 one of them in each box goes to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.359
 absorb 40 more zombies and then one 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.890
 once they do what it would be to fill all 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.239
 these chests do not have to be an order 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.739
 I do not ex you at the same time or anything 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.510
 just fill the all with return 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.949
 zombies each one will see what they 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.140
 it looks like this medal that is the measure 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.880
 longer of the challenge of obviously so 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.100
 fill the four chests of souls of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.750
 zombies and then this is going to be able to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.190
 get fists eye gentlemen something 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.050
 nothing more a little advice that you 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.010
 I want to give if the giants go through 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.080
 where is the chest 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.550
 they will see that when the footprint falls on 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.650
 chest is going to close this means that 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.720
 the restart process then if it's 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.010
 who carry 35 are and if the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.420
 giant and closes the chest are going to have 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.770
 to refill the 40 zombies 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.420
 then ladies have this in mind if 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.040
 is that they see that the good giant is the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.690
 best chest do not fill it experience that 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.190
 happens and then they start filling it 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.470
 this is good I tell you once that 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.450
 have this medal of the challenge of the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.220
 four chests go to the start or to the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.770
 generator 6 where the tablet comes out with 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.750
 the medals are going to see that the mother of 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.980
 until this is going to be understood 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.620
 of orange color and what they have to 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.080
 to do is point that medal and open the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.080
 box saying good that says in pressure 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.400
 to X to get this this award 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.930
 then nothing else press x and they will 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.450
 it seems like now yellow 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.650
 this yellow order grabs him and then 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.930
 of that they will already learn what would be 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.430
 this technique of kung fu or whatever and 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.380
 Well these fists and we will kill 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.580
 a hit until the 19th round so they are 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.440
 quite useful can be improved 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.030
 obviously already with the icetex but 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.340
 for that you need four people 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.750
 well maybe two nothing but good 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.070
 gentlemen or everything navas to get 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.480
 the fists after I will start to climb 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.709
 the tutorials of the centers and all that 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.030
 but hey, he just wanted me to 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.920
 knew this of the fists and then nothing 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.580
 it's because I like this video 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.580
 goodbye
