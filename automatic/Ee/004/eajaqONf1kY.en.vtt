00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
for rumble at Rama 12 I think I think

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.150 
for rumble at Rama 12 I think I think
that<00:00:47.110> last<00:00:47.320> round<00:00:47.590> might<00:00:47.830> have<00:00:47.950> been<00:00:48.070> the

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
that last round might have been the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.530 
that last round might have been the
hardest<00:00:48.340> round<00:00:48.730> to<00:00:48.880> score<00:00:49.000> because<00:00:49.330> there<00:00:49.450> was

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
hardest round to score because there was

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.850 
hardest round to score because there was
a<00:00:49.600> lot<00:00:49.750> of<00:00:49.780> wrestling<00:00:50.260> going<00:00:50.350> on<00:00:50.559> no<00:00:50.710> one

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
about changing your style and trying to

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.300 
about changing your style and trying to
box<00:01:05.440> more<00:01:05.860> but<00:01:06.850> if<00:01:06.970> you<00:01:07.000> have<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.890> heart<00:01:09.130> of<00:01:09.220> a

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
box more but if you have the heart of a

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.430 
box more but if you have the heart of a
lion<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:09.910> fighter<00:01:10.180> sooner<00:01:10.690> or<00:01:10.810> later<00:01:10.930> that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
lion in a fighter sooner or later that

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.230 
lion in a fighter sooner or later that
comes<00:01:11.710> up<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.130> I<00:01:12.460> think<00:01:12.700> that's<00:01:12.880> what<00:01:13.030> we've

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
comes up and I think that's what we've

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.930 
comes up and I think that's what we've
seen<00:01:13.479> from<00:01:14.229> Anna<00:01:14.440> who<00:01:14.680> Letran<00:01:15.040> who<00:01:15.700> in<00:01:15.850> the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
seen from Anna who Letran who in the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.670 
seen from Anna who Letran who in the
first<00:01:16.180> couple<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.570> rounds<00:01:16.930> followed<00:01:17.590> the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
first couple of rounds followed the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.100 
first couple of rounds followed the
gameplan<00:01:18.160> fairly<00:01:18.670> well<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.300> now<00:01:19.690> that<00:01:19.930> she's

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
gameplan fairly well and now that she's

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.980 
gameplan fairly well and now that she's
in<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.290> bit<00:01:20.470> of<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.680> brawl

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.570 

oh<00:01:24.020> there's<00:01:24.590> no<00:01:24.710> doubt<00:01:24.920> about<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:25.340> she

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
oh there's no doubt about it that she

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.890 
oh there's no doubt about it that she
has<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.880> heart<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.150> a<00:01:26.240> fighter<00:01:26.420> but<00:01:26.510> I<00:01:26.660> think

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
has the heart of a fighter but I think

there by Villalobos it went veal I think

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.760

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:40.689

rounds I think she's able to control
around<00:05:41.349> and<00:05:42.340> really<00:05:42.759> keep<00:05:43.050> Bulacan<00:05:44.050> defensive
