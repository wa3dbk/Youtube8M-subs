electric vehicle industry in general
it's<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:18.060> first<00:00:18.300> electric<00:00:18.840> car<00:00:19.050> built<00:00:19.350> from

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it's the first electric car built from

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.320 
it's the first electric car built from
the<00:00:19.680> ground<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:20.189> designed<00:00:20.640> as<00:00:20.850> an<00:00:20.970> electric

car with a bunch of battery stuffed into
it<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.260> also<00:00:25.439> Tesla's<00:00:26.039> key<00:00:26.279> to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
it and it's also Tesla's key to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.460 
it and it's also Tesla's key to
profitability<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.900> we're<00:00:28.019> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.199> take<00:00:28.410> a

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
profitability so we're going to take a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.140 
profitability so we're going to take a
drive<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.250> car<00:00:29.519> we're<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> drive<00:00:30.060> it

you were gone

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.170 
you were gone
now<00:01:04.739> back<00:01:05.040> off<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.640> even<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.000> turn

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
now back off you don't even have to turn

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.580 
now back off you don't even have to turn
in<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:06.360> break<00:01:06.540> Thanks<00:01:07.050> don't<00:01:07.229> touch<00:01:07.440> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
in the break Thanks don't touch the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.990 
in the break Thanks don't touch the
brakes<00:01:07.650> you're<00:01:08.159> touching<00:01:08.490> them<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
brakes you're touching them so the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
brakes you're touching them so the
regenerative<00:01:12.390> braking<00:01:12.930> basically<00:01:13.500> makes<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
regenerative braking basically makes it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
regenerative braking basically makes it
so<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.370> pull<00:01:14.640> your<00:01:15.030> yeah<00:01:15.300> it's<00:01:15.450> very

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
so you just pull your yeah it's very

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
so you just pull your yeah it's very
much<00:01:15.960> single<00:01:16.400> single<00:01:17.400> pedal<00:01:17.670> driving

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.430 

now<00:01:21.360> letting<00:01:21.900> your<00:01:21.990> foot<00:01:22.170> off<00:01:22.260> the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
now letting your foot off the

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.050 
now letting your foot off the
accelerator<00:01:22.760> feel<00:01:23.760> the<00:01:23.910> car<00:01:24.090> slowing<00:01:24.420> down<00:01:26.060> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
accelerator feel the car slowing down it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
accelerator feel the car slowing down it
takes<00:01:27.330> some<00:01:27.450> getting<00:01:27.720> used<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.050> doesn't<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.440> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
takes some getting used to doesn't it it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.870 
takes some getting used to doesn't it it
does<00:01:28.950> take<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> little<00:01:29.400> bit<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:29.760> it's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
does take a little bit but it's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.320 
does take a little bit but it's
incredibly<00:01:30.450> intuitive<00:01:31.430> once<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.760> get<00:01:32.940> dialed

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
incredibly intuitive once you get dialed

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.170 
incredibly intuitive once you get dialed
in<00:01:33.480> which<00:01:33.750> i<00:01:34.050> will<00:01:34.680> say<00:01:34.890> takes<00:01:35.220> maybe<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.940> few

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
in which i will say takes maybe a few

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.780 
in which i will say takes maybe a few
miles<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.750> driving<00:01:36.990> okay<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.800> just<00:01:37.830> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
miles of driving okay you just you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.370 
miles of driving okay you just you
really<00:01:39.180> don't<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> step<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.200> brake

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
really don't have to step on the brake

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.310 
really don't have to step on the brake
except<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> stop<00:01:41.160> or<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.390> very<00:01:42.720> fast<00:01:43.020> slow

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
except the stop or in very fast slow

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.469 
except the stop or in very fast slow
down<00:01:43.530> situations<00:01:44.190> ok<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.180> I'm<00:01:45.270> almost

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
down situations ok so I'm almost

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.240 
down situations ok so I'm almost
coasting<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> stop<00:01:46.470> now<00:01:46.710> correct

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
coasting to a stop now correct

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.460 
coasting to a stop now correct
regenerative<00:01:47.790> braking<00:01:48.150> of<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.360> yeah<00:01:48.660> and<00:01:49.350> now

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
regenerative braking of it yeah and now

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.600 
regenerative braking of it yeah and now
you're<00:01:49.620> just<00:01:49.770> using<00:01:49.950> your<00:01:50.130> brake<00:01:50.370> to<00:01:50.550> stop

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
you're just using your brake to stop

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.080 
you're just using your brake to stop
that<00:01:51.240> was<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.500> center<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.310> gravity<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.820> so

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that was the the center of gravity is so

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.180 
that was the the center of gravity is so
low<00:01:54.330> with<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.660> battery<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.470> stability<00:01:56.160> of

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
low with the battery the stability of

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.140 
low with the battery the stability of
the<00:01:56.460> car<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.920> really<00:01:59.220> is<00:01:59.369> an<00:01:59.610> extremely

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
the car is it really is an extremely

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.840 
the car is it really is an extremely
smooth<00:02:00.509> yes<00:02:01.050> yeah<00:02:01.410> and<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.310> pickup<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
smooth yes yeah and the the pickup is a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.969 
smooth yes yeah and the the pickup is a
lot<00:02:03.060> faster<00:02:03.270> than<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> standard<00:02:04.380> sedan

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
lot faster than kind of a standard sedan

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.219 
lot faster than kind of a standard sedan
well<00:02:05.880> because<00:02:06.150> it<00:02:06.330> puts<00:02:06.780> out<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.900> hundred

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
well because it puts out a hundred

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.320 
well because it puts out a hundred
percent<00:02:07.290> torque<00:02:07.800> from<00:02:08.009> zero<00:02:08.280> pm's<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:09.090> car

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
percent torque from zero pm's this car

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.090 
percent torque from zero pm's this car
which<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.690> non-performance<00:02:10.500> version<00:02:10.920> has

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
which is the non-performance version has

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.449 
which is the non-performance version has
400<00:02:11.670> Newton<00:02:11.850> beat<00:02:12.120> newton<00:02:12.690> meters<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:12.989> torque

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
400 Newton beat newton meters of torque

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.540 
400 Newton beat newton meters of torque
from<00:02:14.459> zero<00:02:14.790> rpms<00:02:15.480> that's<00:02:15.930> really<00:02:16.320> fast<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:17.160> mean

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
from zero rpms that's really fast I mean

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.590 
from zero rpms that's really fast I mean
and<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.200> 5.2<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.830> five<00:02:20.640> point<00:02:20.880> six<00:02:21.209> five

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
and it's 5.2 so five point six five

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.340 
and it's 5.2 so five point six five
point<00:02:22.110> six<00:02:22.320> zero<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.890> 60<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.959> then<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
point six zero to 60 and then with the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.960 
point six zero to 60 and then with the
performance<00:02:25.860> version<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.489> takes<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.850> all<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
performance version it takes it all the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.360 
performance version it takes it all the
way<00:02:27.090> down<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.300> 4.4<00:02:27.930> seconds<00:02:30.560> yeah<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.860> like

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
way down to 4.4 seconds yeah so like

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.400 
way down to 4.4 seconds yeah so like
when<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.670> go<00:02:32.940> around<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.630> corners<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.320> go

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
when you go around the corners we can go

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.199 
when you go around the corners we can go
around<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.739> turns<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.820> don't<00:02:36.030> even

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
around the turns like you don't even

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.140 
around the turns like you don't even
there's<00:02:36.750> no<00:02:37.019> body<00:02:37.260> there's<00:02:37.920> no<00:02:38.160> body<00:02:38.400> roll<00:02:38.700> so

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
there's no body there's no body roll so

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.699 
there's no body there's no body roll so
tell<00:02:39.360> me<00:02:39.390> about<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.780> activator<00:02:40.200> suspension

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
tell me about the activator suspension

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.630 
tell me about the activator suspension
well<00:02:41.130> actually

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
well actually

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.570 
well actually
of<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.840> once<00:02:44.380> we<00:02:44.560> get<00:02:44.710> through<00:02:44.920> this<00:02:45.130> section

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
of it once we get through this section

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.720 
of it once we get through this section
we're<00:02:46.210> going<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.840> go<00:02:47.680> over<00:02:47.920> some<00:02:47.950> bumpy<00:02:48.520> road

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
we're going to go over some bumpy road

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.910 
we're going to go over some bumpy road
where<00:02:49.000> you'll<00:02:49.540> really<00:02:49.840> feel<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.410> active<00:02:50.770> air

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
where you'll really feel the active air

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.380 
where you'll really feel the active air
so<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.130> act<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.459> our<00:02:51.550> suspension<00:02:51.910> can<00:02:52.240> do<00:02:52.360> a

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
so the act of our suspension can do a

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.720 
so the act of our suspension can do a
few<00:02:52.690> things<00:02:53.069> one<00:02:54.069> it<00:02:54.220> makes<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.520> car

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
few things one it makes the car

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.260 
few things one it makes the car
incredibly<00:02:55.600> smooth<00:02:55.930> over<00:02:56.290> rough<00:02:56.500> road<00:02:56.800> but

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
incredibly smooth over rough road but

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.400 
incredibly smooth over rough road but
what<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:58.360> also<00:02:58.390> does<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.260> allows<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:01.410> is

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
what it also does is allows you to is

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.310 
what it also does is allows you to is
the<00:03:02.770> car<00:03:03.010> actually<00:03:03.280> lowers<00:03:03.970> on<00:03:04.450> on<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
the car actually lowers on on the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.830 
the car actually lowers on on the
highway<00:03:05.620> at<00:03:05.770> highway<00:03:06.310> speeds<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:07.209> order<00:03:07.570> to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
highway at highway speeds in order to

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.050 
highway at highway speeds in order to
increase<00:03:08.830> its<00:03:09.070> efficiency<00:03:09.160> lower<00:03:09.820> its

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
increase its efficiency lower its

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.780 
increase its efficiency lower its
coefficient<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:10.959> drag<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.860> lowers<00:03:12.310> when<00:03:12.670> you

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
coefficient of drag it lowers when you

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.350 
coefficient of drag it lowers when you
buy<00:03:12.940> faster<00:03:13.420> yeah<00:03:13.739> how<00:03:14.739> does

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
buy faster yeah how does

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.320 
buy faster yeah how does
because<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:16.830> an<00:03:17.130> air<00:03:17.370> suspension<00:03:17.940> so

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
because the it's an air suspension so

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.390 
because the it's an air suspension so
there<00:03:18.450> was<00:03:18.540> actually<00:03:18.930> air<00:03:19.470> bladders<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
there was actually air bladders and the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.700 
there was actually air bladders and the
shocks<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.960> raise<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.410> lower<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
shocks that can raise and lower the

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.790 
shocks that can raise and lower the
vehicle

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.040 

and<00:03:28.580> I'm<00:03:28.940> going<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.120> turn<00:03:29.360> off<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.660> climate

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
and I'm going to turn off the climate

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.720 
and I'm going to turn off the climate
control<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:30.920> that<00:03:30.950> we<00:03:31.130> can<00:03:31.250> have<00:03:31.280> complete

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
control so that we can have complete

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.060 
control so that we can have complete
silence<00:03:32.510> in<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.780> car<00:03:32.960> and<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.560> can<00:03:33.740> feel<00:03:34.010> how

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
silence in the car and you can feel how

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:45.399 
silence in the car and you can feel how
quiet<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.210> car<00:03:35.450> goes<00:03:35.720> over<00:03:36.170> these<00:03:36.740> bumps

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.110 

there's<00:03:46.409> like<00:03:46.620> yeah<00:03:46.980> there's<00:03:47.250> no<00:03:47.459> vibration

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
there's like yeah there's no vibration

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.349 
there's like yeah there's no vibration
there's<00:03:48.390> no<00:03:48.599> yeah<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:50.730> that's<00:03:50.939> because<00:03:51.090> the

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
there's no yeah and that's because the

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.869 
there's no yeah and that's because the
tires<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:51.989> suspension<00:03:52.489> it's<00:03:53.489> really<00:03:53.760> the

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
tires and the suspension it's really the

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.490 
tires and the suspension it's really the
active<00:03:54.209> air<00:03:54.480> suspension<00:03:55.159> but<00:03:56.159> also<00:03:56.359> because

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
active air suspension but also because

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.490 
active air suspension but also because
the<00:03:58.500> battery<00:03:59.280> pack<00:03:59.790> is<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.540> structural<00:04:01.140> member

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
the battery pack is a structural member

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.099 
the battery pack is a structural member
of<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.709> car<00:04:01.950> so<00:04:02.370> down<00:04:02.579> low<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:03.359> creates<00:04:03.629> a<00:04:03.689> very

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
of the car so down low it creates a very

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.959 
of the car so down low it creates a very
stiff<00:04:04.469> chassis<00:04:05.810> very<00:04:06.810> low<00:04:06.959> center<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.260> gravity

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:07.969 
stiff chassis very low center of gravity

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.220 
stiff chassis very low center of gravity
why<00:04:08.969> don't<00:04:09.150> we<00:04:09.239> need<00:04:09.299> a<00:04:09.420> hammer<00:04:09.659> it<00:04:09.870> but<00:04:10.019> I<00:04:10.049> want

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
why don't we need a hammer it but I want

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.929 
why don't we need a hammer it but I want
you<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.409> smoothly<00:04:10.739> accelerate<00:04:11.069> through<00:04:11.760> these

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
you to smoothly accelerate through these

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.479 
you to smoothly accelerate through these
turns<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.629> just<00:04:13.349> feel<00:04:13.560> how<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.799> car<00:04:14.040> squat

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
turns and just feel how the car squat
