00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
their end come right in you get about

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.520 
their end come right in you get about
maybe<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.920> second<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> half<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.760> throw<00:00:57.530> in

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
maybe a second and a half to throw in
