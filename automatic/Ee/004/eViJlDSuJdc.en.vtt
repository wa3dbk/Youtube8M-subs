and she said I'm working on a new

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.119 
and she said I'm working on a new
hostile<00:00:33.030> mob<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.750> lives<00:00:34.050> underwater<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.980> is

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
hostile mob it lives underwater it is

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.460 
hostile mob it lives underwater it is
not<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> shark<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.449> is<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.900> to<00:00:37.020> be<00:00:37.050> nasty

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
not a shark and it is going to be nasty

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.950 
not a shark and it is going to be nasty
but<00:00:37.949> it<00:00:38.370> currently<00:00:38.699> doesn't<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.390> much<00:00:39.629> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
but it currently doesn't do much and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.350 
but it currently doesn't do much and
then<00:00:40.110> later<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.470> I<00:00:40.650> think<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.699> next<00:00:41.730> day<00:00:42.120> or

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
then later on I think the next day or

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.149 
then later on I think the next day or
some<00:00:42.659> other<00:00:42.750> time<00:00:43.019> or<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.470> guess<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.830> same<00:00:44.010> day

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:44.159 
some other time or I guess the same day

he went ahead and told us kind of what

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.110 
he went ahead and told us kind of what
it<00:00:46.019> does<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.470> he<00:00:47.070> says<00:00:47.339> that<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.729> mob<00:00:47.940> I'm

difficulty full diamond armor is

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.360 
difficulty full diamond armor is
recommended<00:00:57.150> as<00:00:57.269> well<00:00:58.019> as<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.290> potion<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.070> water

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
recommended as well as a potion of water

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.820 
recommended as well as a potion of water
breathing<00:00:59.760> obviously<00:01:00.420> having<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.900> helm<00:01:01.229> with

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
breathing obviously having a helm with

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.380 
breathing obviously having a helm with
respiration<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:02.729> the<00:01:02.879> respiration

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
respiration with the respiration

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.600 
respiration with the respiration
enchantment<00:01:04.080> helps<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.979> see<00:01:05.220> underwater

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
enchantment helps you to see underwater

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.200 
enchantment helps you to see underwater
too<00:01:06.409> so<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.440> guess<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.880> mob<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
too so I guess what the what the mob is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.170 
too so I guess what the what the mob is
it<00:01:09.690> some<00:01:09.900> kind<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.350> ranged<00:01:10.920> mob<00:01:11.370> that<00:01:12.030> will

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it some kind of ranged mob that will

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.999 
it some kind of ranged mob that will
live<00:01:12.420> obviously<00:01:12.990> underwater<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.799> guess

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
live obviously underwater and I guess

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.850 
live obviously underwater and I guess
that<00:01:14.189> begs<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.579> question<00:01:15.119> what<00:01:15.719> mob<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.649> that

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that begs the question what mob can that

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.580 
that begs the question what mob can that
be<00:01:17.039> and<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.369> guess<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> only<00:01:17.969> kind<00:01:18.539> of<00:01:18.689> sea

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
be and I guess the only kind of sea

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.859 
be and I guess the only kind of sea
creature<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.659> has

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
creature that I can think of that has

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.649 
creature that I can think of that has
any<00:01:22.229> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.890> ranged<00:01:23.430> attack<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.149> a<00:01:26.329> no<00:01:27.329> I<00:01:27.359> just

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
any kind of ranged attack is a no I just

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.660 
any kind of ranged attack is a no I just
went<00:01:27.810> ahead<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.140> pause<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.950> video<00:01:29.280> right

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
went ahead and pause the video right

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.039 
went ahead and pause the video right
there<00:01:29.880> hopefully<00:01:30.149> you<00:01:30.390> guys<00:01:30.479> didn't<00:01:30.810> notice

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
there hopefully you guys didn't notice

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.840 
there hopefully you guys didn't notice
because<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.320> did<00:01:31.500> some<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:32.070> nifty<00:01:32.280> editing

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
because I did some some nifty editing

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.249 
because I did some some nifty editing
but<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.149> went<00:01:33.420> ahead<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.750> did<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.049> bit

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
but I went ahead and I did a little bit

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
but I went ahead and I did a little bit
of<00:01:34.289> research<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:35.189> originally<00:01:35.549> going

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
of research and I was originally going

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.419 
of research and I was originally going
to<00:01:36.119> say<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.710> stingray<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:38.039> for<00:01:38.250> some

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
to say a stingray because for some

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.249 
to say a stingray because for some
reason<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.820> thought<00:01:39.030> they<00:01:39.240> shot<00:01:39.600> their<00:01:39.810> barbs

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
reason I thought they shot their barbs

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.349 
reason I thought they shot their barbs
but<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.890> turns<00:01:41.100> out<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.369> stingrays<00:01:41.969> actually

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
but it turns out that stingrays actually

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:43.969 
but it turns out that stingrays actually
just<00:01:42.539> use<00:01:42.659> their<00:01:42.810> tails<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.259> kill<00:01:43.530> stuff<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
just use their tails to kill stuff and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
just use their tails to kill stuff and
so<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.210> actually<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.719> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
so it's not actually going to be a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.940 
so it's not actually going to be a
stingray<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.439> that's<00:01:46.590> not<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:46.920> a

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
stingray because that's not really a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.069 
stingray because that's not really a
ranged<00:01:47.340> attack<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.909> mean<00:01:48.359> the<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.780> tail

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
ranged attack I mean the little tail

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.260 
ranged attack I mean the little tail
does<00:01:49.409> go<00:01:49.679> quite<00:01:50.039> a<00:01:50.070> ways<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.340> kill<00:01:50.670> things<00:01:51.000> but

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
does go quite a ways and kill things but

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.260 
does go quite a ways and kill things but
it's<00:01:51.659> not<00:01:51.929> necessarily<00:01:52.530> range<00:01:53.039> per<00:01:53.460> se<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.850> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
it's not necessarily range per se so I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.539 
it's not necessarily range per se so I
don't<00:01:54.780> actually<00:01:55.020> know<00:01:55.289> what<00:01:55.740> kind<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.070> animal

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
don't actually know what kind of animal

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.340 
don't actually know what kind of animal
creature<00:01:56.969> sea<00:01:57.450> creature<00:01:57.749> this<00:01:58.049> could<00:01:58.200> take

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
creature sea creature this could take

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.469 
creature sea creature this could take
after<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.979> lot<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.789> people<00:01:59.999> were<00:02:00.210> saying

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
after a lot of people were saying

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.760 
after a lot of people were saying
originally<00:02:01.109> that<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.289> was<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.649> like

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
originally that it was going to be like

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.319 
originally that it was going to be like
a<00:02:01.829> jellyfish<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.789> jellyfish<00:02:03.210> are

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
a jellyfish because jellyfish are

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.230 
a jellyfish because jellyfish are
obviously<00:02:03.630> dangerous<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.729> they<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.939> kill

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
obviously dangerous and they can kill

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.809 
obviously dangerous and they can kill
things<00:02:06.539> however<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.399> don't<00:02:08.399> see<00:02:08.550> them<00:02:08.700> being

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
things however I don't see them being

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.999 
things however I don't see them being
much<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> threat<00:02:09.270> cuz<00:02:09.600> jellyfish<00:02:10.500> obviously

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
much of a threat cuz jellyfish obviously

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.950 
much of a threat cuz jellyfish obviously
in<00:02:11.130> nature<00:02:11.520> don't<00:02:11.880> inherently<00:02:12.420> go<00:02:12.690> after

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
in nature don't inherently go after

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.090 
in nature don't inherently go after
things<00:02:13.110> they<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.440> kill<00:02:13.560> things<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.950> hit

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
things they just kill things that hit

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.590 
things they just kill things that hit
them<00:02:14.280> or<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.850> touch<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.090> little<00:02:15.390> tentacles

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
them or that touch the little tentacles

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.720 
them or that touch the little tentacles
and<00:02:15.840> also<00:02:16.560> they<00:02:16.740> don't<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.130> range<00:02:17.370> attacks

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
and also they don't have range attacks

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.040 
and also they don't have range attacks
so<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:17.910> think<00:02:18.000> jellyfish<00:02:18.540> are<00:02:18.660> pretty<00:02:18.840> fairly

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
so I think jellyfish are pretty fairly

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.200 
so I think jellyfish are pretty fairly
ruled<00:02:19.410> out<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.190> think<00:02:20.250> stingrays<00:02:20.910> might

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
ruled out and I think stingrays might

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.850 
ruled out and I think stingrays might
have<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.450> slight<00:02:21.750> possibility<00:02:21.960> if<00:02:22.620> they<00:02:22.800> see

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
have a slight possibility if they see

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.540 
have a slight possibility if they see
the<00:02:23.250> fact

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
the fact

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.510 
the fact
the<00:02:23.640> tail<00:02:23.940> kind<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.660> shoots<00:02:24.930> wife<00:02:25.230> why<00:02:26.010> ahead

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
the tail kind of shoots wife why ahead

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.970 
the tail kind of shoots wife why ahead
of<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> Stingray<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.900> kill<00:02:28.080> spray<00:02:28.500> might<00:02:28.800> be

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
of the Stingray to kill spray might be

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.470 
of the Stingray to kill spray might be
considered<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.490> range<00:02:29.700> attack<00:02:29.970> i'm<00:02:30.120> not<00:02:30.300> sure

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
considered a range attack i'm not sure

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.540 
considered a range attack i'm not sure
i'm<00:02:30.840> not<00:02:31.080> entirely<00:02:31.350> sure<00:02:31.560> what<00:02:31.860> kind<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.310> sea

i'm not entirely sure what kind of sea

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.150 
i'm not entirely sure what kind of sea
creature<00:02:32.820> has<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> ranged<00:02:33.750> attack<00:02:34.050> outside<00:02:34.560> of

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
them to start programming for a new mob

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.350 
them to start programming for a new mob
is<00:03:25.590> going<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.340> take<00:03:26.520> at<00:03:26.670> least<00:03:26.850> six<00:03:27.120> months

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
is going to take at least six months

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.740 
is going to take at least six months
after<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.709> comes<00:03:29.070> out<00:03:29.310> on<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.670> pc<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.120> III

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
after it comes out on the pc and III

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.690 
after it comes out on the pc and III
think<00:03:30.989> we<00:03:31.290> won't<00:03:31.470> see<00:03:31.590> until<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.860> year<00:03:31.950> after<00:03:32.250> we

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
think we won't see until a year after we

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.580 
think we won't see until a year after we
actually<00:03:32.940> see<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.120> on<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.300> pc<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.380> that's

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
actually see it on the pc so that that's

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.930 
actually see it on the pc so that that's
what<00:03:34.739> i<00:03:34.770> got<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.040> lot<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.280> people<00:03:35.550> are<00:03:35.640> saying<00:03:35.760> oh

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.920 
what i got a lot of people are saying oh
we're<00:03:36.150> going<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:36.330> see<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.600> couple<00:03:36.750> months

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
we're going to see it a couple months

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.990 
we're going to see it a couple months
after<00:03:37.320> now<00:03:37.709> i<00:03:37.739> don't<00:03:37.890> i<00:03:38.340> don't<00:03:38.400> know<00:03:38.580> i<00:03:38.670> don't

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
think it's probably going to be probably

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.360 
think it's probably going to be probably
about<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.140> year<00:03:43.290> maybe<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.950> year<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.340> half

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
about a year maybe a year and a half

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.340 
about a year maybe a year and a half
after<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:45.180> actually<00:03:45.420> comes<00:03:45.570> out<00:03:45.690> on<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.930> pc

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
after it actually comes out on the pc

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.890 
after it actually comes out on the pc
however<00:03:47.220> i<00:03:47.400> did<00:03:47.610> want<00:03:47.940> all<00:03:48.120> while<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.690> voice
