different<00:00:26.619> parts<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:28.240> part<00:00:28.300> is<00:00:28.900> actually

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
different parts this part is actually

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.470 
different parts this part is actually
underneath<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:30.160> skin<00:00:30.400> and<00:00:30.730> so<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:31.269> won't

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
underneath the skin and so you won't

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.590 
underneath the skin and so you won't
ever<00:00:31.659> see<00:00:31.810> it<00:00:32.140> there's<00:00:33.010> then<00:00:33.280> a<00:00:33.310> tube<00:00:33.820> which

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
ever see it there's then a tube which

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.560 
ever see it there's then a tube which
connects<00:00:35.050> that<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.250> bulb<00:00:36.489> this<00:00:37.180> bulb

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
connects that to the bulb this bulb

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.860 
connects that to the bulb this bulb
collects<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.350> fluid<00:00:38.710> that<00:00:38.980> comes<00:00:39.219> out<00:00:39.870> the

collects the fluid that comes out the
reason<00:00:41.260> we<00:00:41.350> put<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.680> drain<00:00:41.890> in<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.340> that<00:00:42.609> fluid

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
reason we put the drain in is that fluid

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.660 
reason we put the drain in is that fluid
or<00:00:43.449> sometimes<00:00:44.230> small<00:00:44.500> amounts<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:44.890> blood<00:00:44.949> may

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
or sometimes small amounts of blood may

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.880 
or sometimes small amounts of blood may
develop<00:00:46.269> in<00:00:46.629> the<00:00:47.050> areas<00:00:47.410> where<00:00:47.590> you've<00:00:47.739> had

develop in the areas where you've had
your<00:00:48.070> surgery<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.760> removing<00:00:49.480> them<00:00:49.629> is

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
your surgery and removing them is

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.509 
your surgery and removing them is
important<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.739> make<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.039> healing<00:00:51.370> go

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
important to make the healing go

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.910 
important to make the healing go
smoothly<00:00:51.850> so<00:00:52.239> there's<00:00:53.199> several<00:00:53.469> things<00:00:53.769> you

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
smoothly so there's several things you

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.639 
smoothly so there's several things you
need<00:00:54.129> to<00:00:54.250> know<00:00:54.399> about<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:54.820> drains<00:00:55.350> first<00:00:56.350> is

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
need to know about the drains first is

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.200 
need to know about the drains first is
something<00:00:56.920> called<00:00:57.070> stripping<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:58.149> drains

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
something called stripping the drains

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.880 
something called stripping the drains
I'm<00:01:01.210> going<00:01:01.449> to<00:01:01.510> have<00:01:01.600> Mandy<00:01:01.960> hold<00:01:02.170> this<00:01:02.500> this

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
I'm going to have Mandy hold this this

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.979 
I'm going to have Mandy hold this this
here<00:01:03.219> right<00:01:03.760> like<00:01:03.969> it's<00:01:04.210> going<00:01:04.479> into<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.839> body

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
here right like it's going into the body

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.740 
here right like it's going into the body
sometimes<00:01:05.979> this<00:01:06.700> tube<00:01:07.000> will<00:01:07.240> get<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.390> little

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
sometimes this tube will get a little

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.740 
sometimes this tube will get a little
clogged<00:01:08.080> up<00:01:08.350> by<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.490> small<00:01:10.330> amount<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.570> blood

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
clogged up by a small amount of blood

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.260 
clogged up by a small amount of blood
some<00:01:11.530> protein<00:01:12.040> and<00:01:12.070> fluid<00:01:12.520> or<00:01:12.700> even<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.060> little

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
some protein and fluid or even a little

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.390 
some protein and fluid or even a little
bit<00:01:13.360> of<00:01:13.450> tissue<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:14.380> way<00:01:14.619> you<00:01:14.680> get<00:01:15.220> it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
bit of tissue the way you get it

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.859 
bit of tissue the way you get it
unplugged<00:01:15.909> is<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:17.110> squeeze<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:19.119> drain<00:01:19.420> close

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
unplugged is to squeeze the drain close

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.289 
unplugged is to squeeze the drain close
to<00:01:20.110> where<00:01:20.290> it<00:01:20.409> goes<00:01:20.440> into<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.979> body<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.520> draw

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
to where it goes into the body and draw

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.510 
to where it goes into the body and draw
it<00:01:22.570> away<00:01:23.020> from<00:01:23.290> it<00:01:23.470> like<00:01:23.680> this<00:01:23.979> it<00:01:24.250> creates

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
it away from it like this it creates

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.359 
it away from it like this it creates
suction<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.390> then<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:26.560> let<00:01:26.799> go<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:27.070> this<00:01:27.310> hand

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
suction and then you let go of this hand

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.539 
suction and then you let go of this hand
and<00:01:27.909> it<00:01:28.000> helps<00:01:28.299> milk<00:01:28.860> whatever<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:30.100> in<00:01:30.399> the

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
and it helps milk whatever is in the

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.850 
and it helps milk whatever is in the
tube<00:01:30.820> into<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.960> drain<00:01:32.229> that's<00:01:32.590> known<00:01:32.830> as

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
tube into the drain that's known as

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.680 
tube into the drain that's known as
stripping<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.520> drains<00:01:33.789> you're<00:01:34.420> probably

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
stripping the drains you're probably

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.570 
stripping the drains you're probably
going<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.020> want<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.259> do<00:01:35.440> it<00:01:35.619> every<00:01:36.159> time<00:01:36.369> you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
going to want to do it every time you

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.279 
going to want to do it every time you
empty<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.090> drains<00:01:37.360> it'll<00:01:37.810> just<00:01:38.050> make<00:01:38.229> them

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
empty the drains it'll just make them

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.859 
empty the drains it'll just make them
much<00:01:38.679> more<00:01:38.890> easy<00:01:39.280> to<00:01:39.580> deal<00:01:39.789> with<00:01:39.819> if<00:01:40.479> for<00:01:40.840> some

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
much more easy to deal with if for some

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.540 
much more easy to deal with if for some
reason<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.530> drain<00:01:41.740> gets<00:01:41.920> clogged

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
reason the drain gets clogged

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.700 
reason the drain gets clogged
sometimes<00:01:43.420> fluid<00:01:43.869> will<00:01:44.020> come<00:01:44.050> out<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.619> the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
sometimes fluid will come out of the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.130 
sometimes fluid will come out of the
skin<00:01:44.979> around<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.640> drain<00:01:45.880> it's<00:01:46.479> messy<00:01:46.929> but

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
skin around the drain it's messy but

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.779 
skin around the drain it's messy but
it's<00:01:47.470> not<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.860> end<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.280> world<00:01:48.490> because

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
it's not the end of the world because

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.580 
it's not the end of the world because
the<00:01:49.119> drain<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.539> there<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.990> get<00:01:50.110> rid<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.470> the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
the drain is there to get rid of the

the drain is there to get rid of the
