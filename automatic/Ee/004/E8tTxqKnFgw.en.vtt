00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.270
 Welcome to this learning object 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.490
 my name is víctor yepes and I am a teacher 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.780
 of the engineering department of the 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.510
 construction of the university 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.570
 polytechnic of valència that is the 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.730
 perforation has broken percussion 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.580
 the objectives of this presentation will be 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.250
 first understand the foundation 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.380
 of percussive broken perforation in 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.970
 second place distinguish the types of 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.759
 percussion tartar 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.120
 existing and finally know the 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.250
 advantages of this type of drills 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.000
 for this we have divided the content into 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.089
 four parts introduction the beginning 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.309
 drilling has broken percussion the 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.879
 types of drills has broken percussion 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.420
 and the advantages of broken perforation 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.420
 percussive 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.589
 the perforation has broken percussion appears 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.460
 with the industrial development of the century 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:04.610
 19 perhaps together with the invention of the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.000
 dynamite is the milestone that marks the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.960
 rocks start its use is 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.340
 extended in underground works mines 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.340
 open- pit exploitations and other 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.610
 what is the principle of drilling has 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.190
 broken percussion 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.280
 it's about the impact of a piece of 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.860
 steel that we will call piston on a 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.440
 useful that transmits the energy to the background 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.750
 of the hole by means of an element 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.750
 final mouth 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.710
 this system is especially suitable 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.640
 in hard rocks and with a small diameter 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.640
 drilling 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.190
 the basic actions are in the first place 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.250
 the percussion the impacts produced by 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.190
 the piston stroke originate waves of 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.680
 shock that are transmitted to the mouth to 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.130
 through the linkage 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.260
 secondly the rotation is made 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.110
 turn your mouth to change the area of 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.740
 impact 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.520
 in third place the push to keep 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:17.360
 in contact the rock with the mouth and by 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.730
 last the sweep where the flow allows 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.130
 extract the detritus from the bottom of the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.980
 basin 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.980
 here we can see an expression that we 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.940
 allows to estimate the power of a 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.650
 hammer which is function of the pressure 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.450
 of the fluid that can be oil or air 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.840
 also from the work surface of the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.790
 piston and that depends on the race of 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.689
 piston and piston mass 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.549
 It is also possible to estimate the speed 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.430
 of penetration for a given diameter 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.430
 when using the same equipment in 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.409
 similar conditions is known the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.920
 speed that is reached for another 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.920
 diameter 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.660
 What types of drills do we have? 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.640
 broken percussion 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.950
 depending on where you are 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.040
 installed the hammer we can distinguish 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.940
 hammer drills in the head and 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.260
 hammer drills in the background 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.540
 the hammer drills in the head 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.770
 They have a pneumatic drive or 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.890
 Hydraulic rotation and percussion are 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.800
 they find out of the hole and they 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.030
 transmits by spike and rod g up 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.030
 the mouth of drilling 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.650
 the hammer drills in the background 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.470
 present a pneumatic drive of 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.990
 piston 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.080
 the rotation action can be 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.870
 hydraulic or pneumatic 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.130
 the percussion is direct over the mouth of 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.600
 drilling and rotation is done in 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.600
 the outside of the hole 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.700
 in these pictures we can see several 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.639
 things in principle we can see how 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.650
 according to the type of drilling machine 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.769
 we can choose a diameter of 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.650
 piercing or other also depending 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.800
 if we work in the open or on construction sites 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.529
 underground we can see how in general 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.750
 the hammer in the background presents some 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:37.230
 Larger drilling diameters 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.660
 in the box below and see 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.850
 function of the method either hammer in 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.430
 hydraulic pneumatic head or hammer 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:49.360
 in depth and according to the bench height 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:53.840
 we see the deviation that can present 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.180
 the perforation so the maximum we see 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.900
 It is a deviation of four centimeters 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.060
 per meter drilled in hammers in 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.470
 hydraulic head with bench heights 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.470
 greater than ten meters 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.320
 we can also distinguish the types of 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.590
 drills has broken percussion in 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.560
 hammers, manual or in equipment 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.100
 heavy drilling 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.650
 in manual hammers the rotation is 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.440
 transmits through the rotation bushing 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.320
 of the hammer and is operated by the own 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.900
 piston mechanism depending on the 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.150
 impacts 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.960
 The smaller number of impacts must 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.669
 correspond a lower torque of rotation in 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.600
 change in drilling equipment 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.180
 heavy 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.050
 the rat rotation is triggered through 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:48.380
 of an independent engine this allows 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.720
 act well on the rotation or on the 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:54.220
 percussion depending on the 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.220
 ground conditioners 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.960
 what main advantages does the 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.319
 percussive broken perforation 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.289
 It is applicable to all types of rocks 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:09.930
 soft or hard presents a wide 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:12.210
 diameters availability 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.180
 There is great versatility in 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:19.210
 equipment and great mobility 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:22.270
 is handled with a single operator 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:25.300
 presents speed and accessibility in the 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:29.699
 maintenance of equipment and price 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.699
 of acquisition is not very high 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.160
 as conclusions we can say in 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.280
 first place that the drills have 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.960
 broken percussion are based on the impact 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:46.460
 of the piston over the mouth 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:48.060
 there are two hammer types in the head and 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.540
 in deep 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.910
 there is a wide applicability to 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:58.350
 any kind of rocks especially in 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:01.260
 hard rocks and small diameters also 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:04.830
 the equipments are versatile of great 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:08.330
 mobility and easy to maintain 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.330
 thank you very much for your attention
