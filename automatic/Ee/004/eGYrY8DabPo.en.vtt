00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.860 
for this wonder if they kind of
anticipated<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.620> alright<00:02:40.579> it<00:02:41.450> says<00:02:41.600> on<00:02:41.750> here

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
anticipated this alright it says on here

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.509 
anticipated this alright it says on here
that<00:02:42.049> all<00:02:42.140> these<00:02:42.290> are<00:02:42.500> polarized<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:43.400> they

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
that all these are polarized so they

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.520 
that all these are polarized so they
cannot<00:02:43.760> be<00:02:43.910> connected<00:02:44.150> backwards<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.500> you

cannot be connected backwards so you

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.960 
cannot be connected backwards so you
