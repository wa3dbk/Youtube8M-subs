upon<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.399> side<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.910> article<00:00:42.329> where<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
upon that side of that article where it

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.590 
upon that side of that article where it
said<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.129> India<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.850> women<00:00:45.329> actually

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
said that in India the women actually

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.080 
said that in India the women actually
used<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.170> mask<00:00:46.410> all<00:00:46.739> over<00:00:47.010> their<00:00:47.160> body<00:00:47.370> just

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
used this mask all over their body just

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
used this mask all over their body just
before<00:00:48.390> they<00:00:48.480> got<00:00:48.660> married<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.800> used

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
before they got married that they used

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.549 
before they got married that they used
gram<00:00:50.670> flour<00:00:50.969> which<00:00:51.570> isn't<00:00:51.780> an<00:00:51.930> ingredient<00:00:52.440> in

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
gram flour which isn't an ingredient in

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.189 
gram flour which isn't an ingredient in
that<00:00:52.800> mask<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.550> their<00:00:53.760> babies<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> get<00:00:54.870> fair

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
that mask for their babies to get fair

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.650 
that mask for their babies to get fair
skin<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.800> they<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.430> bath<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.059> baby<00:00:57.300> is

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
skin like they they bath the baby is

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.590 
skin like they they bath the baby is
that<00:00:57.840> gram<00:00:58.230> flour<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.399> I'm<00:00:59.760> guessing<00:01:00.359> this

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that gram flour so I'm guessing this

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
that gram flour so I'm guessing this
mask<00:01:00.989> could<00:01:01.350> not<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.859> harmful<00:01:02.250> at<00:01:02.399> all<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.879> you

I<00:02:40.170> think<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.350> mask<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.830> so<00:02:42.040> fun<00:02:42.340> with<00:02:42.520> that

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
I think that mask is so fun with that

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.020 
I think that mask is so fun with that
bright<00:02:43.600> yellow<00:02:44.170> color<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:46.410> always<00:02:47.410> go<00:02:48.030> right

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
bright yellow color I always go right

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.130 
bright yellow color I always go right
under<00:02:49.390> my<00:02:49.540> eyes

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
under my eyes

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.760 
under my eyes
this<00:02:50.890> helps<00:02:51.310> with<00:02:51.910> dark<00:02:52.900> under-eye<00:02:53.380> circles

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
this helps with dark under-eye circles

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.400 
this helps with dark under-eye circles
