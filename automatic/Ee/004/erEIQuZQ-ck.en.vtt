making<00:00:56.940> enough<00:00:57.180> money<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.800> that's

making enough money and and that's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.099 
making enough money and and that's
exactly<00:00:59.760> what's<00:01:00.090> been<00:01:00.210> happening<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.809> hero

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
factory just its budget hasn't been

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.750 
factory just its budget hasn't been
going<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.600> they<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.979> only<00:01:05.100> make<00:01:05.339> 22

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760

to buy and watch TV shows with because

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.090

on TV I guess and that that's a bummer

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.460 
on TV I guess and that that's a bummer
but<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:24.570> least<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.810> still<00:01:24.840> got<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.409> it

anyways<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:33.329> rumor<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.840> Bionicle

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
anyways if the rumor is that Bionicle

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.670 
anyways if the rumor is that Bionicle
might<00:01:34.920> return<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.689> kind<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
might return and that is kind of a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.870 
might return and that is kind of a
really<00:01:38.130> weird<00:01:38.430> rumor<00:01:38.880> because<00:01:39.240> even<00:01:40.020> though

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
really weird rumor because even though

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.389 
really weird rumor because even though
Bionicle<00:01:41.880> could<00:01:42.390> return<00:01:43.009> what<00:01:44.009> would<00:01:44.159> they<00:01:44.340> do

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
Bionicle could return what would they do

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.990 
Bionicle could return what would they do
with<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
with it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.510 
with it
I<00:01:45.180> mean<00:01:45.840> they<00:01:46.200> could<00:01:46.439> make<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.369> in

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
I mean they could make it like in

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.850 
I mean they could make it like in
another<00:01:47.670> end<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> universe<00:01:48.390> or<00:01:48.899> something

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
another end of the universe or something

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.090 
another end of the universe or something
where<00:01:50.070> there's<00:01:50.250> different<00:01:50.460> TOA<00:01:50.930> but<00:01:51.930> I'm<00:01:52.890> just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
where there's different TOA but I'm just

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.590 
where there's different TOA but I'm just
gonna<00:01:53.369> go<00:01:53.490> ahead<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.850> say<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.149> they<00:01:54.390> have

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
gonna go ahead and say this they have

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.230 
gonna go ahead and say this they have
used<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.350> ton<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.710> names<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:57.000> would<00:01:57.119> be

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
used up a ton of names and it would be

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.060 
used up a ton of names and it would be
really<00:01:57.600> hard<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.020> create<00:01:58.229> more<00:01:58.439> names<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.799> mean

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
really hard to create more names I mean

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.139 
really hard to create more names I mean
I<00:01:59.219> I<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.619> think<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.130> takes<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.579> lot<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:03.090> of

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
I I I really think it takes a lot out of

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.510 
I I I really think it takes a lot out of
them<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> names<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.070> mean

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
them just to get the names like I mean

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.100 
them just to get the names like I mean
it<00:02:05.640> probably<00:02:06.149> took<00:02:06.270> him<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.509> long<00:02:06.630> time<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
it probably took him a long time just to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.479 
it probably took him a long time just to
create<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> names<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.920> different<00:02:08.009> Coen

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
create the names for the different Coen

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.029 
create the names for the different Coen
Bionicle<00:02:08.970> universe<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:10.590> they<00:02:10.709> were<00:02:10.770> to

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
Bionicle universe and if they were to

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.130 
Bionicle universe and if they were to
reboot<00:02:11.370> Bionicle

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
reboot Bionicle

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.130 
reboot Bionicle
then<00:02:12.650> like<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:13.760> said<00:02:14.030> what<00:02:14.240> would<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.480> story<00:02:14.810> be

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
then like I said what would the story be

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.490 
then like I said what would the story be
and<00:02:16.150> would<00:02:17.150> they<00:02:17.300> use<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.810> new<00:02:17.990> building

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
and would they use the new building

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.350 
and would they use the new building
system<00:02:18.950> will<00:02:19.160> not<00:02:19.310> really<00:02:19.580> new<00:02:19.730> anymore<00:02:20.150> but

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
system will not really new anymore but

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.970 
system will not really new anymore but
would<00:02:20.900> they<00:02:20.990> use<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.230> building<00:02:21.500> system<00:02:21.830> that

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
would they use the building system that

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.040 
would they use the building system that
they<00:02:22.040> use<00:02:22.069> for<00:02:22.340> Hero<00:02:22.550> Factory<00:02:23.000> or<00:02:23.150> would<00:02:23.930> they

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
they use for Hero Factory or would they

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.050 
they use for Hero Factory or would they
use<00:02:24.080> something<00:02:24.500> different<00:02:24.920> or<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.550> hope<00:02:25.940> to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
use something different or I hope to

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.360 
use something different or I hope to
gosh<00:02:26.209> not<00:02:26.450> but<00:02:26.800> they<00:02:27.800> go<00:02:27.950> back<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.250> the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
gosh not but they go back to the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.600 
gosh not but they go back to the
Bionicle<00:02:28.850> building<00:02:29.150> system<00:02:29.510> because

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
Bionicle building system because

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.920 
Bionicle building system because
Bionicle<00:02:31.610> building<00:02:31.880> system<00:02:32.270> really<00:02:32.450> didn't

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
Bionicle building system really didn't

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.660 
Bionicle building system really didn't
have<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.140> much<00:02:33.320> articulation<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.280> be<00:02:34.400> honest

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
have that much articulation to be honest

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
have that much articulation to be honest
and<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.870> new<00:02:35.990> hero<00:02:36.230> factory<00:02:36.560> system<00:02:36.740> does<00:02:37.130> and

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
and the new hero factory system does and

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.910 
and the new hero factory system does and
if<00:02:38.690> they<00:02:38.810> were<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.989> create<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.290> new<00:02:39.470> one<00:02:39.650> I

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
if they were to create a new one I

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.240 
if they were to create a new one I
hopefully<00:02:40.580> would<00:02:41.150> be<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.480> same<00:02:41.660> kind<00:02:41.840> of

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
hopefully would be the same kind of

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.750 
hopefully would be the same kind of
concept<00:02:43.250> as<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.730> hero<00:02:44.030> factories<00:02:44.540> and

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
concept as the hero factories and

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.220 
concept as the hero factories and
another<00:02:46.760> rumor<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.570> that<00:02:47.690> it'll<00:02:47.930> be<00:02:48.050> just

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
another rumor is is that it'll be just

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.020 
another rumor is is that it'll be just
something<00:02:48.590> brand<00:02:48.830> new<00:02:49.010> which<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.489> actually<00:02:50.000> a

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
something brand new which is actually a

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.490 
something brand new which is actually a
better<00:02:50.269> idea<00:02:50.450> than<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.840> think<00:02:50.900> bringing<00:02:51.380> back

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
better idea than I think bringing back

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.509 
better idea than I think bringing back
Bionicle<00:02:52.130> would<00:02:52.850> be<00:02:53.739> because<00:02:54.739> they<00:02:55.310> could

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
Bionicle would be because they could

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.520 
Bionicle would be because they could
create<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.060> new<00:02:56.120> world<00:02:56.480> just<00:02:56.840> like<00:02:56.959> fans<00:02:57.290> like

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
create a new world just like fans like

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.440 
create a new world just like fans like
Chima<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.580> even<00:02:59.000> though<00:02:59.060> they<00:02:59.180> wanted

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
Chima and even though they wanted

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.540 
Chima and even though they wanted
Ninjago<00:02:59.989> back<00:03:00.170> they<00:03:00.380> got<00:03:00.530> Chima<00:03:01.010> for<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> year

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
Ninjago back they got Chima for a year

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.020 
Ninjago back they got Chima for a year
and<00:03:01.730> then<00:03:02.510> jaw<00:03:02.720> goes<00:03:02.930> back<00:03:03.170> now<00:03:03.410> but<00:03:03.800> still<00:03:04.730> she

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
and then jaw goes back now but still she

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.509 
and then jaw goes back now but still she
must<00:03:05.209> still<00:03:05.420> go<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.230> believe<00:03:07.100> that<00:03:07.250> she

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
must still go and so I believe that she

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.040 
must still go and so I believe that she
was<00:03:07.670> doing<00:03:07.910> good<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.300> I<00:03:08.360> believe<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:08.810> Lego

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
was doing good and I believe that Lego

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.770 
was doing good and I believe that Lego
will<00:03:09.350> create<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.650> new<00:03:09.830> series<00:03:10.190> in<00:03:10.220> 2015<00:03:10.940> but<00:03:11.420> in

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
will create a new series in 2015 but in

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.890 
will create a new series in 2015 but in
my<00:03:12.769> opinion<00:03:13.340> what<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.150> would<00:03:14.330> really<00:03:14.570> like<00:03:14.870> to

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
my opinion what I would really like to

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.370 
my opinion what I would really like to
see<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:16.180> Bionicle<00:03:17.180> versus<00:03:17.510> hero<00:03:17.720> factory<00:03:17.959> I

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
see is Bionicle versus hero factory I

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.410 
see is Bionicle versus hero factory I
mean<00:03:19.040> I've<00:03:19.130> always<00:03:19.310> wanted<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.700> see<00:03:19.910> Lego<00:03:20.209> do

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
mean I've always wanted to see Lego do

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.960 
mean I've always wanted to see Lego do
probably<00:03:20.840> like<00:03:20.989> just<00:03:21.200> one<00:03:21.920> line<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.489> it<00:03:22.850> I

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
probably like just one line of it I

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.930 
probably like just one line of it I
don't<00:03:23.180> know<00:03:23.299> if<00:03:23.630> they<00:03:24.470> will<00:03:24.680> but<00:03:25.070> it's<00:03:25.310> very

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
don't know if they will but it's very

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.020 
don't know if they will but it's very
it's<00:03:26.390> highly<00:03:26.900> unlikely<00:03:27.290> but<00:03:27.650> if<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.850> does

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
it's highly unlikely but if it does

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.690 
it's highly unlikely but if it does
happen<00:03:29.269> that'd<00:03:29.600> be<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:29.900> amazing<00:03:30.380> cuz<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:31.100> just

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
happen that'd be like amazing cuz I just

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.050 
happen that'd be like amazing cuz I just
really<00:03:32.090> want<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.269> see<00:03:33.010> Tahu<00:03:34.010> go<00:03:34.610> up<00:03:34.790> against

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
really want to see Tahu go up against

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.620 
really want to see Tahu go up against
Ferno<00:03:35.709> kopaka<00:03:36.709> go<00:03:37.040> up<00:03:37.160> against<00:03:37.430> stormer<00:03:38.090> you

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
Ferno kopaka go up against stormer you

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.190 
Ferno kopaka go up against stormer you
know<00:03:38.769> all<00:03:39.769> those<00:03:40.070> characters<00:03:40.579> I<00:03:41.019> just<00:03:42.019> feel

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
know all those characters I just feel

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.720 
know all those characters I just feel
like<00:03:42.320> that'd<00:03:42.530> be<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.709> really<00:03:43.070> really<00:03:43.190> good<00:03:43.340> idea

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
like that'd be a really really good idea

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.030 
like that'd be a really really good idea
but<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.239> don't<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:45.049> feel<00:03:45.410> like<00:03:45.560> that's<00:03:45.769> highly

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
but I don't I feel like that's highly

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.979 
but I don't I feel like that's highly
unlikely<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:46.940> I'm<00:03:47.000> gonna<00:03:47.120> send<00:03:47.570> a<00:03:47.750> letter<00:03:47.870> to

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
unlikely so I'm gonna send a letter to

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.840 
unlikely so I'm gonna send a letter to
Lego<00:03:48.410> asking<00:03:48.920> how<00:03:49.040> hero<00:03:49.310> factory's<00:03:49.700> been

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
Lego asking how hero factory's been

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.729 
Lego asking how hero factory's been
doing<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.269> if<00:03:50.540> they<00:03:51.019> think<00:03:51.079> it's<00:03:51.380> going<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:51.620> be

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
doing and if they think it's going to be

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.620 
doing and if they think it's going to be
canceled<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.340> they<00:03:52.430> probably<00:03:52.610> won't<00:03:52.790> respond

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
canceled and they probably won't respond
