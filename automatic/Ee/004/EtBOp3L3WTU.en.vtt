00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.380 
kind of success when you got together
back<00:00:42.840> at<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.079> beginning<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.410> fall<00:00:43.620> camp<00:00:44.390> well

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
back at the beginning of fall camp well

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.920 
back at the beginning of fall camp well
it's<00:00:45.600> been<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.760> offensive<00:00:47.760> line<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.660> tight

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it's been the offensive line but tight

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.660 
it's been the offensive line but tight
in<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.469> our<00:00:49.739> backs<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.250> been<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.550> each

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
in and our backs have been with each

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.880 
in and our backs have been with each
other<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.390> long<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.440> bench<00:00:52.620> starting

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
other for so long and the bench starting

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.100 
other for so long and the bench starting
from<00:00:53.370> their<00:00:53.550> sophomore<00:00:53.789> years<00:00:54.210> till<00:00:54.629> now<00:00:54.780> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
from their sophomore years till now and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.889 
from their sophomore years till now and
so<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.530> helps<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.129> always<00:00:56.280> helps<00:00:56.489> them

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
so that helps that always helps them

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.180 
so that helps that always helps them
because<00:00:57.899> they've<00:00:58.079> known<00:00:58.500> each<00:00:58.530> other<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
because they've known each other and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.099 
because they've known each other and
been<00:00:59.670> playing<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.120> each<00:01:00.270> other<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:01.020> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
been playing with each other for that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.110 
been playing with each other for that
long<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.530> think<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:02.039> been<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.340> key<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.940> our

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
long I think that's been the key to our

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.320 
long I think that's been the key to our
success<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.750> our<00:01:03.809> running<00:01:04.140> game<00:01:05.060> 11<00:01:06.060> years<00:01:06.270> ago

may be difficult but but it's also

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.270 
may be difficult but but it's also

do you feel like you're at a hundred

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.590 
do you feel like you're at a hundred
percent<00:04:48.690> in<00:04:48.990> that<00:04:49.140> regard<00:04:49.550> um<00:04:50.550> well<00:04:51.300> we<00:04:51.450> have

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
percent in that regard um well we have

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.420 
percent in that regard um well we have
proved<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:52.020> little<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.380> think<00:04:52.410> on<00:04:52.800> our<00:04:52.920> extra

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
proved a little I think on our extra

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.450 
proved a little I think on our extra
point<00:04:53.730> and<00:04:54.110> hit<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.140> few<00:04:55.410> few<00:04:55.650> goals<00:04:55.890> I<00:04:56.160> think

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
point and hit a few few goals I think

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.620 
point and hit a few few goals I think
but<00:04:57.590> it's<00:04:58.590> hard<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.890> say<00:04:59.100> we<00:04:59.310> we<00:05:00.270> don't<00:05:00.480> do

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
but it's hard to say we we don't do

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.750 
but it's hard to say we we don't do
terribly<00:05:01.380> bad<00:05:01.650> in<00:05:01.860> special<00:05:02.250> teams<00:05:02.520> but

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
terribly bad in special teams but

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.270 
terribly bad in special teams but
there's<00:05:02.970> always<00:05:03.090> room<00:05:03.210> for<00:05:03.690> improvement<00:05:04.280> we

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
there's always room for improvement we

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.540 
there's always room for improvement we
stretched<00:05:05.610> it<00:05:05.790> during<00:05:06.060> practice<00:05:06.979> and<00:05:07.979> we

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
stretched it during practice and we

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.870 
stretched it during practice and we
emphasize<00:05:09.030> it<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.300> lot<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:10.410> so<00:05:11.370> we<00:05:11.490> just<00:05:11.700> hope

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
emphasize it a lot and so we just hope

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.560 
emphasize it a lot and so we just hope
that<00:05:12.650> we<00:05:13.650> play<00:05:13.919> well<00:05:14.250> in<00:05:14.310> all<00:05:14.850> phases<00:05:15.210> of<00:05:15.419> the

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
that we play well in all phases of the

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.350

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
game when the time is right and that's

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.719 
game when the time is right and that's
in<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.570> playoffs<00:05:19.100> well<00:05:20.100> cailou<00:05:20.460> is<00:05:20.580> the
