00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.369 
the fletching but i'll do a quick talk
through<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:38.160> process<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.760> how<00:00:38.910> i<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.379> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
through the process of how i do this the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.260 
through the process of how i do this the
first<00:00:40.620> thing<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.010> after<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.940> get<00:00:42.180> your

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
first thing you do after you get your

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
first thing you do after you get your
dowel<00:00:42.510> shaft<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.620> make<00:00:44.100> sure<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.399> straight

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
dowel shaft and make sure it's straight

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.860 
dowel shaft and make sure it's straight
and<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.030> way<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.690> take

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and the way I do that is I just take

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.209 
and the way I do that is I just take
them<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> store<00:00:46.590> throw<00:00:46.980> them<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
them at the store throw them on the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.740 
them at the store throw them on the
concrete<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.850> roll<00:00:48.030> them<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.480> roll

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
concrete and roll them if they roll

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.979 
concrete and roll them if they roll
smooth<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:50.340> straight<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.969> check<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.390> double

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
smooth it's straight you check it double

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.689 
smooth it's straight you check it double
check<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.320> make<00:00:52.469> sure<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.800> straight<00:00:52.949> all

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
check it make sure it's straight all

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.110 
check it make sure it's straight all
right<00:00:53.820> good<00:00:54.559> I'm<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> cut<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:56.129> knock<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
right good I'm going to cut my knock and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.680 
right good I'm going to cut my knock and
I<00:00:57.570> cut<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:57.989> knocks<00:00:58.260> half-inch<00:00:59.039> deep<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.690> then

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
I cut my knocks half-inch deep and then

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.810 
I cut my knocks half-inch deep and then
I<00:01:00.750> sand<00:01:01.140> them<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.500> until<00:01:02.100> they're<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.340> wide

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I sand them out until they're just wide

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.369 
I sand them out until they're just wide
enough<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.210> where<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> little<00:01:04.229> bit

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
enough to where they have a little bit

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.950 
enough to where they have a little bit
of<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.559> grip<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> string<00:01:05.659> you<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.869> hear

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
of a grip on the string you kind of hear

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.100 
of a grip on the string you kind of hear
a<00:01:07.020> pop<00:01:07.290> when<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.650> push<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.950> onto<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> string

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
a pop when you push it onto the string

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.230 
a pop when you push it onto the string
once<00:01:10.110> i<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.560> smoothed<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.880> kind<00:01:12.150> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
once i get that smoothed out I kind of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
once i get that smoothed out I kind of
taper<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.659> down<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:13.080> bit<00:01:13.290> round<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> all

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
taper it down a little bit round it all

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.520 
taper it down a little bit round it all
off<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.640> doesn't<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:15.030> any<00:01:15.409> rough<00:01:16.409> spots

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
off so it doesn't have any rough spots

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.070 
off so it doesn't have any rough spots
on<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> fray<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> string<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.930> I

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
on it to fray the string and then I

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.440 
on it to fray the string and then I
measure<00:01:19.380> three<00:01:20.220> quarters<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.640> an<00:01:20.759> inch<00:01:20.909> from

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
measure three quarters of an inch from

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.010 
measure three quarters of an inch from
the<00:01:21.540> back<00:01:21.930> side<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:23.130> end<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.520> not<00:01:24.020> so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the back side the end of that not so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.450 
the back side the end of that not so
where<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> flexing<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> be<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
where the flexing is going to be and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.890 
where the flexing is going to be and
then<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.670> take<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.299> I'll<00:01:27.390> mark<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.750> line

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
then I take that and I'll mark a line

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.810 
then I take that and I'll mark a line
all<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.200> way<00:01:28.320> around<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.520> gives<00:01:29.700> me

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
all the way around there that gives me

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.340 
all the way around there that gives me
space<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.630> fingers<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.350> go<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.400> between

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
space for my fingers to go in between

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.770 
space for my fingers to go in between
the<00:01:34.350> bowstring<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.729> fletching<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the bowstring and the fletching the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.179 
the bowstring and the fletching the
first<00:01:36.990> time<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> did<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.560> made<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.950> short

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
first time I did it I made up to short

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.490 
first time I did it I made up to short
it<00:01:38.310> didn't<00:01:38.460> work<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:40.110> problem<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.470> have

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
it didn't work so the problem I have

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
it didn't work so the problem I have
with<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.770> arrow<00:01:41.100> right<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.759> this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
with this arrow right here is this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.149 
with this arrow right here is this
fletching<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.810> too<00:01:43.259> short<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.710> measured<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
fletching is too short I measured it

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.179 
fletching is too short I measured it
incorrectly<00:01:44.640> when<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.880> cut<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:49.189> yeah

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
incorrectly when I cut it and it is yeah

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.920 
incorrectly when I cut it and it is yeah
it's<00:01:50.520> about<00:01:50.820> an<00:01:51.060> eighth<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.329> an<00:01:51.450> inch<00:01:51.509> shorter

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it's about an eighth of an inch shorter

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.109 
it's about an eighth of an inch shorter
than<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.140> rest<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.500> them<00:01:52.560> which<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.579> not<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
than the rest of them which is not a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.670 
than the rest of them which is not a
huge<00:01:54.479> deal<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.960> don't<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.560> I'm

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
huge deal but I don't like it so I'm

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.590 
huge deal but I don't like it so I'm
going<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.100> work<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.549> fortunately<00:01:57.479> this

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
going to work with it fortunately this

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.530 
going to work with it fortunately this
is<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> last<00:01:57.990> one<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> put<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.189> top

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
is the last one I put on so it's on top

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.709 
is the last one I put on so it's on top
so<00:02:00.540> all<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.899> really<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:02.659> work<00:02:03.659> that

tape loose on the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:13.750 
tape loose on the
in<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:10.310> then<00:02:10.550> just<00:02:11.110> strip<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.200> off<00:02:12.580> toss<00:02:13.580> it

in and then just strip it off toss it
off<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.000> side<00:02:14.060> also<00:02:14.570> anyway<00:02:14.960> later<00:02:15.700> now

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.730 
off to the side also anyway later now
when<00:02:17.690> you're<00:02:17.810> making<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.320> arrow<00:02:18.530> from

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
when you're making this arrow from

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.300 
when you're making this arrow from
scratch<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:20.290> always<00:02:21.290> put<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.830> feather<00:02:22.100> on

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
scratch I always put the feather on

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.440 
scratch I always put the feather on
first<00:02:22.610> because<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.790> easiest<00:02:26.120> one<00:02:26.420> to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
first because it is the easiest one to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.410 
first because it is the easiest one to
line<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.320> rest<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.680> them<00:02:27.800> off<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.520> what

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
line the rest of them off of and what

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.390 
line the rest of them off of and what
I'll<00:02:29.540> do<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:29.900> I'll<00:02:30.020> just<00:02:30.260> take<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.620> knock<00:02:30.950> and

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
I'll do is I'll just take that knock and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.380 
I'll do is I'll just take that knock and
I'll<00:02:32.120> line<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.720> tape<00:02:33.880> I'll<00:02:34.880> line<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.240> edge

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
I'll line this tape I'll line the edge

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.090 
I'll line this tape I'll line the edge
of<00:02:35.600> these<00:02:35.750> pieces<00:02:36.020> of<00:02:36.290> tape<00:02:36.470> up<00:02:36.710> with<00:02:36.950> that

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
of these pieces of tape up with that

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.170 
of these pieces of tape up with that
knock<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:37.870> each<00:02:38.870> side<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.380> shaft<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.180> then

together<00:02:44.960> and<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.410> makes<00:02:45.620> one<00:02:45.980> arrow<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.550> i'll

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
together and it makes one arrow and i'll

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.920 
together and it makes one arrow and i'll
show<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:46.880> how<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.180> do<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.450> when<00:02:47.630> i<00:02:47.660> get<00:02:47.840> to

up<00:05:57.220> it<00:05:57.820> gives<00:05:57.940> me<00:05:58.120> a<00:05:58.180> 45-degree<00:05:58.870> cut<00:05:59.140> on<00:05:59.290> the

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
up it gives me a 45-degree cut on the

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.950 
up it gives me a 45-degree cut on the
back<00:05:59.590> and<00:05:59.950> it<00:06:00.880> gives<00:06:01.090> me<00:06:01.210> a<00:06:01.240> free<00:06:01.510> quarter<00:06:01.780> inch

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
back and it gives me a free quarter inch

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.420 
back and it gives me a free quarter inch
high<00:06:02.230> fletching<00:06:03.780> I've<00:06:04.780> done<00:06:05.140> them<00:06:05.290> 1<00:06:06.250> inch

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
high fletching I've done them 1 inch

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.590 
high fletching I've done them 1 inch
tall<00:06:07.950> before<00:06:08.950> but<00:06:09.580> I<00:06:09.820> haven't<00:06:10.120> really<00:06:10.330> found

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
tall before but I haven't really found

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.650 
tall before but I haven't really found
that<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:10.900> helps<00:06:11.110> my<00:06:11.230> accuracy<00:06:11.620> any<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.660> your

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
that it helps my accuracy any and your

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.060 
that it helps my accuracy any and your
smaller<00:06:13.960> fletchings<00:06:14.530> are<00:06:14.650> going<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:14.830> fly

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
smaller fletchings are going to fly

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.090 
smaller fletchings are going to fly
faster<00:06:16.170> so<00:06:17.170> it's<00:06:17.620> just<00:06:17.770> a<00:06:17.920> personal

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
faster so it's just a personal

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.700 
faster so it's just a personal
preference<00:06:18.550> i<00:06:18.820> like<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.680> like<00:06:20.680> the

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
preference i like the like the

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.900 
preference i like the like the
three-quarter<00:06:21.280> inches<00:06:21.550> they've<00:06:21.760> been

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
three-quarter inches they've been

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.720 
three-quarter inches they've been
working<00:06:22.060> out<00:06:22.360> pretty<00:06:22.510> well<00:06:22.630> for<00:06:22.780> me<00:06:23.110> so<00:06:23.140> far<00:06:23.730> so

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
working out pretty well for me so far so

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.420 
working out pretty well for me so far so
having<00:06:25.690> made<00:06:25.990> that<00:06:26.170> mark<00:06:26.440> three<00:06:26.980> quarters<00:06:27.310> up

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
having made that mark three quarters up

00:06:27.430 --> 00:07:04.580 
having made that mark three quarters up
three<00:06:27.670> quarters<00:06:27.970> over<00:06:28.830> just<00:06:29.830> take<00:06:30.480> scissors

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.260

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
smooth all that down to make sure the

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.890 
smooth all that down to make sure the

make sure all my fletchings are aligned
the<00:07:11.640> way<00:07:11.760> I<00:07:11.790> want<00:07:14.090> and<00:07:15.090> that's<00:07:15.300> it<00:07:16.460> from<00:07:17.460> here

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.230 
the way I want and that's it from here

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.170 
the way I want and that's it from here
what<00:07:19.230> I'll<00:07:19.350> do<00:07:19.530> is<00:07:19.560> I'll<00:07:19.890> cut<00:07:20.130> the<00:07:20.280> chef's<00:07:20.550> to

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 
what I'll do is I'll cut the chef's to

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.010 
what I'll do is I'll cut the chef's to
length<00:07:21.450> and<00:07:21.810> then<00:07:22.530> i'll<00:07:22.740> put<00:07:22.920> my<00:07:23.040> point<00:07:23.280> on<00:07:23.430> it

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
length and then i'll put my point on it

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.120 
length and then i'll put my point on it
this<00:07:25.020> one<00:07:25.200> here<00:07:25.410> will<00:07:25.530> probably<00:07:25.980> end<00:07:26.040> up

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.130 
this one here will probably end up

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.640 
this one here will probably end up
having<00:07:26.400> a<00:07:26.460> broadhead<00:07:26.700> on<00:07:27.030> it<00:07:27.410> I'm<00:07:28.410> going<00:07:28.590> to

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
having a broadhead on it I'm going to

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.770 
having a broadhead on it I'm going to
have<00:07:28.800> three<00:07:29.280> once<00:07:29.820> I<00:07:29.910> finished<00:07:30.240> this<00:07:30.360> set<00:07:30.660> i'm

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:31.890 
going to have three filled point since

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.260 
going to have three filled point since
you<00:07:32.010> brought<00:07:32.190> heads<00:07:33.050> so<00:07:34.430> on<00:07:35.430> this<00:07:35.640> one<00:07:35.850> here<00:07:36.090> I

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:36.270 
you brought heads so on this one here I

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.540 
you brought heads so on this one here I
just<00:07:36.810> took<00:07:36.960> and<00:07:37.200> put<00:07:37.560> some<00:07:37.740> lines<00:07:38.010> on<00:07:38.250> it<00:07:38.280> just

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.550 
just took and put some lines on it just

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.580 
just took and put some lines on it just
because<00:07:38.610> I<00:07:38.850> like<00:07:39.000> the<00:07:39.030> decoration<00:07:39.410> it<00:07:40.410> looks

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:40.590 
because I like the decoration it looks

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.880 
because I like the decoration it looks
neat<00:07:40.830> and<00:07:41.840> i'll<00:07:42.840> probably<00:07:43.080> do<00:07:43.470> the<00:07:43.590> same<00:07:43.620> on

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:43.890 
neat and i'll probably do the same on

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.940 
neat and i'll probably do the same on
all<00:07:44.070> this<00:07:44.280> so<00:07:44.430> on<00:07:44.550> my<00:07:44.670> arrows<00:07:44.970> match<00:07:45.260> so<00:07:46.260> you

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:46.950 
all this so on my arrows match so you

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.380 
all this so on my arrows match so you
saw<00:07:47.100> it<00:07:47.250> didn't<00:07:47.460> take<00:07:47.580> very<00:07:47.670> long<00:07:47.850> and<00:07:48.270> that's

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:48.390 
saw it didn't take very long and that's

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.060 
saw it didn't take very long and that's
with<00:07:48.570> me<00:07:48.720> talking<00:07:49.020> through<00:07:49.260> the<00:07:49.350> process<00:07:49.830> i

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.070 
with me talking through the process i

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.090 
with me talking through the process i
can<00:07:50.430> actually<00:07:50.580> do<00:07:51.510> all<00:07:51.750> the<00:07:51.900> fletching<00:07:52.320> work

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.100 
can actually do all the fletching work

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.240 
can actually do all the fletching work
on<00:07:53.370> an<00:07:53.550> arrow<00:07:53.730> in<00:07:54.630> about<00:07:55.110> 10<00:07:55.410> minutes<00:07:55.680> if<00:07:56.010> i'm

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.250 
on an arrow in about 10 minutes if i'm

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.670 
on an arrow in about 10 minutes if i'm
not<00:07:56.750> describing<00:07:57.750> the<00:07:57.840> process<00:07:58.020> i've<00:07:58.440> tried

00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 
not describing the process i've tried

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.870 
not describing the process i've tried
shooting<00:07:58.890> a<00:07:59.070> video<00:07:59.220> earlier<00:07:59.340> where<00:07:59.850> I

shooting a video earlier where I
describe<00:08:00.300> the<00:08:00.420> process<00:08:00.630> and<00:08:00.960> made<00:08:01.170> the<00:08:01.320> entire

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 
describe the process and made the entire

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.590 
describe the process and made the entire
arrow<00:08:01.770> from<00:08:01.980> scratch<00:08:02.250> it<00:08:03.150> took<00:08:03.300> me<00:08:03.360> too<00:08:03.570> long

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:03.600 
arrow from scratch it took me too long

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.140 
arrow from scratch it took me too long
