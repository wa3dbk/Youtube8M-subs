idea behind this is very simple you keep

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.340 
idea behind this is very simple you keep
all<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.580> your<00:00:14.820> sheep<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.599> by<00:00:15.750> one<00:00:15.780> space

all of your sheep in a one by one space

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.290 
all of your sheep in a one by one space
in<00:00:16.710> water<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.520> they<00:00:17.730> bob<00:00:17.940> up<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.180> down

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
in water so that they bob up and down

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.279 
in water so that they bob up and down
making<00:00:18.630> them<00:00:18.840> easy<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.320> breed<00:00:19.650> die<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.640> share

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
making them easy to breed die and share

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.750 
making them easy to breed die and share
so<00:00:22.289> first<00:00:22.650> I'll<00:00:22.949> give<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> demonstration

button all of our sheep will get shared

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.970 
button all of our sheep will get shared
now<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> minute<00:00:45.809> our<00:00:45.989> piston<00:00:46.559> tape<00:00:46.800> is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
now at the minute our piston tape is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
now at the minute our piston tape is
completely<00:00:47.640> deactivated<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.450> when<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.660> hit

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
completely deactivated but when we hit

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.479 
completely deactivated but when we hit
this<00:00:48.960> barn<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.800> will<00:00:49.890> take<00:00:50.129> out<00:00:50.309> our

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
this barn here it will take out our

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.700 
this barn here it will take out our
water<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.090> now<00:00:51.239> these<00:00:51.780> sheep<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.289> actually

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
water so now these sheep can actually

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.350 
water so now these sheep can actually
access<00:00:53.129> our<00:00:53.309> grass<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> will<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.149> some

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
access our grass and you will see some

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.700 
access our grass and you will see some
of<00:00:54.480> them<00:00:54.570> will<00:00:54.719> start<00:00:54.930> eating<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.379> straight

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
of them will start eating it straight

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.490 
of them will start eating it straight
away<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.250> ones<00:00:56.699> reach<00:00:56.940> end<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.320> go

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
away that ones reach end and there we go

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.040 
away that ones reach end and there we go
our<00:00:58.770> piston<00:00:59.190> tables<00:00:59.520> rolled<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.809> grass

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
our piston tables rolled and the grass

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.510 
our piston tables rolled and the grass
has<00:01:01.230> been<00:01:01.379> refreshed<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.219> they<00:01:02.370> have

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
has been refreshed so now they have

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.260 
has been refreshed so now they have
plenty<00:01:02.820> more<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.329> eat<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.060> you've

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
plenty more to eat so now that you've

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.060 
plenty more to eat so now that you've
seen<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.689> action<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.200> guess<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.680> should<00:01:07.860> take<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
seen in action I guess we should take a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.649 
seen in action I guess we should take a
look<00:01:08.250> at<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> Redstone<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.119> let's<00:01:09.299> fly<00:01:09.540> around

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
look at the Redstone so let's fly around

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.780 
look at the Redstone so let's fly around
the<00:01:09.900> back<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.369> Redstone

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the back and as you can see the Redstone

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.060 
the back and as you can see the Redstone
is<00:01:12.090> fairly<00:01:12.420> compact<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> myth<00:01:13.409> 5<00:01:13.710> blocks

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
is fairly compact is a myth 5 blocks

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.649 
is fairly compact is a myth 5 blocks
white<00:01:14.310> which<00:01:14.520> i<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:15.000> pretty<00:01:15.210> good<00:01:15.479> is

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
white which i think is pretty good is

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.200 
white which i think is pretty good is
got<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> bud<00:01:16.619> activated<00:01:17.250> piston<00:01:17.610> tape<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
got a bud activated piston tape and a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.510 
got a bud activated piston tape and a
dispenser<00:01:18.869> timing<00:01:19.320> circuit<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.280> quite

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
dispenser timing circuit so that's quite

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.800 
dispenser timing circuit so that's quite
a<00:01:20.549> lot<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.850> things<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> fit<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.570> such<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
a lot of things to fit in such a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.780 
a lot of things to fit in such a
restrictive<00:01:22.439> space<00:01:22.740> another<00:01:23.400> thing<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
restrictive space another thing that you

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.789 
restrictive space another thing that you
have<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.030> account<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.840> grass<00:01:25.229> growth<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
have to account for is grass growth and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.679 
have to account for is grass growth and
the<00:01:26.280> fact<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.549> we're<00:01:26.729> using<00:01:26.909> water<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the fact that we're using water in the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.990 
the fact that we're using water in the
Redstone<00:01:28.140> mechanism<00:01:28.740> which<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.189> notoriously

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
Redstone mechanism which is notoriously

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.480 
Redstone mechanism which is notoriously
risky<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.750> anyway<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.710> guess<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.159> about<00:01:32.340> that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
risky but anyway I guess it's about that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.100 
risky but anyway I guess it's about that
time<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> episode<00:01:33.270> where<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.900> with

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
time in the episode where we get on with

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.399 
time in the episode where we get on with
the<00:01:34.229> tutorial<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.979> let's<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:36.020> now<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.200> before

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the tutorial so let's go now just before

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170 
the tutorial so let's go now just before
we<00:01:37.619> start<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> tutorial<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.970> want<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
we start the tutorial I do just want to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.550 
we start the tutorial I do just want to
say<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.900> are<00:01:39.930> planning<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.409> putting

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
say that if you are planning on putting

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.160 
say that if you are planning on putting
tons<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.369> sheep<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.869> probably

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
tons of sheep in here then it probably

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.840 
tons of sheep in here then it probably
won't<00:01:43.530> work<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.280> will<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.579> munch

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
won't work because they will just munch

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
won't work because they will just munch
run<00:01:45.060> through<00:01:45.329> all<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.600> your<00:01:45.869> grass<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.320> you'll

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
run through all of your grass and you'll

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.350 
run through all of your grass and you'll
just<00:01:46.860> end<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.310> dirt<00:01:47.579> reel<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.149> no

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
just end up with a dirt reel which is no

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.840 
just end up with a dirt reel which is no
good<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.840> anyone<00:01:49.200> however<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.310> did<00:01:50.549> try<00:01:50.790> this

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
good for anyone however I did try this

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.219 
good for anyone however I did try this
out<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.119> ten<00:01:51.479> sheep<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.020> worked

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
out with ten sheep and it worked

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.170 
out with ten sheep and it worked
absolutely<00:01:52.860> fine<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.970> kind

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
absolutely fine so you just have to kind

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.940 
absolutely fine so you just have to kind
of<00:01:54.240> bear<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.720> mind<00:01:54.960> because<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.680> could

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
of bear that in mind because this could

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.319 
of bear that in mind because this could
run<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.250> grass<00:01:56.579> which<00:01:56.880> means<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
run out of grass which means that it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.539 
run out of grass which means that it
will<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.540> rendered<00:01:57.780> useless<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.310> want<00:01:59.490> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
will be rendered useless so you want to

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.100 
will be rendered useless so you want to
kick<00:01:59.700> things<00:01:59.850> off<00:02:00.060> by<00:02:00.270> making<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.630> bud<00:02:00.840> swish

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
kick things off by making your bud swish

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.480 
kick things off by making your bud swish
you<00:02:01.290> want<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> place<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.770> piston<00:02:02.009> where<00:02:02.430> they

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
you want to place a piston where they

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.340 
you want to place a piston where they
block<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
block like this and like that and then a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.319 
block like this and like that and then a
redstone<00:02:04.920> torch<00:02:05.070> there<00:02:05.579> block<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> side

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
redstone torch there block on the side

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.029 
redstone torch there block on the side
with<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> piece<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.110> redstone<00:02:07.290> dust<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.979> top

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
with a piece of redstone dust on top

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.660 
with a piece of redstone dust on top
block<00:02:08.940> up<00:02:09.209> another<00:02:10.140> torch<00:02:10.500> there<00:02:10.860> block<00:02:11.520> on

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
block up another torch there block on

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.760 
block up another torch there block on
top<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.480> side<00:02:12.840> with<00:02:13.230> another

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
top and on the side with another

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.820 
top and on the side with another
piece<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.010> redstone<00:02:14.190> dust<00:02:14.430> block<00:02:15.330> here

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
piece of redstone dust block here

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.470 
piece of redstone dust block here
repeater<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.160> set<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.550> four<00:02:18.000> ticks<00:02:18.240> like

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
repeater and set it to four ticks like

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.930 
repeater and set it to four ticks like
that<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.960> then<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> block<00:02:19.830> applies<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.520> now

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
that and then a block applies so now

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.340 
that and then a block applies so now
when<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.120> take<00:02:21.420> away<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.810> blog<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.230> will

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
when we take away this blog it will

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.810 
when we take away this blog it will
cause<00:02:22.500> an<00:02:22.620> update<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.280> piston<00:02:23.670> which

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
cause an update to that piston which

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.120 
cause an update to that piston which
means<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.180> will<00:02:24.270> extend<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.740> exactly

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
means it will extend so that is exactly

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.860 
means it will extend so that is exactly
what<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.430> need<00:02:26.640> when<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.150> grass<00:02:27.390> turns<00:02:27.660> into

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
what we need when the grass turns into

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.300 
what we need when the grass turns into
dirt<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.440> will<00:02:28.590> cause<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> block<00:02:29.100> update

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
dirt it will cause a block update

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.520 
dirt it will cause a block update
through<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.820> piston<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.360> thus<00:02:30.990> give<00:02:31.260> us<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
through this piston and thus give us a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.310 
through this piston and thus give us a
signal

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
signal

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.570 
signal
so<00:02:34.320> our<00:02:34.560> grass<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.040> going<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.250> go<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.550> this

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
so our grass is going to go like this

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.310 
so our grass is going to go like this
then<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.090> want<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.270> place<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.690> dispenser<00:02:36.870> right

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
then you want to place a dispenser right

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.980 
then you want to place a dispenser right
there<00:02:37.890> place<00:02:38.490> some<00:02:38.700> grass<00:02:39.000> around<00:02:39.570> like<00:02:39.810> this

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
there place some grass around like this

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.980 
there place some grass around like this
now<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.350> has<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.710> be<00:02:40.830> glass<00:02:41.040> or<00:02:41.370> an<00:02:41.580> equivalent

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
now it has to be glass or an equivalent

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.570 
now it has to be glass or an equivalent
transparent<00:02:42.990> block<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.920> use<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> solid

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
transparent block if you use a solid

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.100 
transparent block if you use a solid
block<00:02:44.760> then<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.120> will<00:02:45.240> turn<00:02:45.450> our<00:02:45.600> grass<00:02:45.840> back

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
block then that will turn our grass back

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.410 
block then that will turn our grass back
into<00:02:46.380> dirt<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.800> no<00:02:47.130> one<00:02:47.310> wants<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.640> now<00:02:48.270> in

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
into dirt and no one wants that now in

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.180 
into dirt and no one wants that now in
here<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.780> want<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.990> place<00:02:49.200> your<00:02:49.500> bucket<00:02:50.070> of

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
here you want to place your bucket of

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.010 
here you want to place your bucket of
water<00:02:50.460> then<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.210> just<00:02:51.360> want<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.570> build<00:02:51.780> up

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
water then you just want to build up

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.620 
water then you just want to build up
your<00:02:52.050> wall<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:53.100> place<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.820> block<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.300> top

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
your wall like this place a block on top

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.270 
your wall like this place a block on top
of<00:02:54.750> your<00:02:54.870> dispenser<00:02:55.470> with<00:02:55.890> some<00:02:56.070> redstone

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
of your dispenser with some redstone

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.580 
of your dispenser with some redstone
dust<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.970> then<00:02:57.090> another<00:02:57.390> block<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:58.200> button

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
dust and then another block and a button

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.780 
dust and then another block and a button
so<00:02:58.800> when<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.010> hit<00:02:59.100> your<00:02:59.250> button<00:02:59.460> it<00:02:59.700> will

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
so when you hit your button it will

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.490 
so when you hit your button it will
dispense<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.330> water<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.020> when<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.320> hit<00:03:01.470> it

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
dispense the water and when you hit it

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.610 
dispense the water and when you hit it
again<00:03:01.830> it<00:03:01.860> will<00:03:02.160> retract<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.990> so<00:03:03.990> on<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.260> side

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
again it will retract it so on the side

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.610 
Minecraft that if you have grass
adjacent<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.270> dirt<00:04:45.510> block<00:04:45.780> then<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.380> grass

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
adjacent to a dirt block then the grass

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.700 
adjacent to a dirt block then the grass
will<00:04:46.890> spread<00:04:47.220> a<00:04:47.460> lot<00:04:47.670> faster<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:49.230> now<00:04:49.410> for<00:04:49.650> the

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
will spread a lot faster so now for the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.200 
will spread a lot faster so now for the
other<00:04:49.860> half<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.370> our<00:04:50.430> piston<00:04:50.850> tape<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.150> just

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
other half of our piston tape you just

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.640 
other half of our piston tape you just
want<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.540> bring<00:04:51.660> blocks<00:04:51.930> out<00:04:52.080> like<00:04:52.260> this

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
want to bring blocks out like this

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.620 
want to bring blocks out like this
place<00:04:53.040> a<00:04:53.070> repeater<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.760> set<00:04:54.030> it<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.150> four

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
place a repeater and set it to four

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.750 
place a repeater and set it to four
ticks<00:04:54.900> grab<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.800> sticky<00:04:56.070> piston<00:04:56.280> place<00:04:56.640> it

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
ticks grab a sticky piston place it

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.610 
ticks grab a sticky piston place it
facing<00:04:57.060> upwards<00:04:57.420> with<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.600> block<00:04:57.870> on<00:04:58.050> top<00:04:58.410> and

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
facing upwards with a block on top and

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.140 
facing upwards with a block on top and
then<00:04:59.070> just<00:04:59.310> run<00:04:59.490> your<00:04:59.610> line<00:04:59.760> of<00:04:59.880> redstone

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
then just run your line of redstone

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.060 
then just run your line of redstone
outwards<00:05:00.720> like<00:05:00.780> this<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.320> over<00:05:01.440> here<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:02.040> you

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
outwards like this and over here so you

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.890 
outwards like this and over here so you
want<00:05:02.280> redstone<00:05:02.730> up<00:05:02.850> like<00:05:03.060> that<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.420> a

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
want redstone up like that and a

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.660 
want redstone up like that and a
repeater<00:05:04.290> set<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.920> two<00:05:05.070> ticks<00:05:05.400> with<00:05:05.580> a

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
repeater set it of two ticks with a

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.060 
repeater set it of two ticks with a
block<00:05:05.880> up<00:05:06.060> like<00:05:06.270> so<00:05:06.570> another<00:05:07.320> regular<00:05:07.680> piston

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
block up like so another regular piston

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.220 
block up like so another regular piston
down<00:05:08.220> here<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.790> then<00:05:09.150> carry<00:05:09.510> on<00:05:09.600> your<00:05:09.870> line<00:05:10.080> of

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
down here and then carry on your line of

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.010 
down here and then carry on your line of
redstone<00:05:10.560> out<00:05:10.950> of<00:05:11.160> light<00:05:11.310> there<00:05:11.730> grab<00:05:12.720> a

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
redstone out of light there grab a

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.170 
redstone out of light there grab a
repeater<00:05:13.530> and<00:05:13.950> set<00:05:14.160> it<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.370> four<00:05:14.700> ticks<00:05:14.910> once

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
repeater and set it to four ticks once

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.750 
repeater and set it to four ticks once
again<00:05:15.510> redstone<00:05:16.380> dust<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:17.040> then<00:05:17.250> another

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
again redstone dust and then another

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.700 
again redstone dust and then another
regular<00:05:18.420> piston<00:05:18.600> and<00:05:19.020> then<00:05:19.140> you're<00:05:19.260> done<00:05:19.500> for

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
regular piston and then you're done for

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.580 
regular piston and then you're done for
the<00:05:19.740> redstone<00:05:20.630> so<00:05:21.630> all<00:05:21.930> this<00:05:22.080> left<00:05:22.350> to<00:05:22.440> do<00:05:22.560> now

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
the redstone so all this left to do now

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.800 
the redstone so all this left to do now
is<00:05:22.770> filling<00:05:23.400> out<00:05:23.520> our<00:05:23.670> grass<00:05:24.000> piston<00:05:24.600> wheels

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
is filling out our grass piston wheels

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.450 
is filling out our grass piston wheels
so<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.020> just<00:05:25.140> want<00:05:25.320> to<00:05:25.380> carry<00:05:25.560> out<00:05:25.740> this<00:05:26.220> line

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
so you just want to carry out this line

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.400 
so you just want to carry out this line
of<00:05:26.610> grass<00:05:26.790> to<00:05:26.820> here<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.330> then<00:05:27.840> this<00:05:28.020> one<00:05:28.260> out

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
of grass to here and then this one out

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.110 
of grass to here and then this one out
to<00:05:28.560> here<00:05:28.770> do<00:05:29.010> not<00:05:29.220> fill<00:05:29.460> in<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.730> piece<00:05:29.970> of

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
to here do not fill in this piece of

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.390 
to here do not fill in this piece of
grass<00:05:30.360> otherwise<00:05:30.840> it<00:05:31.080> will<00:05:31.200> break<00:05:31.500> just<00:05:31.860> yeah

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
grass otherwise it will break just yeah

not fill in this one over there so don't

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.920 
not fill in this one over there so don't
fill<00:05:44.070> in<00:05:44.250> that<00:05:44.490> one<00:05:44.700> there<00:05:44.910> because<00:05:45.120> otherwise

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
fill in that one there because otherwise

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.720 
fill in that one there because otherwise
once<00:05:46.230> again<00:05:46.530> it<00:05:46.740> will<00:05:46.890> break<00:05:47.130> and<00:05:47.340> that's<00:05:47.520> just

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
once again it will break and that's just

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.570 
once again it will break and that's just
no<00:05:47.880> good<00:05:48.260> so<00:05:49.260> finally<00:05:49.740> what<00:05:49.950> I<00:05:49.980> want<00:05:50.220> you<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.460> do

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
is fill in all of the available space

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.770 
is fill in all of the available space
with<00:05:52.890> grass<00:05:53.250> that<00:05:53.610> will<00:05:53.790> help<00:05:54.000> spread<00:05:54.450> the

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
with grass that will help spread the

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.750 
with grass that will help spread the
grass<00:05:54.990> along<00:05:55.230> so<00:05:56.040> that<00:05:56.280> you<00:05:56.400> can<00:05:56.580> have<00:05:56.730> a

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
grass along so that you can have a

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.550 
grass along so that you can have a
constant<00:05:57.300> supply<00:05:57.600> there<00:05:57.990> otherwise<00:05:58.320> you

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
constant supply there otherwise you

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.990 
constant supply there otherwise you
could<00:05:58.800> end<00:05:58.830> up<00:05:59.100> with<00:05:59.250> a<00:05:59.310> load<00:05:59.550> of<00:05:59.580> dirt<00:05:59.850> and

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
could end up with a load of dirt and

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.420 
could end up with a load of dirt and
your<00:06:00.150> reel<00:06:00.330> which<00:06:00.810> is<00:06:00.960> no<00:06:01.140> good<00:06:01.350> to<00:06:01.500> anyone<00:06:01.800> so

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
your reel which is no good to anyone so

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.860 
your reel which is no good to anyone so
that's<00:06:02.670> something<00:06:02.880> for<00:06:03.060> you<00:06:03.120> to<00:06:03.240> do<00:06:03.360> then<00:06:03.750> you

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
that's something for you to do then you

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.420 
that's something for you to do then you
can<00:06:04.050> fill<00:06:04.290> it<00:06:04.380> in<00:06:04.410> with<00:06:04.530> sheep<00:06:04.980> that's<00:06:05.280> all

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
can fill it in with sheep that's all

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.980 
can fill it in with sheep that's all
ready<00:06:05.640> when<00:06:06.120> you<00:06:06.210> hit<00:06:06.390> this<00:06:06.510> barn<00:06:06.750> they'll

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
ready when you hit this barn they'll

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.510 
ready when you hit this barn they'll
start<00:06:07.320> bobbing<00:06:07.620> up<00:06:07.680> and<00:06:07.830> down<00:06:07.920> so<00:06:08.280> you<00:06:08.310> can

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
start bobbing up and down so you can

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.760 
start bobbing up and down so you can
shear<00:06:08.820> away<00:06:09.030> and<00:06:09.450> then<00:06:09.960> when<00:06:10.230> you<00:06:10.470> turn<00:06:10.710> off

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
shear away and then when you turn off

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.470 
shear away and then when you turn off
that<00:06:11.070> barn<00:06:11.340> they<00:06:11.550> will<00:06:11.700> be<00:06:11.790> free<00:06:12.120> to<00:06:12.300> either

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480
