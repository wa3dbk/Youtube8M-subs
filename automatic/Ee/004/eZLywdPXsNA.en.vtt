distilled white vinegar baking soda and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.450 
distilled white vinegar baking soda and
borax<00:02:01.360> so<00:02:03.640> vinegar<00:02:04.719> yes<00:02:05.770> yes<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.950> does<00:02:07.130> smell

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
borax so vinegar yes yes it does smell

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.059 
borax so vinegar yes yes it does smell
it<00:02:07.939> does<00:02:08.810> smell<00:02:09.250> but

the smell that it eliminate emanates is
hardly<00:02:16.409> comparable<00:02:17.159> to<00:02:18.379> the<00:02:19.379> noxious<00:02:19.920> gases

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
hardly comparable to the noxious gases

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.110 
hardly comparable to the noxious gases
that<00:02:21.060> would<00:02:21.239> come<00:02:21.480> out<00:02:21.689> of<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.989> dragon<00:02:23.120> from

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
that would come out of a dragon from

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.129 
that would come out of a dragon from
using<00:02:24.480> bleach<00:02:26.060> vinegar<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.269> comparison<00:02:27.989> to

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.139 
using bleach vinegar in comparison to

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.160 
using bleach vinegar in comparison to
bleach<00:02:28.409> is<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:29.639> noxious<00:02:29.879> gases<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.989> would

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
bleach is the noxious gases that would

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.990 
bleach is the noxious gases that would
