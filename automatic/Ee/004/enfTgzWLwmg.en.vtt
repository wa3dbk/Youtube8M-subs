00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
it off put it here cool a little bit

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.540 
it off put it here cool a little bit
down<00:03:35.980> so<00:03:36.980> we<00:03:37.190> do<00:03:37.310> like<00:03:37.490> that<00:03:38.200> 45<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:40.340> we<00:03:40.430> do<00:03:40.520> have

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
down so we do like that 45 so we do have

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.460 
down so we do like that 45 so we do have
a<00:03:40.700> five<00:03:40.940> or<00:03:41.030> six<00:03:41.300> first<00:03:41.540> after<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.200> what<00:03:42.410> I'm

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
a five or six first after so what I'm

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.840 
a five or six first after so what I'm
going<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.620> do<00:03:42.800> here<00:03:42.830> I'm<00:03:43.310> just<00:03:43.370> going<00:03:43.520> to<00:03:43.640> trim

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
going to do here I'm just going to trim

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.820 
going to do here I'm just going to trim
it<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.060> little<00:03:44.090> bit<00:03:44.420> I<00:03:44.630> like<00:03:45.440> things<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.770> be

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
it a little bit I like things to be

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.460 
it a little bit I like things to be
natural<00:03:46.100> so<00:03:46.580> I'm<00:03:46.730> never<00:03:47.030> ever<00:03:47.360> thinking<00:03:48.200> about

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
natural so I'm never ever thinking about

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.260 
natural so I'm never ever thinking about
the<00:03:48.650> OL<00:03:48.770> needs<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.100> be<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.340> same<00:03:49.550> size<00:03:49.850> so

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
the OL needs to be the same size so

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.360 
the OL needs to be the same size so
whatever<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:51.200> needs<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.530> be<00:03:51.650> natural<00:03:51.800> just<00:03:52.280> a

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
whatever it needs to be natural just a

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.630
