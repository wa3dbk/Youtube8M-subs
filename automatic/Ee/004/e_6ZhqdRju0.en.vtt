 and so pit popular or the one spirituality with Drive is the Color 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.370
 Of course this is a promising title for anyone who wants to do that 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.079
 not spirituality and, of course, the pleasures of pleasure

 Positive thinking can not really why these films why 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.570
 Personally, I liked the sea route better, because there is still one 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.030
 little scientific Zumwinkel the Secret at Mannesmann very many 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.770
 Sunshine and motivation and hello it's as easy as important a few 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.800
 Tears in a TV armchair closes the eyes 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.820
 and turns the key around and Ouzo turns him into a new car 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.690
 Mang says it is probably morning or nothing 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.430
 It's not that easy at o2 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.030
 Sample of the angular says positive think Zierl 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.210
 Setting goals and having IAB as that's good but 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.700
 you just have to be butt mass movement just that I'm in 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.790
 Lay in advance and imagine that you hold percent 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.340
 yes, what I get the dream woman or the super job is not enough 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.820
 from "you have to hurt something already 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.590
 Percent the book is as a mixture between autobiography he tells me 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 came to the movie the Bleep even though he was broke and it was 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.640
 still managed 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.710
 the rights to get awarded for this movie he guessed very much 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.060
 clearly also out what in the other books so very much 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.790
 missed 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.490
 no human being we can stop life in a world of polarity around no one can 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.230
 To be good all day just think good thoughts only do good deeds 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.890
 and the people Gasteig's percent try in public 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.900
 Selling 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.690
 Percentages are not the ones that are rarely theirs or those 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.690
 Children are trafficking or those in the office 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:18.079
 do not stop very nicely i am also very careful when 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.629
 someone like that 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.730
 is quite good and just nice and just nice to agree with you back then May and 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.409
 mostly nothing and he sees it just as well I think it's somebody 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.249
 says 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.289
 he deals with the topic of Buddhism very much why one on the 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:37.339
 Scanner here does not hurt the hindu god Gertraud I do not know 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:40.230
 no idea 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.219
 Percent what a bit 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:47.179
 actually spammed no spam that he always blinded the word enlightenment 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.700
 we are completely honest 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.570
 who is really seeking enlightenment 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.240
 basically since there's one more of the prince's bit better 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.329
 that our quality of life improves 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.809
 and as usual strive for enlightenment, I think the least of us there for 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:07.129
 I'm the absolute name for this word I'm the one of Leon 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.469
 from market wants to have his halo when 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:11.829
 around 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.479
 he also met the Dalai Lama and did not snack on the report here 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.949
 read about it in this book was Lamein Leiter 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.409
 because he lost a lot of respect 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.989
 He has it's time to set an example that you can not set penalties 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.599
 should not follow in the Bible or exception in the moment and there am 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.069
 Of course I also a bit bitchy I admit that 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.859
 To be wellness the rest is going to be respect for other living beings behind 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.329
 I'm pretty sensitive 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.529
 And I think there are no exceptions to the rule 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:46.149
 percent 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:50.599
 So what else is there to say about the book? It is certainly a bug 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.989
 Tears percent of people back a bit helps a motivation too 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.940
 get back a target to attack 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.030
 Percent of those who have something to do with steam feeling when I do that and myself 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.329
 effort then I will say that already Â» 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.159
 Percent whoever the other books knows the Secret or Repower around 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:14.870
 I would rule there to grab that point book when I get it 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.259
 Percent yes 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.409
 Binder percent I'm just not a friend of it 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.419
 of pledges I wish me something Preuss 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.740
 it happens that is too easy for me 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.780
 I find it a bit too bad that the author first 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.099
 said they had to do something for it a few pages later 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.020
 is it then again Thier such books Wiehl BÃ¤rbel Mohr cosmic 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.159
 Wish fulfillment or of which 4 ank 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.830
 it can not be that easy to say some but it is such a case 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.429
 contradicts that in my office, even who this is a pity 

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:49.719
 that it does not come to me 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:54.949
 yes, who has motivation maybe who do something again per cent 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.509
 would certainly not be bad advice with the bug already due 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.970
 his advice gives the wheels that are quite percent 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.900
 my neighbor and understandable 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.300
 and you do not have to be so terribly serious about it 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.759
 The alleged victims are right, but with such books that's just always 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.919
 such a thing either one goes off or one does not do it "I have a lot 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.919
 been a lot of books in this direction 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.770
 I would not necessarily recommend the Secret today because as I said 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.060
 this motivational thrust and then usually people first in a 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.020
 Deep down there I think this is here 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.990
 he recommended 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.699
 We also prefer a great movie I liked to have seen a lot 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.520
 given many new interesting aspects and Zach just to know what 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.080
 actually means the word 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.979
 All this explained blood test for the people seeking motivation Diarra 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.690
 for easy yet not reading all these other books is that 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.020
 certainly a good start
