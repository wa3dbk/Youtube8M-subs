00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.950 
attack a flag flag rally and gate relay
let's<00:06:32.700> see<00:06:32.910> if<00:06:32.970> there's<00:06:33.800> any<00:06:34.800> kind<00:06:35.190> of

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
let's see if there's any kind of

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.860 
let's see if there's any kind of
multiplayer<00:06:36.960> I<00:06:37.020> am<00:06:37.320> not<00:06:37.590> sure<00:06:38.840> there's<00:06:39.840> the

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
multiplayer I am not sure there's the

00:06:39.870 --> 00:07:11.550 
multiplayer I am not sure there's the
trophies<00:06:40.410> when<00:06:40.860> our<00:06:40.980> levels<00:06:41.310> and<00:06:41.460> our<00:06:41.550> modes

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.820 

all<00:07:12.560> right<00:07:12.860> so<00:07:13.099> I<00:07:13.129> guess<00:07:13.400> that's<00:07:13.610> it

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830 
all right so I guess that's it

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.420 
all right so I guess that's it
nothing<00:07:15.830> too<00:07:16.280> special<00:07:16.759> here<00:07:17.030> goes<00:07:17.240> the<00:07:18.430> option

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430 
nothing too special here goes the option

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.550 
nothing too special here goes the option
settings<00:07:19.849> that<00:07:19.940> you<00:07:20.090> have<00:07:20.120> access<00:07:21.080> to<00:07:21.289> so

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 
settings that you have access to so

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.490 
settings that you have access to so
there's<00:07:21.740> really<00:07:21.919> nothing<00:07:22.520> too<00:07:23.000> extensive<00:07:23.840> and

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
there's really nothing too extensive and

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.040 
there's really nothing too extensive and
yeah<00:07:25.310> I<00:07:25.520> have<00:07:25.699> the<00:07:25.819> vibration<00:07:26.389> off<00:07:26.509> I<00:07:26.780> guess

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
yeah I have the vibration off I guess
