00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
can get a hold of this thing in the mid

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.179 
can get a hold of this thing in the mid
levels<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.729> level<00:01:29.970> 32<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:31.740> first<00:01:32.009> off<00:01:32.159> let's

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
levels at level 32 so first off let's

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.770 
levels at level 32 so first off let's
take<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> look<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:32.790> some<00:01:32.970> general<00:01:33.119> features<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
take a look at some general features of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.830 
take a look at some general features of
the<00:01:33.900> type<00:01:34.079> 95<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.890> modern<00:01:35.159> warfare<00:01:35.310> 3<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.360> first

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the type 95 in modern warfare 3 so first

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
the type 95 in modern warfare 3 so first
up<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> damage<00:01:37.409> figures<00:01:37.710> are<00:01:37.890> pretty<00:01:38.189> high<00:01:38.310> at

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
up the damage figures are pretty high at

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.270 
up the damage figures are pretty high at
55<00:01:39.150> 20<00:01:39.689> that's<00:01:39.810> 55<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.500> close<00:01:40.740> dropping<00:01:41.189> off

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
55 20 that's 55 up close dropping off

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.249 
55 20 that's 55 up close dropping off
quite<00:01:41.520> dramatically<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.329> 20<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:42.810> long<00:01:42.990> range

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
quite dramatically to 20 at long range

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.609 
quite dramatically to 20 at long range
this<00:01:43.890> allows<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.759> two-shot<00:01:45.240> kill<00:01:45.270> at<00:01:45.540> close

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
this allows for a two-shot kill at close

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
being a three round burst weapon you

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.240 
being a three round burst weapon you
don't<00:03:22.140> even<00:03:22.260> need<00:03:22.500> all<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.799> bullets<00:03:23.100> from

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
don't even need all the bullets from

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.430 
don't even need all the bullets from
your<00:03:23.340> first<00:03:23.730> shot<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.239> hit<00:03:24.359> your<00:03:24.540> target<00:03:24.570> in

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
your first shot to hit your target in

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.199 
your first shot to hit your target in
order<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.769> get<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.250> one-shot<00:03:26.730> kill

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
order to get a one-shot kill

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.720 
order to get a one-shot kill
combine<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.109> with<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.769> low<00:03:29.160> recoil<00:03:29.370> and

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
combine that with the low recoil and

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.819 
combine that with the low recoil and
that<00:03:29.880> low<00:03:30.030> spread<00:03:30.450> means<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.320> maintains

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
that low spread means it is maintains

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.819 
that low spread means it is maintains
that<00:03:32.010> deadliness<00:03:32.370> up<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.350> medium<00:03:34.350> ranges

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
that deadliness up to the medium ranges

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.710 
that deadliness up to the medium ranges
then<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.430> only<00:03:35.609> real<00:03:35.760> downside<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.569> need

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
then the only real downside is you need

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.259 
then the only real downside is you need
between<00:03:36.900> 4<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.530> 5<00:03:37.709> shots<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.160> kill<00:03:38.370> it's<00:03:38.970> at

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
between 4 and 5 shots to kill it's at

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.090 
between 4 and 5 shots to kill it's at
long<00:03:39.450> range<00:03:39.720> which<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.350> essentially<00:03:40.739> two

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
long range which is essentially two

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.550 
long range which is essentially two
bursts<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:41.790> if<00:03:42.600> we<00:03:42.660> consider<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:43.109> two<00:03:43.319> shots

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
bursts so if we consider that two shots

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.710 
bursts so if we consider that two shots
to<00:03:43.709> kill<00:03:43.890> under<00:03:44.310> rate<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.640> fire<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:44.970> 1,000

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720

this video goes live so I'll kind of

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.010 
this video goes live so I'll kind of
give<00:04:34.280> my<00:04:34.460> predictions<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.510> what<00:04:35.630> those<00:04:35.810> might

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
give my predictions and what those might

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.420 
give my predictions and what those might
have<00:04:36.050> been<00:04:36.380> and<00:04:36.620> we<00:04:36.680> can<00:04:36.830> see<00:04:36.980> down<00:04:37.160> in<00:04:37.340> the

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
have been and we can see down in the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.610 
have been and we can see down in the
comments<00:04:37.820> whether<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.090> was<00:04:38.270> right<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:39.500> my

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
comments whether it was right so my

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.320 
comments whether it was right so my
predictions<00:04:40.130> got<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.400> go<00:04:40.520> with<00:04:40.760> a<00:04:41.120> lower

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
predictions got to go with a lower

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.210 
predictions got to go with a lower
damage<00:04:41.630> figure<00:04:42.080> for<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.350> at<00:04:42.650> close<00:04:42.860> range

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
damage figure for that at close range

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.620 
damage figure for that at close range
damage<00:04:44.150> probably<00:04:44.840> between<00:04:45.200> 35<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.730> 40<00:04:47.420> I

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
damage probably between 35 and 40 I

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.990 
damage probably between 35 and 40 I
think<00:04:47.750> that<00:04:48.080> I'd<00:04:48.170> maintain<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.650> 3<00:04:49.040> shot<00:04:49.310> kill<00:04:49.340> so

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
think that I'd maintain a 3 shot kill so

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.960 
think that I'd maintain a 3 shot kill so
it's<00:04:50.150> still<00:04:50.450> a<00:04:50.480> 1:1<00:04:51.350> shot<00:04:51.620> burst<00:04:51.860> that's<00:04:52.730> if

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
it's still a 1:1 shot burst that's if

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.760 
it's still a 1:1 shot burst that's if
you<00:04:53.090> get<00:04:53.240> all<00:04:53.390> three<00:04:53.630> shots<00:04:53.930> on<00:04:54.170> target<00:04:54.200> so<00:04:54.740> I

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
you get all three shots on target so I

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.110 
you get all three shots on target so I
think<00:04:54.860> that<00:04:55.130> would<00:04:55.280> probably<00:04:55.460> balance<00:04:55.940> the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
think that would probably balance the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.090 
think that would probably balance the
weapon<00:04:56.480> just<00:04:57.050> enough<00:04:57.350> so<00:04:57.560> you're<00:04:57.740> not<00:04:57.830> getting

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
weapon just enough so you're not getting

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.010 
weapon just enough so you're not getting
those<00:04:58.280> one-shot<00:04:59.000> kills<00:04:59.270> all<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.750> time

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
those one-shot kills all the time

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.900 
those one-shot kills all the time
because<00:05:00.620> we've<00:05:00.860> always<00:05:01.010> got<00:05:01.250> that<00:05:01.370> chance<00:05:01.700> of

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
because we've always got that chance of

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.400 
because we've always got that chance of
the<00:05:02.030> third<00:05:02.270> shot<00:05:02.600> or<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:02.930> second<00:05:03.290> or<00:05:03.380> third

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
the third shot or the second or third

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.650 
the third shot or the second or third
shot<00:05:03.920> straight<00:05:04.550> off<00:05:04.760> target<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.300> missing<00:05:05.570> the

shot straight off target and missing the

shot straight off target and missing the
bad<00:05:05.810> guy<00:05:06.020> so<00:05:06.800> let's<00:05:06.980> finish<00:05:07.100> off<00:05:07.280> this<00:05:07.430> guide

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640

attachment<00:05:23.690> which<00:05:24.410> increases<00:05:25.010> that<00:05:25.160> rate<00:05:25.400> of

it's bottle very low recoil the rapid
fire<00:05:31.820> that<00:05:32.480> really<00:05:32.690> makes<00:05:32.870> it<00:05:33.080> much<00:05:33.200> more

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
fire that really makes it much more

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.080 
fire that really makes it much more
deadly<00:05:33.650> we've<00:05:34.280> already<00:05:34.430> mentioned<00:05:34.700> that<00:05:34.970> you

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
deadly we've already mentioned that you

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.780 
deadly we've already mentioned that you
can<00:05:35.210> take<00:05:35.450> out<00:05:35.630> a<00:05:35.660> person<00:05:36.200> in<00:05:36.440> one<00:05:36.830> burst<00:05:37.130> it's

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
can take out a person in one burst it's

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.820 
can take out a person in one burst it's
just<00:05:38.030> spring<00:05:38.300> from<00:05:38.450> the<00:05:38.570> hip<00:05:38.750> in<00:05:39.440> a<00:05:39.530> split

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
just spring from the hip in a split

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.530 
just spring from the hip in a split
second<00:05:40.280> so<00:05:40.520> you<00:05:40.610> can<00:05:40.790> increase<00:05:41.000> that<00:05:41.240> even

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
second so you can increase that even

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.690 
second so you can increase that even
more<00:05:41.720> with<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:41.960> help<00:05:42.140> of<00:05:42.260> rapid<00:05:42.590> fire<00:05:42.670> so<00:05:43.670> a

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
more with the help of rapid fire so a

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.940 
more with the help of rapid fire so a
misconception<00:05:44.360> is<00:05:44.690> that<00:05:44.720> the<00:05:45.140> rapid<00:05:45.740> fire

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
misconception is that the rapid fire

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.460 
misconception is that the rapid fire
reduces<00:05:46.160> the<00:05:46.670> time<00:05:46.910> between<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.690> bursts<00:05:48.080> but

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
reduces the time between the bursts but

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.800 
reduces the time between the bursts but
it<00:05:48.890> doesn't<00:05:49.220> it<00:05:49.340> actually<00:05:49.700> just<00:05:49.880> as<00:05:50.480> the<00:05:50.660> name

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
it doesn't it actually just as the name

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.260 
it doesn't it actually just as the name
suggests<00:05:51.170> just<00:05:51.410> increases<00:05:52.010> the<00:05:52.040> rate<00:05:52.880> of<00:05:53.060> fire

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
suggests just increases the rate of fire

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.240 
suggests just increases the rate of fire
the<00:05:53.870> dual<00:05:54.080> attachments<00:05:54.620> proficiency<00:05:55.190> is

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
the dual attachments proficiency is

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.380 
the dual attachments proficiency is
going<00:05:55.430> to<00:05:55.490> be<00:05:55.550> one<00:05:55.700> of<00:05:55.790> the<00:05:55.880> better<00:05:56.030> choices

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
going to be one of the better choices

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.240 
going to be one of the better choices
which<00:05:56.720> allows<00:05:57.020> you<00:05:57.170> to<00:05:57.320> equip<00:05:57.680> the<00:05:57.800> rapid<00:05:58.070> fire

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
which allows you to equip the rapid fire

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.400 
which allows you to equip the rapid fire
and<00:05:58.520> another<00:05:59.330> attachment<00:05:59.660> of<00:05:59.990> your<00:06:00.140> choice

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
and another attachment of your choice

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.070 
and another attachment of your choice
this<00:06:01.130> might<00:06:01.370> be<00:06:01.550> the<00:06:01.820> red<00:06:02.120> dot<00:06:02.300> sight<00:06:02.540> to<00:06:02.810> give

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
this might be the red dot sight to give

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.410 
this might be the red dot sight to give
you<00:06:03.230> more<00:06:03.500> precise<00:06:03.950> aiming<00:06:04.310> we've<00:06:05.300> already

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
seen that those iron sights aren't too

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.530 
seen that those iron sights aren't too
bad<00:06:07.130> but<00:06:07.370> with<00:06:07.490> a<00:06:07.520> three<00:06:07.730> round<00:06:07.910> burst<00:06:08.150> weapon

you<00:06:08.690> really<00:06:08.900> want<00:06:09.050> to<00:06:09.170> be<00:06:09.260> as<00:06:09.350> accurate<00:06:09.500> as

more stealthy approach even though
