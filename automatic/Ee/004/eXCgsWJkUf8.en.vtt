what can your investors expect in form

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.490 
what can your investors expect in form
of

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.590 
of
10<00:02:12.620> schools<00:02:12.980> profits<00:02:13.400> etc<00:02:13.520> well<00:02:14.450> we're

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
10 schools profits etc well we're

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.540 
10 schools profits etc well we're
looking<00:02:14.840> at<00:02:14.900> about<00:02:14.960> fifteen<00:02:15.500> percent<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.250> what

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
looking at about fifteen percent is what

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.090 
looking at about fifteen percent is what
our<00:02:16.580> toll<00:02:17.300> rate<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:18.020> that's<00:02:18.260> what<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.680> make

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
our toll rate is is that's what we make

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.550 
our toll rate is is that's what we make
in<00:02:19.250> profit<00:02:19.700> plus<00:02:20.390> anything<00:02:20.960> over<00:02:21.200> ninety

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
in profit plus anything over ninety

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.650 
in profit plus anything over ninety
percent<00:02:21.740> so<00:02:22.670> if<00:02:22.760> we're<00:02:22.970> get<00:02:23.270> a<00:02:23.300> very<00:02:23.600> high

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
percent so if we're get a very high

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.810 
percent so if we're get a very high
grade<00:02:24.140> concentrate<00:02:24.710> where<00:02:24.890> it's<00:02:25.040> like<00:02:25.160> 93%

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
grade concentrate where it's like 93%

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.810 
grade concentrate where it's like 93%
where<00:02:26.300> we<00:02:26.450> recover<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.990> gold<00:02:27.550> after<00:02:28.550> ninety

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
where we recover the gold after ninety

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.570 
where we recover the gold after ninety
percent<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.600> rest<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:30.050> ours<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:31.250> we<00:02:31.400> pay

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
percent the rest is ours and so we pay

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.510 
percent the rest is ours and so we pay
the<00:02:31.730> miners<00:02:32.060> up<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.540> ninety<00:02:32.870> percent<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:34.190> so

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
the miners up to ninety percent and so

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.400 
the miners up to ninety percent and so
there<00:02:34.760> we<00:02:35.030> get<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.330> build<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.720> bit<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.900> margin

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
there we get to build in a bit of margin

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.790 
there we get to build in a bit of margin
a<00:02:36.560> bit<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.860> extra<00:02:37.570> profit<00:02:38.570> for<00:02:38.720> ourselves<00:02:38.810> but

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
a bit of extra profit for ourselves but

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.680 
a bit of extra profit for ourselves but
in<00:02:40.010> worst-case<00:02:40.280> enero<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.910> fifteen<00:02:41.270> percent

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
in worst-case enero is fifteen percent

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.760 
in worst-case enero is fifteen percent
we're<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.290> factory<00:02:42.890> we're<00:02:43.070> processing

so<00:03:14.330> there's<00:03:14.510> lots<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.780> room<00:03:14.930> for<00:03:14.989> expansion<00:03:15.440> I

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
so there's lots of room for expansion I

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.280 
so there's lots of room for expansion I
definitely<00:03:16.730> see<00:03:17.090> an<00:03:17.299> opportunity<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.840> expand

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
definitely see an opportunity to expand

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.120 
definitely see an opportunity to expand
right<00:03:18.590> away<00:03:18.910> we're<00:03:19.910> getting<00:03:20.299> a<00:03:20.709> large<00:03:21.709> demand

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
right away we're getting a large demand

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.310 
right away we're getting a large demand
you<00:03:22.850> know<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.180> our<00:03:23.269> capacity<00:03:23.780> will<00:03:23.930> be<00:03:24.019> full

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
you know and our capacity will be full

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.680 
you know and our capacity will be full
very<00:03:24.560> quickly<00:03:24.860> within<00:03:25.400> about<00:03:25.640> six<00:03:25.940> months<00:03:26.150> and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
very quickly within about six months and

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.509 
very quickly within about six months and
so<00:03:26.989> then<00:03:27.200> after<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.650> i<00:03:27.709> would<00:03:28.010> say<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.400> we

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
so then after that i would say that we

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.640 
so then after that i would say that we
would<00:03:28.700> look<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:28.910> expansion<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.870> then<00:03:30.620> a

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
would look to expansion and then a

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.070 
would look to expansion and then a
future<00:03:31.370> data<00:03:31.850> we<00:03:32.239> would<00:03:32.450> look<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.630> build<00:03:32.989> a

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
future data we would look to build a

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.830 
future data we would look to build a

then that would be a good time frame or

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.620 
then that would be a good time frame or

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
five days as soon as the samples are

five days as soon as the samples are
done<00:04:42.120> from<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.510> lab<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.530> our<00:04:44.010> own<00:04:44.040> lab<00:04:44.460> then

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
done from the lab and our own lab then

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.030 
done from the lab and our own lab then
we<00:04:45.360> give<00:04:45.690> those<00:04:45.870> results<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.470> customer<00:04:46.919> and

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
we give those results the customer and

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.500 
we give those results the customer and
the<00:04:47.100> customer<00:04:47.130> says<00:04:47.699> yes<00:04:47.880> I<00:04:48.090> agree<00:04:48.210> with<00:04:48.389> that

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
the customer says yes I agree with that

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.510 
the customer says yes I agree with that
and<00:04:48.750> they<00:04:48.840> prove<00:04:49.139> it<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:49.410> then<00:04:50.070> they<00:04:50.160> get<00:04:50.310> paid

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
and they prove it and then they get paid

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.210 
and they prove it and then they get paid
ninety<00:04:51.240> percent<00:04:51.389> right<00:04:51.840> away<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.800> that's

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
ninety percent right away so that's

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.890 
ninety percent right away so that's
about<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.699> three-week<00:04:54.150> faster<00:04:54.690> turnaround

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
about a three-week faster turnaround

we<00:05:13.680> will<00:05:13.889> produce<00:05:14.690> we're<00:05:15.690> producing

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
we will produce we're producing

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.710 
we will produce we're producing
concentrates<00:05:16.919> or<00:05:17.130> processing<00:05:18.090> them<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:18.600> we're

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
concentrates or processing them so we're

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.140 
concentrates or processing them so we're
not<00:05:18.750> actually<00:05:19.110> mining<00:05:19.889> that<00:05:20.100> but<00:05:20.880> that's<00:05:21.060> just

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
not actually mining that but that's just

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.060 
not actually mining that but that's just
give<00:05:21.449> me<00:05:21.539> an<00:05:21.630> idea<00:05:21.720> and<00:05:22.260> that<00:05:22.620> should<00:05:22.800> work<00:05:22.919> out

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
give me an idea and that should work out

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.430 
give me an idea and that should work out
to<00:05:23.190> be<00:05:23.340> on<00:05:23.639> a<00:05:23.699> fully<00:05:24.030> diluted<00:05:24.150> basis<00:05:24.720> about

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
to be on a fully diluted basis about

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.830 
to be on a fully diluted basis about
fifty<00:05:25.770> cents<00:05:26.130> per<00:05:26.310> share<00:05:26.340> in<00:05:26.729> cash<00:05:26.760> flow<00:05:27.180> mmm

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
fifty cents per share in cash flow mmm
