00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
of requests that i had i am just simply

of requests that i had i am just simply
showing<00:00:15.330> i<00:00:15.750> guess<00:00:16.349> what<00:00:16.590> my<00:00:17.160> technique<00:00:17.700> is

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
showing i guess what my technique is

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.700 
showing i guess what my technique is
when<00:00:19.770> i<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:19.920> my<00:00:20.070> nails<00:00:21.289> technique<00:00:22.289> makes<00:00:22.500> it

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
when i do my nails technique makes it

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.710 
when i do my nails technique makes it
sound<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.070> lot<00:00:23.240> fancier<00:00:24.240> than<00:00:24.269> what<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.689> really

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
sound a lot fancier than what it really

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.700 
sound a lot fancier than what it really
is<00:00:26.420> it's<00:00:27.420> really<00:00:28.050> pretty<00:00:28.170> simple<00:00:28.410> i'm<00:00:30.410> doing<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
is it's really pretty simple i'm doing a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.070 
is it's really pretty simple i'm doing a
new<00:00:32.220> bar<00:00:34.010> reclaim<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:37.250> it's<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.460> nice

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
new bar reclaim and it's a nice

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.310 
new bar reclaim and it's a nice
holographic<00:00:41.330> but<00:00:42.330> i'm<00:00:42.449> not<00:00:42.750> used<00:00:43.049> to<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
holographic but i'm not used to the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.200 
holographic but i'm not used to the
brush<00:00:43.589> on<00:00:43.860> these<00:00:44.070> yet<00:00:44.339> i<00:00:44.549> haven't<00:00:44.760> had<00:00:45.000> very

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
brush on these yet i haven't had very

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.710 
brush on these yet i haven't had very
many<00:00:46.190> ok<00:00:47.190> um<00:00:49.820> try<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.940> make<00:00:51.089> sure<00:00:51.119> I'm<00:00:51.510> where

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
many ok um try and make sure I'm where

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.630 
many ok um try and make sure I'm where
you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:52.549> really<00:00:53.549> see<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:58.010> usually<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.159> a<00:00:59.190> thin

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
you can really see I usually do a thin

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:10.520 
you can really see I usually do a thin
coat<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:01.710> first<00:01:01.979> time<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:03.799> I<00:01:09.230> do<00:01:10.230> it<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.380> little

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
coat the first time and I do it a little

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.460 
coat the first time and I do it a little
thicker<00:01:11.510> on<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.750> second<00:01:13.200> coat<00:01:13.410> I<00:01:15.290> don't<00:01:16.290> go

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
thicker on the second coat I don't go

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
thicker on the second coat I don't go
all<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.680> way<00:01:16.800> up<00:01:16.980> to<00:01:17.130> my<00:01:17.250> cuticle<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:20.570> lot

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
all the way up to my cuticle and a lot

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.110 
all the way up to my cuticle and a lot
of<00:01:21.600> people<00:01:22.610> have<00:01:23.610> asked<00:01:24.360> before<00:01:24.980> why<00:01:25.980> um<00:01:26.660> I<00:01:29.120> do

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
of people have asked before why um I do

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.530 
of people have asked before why um I do
it<00:01:30.330> for<00:01:30.390> two<00:01:30.660> reasons<00:01:30.930> um<00:01:33.530> one<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:35.270> don't<00:01:36.270> like

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it for two reasons um one I don't like

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.140 
it for two reasons um one I don't like
the<00:01:37.470> nail<00:01:37.620> polish<00:01:37.980> pooling<00:01:38.400> underneath<00:01:38.580> my

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the nail polish pooling underneath my

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.600 
the nail polish pooling underneath my
cuticle<00:01:39.690> it's<00:01:40.050> impossible<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.190> that<00:01:41.370> off

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
cuticle it's impossible to get that off

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.300 
cuticle it's impossible to get that off
and<00:01:44.690> two<00:01:45.690> I<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.770> look<00:01:46.800> of<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.190> I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and two I just like the look of it I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.160 
and two I just like the look of it I
think<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.580> looks<00:01:47.820> cleaner<00:01:49.700> ok<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.930> you're

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
think it looks cleaner ok and if you're

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.190 
think it looks cleaner ok and if you're
wanting<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:52.800> it<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.100> way<00:01:53.720> lay<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:54.750> brush

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
wanting to do it that way lay your brush

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
wanting to do it that way lay your brush
down<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:56.310> before<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:58.460> kind<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.490> push<00:01:59.729> it

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
down just before and kind of push it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.360 
down just before and kind of push it
back<00:02:00.150> close<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.229> cuticle<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.860> then<00:02:02.100> pull

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
back close to the cuticle and then pull

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:09.730 
back close to the cuticle and then pull
forward<00:02:04.010> makes<00:02:05.010> it<00:02:05.159> easier<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.700> UM<00:02:08.239> keep<00:02:09.239> from

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
forward makes it easier to UM keep from

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.890 
forward makes it easier to UM keep from
it<00:02:10.740> pulling<00:02:11.190> up<00:02:11.550> at<00:02:11.790> your<00:02:11.970> cuticle

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
it pulling up at your cuticle

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.280 
it pulling up at your cuticle
and<00:02:15.989> once<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.110> get<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.379> center<00:02:17.769> line<00:02:17.909> it's

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and once you get that center line it's

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.830 
and once you get that center line it's
you<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:20.500> kind<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.739> drag<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.189> down<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.840> either

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
you just kind of drag it down on either

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.899 
you just kind of drag it down on either
one<00:02:23.230> sorry<00:02:23.530> my<00:02:23.680> hands<00:02:24.010> are<00:02:24.069> shaking<00:02:24.549> something

that's<00:03:06.220> basically<00:03:06.760> pretty<00:03:07.299> much<00:03:08.489> simply<00:03:09.489> what

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
that's basically pretty much simply what

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:16.559 
that's basically pretty much simply what
I<00:03:09.670> do<00:03:09.819> it's<00:03:10.180> just<00:03:10.359> your<00:03:13.319> three<00:03:14.319> stroke<00:03:15.569> and

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
I do it's just your three stroke and

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.069 
I do it's just your three stroke and
starting<00:03:17.109> with<00:03:17.139> the<00:03:17.409> center<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:18.090> try<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.150> round

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
starting with the center I try and round

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.619 
starting with the center I try and round
that<00:03:20.470> curve<00:03:20.829> how<00:03:21.129> I<00:03:21.160> want<00:03:21.579> it<00:03:21.669> to<00:03:21.760> look<00:03:22.120> when

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
that curve how I want it to look when

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.259 
that curve how I want it to look when
I'm<00:03:22.780> finished<00:03:23.019> or<00:03:23.470> at<00:03:23.560> least<00:03:23.739> close<00:03:23.859> to<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.489> so

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
I'm finished or at least close to it so

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.509 
I'm finished or at least close to it so
that<00:03:25.299> I<00:03:25.480> don't<00:03:25.569> have<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:26.410> try<00:03:26.980> not<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.280> have<00:03:27.459> any

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
you go that's pretty much it and then

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.800 
you go that's pretty much it and then
I'll<00:04:14.379> go<00:04:14.530> back<00:04:14.560> afterwards<00:04:15.370> with<00:04:15.639> my<00:04:15.849> top<00:04:16.479> coat

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810

the tip

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.850 
the tip
and<00:04:26.350> that's<00:04:27.350> just<00:04:27.530> simply<00:04:28.070> um<00:04:29.770> brushing<00:04:30.770> the

Polish right there across the tip and

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
Polish right there across the tip and
that<00:04:37.520> helps<00:04:37.910> if<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:38.210> use<00:04:38.480> a<00:04:39.460> sash<00:04:40.460> such<00:04:41.330> great

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
the shrinkage at the tip but it also

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
so they don't peel so badly because

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.090 
so they don't peel so badly because
whenever<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.480> water<00:05:11.690> gets<00:05:11.990> in<00:05:12.200> to<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.860> tip<00:05:13.070> of

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
water will lift between the layers of

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
it's pretty much a habit for me to

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.820 
it's pretty much a habit for me to
always<00:05:26.150> wrap<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.750> tips<00:05:26.960> of<00:05:27.110> my<00:05:27.170> nail<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:27.470> I<00:05:27.770> do
