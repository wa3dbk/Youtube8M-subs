 positive memories of results 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.640
 important in favor of this place that 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.370
 it became the bunker of the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.200

 very good results including one 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.080
 good for us but obviously 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.479
 you imagine that they will have images and 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.770
 they will be able to remember and comment on what 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.600
 has happened here in the oven 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.200
 Barranquilla clashes in Colombia 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.030
 before our selection partners access 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.009

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.130
 Colombia in Barranquilla where we are 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.420
 been beaten 4 to 0 and 5 to 0 and once in 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.250
 the 97 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.590
 the chinese pereda gave us the victory 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.759
 against Colombia for that match but 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.759
 colombia that you remember the most 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.860
 now 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.439
 of the parties that speak those that we have 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.799
 lost have been the one we won today 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.200
 with fight it was night that's why I tell you 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.660
 there's there is a difference of ten 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.840
 more bravo because of the heat that I did I went to 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.930
 that match of 50 that was calf was 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.870
 guest does not know what it gives in tenor in 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.269
 the stadium the humor did not die down 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.000
 it's hotter still because it's 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.720
 deep the stadium is like a basement 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.310
 it's down 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.110
 I have faith because I believe that this 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.450
 team is more worked hard than it was 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.549
 Freddy comes because you do not know if that 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.010
 authorship or maturana who had problems 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.069
 next the resin grab the equipment not 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.400
 and there it was very difficult for him to 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.739
 arrive and put together a team here is 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.630
 working better in the sense of 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.780
 working with those here remember 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.519
 bolivia puts a team completely of 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.510
 lima and we're going through the background 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.049
 Colombia 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:06.829
 in this way commenting on the match that 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.829
 comes out is 2 to 0 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.099
 had two by the corners were 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.879
 spectacular lucky account that was shot 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.120
 a little but magnificent the criminal 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.120
 executed 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:33.409
 wonderful and that's just from 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.409
 match 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:47.930
 and after that 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.860
 we are knowing by reviewing the s for 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.470
 The luminaries of the World Cup in Mexico 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.280
 wins with colombia 1 to 0 does not hear he says you 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.480
 just qualifying France 98 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.600
 a team of hours that was about 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.190
 to reach the world in this way is that 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.190
 the stick returns a year 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.470
 this went away 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.890
 but the truth and the chemistry 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.150
 víctor hugo aristizábal to get vaccinated 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.080

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.759
 mold 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.300
 I think it looks a lot like 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:56.920
 but this time for the world 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.130
 Korea-Japan 2002 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.140
 solano and his mastery to get the 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.120
 brand of his former partner in bottles 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.979
 oscar porn 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.979
 and define everything as a teacher 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.280
 this was the match 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.050
 notably 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.840
 then we did not deserve that is not the only 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.750
 until his axes columbia in a motive 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.169

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.169

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.110
 and there lifts Colombia rises Colombia 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.600
 to get out of that game and that when 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.630
 a result you do not get it without 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.190
 deserve it and one pulls it forward wants 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.020
 to say that if he does not play well, the 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.090
 luck or else we're going to make it end 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.530
