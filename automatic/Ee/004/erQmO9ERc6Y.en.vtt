00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.579 

the<00:00:00.450> first<00:00:00.690> thing<00:00:00.870> you<00:00:00.989> want<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.199> do<00:00:01.350> when<00:00:01.500> you

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
the first thing you want to do when you

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.020 
the first thing you want to do when you
paint<00:00:01.800> your<00:00:01.890> Chevron<00:00:02.310> well<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.820> measure

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
paint your Chevron well is to measure

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.480 
paint your Chevron well is to measure
the<00:00:03.179> wall<00:00:03.510> across<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.740> up<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.130> down<00:00:05.310> that's

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
the wall across and up and down that's

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.680 
the wall across and up and down that's
how<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:05.700> find<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.089> middle<00:00:06.270> so<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.509> measure

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
how you find the middle so you measure

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.259 
how you find the middle so you measure
across<00:00:06.990> divided<00:00:07.440> by<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.790> measure<00:00:08.790> up<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.150> down

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
across divided by to measure up and down

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.669 
across divided by to measure up and down
divided<00:00:09.570> by<00:00:09.719> two<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:09.960> up<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.260> middle<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.559> the

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
divided by two and up the middle of the

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.280 
divided by two and up the middle of the
wall<00:00:10.860> when<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.490> find<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.910> middle<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.990> mark

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
wall when you find the middle you mark

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.829 
wall when you find the middle you mark
it<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> dot<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.330> that<00:00:15.330> will<00:00:15.540> be<00:00:15.660> your

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
it with the dot and that will be your

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:16.730 
it with the dot and that will be your
starting<00:00:16.049> point

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
starting point

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.769 
starting point
so<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.609> angles<00:00:18.119> will<00:00:18.270> look<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> same<00:00:18.539> at<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
so the angles will look the same at the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.570 
so the angles will look the same at the
top<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.170> bottom<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:19.949> side<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.460> then

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
top and bottom and on the side and then

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.929 
top and bottom and on the side and then
you<00:00:20.670> decide<00:00:21.050> how<00:00:22.050> far<00:00:22.560> apart<00:00:23.100> how<00:00:23.580> big<00:00:23.820> you

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
you decide how far apart how big you

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.220 
you decide how far apart how big you
want<00:00:24.090> your<00:00:24.119> Chevron's<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.900> I'm<00:00:25.019> going<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
want your Chevron's to be I'm going to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.070 
want your Chevron's to be I'm going to
do<00:00:25.380> 10<00:00:25.710> inches<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.029> start<00:00:27.449> from<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.779> dot

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
do 10 inches so you start from your dot

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.389 
do 10 inches so you start from your dot
and<00:00:28.410> then<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.189> measure<00:00:29.720> 10<00:00:30.720> inches<00:00:31.320> up<00:00:31.890> and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and then you measure 10 inches up and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.530 
and then you measure 10 inches up and
down<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.000> then<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.050> draw<00:00:34.290> another<00:00:35.160> dot<00:00:35.540> from

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
down and then you draw another dot from

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.290 
down and then you draw another dot from
that<00:00:36.780> point<00:00:37.200> you're<00:00:37.890> going<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.100> use<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.760> part

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
that point you're going to use this part

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.110 
that point you're going to use this part
of<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.629> level<00:00:42.350> it's<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.500> 45<00:00:44.100> degree<00:00:44.370> angle<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
of a level it's a 45 degree angle and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.389 
of a level it's a 45 degree angle and
from<00:00:45.390> there<00:00:46.160> you're<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.610> go<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
from there you're going to go up and

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.549 
from there you're going to go up and
over<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.570> soon<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.079> little<00:00:52.379> bubble

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
over and as soon as that little bubble

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.819 
over and as soon as that little bubble
gets<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> middle<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:55.140> draw<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.590> line

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
gets in the middle you draw your line

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.250 
gets in the middle you draw your line
again<00:00:56.579> I'm<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.329> these<00:00:57.570> about<00:00:57.960> 10

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
again I'm going to do these about 10

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.750 
again I'm going to do these about 10
inches<00:00:58.440> apart<00:00:58.920> they<00:00:59.129> don't<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
inches apart they don't have to be the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.209 
inches apart they don't have to be the
same<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.300> depends<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.440> kind<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.859> pattern

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
same it depends on what kind of pattern

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.359 
same it depends on what kind of pattern
you<00:01:02.370> want<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:03.629> I'll<00:01:03.780> go<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.680> over<00:01:05.100> 10

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
you want so I'll go up and over 10

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.719 
you want so I'll go up and over 10
inches<00:01:05.850> I'll<00:01:06.659> flip<00:01:07.439> my<00:01:07.470> level<00:01:08.010> over<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.430> this

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
inches I'll flip my level over like this

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.020 
inches I'll flip my level over like this
to<00:01:09.000> make<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.330> level<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.869> ground<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
to make this level with the ground and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.359 
to make this level with the ground and
then<00:01:12.030> I'll<00:01:12.150> go<00:01:12.330> down<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:12.960> over<00:01:13.470> 10<00:01:13.710> inches<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
then I'll go down and over 10 inches and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.660 
then I'll go down and over 10 inches and
you<00:01:15.240> keep<00:01:15.509> doing<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.080> pattern<00:01:16.619> until<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you keep doing this pattern until the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
you keep doing this pattern until the
entire<00:01:18.000> wall<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.540> done<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:18.990> what

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
entire wall is done this is what

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.530 
entire wall is done this is what
probably<00:01:19.860> takes<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> longest<00:01:20.640> part<00:01:20.970> when

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
probably takes the longest part when

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.910 
probably takes the longest part when
you're<00:01:21.659> doing<00:01:21.930> your<00:01:21.960> chevron<00:01:22.470> wall<00:01:22.710> then

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
you're doing your chevron wall then

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.219 
you're doing your chevron wall then
after<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.119> need<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> tape<00:01:24.750> your<00:01:24.990> wall

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
after that you need to tape your wall

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.320 
after that you need to tape your wall
when<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.950> start<00:01:26.250> taping<00:01:26.820> your<00:01:26.909> wall<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.299> have

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
when you start taping your wall you have

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.080 
when you start taping your wall you have
to<00:01:27.540> decide<00:01:28.250> which<00:01:29.250> part<00:01:29.700> you're<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
to decide which part you're going to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.609 
to decide which part you're going to
paint<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.659> which<00:01:30.840> part<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
paint and which part is going to be the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.069 
paint and which part is going to be the
same<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.490> I've<00:01:32.610> decided<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:33.930> I'm

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
same so I've decided that in here I'm

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.890 
same so I've decided that in here I'm
going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> paint<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.310> lighter<00:01:35.610> gray<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.689> when

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
going to paint it a lighter gray so when

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.710 
going to paint it a lighter gray so when
you<00:01:37.020> put<00:01:37.350> your<00:01:37.500> tape<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> wall<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:39.479> want

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you put your tape on the wall you want

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
you put your tape on the wall you want
to<00:01:39.840> make<00:01:40.049> sure<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:41.220> you're<00:01:41.430> going<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.640> cover

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
to make sure that you're going to cover

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.530 
to make sure that you're going to cover
the<00:01:42.810> pencil<00:01:43.409> marks<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.610> made<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.360> make

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the pencil marks that you made to make

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.120 
the pencil marks that you made to make
your<00:01:45.750> line<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.290> you're<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.560> put<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
