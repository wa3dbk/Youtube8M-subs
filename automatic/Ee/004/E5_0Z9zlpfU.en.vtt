press down at the nose it is a little

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.110 
press down at the nose it is a little
bit<00:03:31.530> harder<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.890> do<00:03:32.220> but<00:03:32.550> still<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.090> very

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
bit harder to do but still is very

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.200 
bit harder to do but still is very
doable<00:03:34.430> just<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.520> show<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.060> inside

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
doable just to show you the inside

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.020 
doable just to show you the inside
double<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.020> do<00:03:37.080> believe<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.430> little<00:03:38.730> deeper

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
double I do believe is a little deeper

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.850 
double I do believe is a little deeper
on<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.270> larger<00:03:39.630> size<00:03:39.840> than<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.200> smaller<00:03:40.530> so

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
on the larger size than the smaller so

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.110 
on the larger size than the smaller so
that's<00:03:41.070> why<00:03:41.280> more<00:03:41.490> forces<00:03:42.030> apply<00:03:42.360> now<00:03:43.230> if<00:03:44.120> you

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
that's why more forces apply now if you

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.850 
that's why more forces apply now if you
