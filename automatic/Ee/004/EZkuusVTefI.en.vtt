you<00:00:45.690> know<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> knew<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> game<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you know I knew that the game and the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.270 
you know I knew that the game and the
speculation<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> game<00:00:49.680> being<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.100> much

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
speculation of the game being so much

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
speculation of the game being so much
faster<00:00:50.520> than<00:00:50.969> then<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> was<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> days<00:00:52.230> when

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
faster than then it was in the days when

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.860 
faster than then it was in the days when
I<00:00:52.680> played<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.309> perform<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.510> know<00:00:54.600> peak

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
I played and perform that you know peak

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.639 
I played and perform that you know peak
of<00:00:54.989> my<00:00:55.079> career<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:56.280> was<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.850> much<00:00:57.030> faster

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
of my career and was it that much faster

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.760 
of my career and was it that much faster
the<00:00:58.649> game<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.940> faster<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.199> not<00:01:01.410> so

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the game is is faster but it's not so

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.460 
the game is is faster but it's not so
much<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.940> speed<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.199> players

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
much because of the speed of the players

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.730 
much because of the speed of the players
it's<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> rule<00:01:05.670> changes<00:01:06.740> because

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it's because of the rule changes because

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.690 
it's because of the rule changes because
of<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.189> less<00:01:09.060> obstruction<00:01:09.810> lesser<00:01:10.380> or

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
of the less obstruction lesser or

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.399 
of the less obstruction lesser or
literally<00:01:11.700> no<00:01:11.939> obstruction<00:01:12.540> no<00:01:12.840> holding<00:01:13.260> no

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
literally no obstruction no holding no

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.310

grabbing<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:15.090> taking<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.689> red<00:01:15.900> line<00:01:16.080> out

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
grabbing and taking that red line out

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.380 
grabbing and taking that red line out
you<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.860> opened<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> whole<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.640> surface

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
you really opened the whole I surface

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.810 
you really opened the whole I surface
out<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.900> you're<00:01:19.619> creating<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.369> know<00:01:20.400> some

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
out and you're creating you know some

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.719 
out and you're creating you know some
some<00:01:21.330> plays<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.979> make<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> game<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> faster

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
some plays that make the game is faster

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.740 
some plays that make the game is faster
though<00:01:24.180> clot<00:01:24.570> well<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> certain

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
though clot well I think to a certain

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.620 
though clot well I think to a certain
extent<00:01:28.220> we've<00:01:29.220> opened<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> game<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.299> we

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
extent we've opened the game up we we

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.830 
extent we've opened the game up we we
see<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.500> scoring<00:01:32.159> chances<00:01:32.640> which<00:01:33.030> would<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
see more scoring chances which would the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.649 
see more scoring chances which would the
fans<00:01:34.079> wanted<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
fans wanted to see and I think the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.420 
fans wanted to see and I think the
shootouts<00:01:37.079> are<00:01:37.259> great<00:01:37.530> i'm<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> big<00:01:38.040> shootout

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
shootouts are great i'm a big shootout

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.670 
shootouts are great i'm a big shootout
fan<00:01:38.759> enough<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.329> watch<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.720> guys<00:01:39.900> perform<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
fan enough to watch the guys perform and

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.260 
fan enough to watch the guys perform and
no<00:01:40.740> shootout<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.430> i<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> fans<00:01:42.030> love

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
no shootout and i think the fans love

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.870 
no shootout and i think the fans love
them<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.570> well<00:01:42.950> but<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.159> are<00:01:44.250> certain<00:01:44.549> areas

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
them as well but there are certain areas

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
them as well but there are certain areas
of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.119> game<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.630> think<00:01:45.990> needs<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:47.040> know

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
of the game that I think needs you know

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.889 
of the game that I think needs you know
a<00:01:47.340> little<00:01:47.610> bit<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.970> tweaking<00:01:48.270> yea<00:01:48.659> Pleasant

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
a little bit of tweaking yea Pleasant
