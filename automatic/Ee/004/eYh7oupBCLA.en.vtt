00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:21.369
 ella alejandra ppa is a superman character and the whole south is a teenager 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.589
 7 a country arrives 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.589
 new to which I had never gone 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.520
 and is a girl who faces many and more situations in which in this 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.880
 new country and the day to school and that in three minutes 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.080
 which it is good 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.789
 true but with character 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.580
 saavedra in which closes 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.860
 is not a good girl who has personality that has character and is 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.920
 strong because he has to be strong 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.200
 and is in love as it has to be and nomura 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.370
 hence, at the beginning of April 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.160
 the permanent paranaense center girl 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.670
 good question 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.100
 the exhibition 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.190
 they differ in many things starting with the personality catalina 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.730
 It was a girl who has no personality 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.240
 Catalina was a girl that the voice of her conscience was her best friend 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.939
 and it is sold to the highest bidder that the only thing that matters now is 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.710
 materials and money 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.000
 Alejandra is 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.850
 everything costs catalina is a girl who thinks she has personality that 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.570
 he knows what he wants in life 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.539
 and that faces a world 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.820
 of the place and money so he does not let himself be dazzled by that world of design 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.600
 that's not the most important thing in this life the most important thing is what 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.479
 we have here 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.500
 love him who does not hear catalina 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.060
 For his part, the expert 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.640
 really good 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.600
 online are rich poor parents is the sum of so many good things to 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.119
 my 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.330
 this is my first leading role as exclusive to the chain 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.200
 percent is a presumptive is a totally different novel without breasts there is no 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.100
 paradise 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.329
 is a totally different character to catalina with him 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.719
 a great cast 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.240
 with great friends like with great directors good adds 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.859
 Dende a person that I really admire 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.509
 and not because he's my boyfriend but I really admire him a lot as a professional 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.319
 sebastiÃ¡n I'm going to be my 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.319
 sole protagonist and I really admire him a lot as a professional 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.639
 when I finished the novel we got married 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.280
 the hand to try to reach my love 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.439
 has made reference to practicing actions is related to the subject to the maximum 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.370
 zavala and complements really found a person that mcqueen that who can 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.560
 go to go hand in hand with that person 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.660
 building many things we have many professional affinities 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:38.539
 and at the level 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:39.670
 personal 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.409
 i and this and that has been super super rich like 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.370
 how to find a person who has your own are these same ideals to the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.480
 then the rich man's life because we are building a relationship 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.699
 too much passion and anti anti papa papa feeling 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.699
 up to kaka I think that 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.590
 the bread at the economic level are really allocated huge advantage 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.070
 but I think that 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.159
 they are teenagers 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.069
 and I think that when you are at that age, we are more bears, I do not know if 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.679
 only be disaster 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:11.570
 but one 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.140
 has the ability to choose if I'm going astray or if I do not 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.379
 I can pass 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.080
 I can be remembered as a low-income person posing very poor 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.150
 without which he presents many things but I have been like that 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.300
 I'm going down that road but also homeland a lot of money and being in 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.109
 March but it's party 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.150
 with many friends who are offering me drugs but can also 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:37.069
 choose their children and I do not think that 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.160
 in this sense that if we talk about that 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.499
 they would be on equal terms I think that 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.479
 you are free to choose which path to choose 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.529
 I tried to do the best 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.589
 I'm at least three years old 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:54.810
 I never expected five kilos can say really express what I feel 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.479
 I do not stay silent 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:59.679
 when I feel something I really do not prefer to say things as they are 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:03.789
 and I hope in my time when it will also be spoken to be our evening 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:06.869
 You must take them along the right path 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.869
 fleitas to the bases to your children and your children 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.309
 they are surrounded by so many people 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.639
 When you gave him those empty hands, he asked, I think they 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.250
 are in the ability to choose and if these good bases do not think that according to 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:22.509
 go the wrong way 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.930
 I think they're going to have more personality enough to choose where they're going 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.610
 and I hope to be a great pampering mom like that 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.279
 love to kaka 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.580
 to youth the treasury as council 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.330
 principal who has a lot of communication with parents really 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.409
 the primordial term sometimes we get carried away by friends for 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:43.650
 bad influences 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.070
 even by what we see on television because of what we read in the 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.780
 they do newspapers or magazines but I think it is very good to have 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.409
 great communication with parents and also parents 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.050
 but with an open heart to have a great communication with your children to 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.510
 times 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.380
 the dads for being so busy in their jobs 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.740
 in the day to day they forget their children and I think that you have to have a 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.719
 space 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:07.319
 and the child has to 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:08.880
 you have to educate it is the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.380
 the first moment many dads are born after many times that 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.840
 they wait for the children to be 15 years old 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.440
 to talk with their children 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.380
 I think so 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.639
 since you were little you had your son open your heart 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.490
 read great confidence 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.050
 I believe that instead of strengthening a great relationship between 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.009
 Socrates 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.090
 super fundamental I believe that it will be a great success because it is 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.520
 a super nice story you really love is a story for 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.370
 for small and for big and paraguay 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.490
 really that they will be able to sit the big ones and the teenagers to see the 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.970
 No novel that a great story that you have not damaged soon when you listen 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:47.770
 things 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.009
 today on stage 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.529
 on the contrary to the contrary that they are there with the children and 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.639
 explaining many, many things that will happen because they touch 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.020
 very strong topics 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.339
 that more sells sex violations of rules 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:05.270
 but not only the teenagers also the parents 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.919
 so I think it's going to be a big success because that's also why there's a 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.029
 cast 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:15.840
 a sign there is a beautiful cast there are children nor the two beautiful girls 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.720
 and a great talent at the common pastoral level too, with great leadership 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.460
 with a large production 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.290
 and the best thing is that we are doing everything with all the love and the 14 hours 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:27.680
 for savater pancita
