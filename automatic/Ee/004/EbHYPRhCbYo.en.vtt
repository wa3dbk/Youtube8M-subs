00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
shingles though and then the next day

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.110 
shingles though and then the next day
when<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> woke<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.640> used<00:00:32.850> too<00:00:32.940> much

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
when I woke up I think I used too much

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.520 
when I woke up I think I used too much
job<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.809> last<00:00:34.050> time<00:00:34.340> because<00:00:36.260> yeah<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.410> was

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
job this last time because yeah it was

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.770 
job this last time because yeah it was
just<00:00:37.710> way<00:00:37.829> too<00:00:37.890> much<00:00:38.100> Joe<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
just way too much Joe it it was like a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.260 
just way too much Joe it it was like a
mess<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.770> I'm<00:00:41.190> gonna<00:00:41.340> try<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.700> again<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.210> I

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
mess so I'm gonna try it again and I

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
mess so I'm gonna try it again and I
think<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.570> has<00:00:42.690> something<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
think it has something to do with the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.790 
think it has something to do with the
fact<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.600> gel<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.079> used<00:00:46.379> I've<00:00:46.620> had

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
fact that the gel that I used I've had

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.270 
fact that the gel that I used I've had
for<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.550> too<00:00:47.610> long<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.469> olive<00:00:49.739> oil<00:00:49.829> i<00:00:50.100> use

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
for way too long so the olive oil i use

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.189 
for way too long so the olive oil i use
i<00:00:50.309> had<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> long<00:00:50.700> time<00:00:50.969> too<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.570> crystal

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
i had a long time too but the crystal

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.900 
i had a long time too but the crystal
that<00:00:52.260> i<00:00:52.379> had<00:00:52.559> I've<00:00:52.800> had<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.100> way<00:00:53.219> too<00:00:53.280> long<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
that i had I've had it way too long and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.299 
that i had I've had it way too long and
I<00:00:53.969> think<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.270> wasn't<00:00:54.870> yeah<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.010> was

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
I think it just wasn't yeah it just was

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.510 
I think it just wasn't yeah it just was
too<00:00:56.340> much<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.539> I'll<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.739> again<00:00:58.920> at

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
too much so I'll have to do it again at

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.459 
too much so I'll have to do it again at
the<00:00:59.699> end<00:00:59.730> of<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.210> coming<00:01:00.629> week<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.440> I
