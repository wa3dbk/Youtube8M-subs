towards<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.820> end<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.120> month<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.800> believe<00:02:31.800> I

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
towards the end of the month I believe I

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.530 
towards the end of the month I believe I
read<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.340> somewhere<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.240> yeah<00:02:33.390> definitely

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
read that somewhere so yeah definitely

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.690 
read that somewhere so yeah definitely
keep<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.990> lookout<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:34.380> those<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:35.280> obviously

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
keep a lookout for those but obviously

keep a lookout for those but obviously
both<00:02:36.270> trees<00:02:36.600> are<00:02:36.870> going<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.170> sell<00:02:37.350> out<00:02:37.380> because

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
both trees are going to sell out because

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.370
