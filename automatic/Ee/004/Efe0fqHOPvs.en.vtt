we're<00:00:14.800> gonna<00:00:14.920> begin<00:00:15.309> lesson<00:00:15.790> 9<00:00:15.970> with<00:00:16.180> some

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
we're gonna begin lesson 9 with some

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.390 
we're gonna begin lesson 9 with some
repeated<00:00:16.690> concepts<00:00:17.380> we're<00:00:18.010> gonna<00:00:18.100> play<00:00:18.369> a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
repeated concepts we're gonna play a

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.280 
repeated concepts we're gonna play a
chord<00:00:18.850> progression<00:00:18.910> you've<00:00:19.540> already<00:00:19.810> seen

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
chord progression you've already seen

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.940 
chord progression you've already seen
before

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
before

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.370 
before
with<00:00:21.279> a<00:00:21.310> split<00:00:21.850> hand<00:00:22.180> exercise<00:00:22.930> you've

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
with a split hand exercise you've

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.780 
with a split hand exercise you've
already<00:00:23.650> seen<00:00:24.130> before

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
already seen before

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.330 
already seen before
this<00:00:25.240> again<00:00:25.630> is<00:00:25.869> great<00:00:26.230> roll<00:00:26.619> preparation

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
this again is great roll preparation

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.130 
this again is great roll preparation
because<00:00:27.759> it<00:00:28.090> gets<00:00:28.300> you<00:00:28.420> playing<00:00:28.660> different

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
because it gets you playing different

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.470 
because it gets you playing different
notes<00:00:29.169> at<00:00:29.680> a<00:00:29.740> faster<00:00:30.369> stroke<00:00:30.699> with<00:00:31.150> some

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
notes at a faster stroke with some

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.450 
notes at a faster stroke with some
independence<00:00:32.260> and<00:00:32.590> its<00:00:33.040> really<00:00:33.280> good<00:00:33.430> to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
independence and its really good to

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.640 
independence and its really good to
practice<00:00:33.699> this<00:00:34.180> slow<00:00:34.540> and<00:00:34.870> move<00:00:35.140> up<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.379> the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
practice this slow and move up to the

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.410 
practice this slow and move up to the
highest<00:00:35.860> tempo<00:00:36.370> on<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.610> progress<00:00:36.879> chart

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
highest tempo on the progress chart

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.299 
highest tempo on the progress chart
because<00:00:38.019> it's<00:00:38.170> really<00:00:38.379> preparing<00:00:38.830> you<00:00:39.070> to

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
because it's really preparing you to

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.780 
because it's really preparing you to
play<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.580> future<00:00:40.059> role<00:00:40.330> or<00:00:40.629> a<00:00:40.690> future<00:00:41.080> chorale

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
play a future role or a future chorale

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.520 
play a future role or a future chorale
this<00:00:42.790> is<00:00:42.970> what<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.239> first<00:00:43.449> four<00:00:43.870> bars<00:00:44.080> of<00:00:44.260> this

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
this is what the first four bars of this

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:59.250 
this is what the first four bars of this
look<00:00:44.769> like<00:00:57.150> again<00:00:58.150> these<00:00:58.390> concepts<00:00:58.930> are<00:00:59.049> not

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
look like again these concepts are not

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.500 
look like again these concepts are not
new<00:00:59.559> you've<00:00:59.949> done<00:01:00.159> this<00:01:00.280> before<00:01:00.489> we're<00:01:01.269> just

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
new you've done this before we're just

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.240 
new you've done this before we're just
putting<00:01:01.750> it<00:01:01.989> into<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.320> new<00:01:02.680> kind<00:01:03.129> of

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
putting it into a new kind of

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.550 
putting it into a new kind of
combination<00:01:04.150> that<00:01:04.420> helps<00:01:05.019> prepare<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.530> for

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
combination that helps prepare you for

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.430 
combination that helps prepare you for
future<00:01:05.770> literature<00:01:06.490> this<00:01:07.360> next<00:01:07.869> exercise<00:01:08.020> is

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
future literature this next exercise is

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.740 
future literature this next exercise is
the<00:01:09.010> same<00:01:09.310> thing<00:01:09.700> you've<00:01:10.090> seen<00:01:10.479> this

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
the same thing you've seen this

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.960 
the same thing you've seen this
progression<00:01:11.200> before<00:01:11.710> it's<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.460> exercise

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
progression before it's the exercise

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.359 
progression before it's the exercise
where<00:01:13.270> we<00:01:13.390> worked<00:01:13.600> on<00:01:13.810> root<00:01:14.080> position<00:01:14.369> first

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
where we worked on root position first

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.250 
where we worked on root position first
inversion<00:01:15.880> chords<00:01:16.270> back<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.869> root<00:01:17.080> position

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
inversion chords back to root position

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.130 
inversion chords back to root position
and<00:01:17.799> second<00:01:18.430> inversion<00:01:18.700> chords<00:01:19.270> so<00:01:19.870> you<00:01:19.900> need

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
and second inversion chords so you need

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.220 
and second inversion chords so you need
to<00:01:20.320> jump<00:01:20.800> from<00:01:21.310> one<00:01:21.550> chord<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.360> other<00:01:22.510> but

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
to jump from one chord to the other but

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.260 
to jump from one chord to the other but
instead<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.740> playing<00:01:24.040> unison<00:01:24.820> double

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
instead of playing unison double

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.180 
instead of playing unison double
verticals<00:01:25.690> you're<00:01:26.200> now<00:01:26.410> going<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.710> split<00:01:27.070> it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
verticals you're now going to split it

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.400 
verticals you're now going to split it
between<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.700> hands<00:01:28.180> this<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:28.840> what<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.230> first

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
between the hands this is what the first

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:43.410 
between the hands this is what the first
four<00:01:29.710> bars<00:01:29.860> of<00:01:30.040> this<00:01:30.370> exercise<00:01:30.940> looks<00:01:31.330> like

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.749 

the<00:01:44.420> one<00:01:44.659> difference<00:01:45.259> when<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.680> split<00:01:46.130> hands

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
the one difference when you split hands

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.870 
the one difference when you split hands
in<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.000> exercise<00:01:47.420> is<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:48.200> one<00:01:48.920> hand<00:01:49.310> has<00:01:49.640> to

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
in this exercise is that one hand has to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.389 
in this exercise is that one hand has to
prepare<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.720> next<00:01:50.960> chord<00:01:51.380> before<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:52.250> other

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
prepare the next chord before the other

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.440 
prepare the next chord before the other
one<00:01:52.670> is<00:01:52.850> finished

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
one is finished

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.570 
one is finished
previously<00:01:54.229> when<00:01:54.590> both<00:01:54.860> hands<00:01:55.189> were<00:01:55.399> in

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
previously when both hands were in

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.719 
previously when both hands were in
unison<00:01:56.210> they<00:01:56.780> moved<00:01:57.049> at<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.259> same<00:01:57.710> time<00:01:58.159> to

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
unison they moved at the same time to

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.600 
unison they moved at the same time to
prepare<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.330> next<00:01:59.479> chord<00:01:59.899> now<00:02:00.680> your<00:02:01.250> left

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
prepare the next chord now your left

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.969 
prepare the next chord now your left
hand<00:02:01.909> will<00:02:02.090> finish<00:02:02.360> slightly<00:02:02.990> ahead<00:02:03.200> of<00:02:03.770> your

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
hand will finish slightly ahead of your

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.710 
hand will finish slightly ahead of your
right<00:02:04.220> hand<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:04.909> needs<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.509> begin

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
right hand and it needs to begin

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.309 
right hand and it needs to begin
preparing<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:07.070> next<00:02:07.280> note<00:02:07.869> before<00:02:08.869> your

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
preparing the next note before your

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.199 
preparing the next note before your
right<00:02:09.619> hand<00:02:09.950> this<00:02:10.459> is<00:02:10.610> going<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.819> require<00:02:11.150> a

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
right hand this is going to require a

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.120 
right hand this is going to require a
little<00:02:11.480> bit<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.780> independence<00:02:12.530> but<00:02:13.010> it's

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
little bit of independence but it's

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.220 
little bit of independence but it's
necessary<00:02:13.819> in<00:02:14.120> order<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.569> ensure<00:02:14.930> your

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
necessary in order to ensure your

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.320 
necessary in order to ensure your
accuracy<00:02:15.709> here's<00:02:16.580> what<00:02:16.819> this<00:02:16.940> looks<00:02:17.000> like

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
accuracy here's what this looks like

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:33.670 
accuracy here's what this looks like
between<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.989> first<00:02:18.319> two<00:02:18.590> chords<00:02:32.560> when<00:02:33.560> you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
between the first two chords when you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.860 
between the first two chords when you
play<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.100> exercise<00:02:34.640> at<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:34.880> faster<00:02:35.390> tempo<00:02:35.600> you

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
play this exercise at a faster tempo you

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.530 
play this exercise at a faster tempo you
may<00:02:36.200> not<00:02:36.410> notice<00:02:36.739> that<00:02:37.239> exaggerated<00:02:38.239> of

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
may not notice that exaggerated of

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.539 
may not notice that exaggerated of
emotion<00:02:39.049> when<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.380> comes<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.860> preparing<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
emotion when it comes to preparing the

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.170 
emotion when it comes to preparing the
next<00:02:40.700> note<00:02:41.060> however<00:02:42.220> accuracy<00:02:43.220> issues<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:43.940> the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
next note however accuracy issues in the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.440 
next note however accuracy issues in the
future<00:02:44.630> can<00:02:44.989> be<00:02:45.019> directly<00:02:45.680> related<00:02:45.980> to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
future can be directly related to

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.180 
future can be directly related to
understanding<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.630> preparation<00:02:48.260> concept

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
understanding this preparation concept

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.360 
understanding this preparation concept
if<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.970> are<00:02:50.120> not<00:02:50.420> preparing<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.769> next<00:02:52.100> notes

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
if you are not preparing the next notes

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.940 
if you are not preparing the next notes
you<00:02:52.579> play<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:53.180> are<00:02:53.299> much<00:02:53.690> more<00:02:53.989> likely<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.560> be

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
you play you are much more likely to be

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.190 
you play you are much more likely to be
inaccurate<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:56.299> it's<00:02:56.450> really<00:02:56.630> important<00:02:57.079> that

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
inaccurate so it's really important that

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.620 
inaccurate so it's really important that
you<00:02:57.290> understand<00:02:57.799> this<00:02:57.980> concept<00:02:58.250> now<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:59.359> does

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
you understand this concept now it does

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.270 
you understand this concept now it does
require<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.109> little<00:03:00.410> bit<00:03:00.650> of<00:03:00.739> jumping<00:03:01.160> around

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
require a little bit of jumping around

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.060 
require a little bit of jumping around
the<00:03:01.549> keyboard<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.299> some<00:03:02.840> independence<00:03:03.530> but

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
the keyboard and some independence but

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.289 
the keyboard and some independence but
it's<00:03:04.220> really<00:03:04.489> important<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.060> you

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
it's really important that you

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.620 
it's really important that you
understand<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.200> whole<00:03:06.410> concept<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:07.570> want<00:03:08.570> you

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
understand the whole concept I want you

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.630 
understand the whole concept I want you
to<00:03:08.750> start<00:03:09.049> at<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.410> slowest<00:03:09.859> tempo<00:03:10.280> when<00:03:10.549> you

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
to start at the slowest tempo when you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.060 
to start at the slowest tempo when you
do<00:03:10.820> both<00:03:11.000> of<00:03:11.060> these<00:03:11.390> exercises<00:03:12.079> it's<00:03:12.829> also

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
do both of these exercises it's also

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.250 
do both of these exercises it's also
really<00:03:13.430> beneficial<00:03:14.090> once<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:15.049> feel

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
really beneficial once you feel

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
to start with the right hand sometimes

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.880

when<00:03:20.209> we<00:03:20.299> play<00:03:20.540> our<00:03:20.690> Corral's<00:03:21.140> in<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.530> future

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
when we play our Corral's in the future

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.830 
when we play our Corral's in the future
we<00:03:22.489> begin<00:03:22.850> with<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.120> right<00:03:23.359> hand<00:03:23.570> if<00:03:23.720> the

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
we begin with the right hand if the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.660 
we begin with the right hand if the
melody<00:03:24.079> line<00:03:24.470> happens<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.130> be<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.459> right
