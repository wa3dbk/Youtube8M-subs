so we've biased our stake in so that if

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.289 
so we've biased our stake in so that if
two<00:04:09.470> horses<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:09.949> place<00:04:10.280> which<00:04:10.549> include<00:04:11.000> them

two horses a place which include them
horse<00:04:11.659> number<00:04:11.900> one<00:04:12.199> we<00:04:12.739> almost<00:04:12.949> break<00:04:13.519> even

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.330 

we<00:04:17.060> have<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.269> little<00:04:17.630> bit<00:04:17.780> more<00:04:17.959> pay<00:04:18.320> out<00:04:18.470> if

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
we have a little bit more pay out if

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.870 
we have a little bit more pay out if
it's<00:04:19.880> placed<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.630> two<00:04:21.110> others<00:04:21.410> are<00:04:21.530> placed<00:04:21.880> so

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
it's placed and two others are placed so

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.280 
it's placed and two others are placed so
he<00:04:23.180> can<00:04:23.570> basis<00:04:24.050> taking<00:04:25.030> fought<00:04:26.030> against<00:04:26.750> just

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
he can basis taking fought against just

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.530 
he can basis taking fought against just
the<00:04:27.470> first<00:04:27.710> sauce<00:04:28.040> I<00:04:28.340> can't<00:04:28.940> do<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.150> for<00:04:29.390> more

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
the first sauce I can't do it for more

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.050 
the first sauce I can't do it for more
more<00:04:30.080> horses<00:04:30.620> down<00:04:30.980> there<00:04:31.310> because<00:04:31.700> the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
more horses down there because the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.690 
more horses down there because the
combination<00:04:32.780> of<00:04:32.900> steaks<00:04:33.440> will<00:04:34.100> be<00:04:34.250> far<00:04:34.460> too

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
combination of steaks will be far too

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.130 
combination of steaks will be far too
large<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.360> we<00:04:35.450> will<00:04:35.600> need<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:35.780> much<00:04:36.110> bigger

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
large and we will need a much bigger

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.110 
large and we will need a much bigger
display<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:37.190> cover<00:04:37.400> all<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.730> different

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
display to cover all the different

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.110 
display to cover all the different
combinations<00:04:38.810> of<00:04:38.810> steaks<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:40.550> that's<00:04:40.880> why<00:04:41.060> I

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
combinations of steaks so that's why I

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.890 
combinations of steaks so that's why I
can<00:04:41.330> only<00:04:41.510> do<00:04:42.260> an<00:04:42.410> adjustment<00:04:42.830> for<00:04:43.070> one<00:04:43.340> horse

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
can only do an adjustment for one horse

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.800 
can only do an adjustment for one horse
so<00:04:44.900> if<00:04:45.740> we<00:04:45.880> saw<00:04:46.880> that's<00:04:47.090> what<00:04:47.240> happens<00:04:47.570> if<00:04:47.690> we

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
so if we saw that's what happens if we

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.460 
so if we saw that's what happens if we
put<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.020> positive<00:04:49.180> figure<00:04:50.180> in<00:04:50.330> there<00:04:50.570> you<00:04:51.260> can

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
put a positive figure in there you can

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.000 
put a positive figure in there you can
work<00:04:52.310> too<00:04:52.670> if<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:53.390> will<00:04:54.230> Lane<00:04:54.440> some<00:04:54.710> horses

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
work too if you will Lane some horses

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.120 
work too if you will Lane some horses
and<00:04:55.670> you've<00:04:55.850> pretty<00:04:56.660> much<00:04:56.780> fancied<00:04:57.470> that<00:04:57.680> that

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
and you've pretty much fancied that that

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.660 
and you've pretty much fancied that that
first<00:04:59.030> horse<00:04:59.480> may<00:04:59.960> get<00:05:00.230> placed<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:01.310> might<00:05:01.520> not

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
first horse may get placed you might not

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.020 
first horse may get placed you might not
want<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:02.030> have<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.860> pay<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:03.920> much<00:05:04.130> out<00:05:04.460> on<00:05:04.670> it<00:05:04.790> so

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
want to have to pay so much out on it so

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.090 
want to have to pay so much out on it so
he<00:05:05.150> could<00:05:05.180> buy<00:05:05.540> she's<00:05:05.840> taking<00:05:06.410> so<00:05:06.950> they

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
he could buy she's taking so they

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.000 
he could buy she's taking so they
wouldn't<00:05:07.310> break<00:05:07.610> even<00:05:08.060> or<00:05:08.860> people-<00:05:09.860> in<00:05:11.830> if<00:05:12.830> you

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
wouldn't break even or people- in if you

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.620 
wouldn't break even or people- in if you
thought<00:05:13.190> it<00:05:13.370> would<00:05:13.490> get<00:05:13.700> if<00:05:14.090> you<00:05:14.270> thought<00:05:14.480> it

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
thought it would get if you thought it

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.660 
thought it would get if you thought it
would<00:05:14.690> get<00:05:14.810> blessed<00:05:15.200> he<00:05:15.620> could<00:05:15.860> die<00:05:16.430> she

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
would get blessed he could die she

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.760 
would get blessed he could die she
staying<00:05:16.970> so<00:05:17.300> that<00:05:17.450> if<00:05:17.690> it<00:05:17.870> did<00:05:18.080> get<00:05:18.230> place<00:05:18.560> you

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
staying so that if it did get place you

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.860 
staying so that if it did get place you
would<00:05:18.890> make<00:05:19.070> a<00:05:19.100> bigger<00:05:19.430> profit<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:20.090> then<00:05:20.330> the

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
would make a bigger profit and then the

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.050 
would make a bigger profit and then the
profit<00:05:21.260> on<00:05:21.320> it<00:05:21.350> that<00:05:21.590> is<00:05:21.740> six<00:05:21.980> pound<00:05:22.280> 39<00:05:22.910> if

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
profit on it that is six pound 39 if

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.560 
profit on it that is six pound 39 if
it's<00:05:23.210> placed<00:05:23.510> with<00:05:23.690> one<00:05:23.870> other<00:05:23.990> horse<00:05:24.350> but<00:05:25.220> if

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
it's placed with one other horse but if

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.910 
it's placed with one other horse but if
so<00:05:26.570> other<00:05:26.750> horses<00:05:27.080> are<00:05:27.320> placed<00:05:27.620> from<00:05:27.740> the

successful you're doing any place horses
that<00:06:00.350> is<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:00.740> amount<00:06:00.980> that<00:06:01.130> you<00:06:01.310> wind<00:06:01.520> down

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
that is the amount that you wind down

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.110 
that is the amount that you wind down
there<00:06:02.290> all<00:06:03.290> y'all<00:06:03.590> so<00:06:03.800> Blaire's<00:06:04.280> successful

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
there all y'all so Blaire's successful

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.310 
there all y'all so Blaire's successful
so<00:06:05.390> you<00:06:05.570> clean<00:06:06.260> up<00:06:06.290> with<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:08.330> amount<00:06:08.570> total

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
so you clean up with the amount total
