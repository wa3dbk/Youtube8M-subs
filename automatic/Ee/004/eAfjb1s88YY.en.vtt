00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.320
 hi today I present a tutorial on how 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.610
 prepare a pastry circle 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.830
 using a simple sheet in 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.830
 aluminum proceeds in this way 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:38.400
 stay well on the sheet and explain it in 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.400
 this way 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.700
 I stick well then turn and do 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.700
 another daughter 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.170
 tour epic cures again 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:16.560
 runs 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.560
 and I make the last pyre 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.370
 I take a circle because in this 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.170
 so you can see better the 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.120
 procedure but you can anyway 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.080
 also use as one said 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.400
 Local casserole anything 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:18.410
 cylindrical shape then the roll la 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:23.390
 strip and with a marker pen the 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:27.410
 measure with the most cutting scissors 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:36.290
 abundant about 4 centimeters 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:40.630
 I join the two ends, lap and cut 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.630
 in the center for two centimeters 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.970
 turns around the circle again then 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:58.340
 I join the two ends impesting the al 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:04:00.460
 center where I made the cut in this 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.460
 way 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:12.450
 I make it stick well to give it the shape 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:22.530
 right more precise possible throw 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:25.610
 the two fins then nestle and one is the 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.610
 pivot upwards 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:39.909
 then fold the other backwards 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.850
 to block 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:05:01.279
 near well turn and cut this in here 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:05:04.419
 excess toy a circle I do the same 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:07.069
 something also inside then I go towards 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.400
 this case down 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.400
 a line 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.479
 and the other above 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:34.310
 cutting access is the circle is ready 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.460
 how it looks and is taken to make it 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.879
 more rigid it is similar to this in steel 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.650
 it can be inserted before the last fold 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:45.110
 a cardboard cut to size 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.509
 logically for cold use 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.210
 so it's in the fridge while if you are 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:52.129
 must use in the oven instead of 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:06:00.830
 folding a simple sheet will fold it 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:06:03.759
 2 putting one on top of the other thanks to 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.759
 next tutorial hello
