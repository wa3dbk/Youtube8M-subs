00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.350
 hello friends and friends 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.950
 from the area we are going to make a book 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.820
 titled my first book 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.440
 we work with a folio 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.440
 that we double in half 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.920
 and taking the precaution of leaving the 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.330
 part open down we double 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.330
 again in half 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 and each of the faces at his side 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.910
 I actually call it a folding book 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.500
 but it's a strange name 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.780
 then good 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.940
 we'll schedule the first book because it 's 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.740
 the first one we started with 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.329
 function 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.269
 you have to be careful 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.120
 to leave this the first sheet so that 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.510
 be the cover 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.530
 here we will put cover 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.750
 we open this we leave it free 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.750
 here I will put a presentation p 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.150
 and the knot 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.990
 outcome 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.380
 presentation and outcome then it is like this 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:23.619
 drop down can stand up 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.619
 you can even open two examples 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.360
 here we have one 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.360
 the girl and the fairy 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.820
 with its decoration and its brightness 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.820
 in the presentation 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.290
 and the outcome if the story was very 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.610
 long could continue here and still 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.610
 we would have two more sheets 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.299
 he has nothing inside him 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.850
 but this other 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.850
 the girl Rachel 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.110
 for his presentation 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.550
 your elongated knot 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.550
 here as I said before 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.229
 and then inside 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.770
 this comic that can be an illustration 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.840
 or it can be just that a comic 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.840
 Well I hope you liked it
