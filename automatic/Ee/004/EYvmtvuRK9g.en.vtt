not<00:01:14.850> stable<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:16.140> reason<00:01:16.410> for<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.650> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
not stable the reason for this is

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.580 
not stable the reason for this is
because<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.280> range<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.670> set<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.910> auto<00:01:18.290> if<00:01:19.290> set

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
because the range is set to auto if set

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.660 
because the range is set to auto if set
to<00:01:19.710> auto<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.070> power<00:01:20.310> meter<00:01:20.520> will

to auto the power meter will

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.950 
to auto the power meter will
automatically<00:01:21.150> determine<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.480> best<00:01:21.630> signal

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
automatically determine the best signal

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.690 
automatically determine the best signal

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
range based on the measured signal level

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
range based on the measured signal level
we<00:01:24.420> should<00:01:24.630> set<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.810> signal<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.230> the<00:01:25.380> right

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
we should set the signal to the right

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.200 
we should set the signal to the right
range<00:01:25.770> where<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> signal<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:26.880> saturated

range where the signal is not saturated

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
range where the signal is not saturated

reading<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.450> still<00:01:43.630> stable<00:01:43.840> now<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.860> reason

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
reading is still stable now the reason

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.410 
reading is still stable now the reason
for<00:01:45.369> this<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.670> because<00:01:45.700> of<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.149> digital

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
for this is because of the digital

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.710 
for this is because of the digital

the data with a predefined time window
and<00:02:49.250> we'll<00:02:49.340> take<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.610> difference<00:02:49.910> between
