00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 and good rugby is one of the sports 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.400
 more rough and dangerous than as the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.200
 British saying is a game of villains 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.820
 played by gentlemen but in the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.820
 Savior does not play knights but 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.190
 some young girls who give everything for 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.460
 the whole in order to be successful in this 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.490
 Sport and Samuel Arias explains 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.490
 there will be nothing nothing they are disciplined 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.669
 fast 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.290
 strong followed and do not care in not 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.090
 be it is about the first 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.250
 Salvadorans who are practicing 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.350
 rugby the greatest European sport 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.079
 danger due to contact between 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.510
 players the woman was made for 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.760
 any sport is truly a 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.420
 very nice sport for any of 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.420
 the two genres 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.430
 and that unlike other sports of 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.650
 contact here no protectors are used 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.900
 to advance with the ball and knock down the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.430
 opponent is that everything is played with the 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.010
 ball passing it back 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.840
 many people relate it to football 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.300
 American but it 's very different in the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.130
 only protection that only allows 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.100
 the mouth guard and it's a sport 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.090
 pretty rough it takes a lot 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.369
 courage and enough courage to play it 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.619
 and courage what they are demonstrating the most 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.630
 these girls who should forget 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.729
 of feminine manners and care 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.619
 of the skin since the ground where 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.469
 play in this winter season is 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.719
 completely slippery because we have the 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.090
 attention because you need a big 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.039
 discipline is not allowed a hit with the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.270
 deliberately closed fist of lopez 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.829
 from the chest down can you 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.090
 hug the chest from the waist of the 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.090
 Mules or knee 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.140
 that's why almost every encounter 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.950
 it's always a player 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.950
 rugged 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.790
 we had surroundings in costa rica one leg 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.009
 broken a tibia and some of them already 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.690
 they are highlighting as sprinters a 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.530
 key quality that makes them win

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.650
 lake for 10 years and rbs the last 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.450
 to adopt 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.190
 in the end they have earned respect and 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.230
 admiration of the public 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.580
 Knowing that they are the first women 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.920
 who have dared to break the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.670
 paradigms that only man could 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.110
