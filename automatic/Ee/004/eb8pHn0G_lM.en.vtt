iPhone<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.209> definitely<00:02:24.900> say<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.470> if<00:02:25.590> you're<00:02:25.800> a

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000

iPhone I definitely say that if you're a
DSLR<00:02:27.000> shooter<00:02:27.390> who's<00:02:27.780> looking<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.350> smaller

camera that they can use as a walk
around<00:02:31.380> lens<00:02:31.590> or<00:02:31.860> when<00:02:32.040> they're<00:02:32.130> not<00:02:32.340> working

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670

the<00:02:33.600> Sony<00:02:33.900> rx100<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.950> probably<00:02:35.370> one<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.610> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
the Sony rx100 is probably one of the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.090 
the Sony rx100 is probably one of the
best<00:02:36.030> choices<00:02:36.390> I've<00:02:37.020> tested<00:02:37.500> out<00:02:37.590> multiple

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
best choices I've tested out multiple

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.710 
best choices I've tested out multiple
high<00:02:38.370> end<00:02:38.580> point<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:38.970> shoot<00:02:39.120> cameras<00:02:39.570> and

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
high end point and shoot cameras and

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.900 
high end point and shoot cameras and
this<00:02:40.050> one<00:02:40.260> by<00:02:40.470> far<00:02:40.770> blows<00:02:41.250> everything<00:02:41.610> out<00:02:41.850> of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
this one by far blows everything out of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.180 
this one by far blows everything out of
the<00:02:42.000> water
