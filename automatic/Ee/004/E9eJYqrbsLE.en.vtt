00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
try to make sure that the back is what I

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.950 
try to make sure that the back is what I
keep<00:00:37.530> short<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> keep<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.180> short<00:00:39.450> until

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
keep short so I keep this short until

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080 
keep short so I keep this short until
the<00:00:40.050> sides<00:00:40.350> start<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.860> fill<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.250> once<00:00:41.850> those

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the sides start to fill in once those

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.270 
the sides start to fill in once those
sides<00:00:42.390> fill<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.870> which<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.410> take<00:00:43.649> does<00:00:44.040> take<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
sides fill in which do take does take a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.639 
sides fill in which do take does take a
lot<00:00:44.489> longer<00:00:44.670> than<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> back<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.379> start

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
lot longer than the back then we start

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.160 
lot longer than the back then we start
letting<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> back<00:00:47.280> fill<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.870> also<00:00:48.870> whenever

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
letting the back fill in also whenever

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930 
letting the back fill in also whenever
you're<00:00:49.440> trying<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.739> grow<00:00:49.920> out<00:00:50.070> layers<00:00:50.309> same

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
you're trying to grow out layers same

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.010 
you're trying to grow out layers same
thing<00:00:51.210> you're<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.570> want<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.840> keep<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
thing you're going to want to keep that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.229 
thing you're going to want to keep that
perimeter<00:00:52.410> length<00:00:52.829> fairly<00:00:53.430> stationary<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
perimeter length fairly stationary and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.380 
perimeter length fairly stationary and
just<00:00:54.960> let<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.440> continue<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.399> grow<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.730> just

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
just let this continue to grow out just

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.439 
just let this continue to grow out just
remember<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.989> width<00:00:58.199> length<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> enemy

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
remember that width length is the enemy

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.880 
remember that width length is the enemy
of<00:01:00.480> volume<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.199> you're<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
of volume so you're not going to have a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
of volume so you're not going to have a
lot<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.160> big<00:01:02.460> hair<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.000> you've<00:01:03.420> got<00:01:03.449> long<00:01:03.930> hair
