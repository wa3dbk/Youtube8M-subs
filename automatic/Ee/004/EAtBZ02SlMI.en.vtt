00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.760 
really don't know i know a lot of people
talk<00:04:39.210> good<00:04:39.419> about<00:04:39.629> it<00:04:39.780> like<00:04:39.900> like<00:04:40.530> it's<00:04:40.680> gonna

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
talk good about it like like it's gonna

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.260 
talk good about it like like it's gonna
go<00:04:40.949> on<00:04:41.039> a<00:04:41.099> circuit<00:04:41.400> like<00:04:41.430> david<00:04:41.789> vonderhaar<00:04:41.939> is

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
go on a circuit like david vonderhaar is

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.990 
go on a circuit like david vonderhaar is
gonna<00:04:42.870> be<00:04:42.990> backing<00:04:43.349> at<00:04:43.439> a<00:04:43.469> hundred<00:04:43.620> percent

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
gonna be backing at a hundred percent

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.179 
gonna be backing at a hundred percent
some<00:04:45.000> people<00:04:45.300> you<00:04:45.900> know<00:04:45.930> have<00:04:46.680> already<00:04:47.039> said

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
some people you know have already said

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:48.140 
some people you know have already said
that<00:04:47.310> they've<00:04:47.460> played<00:04:47.729> it<00:04:47.909> and<00:04:48.000> they<00:04:48.090> think

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
that they've played it and they think

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.029 
that they've played it and they think
it's<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.539> best<00:04:48.659> call<00:04:48.900> duty<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.379> really<00:04:49.979> don't

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
it's the best call duty I really don't

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:50.990 
it's the best call duty I really don't
know<00:04:50.159> but<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.370> don't<00:04:50.460> want<00:04:50.669> to<00:04:50.729> make<00:04:50.759> any

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
know but I don't want to make any

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.820 
know but I don't want to make any
speculations<00:04:51.300> because<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.319> don't<00:04:52.590> want<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.770> be

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
speculations because I don't want to be

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.170 
speculations because I don't want to be
disappointed<00:04:52.979> you<00:04:53.669> know<00:04:53.759> I<00:04:53.819> don't<00:04:54.000> want<00:04:54.120> to

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
disappointed you know I don't want to

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.159 
disappointed you know I don't want to
tell<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.330> guys<00:04:54.419> how<00:04:54.569> it's<00:04:54.689> gonna<00:04:54.780> be<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.050> best

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
tell you guys how it's gonna be the best

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.140 
tell you guys how it's gonna be the best
I<00:04:55.560> think<00:04:55.979> it's<00:04:56.099> going<00:04:56.159> to<00:04:56.250> be<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.370> vest<00:04:56.639> and<00:04:57.090> a

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
I think it's going to be a vest and a

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.279 
I think it's going to be a vest and a
lot<00:04:57.270> of<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.419> guys<00:04:57.479> asked<00:04:57.870> me<00:04:57.900> for<00:04:58.110> my<00:04:58.199> opinion

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
lot of you guys asked me for my opinion

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.179 
lot of you guys asked me for my opinion
but<00:04:59.009> I<00:04:59.069> never<00:04:59.279> know<00:04:59.460> what<00:04:59.669> to<00:04:59.699> say<00:04:59.969> because<00:05:00.150> I

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
but I never know what to say because I

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.350 
but I never know what to say because I
number<00:05:02.189> one<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.430> can't<00:05:02.729> wait<00:05:02.909> for<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.180> come

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
number one I can't wait for it to come

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.510 
number one I can't wait for it to come
out<00:05:03.509> because<00:05:04.110> it<00:05:04.590> will<00:05:04.710> be<00:05:04.830> on<00:05:04.919> the<00:05:05.009> circuit<00:05:05.370> I

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
out because it will be on the circuit I

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.550 
out because it will be on the circuit I
honestly<00:05:06.060> feel<00:05:06.389> that's<00:05:06.689> my<00:05:06.810> own<00:05:06.960> opinion<00:05:07.409> that

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
honestly feel that's my own opinion that

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.019 
honestly feel that's my own opinion that
it<00:05:07.650> will<00:05:07.770> be<00:05:07.800> in<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.039> circuit<00:05:08.400> it's<00:05:08.580> there's

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:09.029 
it will be in the circuit it's there's

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:11.450 
it will be in the circuit it's there's
no<00:05:09.120> way<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.360> can't<00:05:09.659> be<00:05:10.289> on<00:05:10.379> the<00:05:10.409> circuit<00:05:10.830> MLG

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
no way it can't be on the circuit MLG

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.159 
no way it can't be on the circuit MLG
needs<00:05:11.639> a<00:05:11.729> shooter<00:05:12.029> everybody<00:05:12.810> who<00:05:12.930> went<00:05:13.110> to

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
needs a shooter everybody who went to

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.959 
needs a shooter everybody who went to
the<00:05:13.229> last<00:05:13.439> MLG<00:05:13.830> event<00:05:14.099> it<00:05:14.189> was<00:05:14.250> strictly<00:05:14.430> pc

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:14.969 
the last MLG event it was strictly pc

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.450 
the last MLG event it was strictly pc
and<00:05:15.210> it<00:05:15.629> was<00:05:15.779> just<00:05:15.960> lonely<00:05:16.169> it<00:05:16.979> just<00:05:17.189> felt<00:05:17.400> like

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
and it was just lonely it just felt like

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.070 
and it was just lonely it just felt like
a<00:05:17.580> ghost<00:05:17.939> down<00:05:18.150> there<00:05:18.389> because<00:05:18.659> they<00:05:18.900> didn't

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
a ghost down there because they didn't

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.869 
a ghost down there because they didn't
have<00:05:19.110> any<00:05:19.349> shooters<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:19.949> know<00:05:20.069> just<00:05:20.580> doesn't

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
have any shooters you know just doesn't

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.700 
have any shooters you know just doesn't

feel right Early's golden boy said that
and<00:05:23.219> I<00:05:23.310> personally<00:05:24.240> watching<00:05:24.599> the<00:05:24.689> stream<00:05:24.840> it

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
and I personally watching the stream it

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.559 
and I personally watching the stream it
felt<00:05:25.289> like<00:05:25.409> that<00:05:25.650> and<00:05:26.400> i<00:05:26.909> had<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.150> couple<00:05:27.300> other

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
felt like that and i had a couple other

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:28.580 
felt like that and i had a couple other

friends that went out there and just
just<00:05:29.039> to<00:05:29.129> go<00:05:29.310> because<00:05:29.610> they<00:05:29.729> lived<00:05:29.939> near<00:05:30.180> it

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
just to go because they lived near it
