00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 exactly rank being more 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.250
 synthetic rhin so that's the emotion 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.990
 which is the only organ that is linked to 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.500
 116 to the ancestors that there are only types 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.840
 emotions 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 then the Rhine laurent but if china 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.270
 daily to the emotion of fear way of the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.279
 fright but Lorraine in medicine 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.930
 Chinese is very important to me 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.080
 because these are the foundations of the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.480
 life the rhine often compared to the east to the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.970
 candle of life laurens and puts in 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.650
 reserve what's called gasoline 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.920
 vital vital essence 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.770
 it's an energy that has been purified 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.700
 refined put in reserve like a precious 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.620
 treasure in the rhine there is called 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.079
 the vital essence of rats is called 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.289
 jeans of the kidneys and jean guerin and 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.480
 the inheritance in and from the ancestors 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.280
 of your parents first because in the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.500
 jeans in behra jeans there is no 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.570
 simply matter the vital essence 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.000
 but also the spirit is that wears the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.280
 line and that's what's important at 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.239
 that's why we have the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.369
 ancestor worship 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.140
 asia we greatly respect the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.570
 elderly who who are our 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.400
 memory the memory of our history 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.650
 in the guerin jeans is a transmission 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.360
 not only genetic chromosomes 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.009
 the eldest hereditary energy is the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.070
 Guinean jeans but also the memory 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.070
 emotional transpose inherited from everything 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.220
 the lot of a whole lineage so in the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.439
 berain jean has a part in and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.840
 that comes from our parents is 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.829
 also an acquired part which 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.500
 comes from the production that comes 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.689
 processing and transport of 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.770
 food by the other guy called 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.180
 the spleen the spleen is the energy 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.890
 digestive digestive 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.110
 even if you have inherited a beautiful 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.439
 hereditary energy if you stop 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.090
 eat 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.890
 if you have been digested 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.109
 if you eat what you do not need you 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.479
 do not have energy ine because 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.490
 energy nor is doomed to run out 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.799
 with time she is constantly 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.049
 nourished by the energy gained from 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.410
 food and that's why I 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.299
 say that we could compare jeans 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.970
 and kidneys at what's called the 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.769
 hereditary heritage that are put into 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.920
 reserve in what is called the chest 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.660
 do beyond genetics which are the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.180
 chromosomes and in the chromosome that is 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.849
 what is there yal dna and adn these are 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.099
 messages of life ok 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.840
 even if you have a good edit and 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.590
 that you have poor nutrition 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.110
 you can get sick and that's for 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.750
 that in western medicine there is a 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.519
 search path more and more of 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.849
 more and more I would not say popular 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.700
 it's not the word more and more refined 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.819
 it's nutrigenomics there are a lot 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.239
 of western medicine studied 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.879
 a lot 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.099
 the influential rise in nutrients it's up to 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.560
 tell the micronutrients about decoding 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.130
 young people it must be said that in 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.250
 chromosomes 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.590
 there are 90% who are not decoding the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.700
 book of life and even smoked translated 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.840
 than is necessary for 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.840
 maintain my life
