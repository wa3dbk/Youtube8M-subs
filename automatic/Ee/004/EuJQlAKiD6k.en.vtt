00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.230
 on the tv author for our show 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.450
 daily devoted to the quinté + it's 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.190
 at 5.5 my guest of the day philippines 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.030
 Paris turf newspaper updo to play 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.130
 of the piano jean philippe 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.439
 open to all this Wednesday direction 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.720
 cagnes-sur-mer with the robach price 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.670
 a test for 4 year old horses and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.590
 more about the 2500 meters of the great 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.240
 track the summary have walls on 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.340
 will not start in this mission by 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.410
 the quinté + 5.5 analysis will follow the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.170
 pronoun from our consultant without forgetting 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.530
 the game boards then in game plan 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.570
 the number 16 typist that just won 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.460
 it took three pounds of penalty 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.500
 do not worry at all then so 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.989
 she definitely won a handicap on 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.570
 a 2004 here even on the grass is in 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.829
 heavy ground by two lengths so 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.750
 she has the margin 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.370
 she was penalized three kilos but 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.949
 finally I think she is still 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.920
 quite the level and she is 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.390
 regular and more is it moreover 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.239
 he is ridden by fabrice veron the man 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.470
 in the form of the meeting the confidence to 100% 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.600
 ok she can climb category on 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.430
 will have understood it in opposition number 3 or 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.680
 an absolute base of titles at this level 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.760
 the three notions there also unavoidable 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.369
 to paper yes it did a good 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.060
 back on psf right here it is 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.680
 fourth 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.930
 it was shorter than his jockey 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.479
 antoine gauthier said he would be 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.670
 much better on longer so he 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.220
 is doing very well cagnes he has in case of 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.990
 exit at two seconds two 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.259
 first accessits and a fourth 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.020
 square 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.909
 so that's a basic notion it's a 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.009
 concept well this is the case to say it 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.990
 between positions the number 9 brasil 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.310
 and then she has a lot of rigor 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.229
 and regularity 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.640
 the training is very confident there 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.720
 so we can not discard it not 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.880
 at all we can not dismiss it 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.600
 that she finished her 2013 season very well 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.690
 so she was in the teeth the money 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.819
 the last three times in lyon jean 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.049
 gauvin stone and super confident he we 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.810
 said she was a mare 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.090
 eclectic which in addition is very 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.860
 powerful rope left so where she 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.470
 has acquired three of his four victories 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.929
 and she's going as well in the town so 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.269
 the same I make it logical to the end 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.849
 it's true okay the number 6 e royal 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.380
 stay then she does a little 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.700
 back she has means that's 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.160
 sure but she does like a little 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.239
 back home yes and so I had 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.970
 loved because she had run well in 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.110
 the quinté price of breeding in November 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.569
 last who was 7th she had 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.819
 really provided a good performance 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.080
 there actually she does a 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.460
 returned but 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.320
 It must be said that last year she 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.920
 had won on a comeback after three 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.720
 months of absence 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.750
 so this is a mare who can do 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.240
 fly 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.440
 of English okay so it's the same 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.200
 it is powerful and freshness that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.300
 that's for sure ok then in fifth position 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.620
 the number 4 which we have clods 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.840
 talked a lot before the show 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.980
 I'm not a fan I do not really like them 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.930
 horses that flat obstacle bottom like that 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.820
 now it's a serious training 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.290
 and red line reason why you 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.700
 had placed it years ago the tree yes it can 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.840
 scare you and that can be a point 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.130
 of questioning actually me I 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.200
 think you have to give it a try 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.490
 she is the ladle is super fit there 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.860
 has won two straight since the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.930
 start of the meeting 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.350
 here is the horse will be associated with crastus 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.700
 so one who knows very well so here 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.620
 I think that 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.050
 you really have to try it 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.970
 these are girls will not be favorite but 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.200
 we're wary of my linen cotton hockey 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.250
 Philippines Jeumont and a little reminder 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.500
 of your selection is worth 8 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.050
 so then but eight horses this is the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.860
 eesc typist three concepts 9 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.780
 brasil and gna the royal ciss remains the 4 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.560
 which clumps it's all class 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.540
 the 15th to dender and the 5th of December ok 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.549
 regarding the game board one is 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.830
 gone on a 5,500 and he three horses 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.470
 three bases that to paper seems absolute 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.980
 the 3rd on the 9th the 16th we placed behind the 2nd 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.870
 the 4th the 5th the 6th the 7th the 8th and the 15th 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.849
 it's a game that will taste 21 euros on 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.019
 can play at 50% you can play at 10% I 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.660
 reminds you of ken jackpot that amounts to 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.930
 a little more than 6000 or see 7000 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.420
 euros 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.190
 good bah philippines everything is said or 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.170

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.940
 show looked at each other by 1 it's not
