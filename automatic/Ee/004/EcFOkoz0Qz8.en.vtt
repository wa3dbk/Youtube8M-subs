00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.910
 hello with you, Sergey, I stuck in 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.560
 I continue a series of video lessons devoted 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.490
 building your online store on 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.309
 opencart 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.259
 In this lesson I will consider the issue of binding 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.370
 domain name to the real place 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:22.320
 file locations 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:24.449
 hosting despite the fact that in previous 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.519
 lessons we have ordered hosting and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.949
 registered domain names for 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.840
 Internet shopping is the connection between 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.050
 file locations and domain names 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.660
 There is no example if they introduce an amine name which 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.270
 I registered that at browser request 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.070
 I get this answer here 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.590
 shows just how that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.320
 the browser can not find anything on this 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.870
 address and we need to connect 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.870
 between the symbolic domain name and that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.789
 the place where our site files are located on 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.280
 the current moment there are probably files 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.840
 stub which hoster automatically 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.239
 sets when creating so 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.520
 and it should be displayed as you type in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.129
 browser address bar how to install 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.170
 connection to establish connection 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.510
 between the symbolic domain name and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.460
 direct file location 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.880
 our site must be installed 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.460
 server name server addresses 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.520
 names we are informed by the administration of the host 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.850
 in a letter called code 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.360
 account activation in this email is 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.100
 several sections 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.759
 which are very important first here 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.860
 section to enter the account that is in 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.710
 control panel hosting section for 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.900
 database management 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.280
 one database is automatically created 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.090
 when you activate your account 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.950
 section for access via ftp protocol for 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.720
 to transfer files from 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.759
 local computer to hosting and 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.340
 mail section 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.259
 in order to get server names 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.050
 Names need to go to the panel 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.869
 Hosting management follow the link and 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.700
 enter username and password and and 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:27.040
 user and password I just copy 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:28.930
 letter push entry and render in 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.739
 hosting control panels for 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.050
 to find 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.370
 nameserver names let's go into 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.709
 section sites and 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.890
 in the section of our site go to 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:43.450
 dns control opens table 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:47.920
 and the nameserver names they appear in 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.190
 Tables Tables in records of type NS 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.329
 that is, we have 4 name servers and their 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.670
 need to register 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.070
 you and the registrar have a domain registrar 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.230
 domain name of our project this 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:04.450
 domains go to his site and go 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.810
 follow the link to the control panel 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.799
 I automatically logged in 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.510
 Control Panel 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:17.260
 and here it is necessary in the domain section 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.690
 services click go to 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.330
 management 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.600
 and it turns out the management page 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.060
 domains and now here 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.660
 I launch the page of the domain which 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.750
 used to shop here choose 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.270
 control dns servers and here in these 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.330
 four fields need to drive 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.760
 server name is now ticked 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.050
 use a registrar server 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:49.340
 I disconnect her from the page for free 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.840
 Hosting Management I copy server name 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.690
 which must be set for the domain 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.400
 all the other three I differ only 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:12.570

 changes are saved and now 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.180
 you just have to wait 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.340
 when will the database update 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.600
 dns around the world usually go for it 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.210
 6 to 24 hours after base 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.310

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.400
 available by entering in the address bar 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.470
 browser will connect to 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.870
 real file location 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.240
 the site that is, those files will be taken 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.040
 which are now in our catalog 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.020
