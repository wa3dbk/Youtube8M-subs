00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
program and I thought well there's got

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.819 
program and I thought well there's got
to<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.240> better<00:01:27.509> way<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.290> started<00:01:28.650> talking

and what I here's what I learned is

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.170 
and what I here's what I learned is
first<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.100> all<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.400> learned<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.909> yoga

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
first of all and I learned this in yoga

first of all and I learned this in yoga
classes<00:01:39.390> you've<00:01:39.689> got<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> start<00:01:40.140> listening<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
classes you've got to start listening to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.859 
classes you've got to start listening to
your<00:01:40.890> body<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.400> when<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.329> listen<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.750> your

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
your body and when you listen to your

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.499 
your body and when you listen to your
body<00:01:43.049> your<00:01:43.680> body<00:01:43.920> responds<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.729> best<00:01:44.970> so

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
body your body responds the best so

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.630 
body your body responds the best so
think<00:01:46.380> about<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.710> walk<00:01:46.920> run<00:01:47.189> method<00:01:47.399> me

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
think about this walk run method me

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.819 
think about this walk run method me
using<00:01:47.850> your<00:01:47.939> watch<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.390> much<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.530> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
using your watch so much so if if it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.530 
using your watch so much so if if it
beeps<00:01:50.310> every<00:01:50.820> minute<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.149> then<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.360> beeps

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
beeps every minute and then it beeps

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.149 
beeps every minute and then it beeps
every<00:01:51.689> three<00:01:52.020> minutes<00:01:52.140> beeps<00:01:52.619> every<00:01:52.890> minute

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
every three minutes beeps every minute

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.160 
every three minutes beeps every minute
you<00:01:53.490> start<00:01:53.759> becoming<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.240> slave's<00:01:54.630> your<00:01:54.930> watch

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you start becoming a slave's your watch

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.709 
you start becoming a slave's your watch
and<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:56.310> don't<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:57.000> listen<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.479> your<00:01:57.600> body

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
and you don't really listen to your body

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.389 
and you don't really listen to your body
and<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.409> tell<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.680> I've<00:01:58.799> been<00:01:58.829> there<00:01:59.070> I've

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
and I can tell you I've been there I've

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.800 
and I can tell you I've been there I've
been<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.909> marathon<00:02:00.180> course<00:02:00.509> just

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
been out on that marathon course just

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.120 
been out on that marathon course just
waiting<00:02:01.229> for<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.439> thing<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.710> beeps<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.100> I

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
waiting for the thing to beeps so I

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.719 
waiting for the thing to beeps so I
could<00:02:02.399> start<00:02:02.640> walking

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
could start walking

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.190 
could start walking
and<00:02:03.939> then<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.150> dreaded<00:02:04.509> that<00:02:04.720> next<00:02:05.049> feed

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
and then I dreaded that next feed

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.050 
and then I dreaded that next feed
because<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.530> had<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.890> start<00:02:06.130> running<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.670> wasn't

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
because I had to start running I wasn't

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.359 
because I had to start running I wasn't
listening<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.570> my<00:02:07.689> body<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.709> other<00:02:08.860> thing<00:02:09.190> is

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
listening to my body the other thing is

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.010 
listening to my body the other thing is
I<00:02:09.489> want<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.729> use<00:02:09.849> an<00:02:09.970> analogy<00:02:10.209> here<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
I want to use an analogy here the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.690 
I want to use an analogy here the
analogy<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.470> driving<00:02:11.950> in<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.130> city<00:02:12.370> versus

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
analogy of driving in the city versus

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.309 
analogy of driving in the city versus
driving<00:02:13.090> on<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.330> highway<00:02:13.450> if<00:02:13.900> you're<00:02:14.050> driving

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
driving on the highway if you're driving

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.900 
driving on the highway if you're driving
in<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.620> city<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.190> know<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.370> have<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.670> stop

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
in the city you know you have to stop

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.030 
in the city you know you have to stop
start<00:02:16.209> stop<00:02:16.270> start<00:02:16.540> stop<00:02:16.870> start<00:02:17.140> if<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:17.830> drive

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
start stop start stop start if you drive

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.589 
start stop start stop start if you drive
them<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.310> highway<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.670> go<00:02:18.880> at<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.090> nice<00:02:19.270> even

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
them the highway you go at a nice even

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.229 
them the highway you go at a nice even
pace<00:02:19.959> for<00:02:20.319> longer<00:02:20.709> periods<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.250> time<00:02:21.459> which<00:02:22.060> do

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
pace for longer periods of time which do

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.030 
pace for longer periods of time which do
you<00:02:22.300> get<00:02:22.450> better<00:02:22.660> gas<00:02:22.930> mileage<00:02:22.959> in<00:02:23.590> well

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
you get better gas mileage in well

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.410 
you get better gas mileage in well
everybody<00:02:24.610> knows<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.910> get<00:02:25.000> better<00:02:25.209> gas

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
everybody knows you get better gas

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.809 
everybody knows you get better gas
mileage<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.050> highway<00:02:26.560> versus<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.550> city

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
mileage on the highway versus the city

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.090 
mileage on the highway versus the city
so<00:02:28.330> if<00:02:28.450> you're<00:02:28.600> using<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:29.050> walk<00:02:29.530> run<00:02:29.769> walk

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
so if you're using this walk run walk

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.380 
so if you're using this walk run walk
run<00:02:30.340> walk<00:02:30.610> run<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:30.940> you're<00:02:31.180> stopping

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
run walk run and you're stopping

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.479 
run walk run and you're stopping
starting<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:31.900> stopping<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.230> starting<00:02:32.489> your

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
starting and stopping and starting your

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.240 
starting and stopping and starting your
efficiency<00:02:33.930> actually<00:02:34.930> would<00:02:35.410> decrease<00:02:35.890> based

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
efficiency actually would decrease based

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.640 
efficiency actually would decrease based
on<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.670> idea<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.690> rang<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.350> lot<00:02:38.500> of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
on that idea and that rang a lot of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.490 
on that idea and that rang a lot of
sense<00:02:38.830> with<00:02:38.980> me<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:40.900> thought<00:02:41.080> well<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.260> put

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
sense with me so we thought well I put

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.440 
sense with me so we thought well I put
all<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.739> together<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.220> said<00:02:42.370> wow<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.299> know

all that together I said wow you know
what<00:02:43.870> about<00:02:43.989> if<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.380> just<00:02:44.560> ran<00:02:44.890> until<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:46.000> needed

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
what about if I just ran until I needed

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.000 
what about if I just ran until I needed
to<00:02:46.600> take<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.810> walk<00:02:46.930> breaker<00:02:47.500> there<00:02:47.650> was<00:02:47.769> an<00:02:47.890> aid

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
to take a walk breaker there was an aid

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.890 
to take a walk breaker there was an aid
station<00:02:48.040> or<00:02:48.549> I<00:02:48.580> needed<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.970> eat<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.600> started

that you you're going pretty hard at
that<00:04:26.170> point<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:26.650> you<00:04:26.710> might<00:04:27.010> need<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.250> walk

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
that point so you might need a walk

they're out there especially in these
marathon<00:04:59.590> training<00:04:59.860> programs<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.760> I<00:05:00.850> think<00:05:00.880> a

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
marathon training programs and I think a

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.820 
marathon training programs and I think a
lot<00:05:01.450> of<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.660> programs<00:05:02.110> actually<00:05:02.380> kind<00:05:02.740> of

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
lot of the programs actually kind of

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.710 
lot of the programs actually kind of
breed<00:05:03.070> this<00:05:03.250> type<00:05:03.460> of<00:05:03.490> runner<00:05:03.790> they<00:05:04.330> get<00:05:04.570> all

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
breed this type of runner they get all

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
stuck on one pace like I got to do nine

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.000 
stuck on one pace like I got to do nine
minute<00:05:07.000> miles<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.720> you<00:05:08.320> know<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.560> truth<00:05:08.800> is

a toolbox is now in your toolbox you can

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.770 
a toolbox is now in your toolbox you can
run<00:05:24.340> me<00:05:24.520> all<00:05:24.729> these<00:05:24.910> different<00:05:25.300> speeds<00:05:25.540> so

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
run me all these different speeds so

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.240 
run me all these different speeds so
instead<00:05:26.020> of<00:05:26.080> just<00:05:26.290> having<00:05:26.380> a<00:05:26.680> hammer<00:05:26.890> being

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
instead of just having a hammer being

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.680 
instead of just having a hammer being
able<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.430> go<00:05:27.550> one<00:05:27.790> speed<00:05:27.940> you'll<00:05:28.479> have<00:05:28.660> a

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
able to go one speed you'll have a

hammer or screwdriver saw the drill so

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.450 
hammer or screwdriver saw the drill so
now<00:05:32.020> you<00:05:32.080> have<00:05:32.320> a<00:05:32.350> bunch<00:05:32.770> of<00:05:32.919> tools<00:05:33.100> in<00:05:33.430> there

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
now you have a bunch of tools in there

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.040 
now you have a bunch of tools in there
that<00:05:33.760> you<00:05:33.850> can<00:05:34.030> use<00:05:34.060> on<00:05:34.390> your<00:05:34.479> next<00:05:34.690> marathon

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
that you can use on your next marathon

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.900
