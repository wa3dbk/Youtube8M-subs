major hit if that creep come up here to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.609 
major hit if that creep come up here to
this<00:01:22.920> expansion<00:01:23.390> just<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> speed<00:01:24.780> alone<00:01:25.259> on

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
this expansion just the speed alone on

here
as<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:39.660> looks<00:03:39.840> like<00:03:40.020> now<00:03:40.290> we're<00:03:40.560> 16<00:03:41.240> 17<00:03:42.240> minutes

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
fully fully expanded on this side for

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.530 
fully fully expanded on this side for
fruit<00:03:49.260> cellar<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.910> he's<00:03:51.060> going<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.240> have<00:03:51.420> the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
fruit cellar so he's going to have the

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.410 
fruit cellar so he's going to have the
economic<00:03:51.690> advantage<00:03:52.410> here<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.680> looks<00:03:52.890> like<00:03:53.420> as

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
economic advantage here it looks like as

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.710 
economic advantage here it looks like as
we<00:03:55.260> look<00:03:55.410> at<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.620> income<00:03:56.040> yeah<00:03:56.340> look<00:03:56.520> at<00:03:56.580> that

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
we look at the income yeah look at that

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.570 
we look at the income yeah look at that
2,100<00:03:57.720> minerals<00:03:58.140> compared<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.560> 1600<00:03:59.250> minerals

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
2,100 minerals compared to 1600 minerals

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.490 
2,100 minerals compared to 1600 minerals
i<00:03:59.730> would<00:04:00.060> say<00:04:00.300> fruit<00:04:00.630> cellar<00:04:00.840> definitely<00:04:01.380> has

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
i would say fruit cellar definitely has

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.360 
i would say fruit cellar definitely has
an<00:04:01.620> advantage<00:04:01.920> here<00:04:02.600> it<00:04:03.600> looks<00:04:03.930> like<00:04:04.370> SEC

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
an advantage here it looks like SEC

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.680 
an advantage here it looks like SEC
trying<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.850> expand<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.240> here<00:04:06.450> as<00:04:06.600> well<00:04:07.160> and

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
trying to expand up here as well and

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.210 
trying to expand up here as well and
just<00:04:09.690> bringing<00:04:10.080> another<00:04:10.260> drop<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.770> looks<00:04:10.950> like

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
just bringing another drop it looks like

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.920 
just bringing another drop it looks like
for<00:04:11.610> fruit<00:04:11.910> cellar<00:04:12.890> as<00:04:14.540> he's<00:04:15.540> met<00:04:15.750> back

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
for fruit cellar as he's met back

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.630 
for fruit cellar as he's met back
starting<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.320> come<00:04:16.470> around<00:04:16.620> bring<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.520> into

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
starting to come around bring it into

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.070 
starting to come around bring it into
the<00:04:17.760> tanks<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.270> a<00:04:18.299> lowly<00:04:18.870> infantry<00:04:19.650> here<00:04:19.920> as

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
the tanks and a lowly infantry here as

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.260 
the tanks and a lowly infantry here as
we<00:04:22.080> start<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.380> drop<00:04:22.680> down<00:04:22.950> all<00:04:23.190> these<00:04:23.640> hydras

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270

we start to drop down all these hydras
onto<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.690> map<00:04:24.870> with<00:04:25.140> some<00:04:25.320> roaches<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.860> more

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
onto the map with some roaches and more

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.300 
onto the map with some roaches and more
hydras<00:04:26.490> coming<00:04:26.730> in<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.880> way<00:04:27.000> with<00:04:27.690> some<00:04:28.310> some

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
hydras coming in the way with some some

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.130 
hydras coming in the way with some some
banelings<00:04:29.820> coming<00:04:30.150> in<00:04:30.270> as<00:04:30.420> well<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.110> help

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
banelings coming in as well to help

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.380 
banelings coming in as well to help
support<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:32.460> this<00:04:32.670> looks<00:04:32.820> like<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.120> could<00:04:33.180> be<00:04:33.300> a

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
support so this looks like it could be a

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.140 
support so this looks like it could be a
force<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.840> be<00:04:33.870> reckoned<00:04:33.930> with<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.850> we<00:04:35.970> do<00:04:36.060> have

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
force to be reckoned with and we do have

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.910 
force to be reckoned with and we do have
an<00:04:36.240> itís<00:04:36.660> worm<00:04:36.870> coming<00:04:37.140> in<00:04:37.260> somewhere<00:04:37.740> where
