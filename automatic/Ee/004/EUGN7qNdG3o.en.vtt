00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.890
 When unzipping 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.330
 Contents has become something like 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.100
 This is the contents of this guy 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.790
 In this is a psp of the grassef 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.210
 It is save data 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.970
 Yes 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.610
 So first of all 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.870
 A little towards pc 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.870
 I think that I want to transfer 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:22.890
 Well then 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.890
 I would like to erase all the saved data of Grassef in 8 pt . 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.500
 Well, this is the end of all saved data saved in psp . 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.270
 Then 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.270
 connect psp flexibly 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.630
 Yes if you connect pcp to your computer 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:35.840
 Open this psp file here that pc open psp file 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:40.880
 There is that save data in the 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:44.260
 And what was decompressed in the save data just before 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.260
 I will put that as it is 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:54.749
 Yes I finished 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:54.749
 Then I would like to do a d'Glassef to try 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:04.139
 Yes try to start the game 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.060
 Combat helicopters will not fall like this in the garage 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.600
 After this 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.580
 that 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.580
 Also this center helicopter 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.180
 is not it 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:23.169
 It was on this site 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:28.070
 Because there is a way to put out the battle helicopter on this site, I will do my best while looking at this site 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:33.100
 If you put out the battle helicopter, you can use the battle helicopter 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.100
 How to operate this combat helicopter to 8 tsunami 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.960
 Oh dear 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.960
 I don't understand myself well 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.950
 I tried to use it but 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.480
 I said that 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.140
 It is not 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.600
 bear with l or r l or round button 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:06:00.840
 I can beat the bad feeling This is this 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.110
 It is another point of caution but if this center helicopter is broken once 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.380
 that 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:10.420
 As it does not come out to the garage, if it is broken once, save saved data and load it from the beginning 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.560
 I have to start 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.440
 Yes more 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.420
 It was how to use the grassef send edge 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.750
 Yes 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.750
 the end
