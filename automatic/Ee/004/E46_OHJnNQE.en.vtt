of<00:00:02.700> doing<00:00:02.760> experiment<00:00:03.689> here<00:00:03.990> so<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:06.080> the

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
of doing experiment here so this is the

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.500 
of doing experiment here so this is the
fodder<00:00:07.350> for<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.770> chickens<00:00:08.189> but<00:00:09.090> we've<00:00:09.269> also

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
fodder for the chickens but we've also

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.650 
fodder for the chickens but we've also
been<00:00:09.990> doing<00:00:10.349> some<00:00:10.500> juicing<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:12.210> I've<00:00:12.509> been

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
been doing some juicing so I've been

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.070 
been doing some juicing so I've been
taking<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:14.269> cutting<00:00:15.269> off<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> top<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
taking the cutting off the top of the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.820 
taking the cutting off the top of the
wheatgrass<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:17.250> then<00:00:17.430> there's<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.090> this

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
wheatgrass but then there's all of this

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.370 
wheatgrass but then there's all of this
mat<00:00:19.830> that's<00:00:20.369> here<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.480> was<00:00:21.630> thinking<00:00:21.960> well<00:00:22.109> I

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
mat that's here so I was thinking well I

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.990 
mat that's here so I was thinking well I
would<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:22.590> go<00:00:22.949> give<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.640> chickens

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
would just go give that to the chickens

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.429 
would just go give that to the chickens
my<00:00:24.930> husband<00:00:25.320> wanted<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.160> try<00:00:27.050> to<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.289> what

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
my husband wanted to try to see what

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.220 
my husband wanted to try to see what
happens<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.650> blend<00:00:32.030> this<00:00:33.030> all<00:00:33.360> up<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.870> now

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
happens if we blend this all up and now

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.959 
happens if we blend this all up and now
to<00:00:34.290> our<00:00:34.590> smoothies<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.160> mean<00:00:35.340> all<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> is

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
to our smoothies I mean all it is is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.080 
to our smoothies I mean all it is is
sprouted<00:00:36.450> wheat<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.160> there's<00:00:38.160> no<00:00:38.340> soil<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
sprouted wheat and there's no soil in it

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.290 
sprouted wheat and there's no soil in it
and<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:40.200> fresh<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.890> don't<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.399> why<00:00:42.059> we

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
and it's fresh so I don't know why we

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.590 
and it's fresh so I don't know why we
couldn't<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.100> what<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.399> did<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:45.360> took

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
couldn't so this is what we did we took

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.549 
couldn't so this is what we did we took
some<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.559> there<00:00:47.480> about<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> quarter<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.140> this

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
some in there about a quarter of this

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.209 
some in there about a quarter of this
tray<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.989> put<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:52.710> some<00:00:53.010> water

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
tray and put it in there with some water

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.920 
tray and put it in there with some water
and<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> did<00:00:54.480> blend<00:00:54.750> up

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and as you can see it did blend up

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.830 
and as you can see it did blend up
pretty<00:00:55.140> good<00:00:56.090> but<00:00:57.090> there's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> lot<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.629> fiber

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
pretty good but there's a lot of fiber

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.290 
pretty good but there's a lot of fiber
in<00:00:58.079> there<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.789> thinking<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.180> could

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
in there so I was thinking we could

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
in there so I was thinking we could
strain<00:01:00.719> off<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> fiber<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.859> use<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
strain off the fiber and just use the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.870 
strain off the fiber and just use the
good<00:01:02.460> juice<00:01:02.969> that's<00:01:03.329> left<00:01:03.860> but<00:01:04.860> my<00:01:05.519> husband

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
good juice that's left but my husband

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.179 
good juice that's left but my husband
wants<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:07.110> know<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.470> blend<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
wants to you know just blend it up and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.550 
wants to you know just blend it up and
just<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.659> use<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.110> whole<00:01:10.290> thing

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
just see if we can use the whole thing

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.090 
just see if we can use the whole thing
and<00:01:10.920> he'll<00:01:11.520> coordinate<00:01:12.510> his<00:01:12.689> smoothies<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

and he'll coordinate his smoothies you
know<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> base<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.570> his<00:01:15.720> smoothie<00:01:16.080> in

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.800 
know use it as a base in his smoothie in
the<00:01:16.259> morning<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.909> other<00:01:18.030> part<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.460 
the morning so the other part of it is
that<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.640> tore<00:01:21.060> some<00:01:21.479> pieces<00:01:21.720> apart<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
that and I tore some pieces apart and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.280 
that and I tore some pieces apart and
I'm<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.070> gonna<00:01:23.450> dehydrate<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.110> whole<00:01:25.259> thing

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
I'm just gonna dehydrate the whole thing

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.240 
I'm just gonna dehydrate the whole thing
it'll<00:01:28.290> work<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> won't<00:01:28.950> work

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
it'll work or it won't work

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.880 
it'll work or it won't work
but<00:01:29.640> either<00:01:30.090> way<00:01:30.299> we'll<00:01:30.570> know<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.020> then<00:01:31.560> once

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
but either way we'll know and then once

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.990 
but either way we'll know and then once
it<00:01:32.040> dehydrates<00:01:32.810> then<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.670> blend<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:35.939> up

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
it dehydrates then I can blend it all up

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.210 
it dehydrates then I can blend it all up
just<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.479> I've<00:01:36.689> done<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.650> other<00:01:37.680> vegetables

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
just like I've done the other vegetables

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.819 
just like I've done the other vegetables
that<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.790> dehydrate<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.049> then<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.290> powder<00:01:40.590> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that I dehydrate it and then I powder it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.080 
that I dehydrate it and then I powder it
so<00:01:41.640> I'll<00:01:42.060> be<00:01:42.659> back<00:01:42.840> as<00:01:43.079> soon<00:01:43.110> as<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.560> dry<00:01:44.090> all

don't even know if it's gonna blend up I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:04:00.420 
don't even know if it's gonna blend up I
haven't<00:02:03.270> tried<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.630> before<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.200> here<00:02:04.469> goes
