00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 I love to show you today 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.259
 we have this great light jersey dress 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.480
 it could be great movie 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.099
 summer but also five spring and it 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.870
 consists of two different substances 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.940
 and is still out there with lace 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.269
 I wish you much fun with 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.269
 watch 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.430
 as a template you need a dress 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.220
 the top you act then you need 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.730
 jersey fabric another fabric for 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.780
 top there still cutting tool 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.150
 Tape measure a pen or cutter chalk 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.650
 matching even elastic lace and 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.500
 rubber wall pins and of course one 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.840
 Sewing machine stop for the rock part 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.850
 It's best to double up either 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.370
 you must be of villars judgment 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.799
 would and measurably, and frustrating to 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.379
 to the desired length or you take 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:05.500
 You found the dress which is up here 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.930
 is elastic and just puts it on it 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.880
 on the fabric and then draw it 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.619
 just a straight line up 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.479
 to where the rock changes if you 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.250
 No dress as a template you do 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.380
 just a square where all beds 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.060
 are the same length or you are in it 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.659
 because I dress up so fast 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.659
 can be seen 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:32.680
 and then you cut that square 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:36.490
 double out and then go to two 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.900
 opposite sides together 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.340
 you can either gossip with one 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.470
 I and a tip make work 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:48.430
 or some top coat or you 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:50.680
 uses an opera love machine for that 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.860
 the top was worn on the basis of the dress like 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.360
 after that must be top and folds 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.610
 then you beat yourself all over 1 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.570
 and it is stuck 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.400
 then we take the fabric for that 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.580
 top part should also be elastic 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.450
 double and put yours there 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.490
 folded stop on and around 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.590
 draw it now with a pen or 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.599
 with tailor chalk prevented 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.709
 in the same way you can 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.170
 of course you too before 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.420
 drawing patterns on paper draw to the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.310
 now on lined lines ennobled now 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.150
 even a centimeter after even wanted 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.519
 I enter with you 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.440
 then you're cutting along the near 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.440
 spent in their desktop 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.620
 cutout for the requirements 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.380
 it's best to orient yourself 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.360
 your Volland and usually at different 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.010
 score how much lower the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.590
 excerpt is and draws the whole 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.590
 then on your cut top 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.310
 You can easily get euro points 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.310
 to connect to an action 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:12.260
 then you cut this curve only on 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.000
 front part from there I have a new one 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.129
 opera lures machine I have used this 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.989
 now to achieve such great live 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.569
 Of course you can also do one 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.340
 Use zigzag stitch 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.459
 next with their both sides 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.660
 tenant desktops and the short beets 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.660
 the carriers of the top 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.939
 then you take a rubber band and 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.060
 either takes the measure of others 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:42.519
 template dress or take it over once 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.840
 your under breast circumference and around 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:49.000
 then cut it off next 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.939
 you end the two with a square 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.439
 and a cross in the middle together 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.599
 Now you are on the top of the 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.180
 skirt part and at the rubber band in each case eight 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.430
 Need the same distances this 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.230
 you can now need as 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.470
 landmarks use the same above 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.989
 top of the vogtland warned which 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.430
 different distances are on 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.189
 even points with one after 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.720
 connect and pin 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:16.000
 so you can even the stop 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.109
 on which nobody distribute and behave 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.109
 at the end a nice baku 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:42.069
 if you managed this pummel work 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.909
 has complete with her once in a circle 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.729
 around 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:48.069
 you use a zigzag on it 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.839
 beginning without the elastic band to those 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.929
 few times drove back 

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:55.360
 and then you can wear the rubber band that long 

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:58.239
 pull as the fabric of the skirt is partly 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.669
 it just to those and the ruffles too 

00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:02.139
 receive 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.139
 make sure that the rubber band during 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.579
 the entire process is served if 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.959
 you want to know you too 

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:08.759
 still with an overflow stitch choice 

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:11.469
 clean 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.239
 Next, the elastic tip 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:15.579
 to the sweeping edges of the 

00:05:13.239 --> 00:05:18.009
 neckline and arm holes sewn on 

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:20.889
 you put the lace ribbon on the 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:23.709
 right side of the stop with the smooth 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.809
 edge to the edge of the cutout and 

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:27.519
 sews along with a zigzag stitch 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:29.709
 if you want that a lot 

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:31.269
 survives so very close to the edge 

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:33.479
 would be that less acute 

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:35.169
 then do not survive on the left 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.179
 in between you can do it all 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.999
 also fold over and look like 

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:42.669
 far it survives enterprise around the 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:45.550
 complete cutout around and also 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:49.029
 the arm holes and then he folded the 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:52.899
 lace so that they look nice outside 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:55.509
 survives and meters them inwards 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:58.869
 worked well known from the outside close to 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.610
 It is best to use them as well 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:03.539
 again a zigzag sting and that too 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.539
 you turn around again 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.060
 then you have to last the song 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.400
 miss the skirt part to complain you 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.770
 the stop down in the morning just knew 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.450
 I double over and pin him down 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.960
 Now you go best with a 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:36.060
 zigzag stitch all around 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.430
 You have to be careful that the stop 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.440
 does not fold again and that 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.650
 the fabric does not serve itself too much 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:49.700
 Helps, among other things, an upper transport 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.700
 foot and ready is an airy dress 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:19.780
 I thank you for really great to 

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:21.069
 see and hope you got pleasure 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.169

 look at another dress and 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.349
