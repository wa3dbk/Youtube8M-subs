00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
we really had to make it fit in with

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.660 
we really had to make it fit in with
Chevrolet's<00:00:08.270> portfolio<00:00:08.870> so<00:00:09.350> and<00:00:10.340> this<00:00:10.460> car

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
Chevrolet's portfolio so and this car

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.330 
Chevrolet's portfolio so and this car
came<00:00:10.850> off<00:00:11.030> the<00:00:11.120> back<00:00:11.299> of<00:00:11.510> the<00:00:11.780> Camaro<00:00:12.530> so<00:00:12.980> the

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
came off the back of the Camaro so the

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.490 
came off the back of the Camaro so the
Camaro<00:00:13.670> was<00:00:13.730> very<00:00:14.030> hot<00:00:14.209> at<00:00:14.330> the<00:00:14.389> time<00:00:14.629> so<00:00:15.289> we

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
Camaro was very hot at the time so we

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.090 
Camaro was very hot at the time so we
wanted<00:00:15.770> to<00:00:15.830> give<00:00:15.950> it<00:00:16.070> as<00:00:16.190> much<00:00:16.219> you<00:00:17.210> know<00:00:17.360> that

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
wanted to give it as much you know that

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.490 
wanted to give it as much you know that
Camaro<00:00:19.100> DNA<00:00:19.610> and<00:00:19.880> also<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:20.990> DNA<00:00:21.380> of

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
Camaro DNA and also the DNA of

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.150 
Camaro DNA and also the DNA of
Chevrolet's<00:00:22.310> from<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:22.850> past<00:00:23.090> so<00:00:23.900> we<00:00:24.410> tried<00:00:25.130> to

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
Chevrolet's from the past so we tried to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.210 
Chevrolet's from the past so we tried to
style<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:25.640> car<00:00:25.880> with<00:00:26.810> that<00:00:26.960> in<00:00:27.110> mind<00:00:27.350> so<00:00:28.040> that

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
style the car with that in mind so that

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.330 
style the car with that in mind so that
it<00:00:28.640> had<00:00:29.030> that<00:00:29.210> lean<00:00:29.600> taut<00:00:30.320> feel<00:00:31.010> to<00:00:31.220> the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
it had that lean taut feel to the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.490 
it had that lean taut feel to the
exterior<00:00:31.880> that<00:00:31.970> would<00:00:32.119> fit<00:00:32.989> in<00:00:33.110> with<00:00:33.260> the

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
exterior that would fit in with the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.990 
exterior that would fit in with the
Chevrolet<00:00:34.070> portfolio

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000

I<00:00:35.500> think<00:00:36.500> proportion<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.100> stance<00:00:37.370> are<00:00:37.909> one<00:00:38.059> of

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
I think proportion and stance are one of

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.180 
I think proportion and stance are one of
the<00:00:38.210> things<00:00:38.420> that<00:00:38.570> for<00:00:38.719> me<00:00:38.839> stand<00:00:39.589> out<00:00:39.800> from

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
the things that for me stand out from

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.090 
the things that for me stand out from
every<00:00:40.820> other<00:00:40.940> vehicle<00:00:41.179> in<00:00:41.510> its<00:00:41.809> segment<00:00:42.100> and

every other vehicle in its segment and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.040 
every other vehicle in its segment and

it's quietly uniquely styled there isn't
a<00:00:45.079> car<00:00:45.319> in<00:00:45.499> that<00:00:45.620> segment<00:00:45.920> that<00:00:46.249> looks<00:00:46.519> like

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
a car in that segment that looks like

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.750

sedans my favorite part of the car is
the<00:00:55.729> rear<00:00:55.879> end<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.629> way<00:00:56.780> that<00:00:56.960> it's<00:00:57.079> been

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
the rear end and the way that it's been

way that the rear quarter panel and the

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.750 
way that the rear quarter panel and the
Declan<00:01:03.079> is<00:01:03.319> all<00:01:03.739> integrated<00:01:04.220> with<00:01:04.370> very

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
Declan is all integrated with very

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.510 
Declan is all integrated with very
sophisticated<00:01:05.059> surfaces<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.560> almost<00:01:06.860> has<00:01:07.159> a

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
sophisticated surfaces it almost has a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.760 
sophisticated surfaces it almost has a
sort<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.120> sports<00:01:08.420> car<00:01:08.780> feel<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:09.470> with<00:01:09.650> the

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
sort of sports car feel to it with the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.550 
sort of sports car feel to it with the
sensibilities<00:01:10.370> of<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.610> family<00:01:10.910> car<00:01:11.560> although

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
sensibilities of a family car although

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.930 
sensibilities of a family car although
we<00:01:12.680> wanted<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.070> be<00:01:13.220> as<00:01:13.310> sporty<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:13.880> as

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
we wanted it to be as sporty and as

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.960 
we wanted it to be as sporty and as
aggressive<00:01:14.390> on<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.630> outside<00:01:15.490> we<00:01:16.490> wanted<00:01:16.820> to

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
aggressive on the outside we wanted to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.740 
aggressive on the outside we wanted to
maintain<00:01:17.570> those<00:01:18.320> qualities<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.300> make<00:01:20.300> it<00:01:20.510> a

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
maintain those qualities that make it a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.480 
maintain those qualities that make it a
very<00:01:21.500> good<00:01:21.620> family<00:01:21.980> car<00:01:22.280> as<00:01:22.430> well<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:24.170> Malibu

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
very good family car as well the Malibu

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.710 
very good family car as well the Malibu
definitely<00:01:25.490> influenced<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.330> VF<00:01:26.570> Commodore

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
definitely influenced the VF Commodore

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.820 
definitely influenced the VF Commodore
when<00:01:27.440> I<00:01:27.470> returned<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:27.890> Australia<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.830> and

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
when I returned to Australia and and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.370 
when I returned to Australia and and
also<00:01:31.190> this<00:01:31.430> worked<00:01:31.670> both<00:01:31.820> ways<00:01:32.120> when<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:33.050> we

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
also this worked both ways when the we

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.320 
also this worked both ways when the we
knew<00:01:33.530> that<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.980> the<00:01:34.550> VF<00:01:34.820> was<00:01:35.030> going<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:35.210> be<00:01:35.300> a

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
knew that the the VF was going to be a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.820 
knew that the the VF was going to be a
Chevrolet<00:01:35.780> as<00:01:35.900> well<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:36.350> be<00:01:36.440> fed<00:01:36.620> back<00:01:36.770> into

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
Chevrolet as well and be fed back into

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.360 
Chevrolet as well and be fed back into
the<00:01:37.310> North<00:01:37.580> American<00:01:37.700> market<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:39.370> both

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
the North American market so both

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.890 
the North American market so both
customers<00:01:40.880> would<00:01:41.000> see<00:01:41.180> similarities<00:01:41.600> between

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
customers would see similarities between

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.810 
customers would see similarities between
both<00:01:42.320> products<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.040> they'd<00:01:43.400> work<00:01:43.580> together

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
both products and they'd work together

00:01:43.820 --> 00:02:18.740 
both products and they'd work together
in<00:01:44.180> both<00:01:44.330> markets
