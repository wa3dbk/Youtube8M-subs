00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.090 
I'm being struggling a little bit more
with<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> rhythm<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.470> that's<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
with the rhythm but that's because the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.859 
with the rhythm but that's because the
surface<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.790> fast<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.780> know

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
surface is really fast but you know
