00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
you're gonna want the motor a battery I

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.900 
you're gonna want the motor a battery I
just<00:00:20.240> got<00:00:20.449> a<00:00:20.480> triple-a<00:00:21.039> but<00:00:22.039> you<00:00:22.310> can<00:00:22.460> use<00:00:22.609> I

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
just got a triple-a but you can use I

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.840 
just got a triple-a but you can use I
take<00:00:23.210> any<00:00:23.449> kind<00:00:23.779> of<00:00:23.900> battery<00:00:24.460> along<00:00:25.460> it<00:00:25.670> so<00:00:25.789> it

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
take any kind of battery along it so it

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.919 
take any kind of battery along it so it
works<00:00:26.060> you<00:00:27.050> could<00:00:27.230> use<00:00:27.380> triple<00:00:28.250> a<00:00:28.279> double<00:00:28.929> a

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
works you could use triple a double a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.530 
works you could use triple a double a
and<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:30.679> badiy<00:00:30.949> if<00:00:31.369> you're<00:00:31.939> gonna<00:00:32.090> use<00:00:32.239> cell

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
and so badiy if you're gonna use cell

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.229 
and so badiy if you're gonna use cell
batteries<00:00:33.700> nothing<00:00:34.700> you're<00:00:34.820> going<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.090> have

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
do you gonna make a whole may run out of

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.270 
do you gonna make a whole may run out of
like<00:00:50.510> really<00:00:51.020> strong<00:00:51.230> paper<00:00:51.559> or<00:00:51.890> cardboard

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
this polygon saw where it gets on

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.469 
this polygon saw where it gets on
dried-up<00:01:07.490> gum<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.180> what<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.320> what<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.740> mean<00:01:10.010> is

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
dried-up gum and what and what I mean is

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.030 
dried-up gum and what and what I mean is
get<00:01:11.479> gum<00:01:11.689> that<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:12.020> have<00:01:12.229> into<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.590> and<00:01:12.979> you

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
get gum that you have into it and you

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.210 
get gum that you have into it and you
get<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> piece<00:01:13.610> literature<00:01:14.380> so<00:01:15.380> then<00:01:15.619> get<00:01:16.040> your

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
get a piece literature so then get your

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.080 
get a piece literature so then get your
motor<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:16.909> then<00:01:17.780> put<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.140> like<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:19.090> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
motor and then put it like that and the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.420 
motor and then put it like that and the
gum<00:01:20.299> is<00:01:20.330> so<00:01:20.600> let<00:01:20.780> go<00:01:20.960> stay<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:22.009> won't<00:01:22.220> like

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
gum is so let go stay so it won't like

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.530 
gum is so let go stay so it won't like
come<00:01:22.700> out<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:24.110> then<00:01:24.500> get<00:01:24.920> your<00:01:25.130> battery<00:01:26.030> and

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
come out so then get your battery and

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.469 
come out so then get your battery and
get<00:01:27.439> your<00:01:27.680> wires<00:01:27.950> condensed<00:01:28.729> connect<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
get your wires condensed connect the

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.819 
get your wires condensed connect the
channel<00:01:29.750> motor<00:01:31.390> get<00:01:32.390> one<00:01:32.630> put<00:01:33.200> them<00:01:33.350> on<00:01:33.500> any

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
channel motor get one put them on any

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:42.249 
channel motor get one put them on any
side<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.329> to<00:01:38.630> get<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.990> other<00:01:39.170> side<00:01:41.259> and

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
side it is to get the other side and

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.370 
side it is to get the other side and
then<00:01:42.500> before<00:01:43.220> I<00:01:43.490> connect<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.030> it's<00:01:44.990> gonna<00:01:45.229> take

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
then before I connect it it's gonna take

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.010 
then before I connect it it's gonna take
this<00:01:45.500> obviously<00:01:45.920> Apogee<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.579> and<00:01:47.090> there's

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
this obviously Apogee it and there's

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.569 
this obviously Apogee it and there's
this<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:51.710> then<00:01:51.920> you've<00:01:52.040> got<00:01:52.189> your<00:01:52.340> fans

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
this and then you've got your fans

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.569 
this and then you've got your fans
simple<00:01:53.270> like<00:01:53.420> that<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:54.680> it<00:01:54.890> really<00:01:54.920> goes<00:01:55.399> work

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
simple like that and it really goes work

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.109 
simple like that and it really goes work
but<00:01:58.579> up<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:59.390> is<00:01:59.810> coming<00:02:00.140> Oulu<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:00.890> if<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.909> gets

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
but up it is coming Oulu so if it gets

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.480 
but up it is coming Oulu so if it gets
loose<00:02:02.390> just<00:02:02.750> put<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.259> back<00:02:03.380> there<00:02:03.649> and

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
loose just put it back there and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.030 
loose just put it back there and
work

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.880 

so<00:02:09.119> that's<00:02:10.119> what<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.540> just<00:02:10.720> got<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.050> simple<00:02:11.440> fan

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
so that's what you just got a simple fan

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.270 
so that's what you just got a simple fan
and<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:13.060> only<00:02:13.240> get<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.510> use<00:02:13.810> one<00:02:13.840> battery<00:02:14.680> so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and you only get to use one battery so

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.020 
and you only get to use one battery so
it's<00:02:15.490> very<00:02:15.700> cheap<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:18.130> that<00:02:18.790> where

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
it's very cheap and this is that where

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.540 
it's very cheap and this is that where
if<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.540> not<00:02:19.720> working<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.950> probably<00:02:21.250> means

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
if it's not working it probably means

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.290 
if it's not working it probably means
