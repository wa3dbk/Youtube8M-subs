00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.440
 and well, and I made a sample here 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:49.660
 of the colors so that they can see them 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.660

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.190

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.780
 elvin green 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.720
 then the orange moon 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:35.069
 then the pure lung with English in the 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:41.730
 purple dwells after the world follows a 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:45.860
 power boat the power or something like that but this 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:51.430
 then follow the common pin 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:54.880
 and at the end is the ice yellow smoke 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.140

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.070
