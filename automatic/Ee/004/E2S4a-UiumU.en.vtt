I mean the FD rx7 is a legend and so is

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.859 
I mean the FD rx7 is a legend and so is
the<00:02:02.640> evo<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> mean<00:02:03.180> these<00:02:03.240> things<00:02:03.299> are<00:02:03.659> both

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869

was one of the standout points of the
trailer<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.800> me<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.640> just<00:03:17.670> looked<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.090> awesome

just I think a really nice little touch
and<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.800> was<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.040> fact<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.340> yes<00:03:26.670> there's<00:03:27.180> a

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300
