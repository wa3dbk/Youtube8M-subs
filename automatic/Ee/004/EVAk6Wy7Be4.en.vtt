00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.529
 and here is March 27th it means one thing 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.600
 that she showed the light of the battlefield 4 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.790
 but today we do not talk about it that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.809
 what I promised in the last issue is about 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.700
 destruction 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.530
 let's first ruin the source 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.730
 so that everything is clear Swedish 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.590
 electronic arts developers 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.110
 presented to the world battlefield bad company 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.330
 on the new force engine they promised us 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 the destruction of which the sky is not alone 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.500
 shooters but minus is that the first is bad 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.390
 The company came out only on the console and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.460
 when the developers talked about the second 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.150
 parts and that it will be possible to destroy everything 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 smithereens 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.920
 the players began to count not until the date 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.710
 release now bad company comes out like on 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 pc and on the console the output of the game was 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.120
 colossal in sales as well as 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.250
 promised now everything collapses the wall it 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.369
 shelter house is not an obstacle well 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.930
 just joy and a lot of emotions after a year 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.210
 people presented a new game from the series 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.159
 battlefield near the village there was an opinion that 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.350
 continue bad nose company instead 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.580
 showed everyone battlefield 3 on the engine 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.070
 force byte 2 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.760
 like a case of a nice new technology 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.640
 graphics 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.950
 but when we run it we do not see those 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.380
 only some of the worst damage 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.539
 parts of houses broke and they destroy for 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.030
 programming they are where to shoot 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.009
 what is the beauty of force b2 only 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.869
 graphics after stormy statements 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.869
 electronic art players decide to release 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.469
 addition to the lasso where you can supposedly 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.390
 to destroy 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.149
 it really is so well to destroy 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.460
 at least one house needed to be drunk in Moscow 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.770
 shells or take help as a technician 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.299
 for example the tank is all cool with it 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.009
 of destruction and end in 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.469
 battlefield3 despite the rest 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.539
 additions we are now judging the original 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.399
 the fact that they released the very beginning 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.130
 developers and not what complemented 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.950
 early march 2013 electronics art 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.750
 I knew that I used force b2 for 30 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.720
 percent is that in the fourth part 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.360
 send all 80 came the same 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.880
 moment and March 27th electronics art 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.160
 it seemed to you the gameplay how everything collapses 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.990
 obstacles from one shot to a point 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.730
 as in bad company 2 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.620
 also electronics told that 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.390
 use the new engine request 3 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.519
