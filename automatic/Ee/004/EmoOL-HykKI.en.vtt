 show a product that I use for the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:15.929
 paint still organized aluminum 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:19.369
 tin chrome so we vote go 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.369

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.550
 it's good sometimes we have some it's 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.100
 some pieces like this in the organized 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.210
 I'm going to start preparing now for 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.190
 paint and organized it does not stick much 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.360
 well when you apply a direct paint 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.879
 over 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.129
 she creates a paint film can 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.850
 stay, I'll show you to you here 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.620
 O 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.059
 this one was in an accident at the time of 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.269
 mount but the ink looks may 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.850
 The more the paint she releases any 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:09.160
 blow that does not stay locally 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.710
 You can pull the paint, she'll let go. 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.680
 is aluminum is worse yet 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.080
 the chrome is neither spoken nor a piece 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.259
 chrome I had a chair I'll show 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.619
 To you, she and the chair are 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.920
 showing up for you there she is 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.950
 chrome outlet too bad and I ended up 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.729
 opting to paint on the back yard of 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.190
 black and for that I used black matte 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:46.700
 niro this product that gives comics salt 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:49.160
 shop at the right time really a 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.220
 black ink only won in black ink 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.920
 It was common ground that it is actually a 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.349
 monster beach, but she comes before 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.000
 when you are going to use the beach or 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:14.060
 before the ink when you do not look okay 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:16.280
 in the case is analyzed as this is another 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.220
 product that would be is not in here 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.020
 moment the fund would be baptized before 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.910
 which only changes the color plus the function 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.830
 exactly the same as a catalyst 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.849
 including blue to matte black 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.280
 delirium 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.470
 I paid from 5 real needs to the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.550
 comics, I'll prepare here and go 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.470
 start working 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.330
 I'll apply for you will stay. 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.640
 the piece here later I'll show you 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.410
 how do I stay but the very simple application 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.330
 I even used that video of 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.790
 bike, I'll leave the link to whoever 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.350
 want to see the application of the price 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.200
 when I talked about him in the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.520
 Bike good and let's work here 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.450
 So I 'm going back, I 'm just going to prepare the 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.450
 my black matte 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:24.629
 to prepare 40 ml there for the catalyst 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:30.540
 for 2008 the proportion is 40 ml of 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:34.280
 iml very dull catalyst 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.280
 focused on being used 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.510
 I just visited my house. 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.599
 earth and finished shortly after 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.430
 clean the school that is a recommendation 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.709
 mainly with matte black has just 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.989
 paint clean soon after pistol 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.319
 because certain very fast when you 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.930
 uses a pistol with an aluminum cup 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.569
 like my when the nylon canopy and still 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.409
 is less a problem than even the ideal but 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:14.030
 in case they are not from the same corn 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.310
 so here's how I would apply 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.259
 now another ink 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.190
 I'm going to apply a cheetah actually 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:25.039
 was forced to paint or is it a privilege 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.070
 come with it up to four hours 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.770
 is the good application of matte black to 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.780
 be able to have a better grip in the case 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.889
 did a test that at least I just 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:40.099
 quote the piece is still high but as 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:44.889
 You can see, you already have one. 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.889
 Opel adhesion did not take 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:55.039
 I just painted it just has a certain 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:58.880
 with the key and the ink will not 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:02.419
 will be leaving then it is in the case taken 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.479
 It's legal a garbage heap a320 before 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:08.210
 or 400 before painting in the case of 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.340
 aluminum dodÃ´ globalizado does not need 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.199
 because he only had this tip that I had to 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.010
 You today I hope you have 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.630
 liked and good paintings with you until 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.280
 next video left with my 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.280
 a piece embrace all
