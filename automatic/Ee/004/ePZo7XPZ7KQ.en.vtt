00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.150 
every time I'm want to iron but I just
do<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.140> instead<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.829> you've<00:00:43.950> ever<00:00:44.070> been

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
do this instead so if you've ever been

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160

in<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.460> situation<00:00:44.670> where<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.390> put<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.809> like

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
in a situation where you put on like

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.660 
in a situation where you put on like
your<00:00:46.320> favorite<00:00:46.710> shirt<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.129> then<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.340> realize

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
your favorite shirt and then you realize

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.130

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
use it on very delicate shirts as you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.280 
use it on very delicate shirts as you
know<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.710> ironing<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.520> um<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.900> is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
know with ironing but like um this is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620 
know with ironing but like um this is
especially<00:01:13.890> good<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:15.060> regular<00:01:15.360> cotton

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
especially good for just regular cotton

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
especially good for just regular cotton
shirts<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.320> something<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.009> works<00:01:17.220> with

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
shirts or something but it works with

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.160 
shirts or something but it works with
other<00:01:17.700> materials<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.420> well<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.810> make<00:01:18.930> sure

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
other materials as well just make sure

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.960 
other materials as well just make sure
that<00:01:19.740> you're<00:01:19.860> cautious<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.549> are<00:01:20.610> not<00:01:20.790> using

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that you're cautious they are not using

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.670 
that you're cautious they are not using
something<00:01:21.270> very<00:01:21.570> delicate<00:01:22.049> because<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
something very delicate because I

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.160 
something very delicate because I
haven't<00:01:22.830> tried<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.520> very<00:01:24.390> delicate<00:01:24.540> shirt<00:01:24.930> but

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
haven't tried a very delicate shirt but

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.630 
haven't tried a very delicate shirt but
I'm<00:01:25.290> guessing<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.950> wouldn't<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> very<00:01:26.400> good

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
I'm guessing it wouldn't be a very good

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.700 
I'm guessing it wouldn't be a very good
outcome<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.780> you're<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> need<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
outcome so all you're going to need is a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950 
outcome so all you're going to need is a
simple<00:01:29.250> household<00:01:30.119> item<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.689> probably

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
simple household item that you probably

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.950 
simple household item that you probably
already<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.350> maybe<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.750> hair

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
already have maybe if you do your hair

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.440 
already have maybe if you do your hair
lot<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.549> straightener<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
lot so that is just a straightener and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.690 
lot so that is just a straightener and
this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.829> know<00:01:37.950> another<00:01:38.220> word<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.610> is

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
this is you know another word for it is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.249 
this is you know another word for it is
a<00:01:38.729> flat<00:01:39.000> iron<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.630> may<00:01:39.750> put<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> pieces

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
a flat iron so you may put the pieces

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.230 
a flat iron so you may put the pieces
together<00:01:40.470> all<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.549> take<00:01:42.090> your

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
together all you have to do is take your

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.670 
together all you have to do is take your
strainer<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.720> why<00:01:42.960> does<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.259> match<00:01:43.500> my

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
strainer and why does this match my

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.499 
strainer and why does this match my
shirt<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.460> awkward<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:45.270> far<00:01:45.420> as

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
shirt that's really awkward as far as

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.090 
shirt that's really awkward as far as
perfectly<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.140> there's<00:01:46.500> two<00:01:46.770> plates

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
perfectly because there's two plates

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.760 
perfectly because there's two plates
right<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.850> when<00:01:48.780> pushed<00:01:49.170> together<00:01:49.350> they

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
right here and when pushed together they

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.920 
right here and when pushed together they
just<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.280> flat<00:01:50.700> iron<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.299> clothes<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
want to know inside of this is obviously

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.630 
want to know inside of this is obviously
it's<00:02:23.810> not<00:02:23.870> just<00:02:24.230> like<00:02:24.290> one<00:02:24.620> flat<00:02:25.040> iron<00:02:25.340> that

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
it's not just like one flat iron that

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.920 
it's not just like one flat iron that
you<00:02:25.700> can<00:02:25.849> just<00:02:26.000> go<00:02:26.150> across<00:02:26.330> your<00:02:26.690> clothes

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
you can just go across your clothes

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.740 
you can just go across your clothes
really<00:02:27.110> quickly<00:02:27.530> um<00:02:27.709> it's<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.819> very<00:02:29.000> small<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.660> a

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
really quickly um it's a very small of a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.720 
really quickly um it's a very small of a
plate<00:02:30.019> so<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.440> can't<00:02:30.920> really<00:02:31.010> get<00:02:31.400> into<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
plate so you can't really get into the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.400 
plate so you can't really get into the
middle<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.120> shirt<00:02:32.390> as<00:02:32.540> easily<00:02:33.019> as<00:02:33.380> you

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
middle of the shirt as easily as you

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.390 
middle of the shirt as easily as you
would<00:02:33.799> with<00:02:34.579> a<00:02:34.610> regular<00:02:34.700> iron<00:02:35.299> however<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:36.079> is

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
would with a regular iron however it is

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.190 
would with a regular iron however it is
doable<00:02:37.400> if<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.760> just<00:02:37.940> kind<00:02:38.180> of<00:02:38.269> scrunch<00:02:39.049> your

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
doable if you just kind of scrunch your

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.069 
doable if you just kind of scrunch your
way<00:02:39.590> like<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.579> um<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:41.569> it<00:02:41.780> won't<00:02:41.959> really

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
way like this um and it won't really

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.600
