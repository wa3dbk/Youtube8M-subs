00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 I speak for myself I technical only give the 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.760
 10% the other 90 they do 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.810
 and believe me what 90 of them was was 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.950
 great 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.680
 this 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.680
 with this you put our flag 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.930
 this is our flag from here to that 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.570
 finish this 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.450
 pronounced by each of the 28 or 30 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.980
 that we are I deserve to be here be 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.140
 our place 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.570
 this is our place this our place 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.940
 and that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.990
 you and will move me with this that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.610
 do these young people 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.610
 of which I am very proud and 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.180
 and now better many of you will judge 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.820
 that this is not football I the rules or the 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.030
 expulsion what I would live football 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.250
 in the in the kingdom of adam and eva so without 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.020
 the apple until before the apple 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.660
 but someone bit the apple and and there 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.580
 decline and in this country the decline is 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.630
 very sad is very unfortunate is very 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.070
 nice 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.170
 and then 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.750
 when in this way you have to rescue 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.630
 points and I'm sorry and truly what 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.090
 I feel it's not me or mine or 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.250
 the players but every point is gold 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.350
 ground and we deserve to be 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.570
 in first vision we deserve 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.450
 be in the first division this our 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.180
 flag 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.189
 I leave with the certainty that the future 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.440
 it's still on the other side we 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.230
 we manage our future 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.510
 and every day we have more illusion and more more 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.070
 joy of staying here and then the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.170
 five games that I have left that still 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.660
 I had to scratch more points 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.210
 because with this there is no certainty 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.650
 I insist that what we are going to achieve is going to 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.900
 being very heavy is going to be very hard going to 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.510
 be very exhausting because if it is 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.090
 Weathered stirrups but but in the end 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.130
 you have these satisfactions do not insist 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.570
 the beers in the in the barrel of 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.460
 manure 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.740
 We pulled and we won is that already 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.250
 we achieved success right now it is cannon and 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.250
 as a pit I do not presume it is to presume it 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.640
 I presume 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.940
 of all 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.090
 I'm going to here 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.580
 teacher forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.400
 Sorry I'm sorry, but the rules 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.930
 I do not, and I think what is not 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.860
 We tried son but it's so much fear 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.400
 of every minute gained in a play to 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.070
 lose everything because with that you live and the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.350
 three changes were offensive today and 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.700
 lived and you treat them driven but more 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.130
 that I push the understand and the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.310
 I understand they do not want to waste in the 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.110
 70 what they did the 169 no 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.810
 they want to waste in the 85 what already 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.530
 they did 84 they do not want it and they are in their 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.140
 right reason and I support them is not the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.690
 hit since your server is here 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.460
 It is what we have sought not to 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.970
 recover the illusion and joy for the 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.830
 game 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.620
 and shout to ourselves that is 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.480
 our place and we do not want to move to 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.220
 it all cost a lot of work today 8 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.190
 players had not they did not know the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.400
 Aztecs had not stepped on this court and 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.310
 everything and that instead of weakening you served 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.300
 to motivate you this is wonderful and 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.800
 this is truly necessary until 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.870
 which is wonderful and the America is a 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.240
 wonder and all this is wonderful 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.580
 with that desire to want to return the 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.350
 next year so we play it 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.880
 I'm leaving, young people, we have the night 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.880
