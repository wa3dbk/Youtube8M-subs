he is unbelievable player he has

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.520 
he is unbelievable player he has
improved<00:02:43.160> ever<00:02:43.880> since<00:02:44.150> his<00:02:44.360> rookie<00:02:44.510> year<00:02:44.660> but

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
improved ever since his rookie year but

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.229 
improved ever since his rookie year but
he<00:02:45.739> just<00:02:45.920> doesn't<00:02:46.280> have<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.400> size<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.180> the

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
he just doesn't have the size and the

attrition<00:02:49.970> up<00:02:50.120> down<00:02:50.269> there<00:02:50.510> so<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.750> think

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
attrition up down there so I think

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.479 
attrition up down there so I think
that's<00:02:51.319> going<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.620> be<00:02:51.739> one<00:02:51.920> advantage<00:02:52.370> they're

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
get a quality shot of clay could come

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.420 
get a quality shot of clay could come
off<00:04:53.599> of<00:04:53.750> that<00:04:53.780> screen<00:04:54.169> just<00:04:54.560> let<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:54.830> fly<00:04:55.069> and

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
off of that screen just let it fly and

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.709 
off of that screen just let it fly and
that's<00:04:55.759> why<00:04:55.879> he's<00:04:56.090> going<00:04:56.210> to<00:04:56.270> be<00:04:56.389> able<00:04:56.449> to<00:04:56.599> get

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:56.719 
that's why he's going to be able to get

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:58.540 
that's why he's going to be able to get
up<00:04:56.840> shots<00:04:57.139> that<00:04:57.379> Kyle<00:04:57.590> Korver<00:04:57.949> wasn't<00:04:58.250> able<00:04:58.370> to

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
up shots that Kyle Korver wasn't able to

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.610 
up shots that Kyle Korver wasn't able to
get<00:04:58.699> up<00:04:58.849> and<00:04:59.060> ask<00:04:59.360> and<00:04:59.719> that's<00:05:00.289> going<00:05:00.409> to<00:05:00.500> put

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
get up and ask and that's going to put

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.709 
get up and ask and that's going to put
more<00:05:00.710> pressure<00:05:00.860> on<00:05:01.069> shump<00:05:01.430> JR<00:05:02.150> smith<00:05:02.419> maybe

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
more pressure on shump JR smith maybe

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.300 
more pressure on shump JR smith maybe
even<00:05:02.870> Kyrie<00:05:03.259> if<00:05:03.379> he's<00:05:03.500> switching<00:05:03.740> out<00:05:03.919> on<00:05:03.949> he's

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
even Kyrie if he's switching out on he's

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.589 
even Kyrie if he's switching out on he's
going<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.520> put<00:05:04.729> pressure<00:05:04.969> on<00:05:05.120> just<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.360> way<00:05:05.449> he

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
going to put pressure on just the way he

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.809 
going to put pressure on just the way he
runs<00:05:05.780> around<00:05:05.900> obviously<00:05:06.530> Kyrie<00:05:07.250> is<00:05:07.370> less<00:05:07.639> than

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
runs around obviously Kyrie is less than

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.580 
runs around obviously Kyrie is less than
a<00:05:07.909> hundred<00:05:08.210> percent<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.719> the<00:05:08.750> matchup<00:05:09.229> is

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
a hundred percent and the matchup is

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.680 
a hundred percent and the matchup is
between<00:05:10.039> point<00:05:10.340> guard<00:05:10.550> Steph<00:05:10.879> Curry<00:05:11.180> Kyrie

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
between point guard Steph Curry Kyrie

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.480 
between point guard Steph Curry Kyrie
Irving<00:05:12.020> but<00:05:12.259> how<00:05:12.379> much<00:05:12.500> do<00:05:12.680> you<00:05:12.740> expect<00:05:13.129> Kyrie

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
Irving but how much do you expect Kyrie

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.830 
Irving but how much do you expect Kyrie
to<00:05:13.639> be<00:05:13.729> guarding<00:05:14.060> clay<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.509> guy<00:05:14.629> that<00:05:14.810> you

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
to be guarding clay the guy that you

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.930 
to be guarding clay the guy that you
just<00:05:15.139> mentioned<00:05:15.319> given<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:15.919> fact<00:05:16.129> that<00:05:16.219> Kyrie

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
just mentioned given the fact that Kyrie

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.580 
just mentioned given the fact that Kyrie
has<00:05:17.180> been<00:05:17.389> taken<00:05:17.659> off<00:05:17.750> Derrick<00:05:18.050> Rose<00:05:18.229> at<00:05:18.409> times

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
has been taken off Derrick Rose at times

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.170 
has been taken off Derrick Rose at times
he<00:05:18.889> has<00:05:19.009> been<00:05:19.069> taken<00:05:19.490> off<00:05:19.580> jeff<00:05:19.789> Teague<00:05:20.000> at

he has been taken off jeff Teague at

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.969 
he has been taken off jeff Teague at
times<00:05:20.389> I<00:05:20.659> think<00:05:21.229> we're<00:05:21.500> going<00:05:21.680> to<00:05:21.800> see<00:05:21.830> a

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
times I think we're going to see a

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.559 
times I think we're going to see a
scenario<00:05:22.190> where<00:05:22.490> Kyrie<00:05:23.090> is<00:05:23.210> probably<00:05:23.449> going

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
scenario where Kyrie is probably going

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.029 
scenario where Kyrie is probably going
to<00:05:23.630> be<00:05:23.719> matched<00:05:23.990> up<00:05:24.139> against<00:05:24.469> Harrison<00:05:24.830> Barnes

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
to be matched up against Harrison Barnes

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.339 
to be matched up against Harrison Barnes
a<00:05:25.279> lot<00:05:25.430> you<00:05:25.969> don't<00:05:26.150> want<00:05:26.300> to<00:05:26.360> go<00:05:26.509> klay<00:05:26.960> Thompson

Barnes<00:05:31.909> is<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:32.360> guy<00:05:32.599> that's<00:05:32.870> just<00:05:33.020> you<00:05:33.469> know

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
Barnes is a guy that's just you know

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.320 
Barnes is a guy that's just you know
he's<00:05:33.680> a<00:05:33.710> spot-up<00:05:34.009> shooter<00:05:34.130> he<00:05:34.460> can<00:05:34.669> drive<00:05:34.969> and

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
he's a spot-up shooter he can drive and

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.029 
he's a spot-up shooter he can drive and
another<00:05:36.020> thing<00:05:36.139> you<00:05:36.469> know<00:05:36.560> they<00:05:36.710> share<00:05:36.919> the

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
another thing you know they share the

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.680 
another thing you know they share the
same<00:05:37.069> agency<00:05:37.699> you<00:05:37.940> know<00:05:38.090> they<00:05:38.270> said<00:05:38.479> shame

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
same agency you know they said shame

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.689 
same agency you know they said shame
agent<00:05:39.349> so<00:05:39.770> I<00:05:39.800> think<00:05:39.949> they'll<00:05:40.219> have<00:05:40.460> some

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
agent so I think they'll have some

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:41.800 
agent so I think they'll have some
little<00:05:40.849> bickering<00:05:41.060> going<00:05:41.330> on<00:05:41.449> between<00:05:41.630> those

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
little bickering going on between those

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.390 
little bickering going on between those
two<00:05:41.990> but<00:05:42.139> I<00:05:42.199> think<00:05:42.380> that's<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.620> best<00:05:42.830> scenario

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
two but I think that's the best scenario

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.550 
two but I think that's the best scenario
and<00:05:43.819> matchup<00:05:44.210> for<00:05:44.300> Kyrie<00:05:44.630> in<00:05:44.719> that<00:05:44.840> series<00:05:45.050> all
