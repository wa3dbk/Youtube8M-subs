think<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.550> use<00:01:11.700> function<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
think you have to use function up and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.300 
think you have to use function up and
down<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.020> something<00:01:13.500> long<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.220> you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
down or something long like that you

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.350 
down or something long like that you
have<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> look<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:14.730> your<00:01:14.850> keyboard<00:01:15.210> but

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
have to look at your keyboard but

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.179 
have to look at your keyboard but
that'll<00:01:15.960> give<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> ability<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.740> kind<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
that'll give you the ability to kind of

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.819 
that'll give you the ability to kind of
quickly<00:01:17.369> go<00:01:17.640> through<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.710> you're<00:01:19.710> just

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
quickly go through and you're just

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.249 
quickly go through and you're just
paging<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:20.670> bit<00:01:20.790> at<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> time<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.990> that's

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
paging a little bit at a time so that's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
paging a little bit at a time so that's
that's<00:01:22.740> another<00:01:23.009> quick<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.729> able<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that's another quick way to be able to

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.719 
that's another quick way to be able to
navigate<00:01:24.119> especially<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.729> you're

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
navigate especially if you know you're

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.340 
navigate especially if you know you're
using<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.210> lot<00:01:27.329> or<00:01:27.540> excuse<00:01:27.840> me<00:01:27.869> using<00:01:28.259> a

shortcuts<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.460> kind<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.210> bit<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
shortcuts can be kind of a bit of a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.679 
shortcuts can be kind of a bit of a
lifesaver<00:01:36.899> for<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:38.090> things<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.149> that<00:01:39.360> so

tiny or gigantic whichever but there's a

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.139 
tiny or gigantic whichever but there's a
keyboard<00:01:56.399> shortcut<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.880> which<00:01:57.119> is

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
keyboard shortcut for that which is

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.719 
keyboard shortcut for that which is
shift<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.110> left<00:01:58.140> or<00:01:58.799> right<00:01:58.979> bracket<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.610> as

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
shift and left or right bracket so as

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.219 
shift and left or right bracket so as
you<00:01:59.850> can<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.180> here<00:02:00.329> I'm<00:02:00.420> increasing<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:00.990> size

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you can see here I'm increasing the size

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.639 
you can see here I'm increasing the size
of<00:02:01.590> my<00:02:02.369> my<00:02:03.060> thumbnails<00:02:03.479> by<00:02:03.689> hitting<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
of my my thumbnails by hitting to the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.399 
of my my thumbnails by hitting to the
right<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.100> then<00:02:05.570> back<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.750> left<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.380> left

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
right and then back to the left the left

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.080 
right and then back to the left the left
bracket<00:02:07.710> will<00:02:08.009> make<00:02:08.190> them<00:02:08.310> small<00:02:08.550> something

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
bracket will make them small something

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.430 
bracket will make them small something
to<00:02:09.149> keep<00:02:09.240> in<00:02:09.360> mind<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.690> when<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.930> do<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.320> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
to keep in mind is when you do get up to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.170 
to keep in mind is when you do get up to
a<00:02:10.470> larger<00:02:10.890> size<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.310> here<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:12.030> to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
a larger size like this here I have to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.880 
a larger size like this here I have to
hit<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> couple<00:02:12.570> extra<00:02:12.930> time<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.680> size

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
hit it a couple extra time so this size

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.170 
hit it a couple extra time so this size
if<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.130> want<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.370> go<00:02:14.460> bigger<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.060> hit<00:02:15.150> it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
if I want to go bigger I have to hit it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.630 
if I want to go bigger I have to hit it
one<00:02:15.420> two<00:02:15.750> three<00:02:16.290> four<00:02:16.950> times<00:02:16.980> before<00:02:17.400> it

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
one two three four times before it

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.699 
one two three four times before it
increases<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.240> size<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:19.110> you'll<00:02:19.320> notice<00:02:19.530> that

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
increases in size but you'll notice that

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.650 
increases in size but you'll notice that
this<00:02:20.069> little<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:20.610> little<00:02:20.970> circle<00:02:21.420> thing

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
this little this little circle thing

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.410 
this little this little circle thing
here<00:02:22.080> as<00:02:22.370> I'm<00:02:23.370> doing<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.760> it's<00:02:24.000> kind<00:02:24.360> of

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
here as I'm doing that it's kind of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
here as I'm doing that it's kind of
going<00:02:24.629> down

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
going down

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.290 
going down
but<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.280> doesn't<00:02:26.430> actually<00:02:26.580> drop<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.150> size

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
but it doesn't actually drop in size

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.180 
but it doesn't actually drop in size
until<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.750> until<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.530> hit<00:02:28.710> kind<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.100> a

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
until you until you hit kind of a

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.730 
until you until you hit kind of a
milestone<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.840> that's<00:02:31.230> pretty<00:02:31.560> much

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
milestone in there so that's pretty much

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.190 
milestone in there so that's pretty much
it<00:02:31.800> for<00:02:31.980> those<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:33.570> next<00:02:33.810> thing<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.020> want<00:02:34.170> to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
it for those the next thing I want to

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.980 
it for those the next thing I want to
talk<00:02:34.380> about<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:36.210> know<00:02:36.270> if<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.510> take<00:02:36.780> an

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
talk about is you know if you take an

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.170 
talk about is you know if you take an
image<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.880> want<00:02:39.000> to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
image like this here and you want to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.470 
image like this here and you want to
zoom<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.920> couple<00:02:41.430> quick<00:02:41.550> ways<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.390> know

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
zoom in a couple quick ways is you know

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.610 
zoom in a couple quick ways is you know
you<00:02:42.570> can<00:02:42.690> hit<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.900> Z<00:02:43.080> key<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.500> will<00:02:43.590> give

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
you can hit the Z key and that will give

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.650 
you can hit the Z key and that will give
you<00:02:43.830> full<00:02:44.040> zoom<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:45.180> something<00:02:45.480> that's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you full zoom but something that's

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.840 
you full zoom but something that's
really<00:02:45.900> handy<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.280> lot<00:02:47.490> is<00:02:47.670> what

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
really handy and I do this a lot is what

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.880 
really handy and I do this a lot is what
I'm<00:02:47.940> looking<00:02:48.180> at<00:02:48.270> an<00:02:48.420> image<00:02:48.540> some<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.410> know<00:02:49.440> we

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
I'm looking at an image some you know we

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.440 
I'm looking at an image some you know we
will<00:02:50.190> work<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.730> we're<00:02:50.850> trying<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.210> work<00:02:51.300> on

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
will work on it we're trying to work on

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.670 
will work on it we're trying to work on
details<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:51.960> sometimes<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.440> want<00:02:52.590> to

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
details but sometimes we want to

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.020 
details but sometimes we want to
actually<00:02:52.770> back<00:02:53.130> away<00:02:53.370> from<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.610> we<00:02:53.790> want<00:02:53.970> to

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
actually back away from it we want to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.550 
actually back away from it we want to
see<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.210> a<00:02:54.240> little<00:02:54.360> smaller<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:54.900> just<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.530> in

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
see it a little smaller so just like in

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.350 
see it a little smaller so just like in
Photoshop<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.460> actually<00:02:56.640> hit<00:02:56.910> command<00:02:57.240> +

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
Photoshop you can actually hit command +

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.010 
Photoshop you can actually hit command +
or<00:02:57.690> minus<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:59.370> only<00:02:59.640> goes<00:02:59.850> out<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.690> know<00:03:00.810> I

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
or minus and it only goes out you know I

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.900 
or minus and it only goes out you know I
think<00:03:01.260> one<00:03:01.560> step<00:03:01.890> from<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.220> normal<00:03:02.520> view<00:03:02.700> but

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
think one step from the normal view but

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.010 
think one step from the normal view but
command-<00:03:03.810> will<00:03:04.170> allow<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:06.840> know<00:03:06.930> to

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
command- will allow it to you know to

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.330 
command- will allow it to you know to
shrink<00:03:07.350> down<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.530> little<00:03:07.710> bit<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.040> then<00:03:08.100> you

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
shrink down a little bit and then you

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.580 
shrink down a little bit and then you
can<00:03:08.460> also<00:03:08.580> hit<00:03:08.880> just<00:03:09.510> one<00:03:09.690> time<00:03:09.930> or<00:03:10.230> two<00:03:10.380> times

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
can also hit just one time or two times

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.590 
can also hit just one time or two times
or<00:03:10.980> even<00:03:11.010> three<00:03:11.400> times<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:12.240> you<00:03:12.300> can<00:03:12.570> actually

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
or even three times so you can actually

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.840 
or even three times so you can actually
zoom<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.170> much<00:03:13.470> further<00:03:13.650> than<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.220> hundred

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
zoom it much further than the hundred

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.000 
zoom it much further than the hundred
percent<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.540> always<00:03:15.780> hit<00:03:15.930> Z<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.710> be<00:03:16.800> able<00:03:16.920> to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
percent and always hit Z to be able to

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.250 
percent and always hit Z to be able to
toggle<00:03:17.190> back<00:03:17.490> in<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.940> out<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.020> able<00:03:19.110> to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
toggle back in and out to be able to

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.560 
toggle back in and out to be able to
zoom<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:20.160> that's<00:03:20.850> pretty<00:03:21.060> quick<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.420> easy
