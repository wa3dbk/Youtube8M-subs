a<00:04:07.800> better<00:04:08.010> way<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.760> realized<00:04:09.390> after<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.810> had<00:04:10.050> my

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
a better way and realized after I had my

a better way and realized after I had my
own<00:04:10.440> children<00:04:10.740> that<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.640> better<00:04:11.850> way<00:04:12.090> is

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
own children that the better way is

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.510 
own children that the better way is
really<00:04:12.600> disturbed<00:04:13.050> children<00:04:13.320> start<00:04:14.010> learning

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
really disturbed children start learning

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:22.880 
really disturbed children start learning
the<00:04:14.550> language<00:04:15.090> at<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.360> very<00:04:15.810> young<00:04:15.900> age<00:04:21.890> those

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
the language at a very young age those

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.460 
the language at a very young age those
are<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.100> children<00:04:23.370> come<00:04:23.820> from

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
are the children come from

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.980 
are the children come from
english-speaking<00:04:25.670> households<00:04:26.670> and<00:04:26.990> then

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
english-speaking households and then

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.560 
english-speaking households and then
that's<00:04:28.530> why<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.830> immersion<00:04:29.490> is<00:04:29.640> so<00:04:29.820> important

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
that's why the immersion is so important

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.790 
that's why the immersion is so important
we're<00:04:31.410> Chinese<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.310> I've<00:04:33.060> my<00:04:33.930> mom<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.620> dad

fluently I think it's important to know
your<00:04:44.880> own<00:04:45.150> language<00:04:46.520> this<00:04:47.520> is<00:04:47.670> really<00:04:47.850> the

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
your own language this is really the

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.690 
your own language this is really the
time<00:04:48.270> when<00:04:48.540> their<00:04:49.260> minds<00:04:49.470> get<00:04:49.710> molded<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.310> you

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
time when their minds get molded and you

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.630 
time when their minds get molded and you
know<00:04:50.820> they<00:04:51.620> they<00:04:52.620> form<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.040> foundation<00:04:53.190> for

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
know they they form the foundation for

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.300 
know they they form the foundation for
what<00:04:54.030> they<00:04:54.150> can<00:04:54.210> do<00:04:54.450> in<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.630> future<00:04:54.810> so<00:04:55.310> that's

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
what they can do in the future so that's

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.620 
what they can do in the future so that's
why<00:04:56.430> we<00:04:56.550> thought<00:04:56.730> it<00:04:56.850> was<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:57.060> important<00:04:57.450> to<00:04:57.480> do
