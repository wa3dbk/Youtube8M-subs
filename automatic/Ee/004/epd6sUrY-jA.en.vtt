would say maybe four to five years and
I've<00:00:18.810> gotten<00:00:19.080> some<00:00:19.109> pretty<00:00:19.410> good<00:00:19.650> use<00:00:19.859> out<00:00:20.070> of

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
I've gotten some pretty good use out of

like that
I<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:29.220> use<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.900> know<00:00:30.960> recreational

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
I just use it for you know recreational

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.209 
I just use it for you know recreational
purposes<00:00:32.570> I<00:00:33.570> don't<00:00:33.989> do<00:00:34.140> any<00:00:34.320> relic<00:00:34.680> hunting<00:00:35.010> or

purposes I don't do any relic hunting or
anything<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.670> that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
anything like that

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.110 
anything like that
I'll<00:00:37.200> take<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.770> beach<00:00:38.010> or<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.430> comb

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
I'll take it to the beach or just comb

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.170 
I'll take it to the beach or just comb
some<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.629> my<00:00:39.989> my<00:00:40.620> dad's<00:00:40.829> old<00:00:41.040> property<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.910> my

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
some of my my dad's old property and my

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.240 
some of my my dad's old property and my
property<00:00:42.440> just<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:43.620> what<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.980> come<00:00:44.010> up

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
property just to see what I can come up

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.319 
property just to see what I can come up
with<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.190> guess<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.670> perhaps<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
with so I guess in perhaps in a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.119 
with so I guess in perhaps in a
roundabout<00:00:48.600> way<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.840> might<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> relic<00:00:49.739> hunter

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
roundabout way I might be a relic hunter

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.299 
roundabout way I might be a relic hunter
but<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.210> would<00:00:51.539> say<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.780> nothing<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.129> big

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
but I would say that nothing in a big

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.060 
but I would say that nothing in a big
way<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:54.230> just<00:00:55.230> something<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> kill<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> time

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
way just just something to kill the time

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.880 
way just just something to kill the time
so<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.239> I'm<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.899> am<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
so what I'm going to do I am going to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.330 
so what I'm going to do I am going to
get<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.670> guy<00:00:59.969> set<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.289> give<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> small

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
get this guy set up and give a small

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.080 
get this guy set up and give a small
demonstration<00:01:02.899> using<00:01:03.899> different<00:01:04.409> metals<00:01:05.090> in

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
demonstration using different metals in

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.880 
demonstration using different metals in
order<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:09.320> okay<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> base

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
order to do so okay this is the base

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.470 
order to do so okay this is the base
unit<00:01:11.100> here

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:25.680 

and<00:01:17.480> here's<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.260> coil<00:01:19.160> unit<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:24.610> headphones

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
and here's the coil unit and headphones

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.200 
and here's the coil unit and headphones
headphones<00:01:26.690> are<00:01:27.350> very<00:01:27.380> important<00:01:28.310> because<00:01:28.640> it

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
headphones are very important because it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.380 
headphones are very important because it
actually<00:01:29.570> allows<00:01:30.260> you<00:01:30.560> to<00:01:30.740> hear<00:01:31.010> things<00:01:31.390> more

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
actually allows you to hear things more

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.240 
actually allows you to hear things more
clearly<00:01:32.780> without<00:01:33.260> a<00:01:33.440> lot<00:01:33.680> of<00:01:33.830> background

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
clearly without a lot of background

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.440 
clearly without a lot of background
noise<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.910> interfere<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:36.910> also<00:01:37.910> my

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
noise to interfere and also my

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.550 
noise to interfere and also my
understanding<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.140> by<00:01:39.530> using

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
understanding is that by using

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.990 
understanding is that by using
headphones<00:01:40.420> instead<00:01:41.420> of<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.900> actual<00:01:42.170> speaker

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
headphones instead of the actual speaker

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.890 
headphones instead of the actual speaker
on<00:01:44.000> here<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:45.860> can<00:01:45.890> actually<00:01:46.450> extend<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.720> life

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
on here you can actually extend the life

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.460 
on here you can actually extend the life
of<00:01:48.020> your<00:01:48.200> batteries<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.619> little<00:01:48.979> bit<00:01:50.050> okay<00:01:51.050> so

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
of your batteries a little bit okay so

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.670 
of your batteries a little bit okay so
let<00:01:52.070> me<00:01:52.130> just<00:01:52.310> take<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.550> minute<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:53.500> dig<00:01:54.500> out

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
let me just take a minute to dig out

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:05.520 
let me just take a minute to dig out
some<00:01:54.920> fresh<00:01:55.190> batteries<00:01:58.600> pop<00:01:59.600> open<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.990> cover

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:15.130 

install<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.740> batteries<00:02:12.400> okay<00:02:14.140> they

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
install the batteries okay they

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.260 
install the batteries okay they
recommend<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.830> put<00:02:15.980> one<00:02:16.250> up<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.850> one

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
recommend that you put one up and one

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
recommend that you put one up and one
down

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.020 

get<00:02:26.890> those<00:02:27.040> guys<00:02:27.220> all<00:02:27.550> tangled<00:02:27.940> up<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.540> there

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
get those guys all tangled up in there

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.390 
get those guys all tangled up in there
which<00:02:31.030> perhaps<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:34.740> see<00:02:35.740> if<00:02:35.800> we<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:36.070> close<00:02:36.250> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
which perhaps I see if we can close the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.570 
which perhaps I see if we can close the
cover<00:02:36.580> yes<00:02:36.910> we<00:02:37.060> can<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:40.300> then<00:02:40.480> we<00:02:40.660> can<00:02:40.900> just

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
cover yes we can and so then we can just

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.340 
cover yes we can and so then we can just
make<00:02:42.580> these<00:02:42.790> two<00:02:43.030> together<00:02:43.180> there's<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.900> push

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
make these two together there's a push

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.630 
make these two together there's a push
lock<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:46.500> many<00:02:47.500> different<00:02:47.830> adjustments<00:02:48.550> you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
lock and many different adjustments you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.190 
lock and many different adjustments you
can<00:02:48.670> adjust<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.210> height<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.570> this<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.990> your

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
can adjust the height of this to your

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.940 
can adjust the height of this to your
particular<00:02:51.070> needs<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:53.380> start<00:02:53.650> off<00:02:53.740> on<00:02:53.920> a

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
particular needs to start off on a

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.880 
particular needs to start off on a
shorty<00:02:54.310> here<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.930> can<00:02:56.080> plug<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.560> coil

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
shorty here and you can plug the coil

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
shorty here and you can plug the coil
into<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.780> receptacle<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.520> back<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.820> the
