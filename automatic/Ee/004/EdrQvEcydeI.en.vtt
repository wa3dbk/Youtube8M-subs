00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.269
 hello I am dominican I am 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.340
 craftsman painter decorator I 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.490
 I specialize in coatings 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.570
 decorative and traditional and I'm going 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.840
 show you today how do we 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.810
 makes an oil patina this 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.410
 patina maybe ask be sure of the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.500
 painting so on the mural 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:31.640
 either on on wood for example it you 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:39.220
 must linseed oil from the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:41.050
 turpentine from active ciq pigments 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.760
 a brush 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.670
 I took as a shadow pigment 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.949
 natural and that I left 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.239
 that I had dissolved with a small 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.500
 little alcohol to 90 to facilitate so 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.500
 this dissolution 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.750
 I need two-thirds of turpentine and 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.110
 a third 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.590
 linseed oil and I add a few 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.270
 small drops of 6 kg early and I 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:20.190
 mix everything and that's it we skated 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.729
 ready I can put it on a 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.030
 painting 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.840
 so I'm going geprim I took a little 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.740
 a small piece of raw wood furniture in pine and 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.560
 I will put my patina directly on this 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.640
 furniture 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.100
 then this patina makes it possible to see the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.569
 wood fiber in transparency but 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.149
 turns out that this is not very 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:50.399
 beautiful wood but we can see the wood 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:56.119
 appear under this patina so if I 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:02:02.990
 find that it's not dragged too dark 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:08.940
 I can take a siphon a sopalin 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.829
 to wipe it for the blurred I laid 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.870
 this patina on a wood that is not 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.269
 processed a wood that is raw 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.190
 so we can see the wood in 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.579
 transparency but you can also 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.560
 use this this turntable either on a 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.250
 wall that is already painted or be on a 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.370
 furniture that is painted and if I want that 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.430
 it is - less equal I take 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.230
 possibly sandpaper or 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.650
 glass wool 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.650
 I think 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.580
 that's it I finished so I used 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.890
 this oil patina on this piece of furniture 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.170
 not to make an aged effect but 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:55.160
 rather for for to dye so 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:57.980
 light this little wooden furniture I can 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.110
 use all the spices band of 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.000
 all the colors there I used a 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.220
 natural blond shade that allows me to 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.330
 that allows me to do an imitation of 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.690
 wood I took a little stool on 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.170
 which I already spent a layer of 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:19.880
 oil painting and I'm going now 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:24.350
 patinated this piece of furniture with the patina and if I 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:32.230
 find that my job is too thick I 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:37.569
 take a cloth I wipe the patina 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:42.130
 while respecting the wood fiber 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.130
 so I do not do that for example 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.950
 because you do not have the cutest I 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.819
 really make a move 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:57.379
 very sweet so you have the same 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:05.440
 thing to do so wiped the surplus of 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:09.920
 patina and sanded do dd I did 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.200
 simply on the painted furniture you 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.900
 this patina will allow you to give a 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.299
 aged effect that you can not find 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.440
 obviously on the small plain furniture 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.780
 now you know how 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.630
 an oil patina and you can you 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.729
 amuse to cover your furniture raw or 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.060
 your furniture already painted you will see it's 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.060
 very easy 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.140
 and
