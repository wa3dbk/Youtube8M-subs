range for this because if you're not

range for this because if you're not
experienced<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:31.950> Molly<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.759> you've<00:01:32.850> never

done<00:01:33.270> Jade<00:01:33.479> before<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.439> you're<00:01:34.590> watching<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
done Jade before and you're watching a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.050 
done Jade before and you're watching a
Jade<00:01:35.159> guide<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.579> probably<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> good<00:01:36.000> idea

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
Jade guide it's probably a good idea

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
Jade guide it's probably a good idea
that<00:01:36.360> you're<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> distance<00:01:37.110> from<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.619> magic

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that you're a distance from it and magic

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.890 
that you're a distance from it and magic
isn't<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.759> effective<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.299> old-school

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
isn't that effective on old-school

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.719 
isn't that effective on old-school
so<00:01:40.880> once<00:01:41.880> dad's<00:01:42.810> well<00:01:43.619> we'll<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so once dad's well we'll get to the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.429 
so once dad's well we'll get to the
spawns<00:01:45.030> first<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.869> should<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.110> able<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> see

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
spawns first you should be able to see

that<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.840> because<00:02:31.230> jad<00:02:31.560> will<00:02:31.740> walk<00:02:31.980> Southwest

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850

other three are a bit of a problem

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.140 
other three are a bit of a problem
because<00:02:42.630> jad<00:02:42.990> will<00:02:43.200> literally<00:02:43.590> walk<00:02:43.980> all<00:02:44.670> the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
because jad will literally walk all the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.130 
because jad will literally walk all the
way<00:02:45.180> down<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.020> basically<00:02:46.709> find<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:48.570> you

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
way down and basically find you and you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.600 
way down and basically find you and you
won't<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.500> any<00:02:49.680> safe<00:02:49.950> spot<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.550> you

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
won't have any safe spot so you

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.820 
won't have any safe spot so you
basically<00:02:51.480> standing<00:02:52.110> there<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.440> open<00:02:52.709> you

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
basically standing there in the open you

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.860 
basically standing there in the open you
can<00:02:53.040> attempt<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.520> lure<00:02:53.760> but<00:02:54.090> it's<00:02:54.209> not<00:02:54.420> worth

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
can attempt to lure but it's not worth

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.720 
can attempt to lure but it's not worth
it<00:02:55.080> in<00:02:55.230> my<00:02:55.260> opinion<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.430> might<00:02:56.580> as<00:02:56.700> well

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
it in my opinion and you might as well

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.040 
it in my opinion and you might as well
just<00:02:56.970> kill<00:02:57.150> them<00:02:57.300> as<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.600> doesn't<00:02:57.810> have<00:02:57.900> that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
just kill them as it doesn't have that

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.680 
just kill them as it doesn't have that
much<00:02:58.260> Life<00:02:58.470> Points<00:02:58.680> anywhere<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.510> more

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
much Life Points anywhere and the more

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.210 
much Life Points anywhere and the more
time<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.989> spend<00:03:01.050> luring<00:03:01.440> him<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.830> more<00:03:02.010> time

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
time you spend luring him the more time

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.290 
time you spend luring him the more time
that<00:03:02.459> you've<00:03:02.550> got<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.940> might<00:03:03.180> potentially

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
that you've got that might potentially

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.970 
that you've got that might potentially
misclick<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.050> prayer<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.500> die

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
misclick a prayer and die

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.170 
misclick a prayer and die
so<00:03:05.910> once<00:03:06.810> jad<00:03:07.110> spawns<00:03:07.820> it's<00:03:08.820> going<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.060> be

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
so once jad spawns it's going to be

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.410 
so once jad spawns it's going to be
imperative<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.940> well<00:03:11.940> actually<00:03:12.120> before

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
imperative that well actually before

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.090 
imperative that well actually before
judge<00:03:12.840> spawns<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.350> want<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.680> be<00:03:13.770> praying

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
judge spawns you want to be praying

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.400 
judge spawns you want to be praying
range<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.390> reason<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.720> probe<00:03:15.930> range<00:03:16.170> is

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
range and the reason you probe range is

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.110 
range and the reason you probe range is
because<00:03:16.770> of<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.980> sounds<00:03:17.489> if<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.760> have<00:03:17.970> your

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
because of the sounds if you have your

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.940 
because of the sounds if you have your
game<00:03:18.390> sounds<00:03:18.840> turned<00:03:19.049> on<00:03:19.320> I'll<00:03:19.590> show<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:19.860> a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
game sounds turned on I'll show you a

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.850 
game sounds turned on I'll show you a
screen<00:03:20.310> job<00:03:20.519> what<00:03:22.580> this<00:03:23.580> what<00:03:24.330> my<00:03:24.510> game<00:03:25.200> sounds

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
screen job what this what my game sounds

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.789 
screen job what this what my game sounds
was<00:03:26.100> look<00:03:26.670> like<00:03:26.910> when<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.180> had<00:03:27.630> when<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.590> was

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
was look like when I had when I was

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.890 
was look like when I had when I was
fighting<00:03:29.100> jad<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:30.150> reason<00:03:30.480> for<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.840> is

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
fighting jad and the reason for this is

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.570 
fighting jad and the reason for this is
that<00:03:31.049> you<00:03:31.230> can<00:03:31.380> hear<00:03:31.650> both<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.890> jazz<00:03:32.220> attacks

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
that you can hear both of jazz attacks

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.860 
that you can hear both of jazz attacks
you<00:03:32.730> can<00:03:32.850> hear<00:03:33.000> his<00:03:33.090> range<00:03:33.360> attack<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.810> you

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
you can hear his range attack and you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.020 
you can hear his range attack and you
can<00:03:34.019> hear<00:03:34.200> his<00:03:34.290> major<00:03:34.560> attack<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.489> reason<00:03:35.910> you

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
can hear his major attack the reason you

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
and what you're listening for if you can

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.200 
and what you're listening for if you can
identify<00:04:23.140> between<00:04:24.130> these<00:04:24.340> those<00:04:24.790> two<00:04:24.970> sounds

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210

without<00:04:25.720> even<00:04:26.200> looking<00:04:26.500> at<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.770> then<00:04:27.010> that's

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
without even looking at and then that's

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.850 
without even looking at and then that's
great<00:04:27.760> but<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.840> should<00:04:29.020> probably<00:04:29.200> be<00:04:29.560> looking

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
great but you should probably be looking

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.890 
great but you should probably be looking
at<00:04:29.980> them<00:04:30.070> at<00:04:30.190> all<00:04:30.370> times<00:04:30.610> unless<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.630> put<00:04:31.870> a

pre-arranged as explained earlier so at

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.430 
pre-arranged as explained earlier so at
about<00:04:36.730> a<00:04:36.880> half<00:04:37.060> HP<00:04:37.330> jad<00:04:38.110> is<00:04:38.380> going<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.970> summon

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
safely whereas in another spot you can't

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.490 
safely whereas in another spot you can't
do<00:05:24.640> that<00:05:24.850> so<00:05:25.420> you<00:05:25.480> need<00:05:25.720> to<00:05:25.840> just<00:05:26.020> kill<00:05:26.260> them

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
do that so you need to just kill them

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.650 
do that so you need to just kill them
whilst<00:05:26.950> attacking<00:05:27.730> Judd<00:05:28.000> at<00:05:28.150> the<00:05:28.240> same<00:05:28.450> time

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
whilst attacking Judd at the same time

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.240 
whilst attacking Judd at the same time
if<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:28.870> healers<00:05:29.230> hit<00:05:29.380> you<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:29.740> need<00:05:29.890> to<00:05:30.010> brew

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
if the healers hit you you need to brew

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.500 
if the healers hit you you need to brew
I<00:05:30.490> would<00:05:31.090> only<00:05:31.210> suggest<00:05:31.450> brewing<00:05:32.080> if<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.880> have

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
I would only suggest brewing if you have

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.920 
I would only suggest brewing if you have
been<00:05:35.110> hit<00:05:35.380> by<00:05:35.410> an<00:05:35.950> attack<00:05:36.340> from<00:05:36.970> jad<00:05:37.390> and<00:05:37.690> you

been hit by an attack from jad and you

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.640 
been hit by an attack from jad and you
have<00:05:38.110> a<00:05:38.140> little<00:05:38.440> bit<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.680> space<00:05:39.390> to<00:05:40.390> heal<00:05:41.080> so

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
have a little bit of space to heal so

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.100 
have a little bit of space to heal so
basically<00:05:41.980> is<00:05:42.370> Caston<00:05:42.940> attack<00:05:43.240> you<00:05:43.840> switch

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
basically is Caston attack you switch

you can I would take your time with it
be<00:05:55.780> careful<00:05:56.050> because<00:05:56.770> it's<00:05:57.040> very<00:05:57.190> important

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 
be careful because it's very important

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.310 
be careful because it's very important
that<00:05:57.700> you<00:05:57.880> don't<00:05:58.000> miss<00:05:58.300> especially<00:05:58.600> if<00:05:59.170> you're

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
that you don't miss especially if you're

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.220 
that you don't miss especially if you're
not<00:05:59.710> above<00:06:00.490> ninety<00:06:00.910> ninety<00:06:01.480> seven<00:06:01.780> hit<00:06:01.930> points

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
not above ninety ninety seven hit points

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.430 
not above ninety ninety seven hit points
not<00:06:02.530> ninety<00:06:03.460> seven<00:06:03.760> is<00:06:03.910> the<00:06:04.030> max<00:06:04.300> that<00:06:04.930> jag<00:06:05.200> can

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
not ninety seven is the max that jag can

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.170 
not ninety seven is the max that jag can
hit<00:06:05.650> you<00:06:05.770> so<00:06:06.040> it's<00:06:06.220> important<00:06:06.670> that<00:06:06.730> you<00:06:06.850> don't

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
hit you so it's important that you don't

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.240 
hit you so it's important that you don't
get<00:06:07.510> hit<00:06:07.660> in<00:06:07.840> ninety<00:06:08.140> seven<00:06:08.470> and<00:06:08.590> that<00:06:09.130> you

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
get hit in ninety seven and that you

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.570 
get hit in ninety seven and that you
were<00:06:09.340> above<00:06:09.550> ninety<00:06:09.910> seven<00:06:10.150> HP<00:06:10.510> if<00:06:10.720> you<00:06:10.990> can<00:06:11.230> be

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
were above ninety seven HP if you can be

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.300 
were above ninety seven HP if you can be
so<00:06:13.169> the<00:06:14.169> other<00:06:14.290> problem<00:06:14.620> with<00:06:14.740> the<00:06:14.800> healers<00:06:15.130> is

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
so the other problem with the healers is

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.730 
so the other problem with the healers is
that<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:16.690> healers<00:06:17.110> if

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
that the healers if

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.770 
that the healers if

they managed to get dad to full-hp at
any<00:06:20.080> point<00:06:20.470> they<00:06:21.400> will<00:06:21.610> respawn<00:06:22.030> so<00:06:22.660> ideally

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
any point they will respawn so ideally

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.719 
any point they will respawn so ideally

00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:57.600 
tank them only hits and you've got low
defense

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
defense

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.909 
defense
I<00:06:57.669> would<00:06:57.819> suggest<00:06:57.970> killing<00:06:58.509> them<00:06:58.659> most<00:06:59.500> people

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
I would suggest killing them most people

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.800 
I would suggest killing them most people
that<00:07:00.159> go<00:07:00.310> for<00:07:00.490> fire<00:07:00.639> kit<00:07:00.880> these<00:07:01.060> days<00:07:01.300> have<00:07:01.599> low

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
that go for fire kit these days have low

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.420 
that go for fire kit these days have low
defense<00:07:02.169> so<00:07:02.409> it's<00:07:02.560> probably<00:07:02.949> worth<00:07:03.130> killing

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
defense so it's probably worth killing

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.809 
defense so it's probably worth killing
them<00:07:04.770> after<00:07:05.770> the<00:07:05.860> healers<00:07:06.130> are<00:07:06.159> dead<00:07:06.520> it's

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:06.819 
them after the healers are dead it's

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:09.439 
them after the healers are dead it's
basically<00:07:07.240> Astra<00:07:07.930> you<00:07:08.229> know<00:07:08.349> a<00:07:08.590> long<00:07:09.159> run

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449 
basically Astra you know a long run

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:12.059 
basically Astra you know a long run
until<00:07:10.449> jad<00:07:10.840> is<00:07:11.020> dead<00:07:11.229> he's<00:07:11.560> going<00:07:11.770> to<00:07:11.830> be<00:07:11.919> high

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:12.069 
until jad is dead he's going to be high

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:13.890 
until jad is dead he's going to be high
HP<00:07:12.310> than<00:07:12.699> half<00:07:12.880> because<00:07:13.120> the<00:07:13.300> heals<00:07:13.539> will<00:07:13.810> have

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
HP than half because the heals will have

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.930 
HP than half because the heals will have
held<00:07:14.080> them<00:07:14.229> a<00:07:14.259> little<00:07:14.650> bit<00:07:14.830> probably<00:07:15.789> even

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940 
held them a little bit probably even

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.360 
held them a little bit probably even
more<00:07:16.150> than<00:07:16.360> that<00:07:16.389> and<00:07:16.860> basically<00:07:17.860> just<00:07:18.069> do<00:07:18.220> the

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370 
more than that and basically just do the

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.399 
more than that and basically just do the
same<00:07:18.610> it's<00:07:19.150> rinse<00:07:19.389> and<00:07:19.509> repeat<00:07:19.810> basically<00:07:20.259> you

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:20.409 
same it's rinse and repeat basically you

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:23.070 
same it's rinse and repeat basically you
watch<00:07:20.620> for<00:07:20.830> his<00:07:20.919> feet<00:07:21.729> you<00:07:22.330> listen<00:07:22.750> for<00:07:22.930> his

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 
watch for his feet you listen for his

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.990 
watch for his feet you listen for his
attacks<00:07:23.500> and<00:07:23.830> just<00:07:24.310> shoot<00:07:24.490> him<00:07:24.610> until<00:07:24.759> he's

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 
attacks and just shoot him until he's

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.680 
attacks and just shoot him until he's
dead<00:07:25.210> basically<00:07:25.479> it's<00:07:26.349> not<00:07:26.560> that<00:07:26.740> hard<00:07:26.949> and
