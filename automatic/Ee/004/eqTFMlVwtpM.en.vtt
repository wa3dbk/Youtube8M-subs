you<00:00:02.159> can<00:00:02.340> use<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.730> viewcube<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.510> steering

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
you can use the viewcube and steering

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.470 
you can use the viewcube and steering
wheels<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.589> navigate<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.310> 3d<00:00:05.640> scene<00:00:05.940> such<00:00:06.450> as

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
wheels to navigate in a 3d scene such as
