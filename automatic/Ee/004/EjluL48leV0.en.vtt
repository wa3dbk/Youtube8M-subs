sprouts going in there what happened was

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.500 
sprouts going in there what happened was
with<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.990> system<00:00:16.440> because<00:00:17.279> my<00:00:17.430> water<00:00:17.730> was<00:00:18.029> so

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
with the system because my water was so

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.259 
with the system because my water was so
hard<00:00:19.460> 568<00:00:21.109> parts<00:00:22.109> per<00:00:22.699> million<00:00:23.699> or<00:00:23.970> whatever

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
hard 568 parts per million or whatever

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.019 
hard 568 parts per million or whatever
it<00:00:24.330> may<00:00:24.449> be<00:00:24.680> and<00:00:25.680> hardness<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.849> was<00:00:26.939> like

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
it may be and hardness it was like

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.800 
it may be and hardness it was like
liquid<00:00:27.420> rock<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.960> made<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> pH<00:00:29.599> extremely<00:00:30.599> high

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
liquid rock I made the pH extremely high

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.880 
liquid rock I made the pH extremely high
and<00:00:31.309> nothing<00:00:32.309> would<00:00:32.430> grow<00:00:32.640> except<00:00:33.180> algae<00:00:33.890> so

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and nothing would grow except algae so

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.080 
and nothing would grow except algae so
what<00:00:35.070> happened<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> thought<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> was<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> rock

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
what happened I thought it was the rock

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.670 
what happened I thought it was the rock
and<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.360> switched<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> rock<00:00:36.960> out<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.469> some

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and I switched the rock out with some

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.950 
and I switched the rock out with some
newer<00:00:37.860> gravel<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.700> different<00:00:39.420> type<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> gravel

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
newer gravel a different type of gravel

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
newer gravel a different type of gravel
from<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> river<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.010> rapid<00:00:41.399> fire<00:00:41.579> just

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
from the river but the rapid fire just

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.850 
from the river but the rapid fire just
fine<00:00:42.239> when<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> discovered<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.469> was<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
fine when I discovered what it was the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.330 
fine when I discovered what it was the
water<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.760> gravel<00:00:45.860> after<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.920> changed

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
water and not the gravel after I changed

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
water and not the gravel after I changed
that<00:00:47.520> pH<00:00:48.120> balance<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.660> take<00:00:48.870> steady<00:00:49.110> around

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that pH balance is take steady around

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.400 
that pH balance is take steady around
seven<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.879> taken<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.629> eight<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.289> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
seven I have taken it to eight and I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.389 
seven I have taken it to eight and I
brought<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.770> back<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> 6.5<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:55.219> if<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
brought it back down to 6.5 and if you

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.770 
brought it back down to 6.5 and if you

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
took some nails treated in marietta

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.469 
took some nails treated in marietta
Cassidy<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.580> place<00:01:05.850> them<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.180> the

one<00:02:14.690> month<00:02:14.900> these<00:02:15.170> should<00:02:15.410> be<00:02:15.440> producing<00:02:15.920> some

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
one month these should be producing some

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.170 
one month these should be producing some
flowers<00:02:16.460> they're<00:02:16.610> probably<00:02:16.760> going<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.060> grow

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
flowers they're probably going to grow

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.500 
flowers they're probably going to grow
twice<00:02:17.450> as<00:02:17.510> big<00:02:17.990> as<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:19.180> yes<00:02:20.180> you're<00:02:20.420> probably

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
twice as big as this yes you're probably

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.630 
twice as big as this yes you're probably
saying<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.290> have<00:02:21.530> them<00:02:21.770> too<00:02:22.100> close<00:02:22.340> together

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
saying you have them too close together

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.410 
saying you have them too close together
that<00:02:23.120> may<00:02:23.660> be<00:02:24.110> true<00:02:24.970> well<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.030> was<00:02:26.180> going<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.360> let

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
that may be true well I was going to let

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.090 
that may be true well I was going to let
him<00:02:26.570> grow<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.050> see<00:02:27.260> what<00:02:27.380> happens<00:02:27.680> anyway<00:02:28.070> I

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
him grow and see what happens anyway I

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.640 
him grow and see what happens anyway I
keep<00:02:28.460> putting<00:02:28.670> some<00:02:29.000> piece<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.200> bamboo<00:02:30.440> and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
keep putting some piece of bamboo and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.470 
keep putting some piece of bamboo and
stuff<00:02:30.980> around<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.490> have<00:02:31.610> something<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.000> lean

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
stuff around so I have something to lean

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.950 
stuff around so I have something to lean
on<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.720> stuff<00:02:33.170> like<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.400> those<00:02:34.400> are<00:02:34.960> skimpy

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
on and stuff like that those are skimpy

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.820 
on and stuff like that those are skimpy

fast<00:02:41.390> right<00:02:41.870> now<00:02:41.930> but<00:02:42.380> don't<00:02:42.590> know<00:02:42.860> why<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:43.550> did

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
fast right now but don't know why I did

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.420 
fast right now but don't know why I did
originally<00:02:45.050> kill<00:02:45.350> some<00:02:45.650> of<00:02:45.680> them<00:02:45.920> was<00:02:46.100> when<00:02:46.310> I

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
originally kill some of them was when I

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.590 
originally kill some of them was when I
was<00:02:46.610> making<00:02:47.090> my<00:02:47.680> iron<00:02:48.680> mixture<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.640> made<00:02:50.570> some

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
was making my iron mixture I made some

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.010 
was making my iron mixture I made some
dissolved<00:02:51.230> iron<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:51.890> uric<00:02:52.460> acid<00:02:53.030> they<00:02:53.390> let

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
dissolved iron in uric acid they let

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.600 
dissolved iron in uric acid they let
dissolve<00:02:54.410> nails<00:02:54.709> until<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.250> neutral

dissolve nails until it neutral

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.780 
dissolve nails until it neutral
neutralizes<00:02:56.420> it'll<00:02:57.290> help<00:02:57.470> add<00:02:58.420> iron<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.690> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
neutralizes it'll help add iron to the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.010 
neutralizes it'll help add iron to the

time<00:03:06.230> but<00:03:06.800> you<00:03:07.010> only<00:03:07.100> need<00:03:07.280> about<00:03:07.520> a<00:03:07.640> cap<00:03:08.000> at<00:03:08.270> a

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
time but you only need about a cap at a

time but you only need about a cap at a
time<00:03:08.630> even<00:03:09.350> those<00:03:09.620> three<00:03:09.950> little<00:03:10.130> caps<00:03:10.489> less
