00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.110
 a sad page in the history of one of the most joyful Brazilians 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.930

 the plane came from rio de janeiro to ceará 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.780
 one of the scales would be in large meadow 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.540
 bad weather did not allow 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.460
 the 40 passengers 13 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.680

 renato aragão tells that the place of the accident was a forest perhaps the time 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.930
 and anguish of that moment will be left confused memories this 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.160
 business administrator is the son of the entrepreneur campinense and marvila limeira 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.520

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.430
 around there was only one corn roast paulo marcelo remembers every moment in the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 father's death day we come to hear 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.290
 the noise of the airplane 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.220
 flying over large prairie trying to land on landing approach 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.000
 ef 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.030
 I remember that my mother made a comment about his arrival at home 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.380
 but can not arrive 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.130

 52 years later what is at the scene of the accident is only exploratory 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.450
 right after the tragedy 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.860
 the place became known as the airplane chapel and to this day attracts people who 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.159
 come to find and pay promises 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.040
 in the account of Renato Aragon, many of the people who appeared shortly after the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.220
