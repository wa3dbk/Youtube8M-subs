00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.469
 the staircase is such a familiar object 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.469
 that the risks it can lead to are often underestimated 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.560
 if used incorrectly it is a tool that can cause serious accidents 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.310
 sometimes even deadly 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.269
 in fact, statistics tell us that fall injuries are among the most 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.269
 frequent in the world of work 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.870
 but they can also send accidents - gravina 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.850
 for example if you need to pick up an item out of your reach 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.950
 yes in a long thesis on the tips of the wrong feet do not try to jump 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.290
 these maneuvers carried out due to laziness can be the most dangerous 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.080
 and cause accidents 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.810
 more than you think 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.060
 the first precaution and therefore a correct organization for a work is 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.180
 It is essential to use the most suitable equipment 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.160
 to pick up an object at the top, for example, a ladder must be used 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.590
 the water 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.860
 however, the premise is necessary 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.630
 the use of portable ladders reserved only for those who have received a special one 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 training safe working with a ladder means always following the instructions 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.910
 security features specific to each type of chess 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 some pertenze are also reported on the scale 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.480
 this symbol indicates the maximum capacity of 150 kilograms 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.969
 this is the brand that certifies the construction of the staircase 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.969
 second security requirements of European regulations 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.320
 with a scale of this type 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.210
 you can be sure 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.000
 but a ladder must also be in good condition 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.100
 before using it carefully check that everything is 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.430
 in particular check that there are no tiki damaged items 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.430
 mechanisms are working 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.199
 but also incorrect use can be a source of xp 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:15.229
 in this case we observe residual adhesive tape makes you a step 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:17.379
 dangerously slippery 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.039
 so remember 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.549
 only use ladders in perfect condition 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.109
 an anonymous staircase 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.109
 it is always a dangerous scale 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.189
 let's see now how to use a ladder 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.469
 the stairs with parapet handrail on the platform 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.719
 allow greater security 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.989
 but even in this case never underestimate the dangers 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.269
 for example, do not climb with shoes that can make you slip 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.180
 like high heels 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.729
 or sandals 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.989
 only a sole with good adherence who avoids slipping 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.269
 to climb without risk 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.329
 rest your feet on the whole step nite nite heating the handrail 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.409
 when you are at the top of the ladder even if it is protected, always be careful i 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.329
 movements 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.319
 if it is necessary to perform a work at height even a simple operation such as 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.129
 the one we are seeing 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.290
 only a ladder treated with a platform and parapet allows you to run it in 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.549
 safety 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.819
 in the descent, hold onto the ladder firmly with one hand 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.359
 hey always check where he puts tt 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.359
 this is correct use 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.099
 when working at high heights 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.499
 the risk of falling ever present 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:43.009
 even from a single meter of height a fall can cause serious injury - 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.029
 so always pay attention to where you place your feet 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:50.029
 both on the platform and on the steps 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.879
 much caution also in moving the products 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.029
 do not dwell more than necessary on the ladder to check them 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:02.109
 fun and the movements you do 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.409
 an object falling from above could have serious consequences for any eventuality 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:07.779
 people in transit 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:11.009
 so move carefully 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:14.229
 and when you picked up the product 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.229
 do not indicate us with both hands occupied 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.660
 put yourself in a comfortable and safe position resting your project on 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.620
 platform 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.620
 go down grabbing by the handrail and being careful where to place your feet 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.370
 only when you are on the ground do you pick up a concert 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.710
 following this sequence of operations 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.380
 you can go down safely 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.380
 without taking risks 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.319
 a last precaution in case you have to go alone to an isolated room 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.749
 notify a colleague before entering 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:50.729
 in the event of an accident it may take some time before someone notices 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:51.119
 of you
