last like a hot bar then start flying
and<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.359> down<00:01:00.829> pretty<00:01:01.829> simple<00:01:02.039> I

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and to get down pretty simple I

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.520 
and to get down pretty simple I
think<00:01:03.199> yeah

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.100 

it<00:01:07.530> works<00:01:07.680> pretty<00:01:07.890> well

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
it works pretty well

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.210 
it works pretty well
there's<00:01:10.110> still<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> few<00:01:10.500> glitches<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.950> but

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
there's still a few glitches in it but

there's still a few glitches in it but
other<00:01:11.460> than<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:12.000> doesn't<00:01:12.299> work<00:01:12.360> it's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
other than that it doesn't work it's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:23.480

it's<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:27.320> it's<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.530> barrier<00:02:32.020> now<00:02:33.020> how<00:02:33.230> do<00:02:33.320> what

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
it's like it's a barrier now how do what

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.740 
it's like it's a barrier now how do what
you're<00:02:33.530> doing<00:02:33.710> is<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.460> rapidly<00:02:34.880> um<00:02:35.150> little

IFIF<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.760> guys<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.210> side<00:03:05.420> are<00:03:05.570> head

IFIF you guys to to the side are head
moving<00:03:06.200> around<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:07.130> you<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:07.340> shift<00:03:07.520> move<00:03:07.970> it

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
moving around so you just shift move it

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.360 
moving around so you just shift move it
and<00:03:08.390> then<00:03:08.810> block<00:03:09.320> beneath<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.680> would<00:03:10.220> break

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
and then block beneath you would break

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.960 
and then block beneath you would break
like<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:12.520> that's<00:03:13.520> essentially<00:03:13.850> what's

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
like so that's essentially what's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.030 
like so that's essentially what's
happening<00:03:14.180> here<00:03:14.330> if<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.420> want<00:03:14.600> me<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.980> go<00:03:15.980> to

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
happening here if you want me to go to

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.720 
happening here if you want me to go to
an<00:03:16.190> in-depth<00:03:16.700> tutorial<00:03:18.250> then<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.340> can't<00:03:19.610> I

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
an in-depth tutorial then I can't I

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.040 
an in-depth tutorial then I can't I
guess<00:03:20.200> if<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.260> wanna<00:03:21.380> see<00:03:21.560> how<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:23.750> actual

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
guess if you wanna see how the actual

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.650 
guess if you wanna see how the actual
placing<00:03:24.920> other<00:03:25.040> thing<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:25.340> it's<00:03:26.150> testing<00:03:26.510> for

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
placing other thing is it's testing for

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.050 
placing other thing is it's testing for
if<00:03:26.720> you've<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.900> glass<00:03:27.110> right<00:03:27.260> here<00:03:27.760> if<00:03:28.760> you<00:03:28.970> have

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
if you've a glass right here if you have

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.550 
if you've a glass right here if you have

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
glass in the correct slot watch this

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.080 
glass in the correct slot watch this
watch<00:03:30.770> the<00:03:30.950> Camaro<00:03:31.160> right<00:03:31.280> here<00:03:31.610> this

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
watch the Camaro right here this

just<00:03:36.650> happened<00:03:36.950> yes

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
just happened yes

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.180 
just happened yes
what<00:03:38.600> happens<00:03:38.930> is<00:03:39.760> this<00:03:40.760> come<00:03:41.830> this<00:03:42.830> command

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
what happens is this come this command

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.900 
what happens is this come this command
gets<00:03:43.280> activated<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:44.390> clones<00:03:46.330> this<00:03:47.330> block<00:03:48.910> down

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
gets activated it clones this block down

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.089 
gets activated it clones this block down
right<00:03:50.120> there

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.959 

and<00:03:53.269> then<00:03:54.469> if<00:03:55.469> your<00:03:55.620> know<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.129> glass<00:03:56.849> is

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:56.969 
and then if your know is that glass is

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:58.369 
and then if your know is that glass is
no<00:03:57.090> longer<00:03:57.239> in<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.540> slide<00:03:57.780> well<00:03:58.140> if<00:03:58.260> they

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
no longer in that slide well if they

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.920 
no longer in that slide well if they
wash<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.950> block<00:03:59.159> it'll<00:03:59.939> actually<00:04:00.150> click<00:04:00.540> this

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
wash the block it'll actually click this

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.530 
wash the block it'll actually click this
little<00:04:01.109> set<00:04:01.319> this<00:04:01.469> blocker<00:04:01.769> here<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.189> air<00:04:02.540> like

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
little set this blocker here to air like

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.250 
little set this blocker here to air like
so<00:04:03.750> set<00:04:04.409> up<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.709> no<00:04:04.829> longer<00:04:05.040> will<00:04:06.030> this<00:04:06.420> okay<00:04:07.200> is

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
so set up to no longer will this okay is

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.729 
so set up to no longer will this okay is
really<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:08.810> but<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.930> shift<00:04:10.170> thing<00:04:10.379> still

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
really on but the shift thing still

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.770 
really on but the shift thing still
works<00:04:10.980> now<00:04:11.370> we<00:04:11.430> get<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.120> barrier<00:04:12.390> block<00:04:12.569> still

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
works now we get a barrier block still

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.120 
works now we get a barrier block still
around<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.049> can<00:04:13.170> do<00:04:13.349> that<00:04:13.549> um<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:15.859> will<00:04:16.859> also

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
around you can do that um I will also

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.259 
around you can do that um I will also
make<00:04:17.310> um<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.910> just<00:04:18.840> have<00:04:19.139> his<00:04:19.410> earlier

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
make um I just have his earlier

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.279 
make um I just have his earlier
essentially<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:22.650> can<00:04:22.740> also<00:04:22.949> having<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.310> fill

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
essentially you can also having a fill

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.909 
essentially you can also having a fill
replace<00:04:25.289> barrier<00:04:25.620> blocks<00:04:27.680> once<00:04:28.680> you<00:04:28.770> got<00:04:28.889> a

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
replace barrier blocks once you got a

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.520 
replace barrier blocks once you got a
certain<00:04:29.130> range<00:04:29.280> Ursula<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.669> can<00:04:29.789> add<00:04:29.940> more

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
certain range Ursula you can add more

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.360 
certain range Ursula you can add more
little<00:04:31.530> things<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:31.770> knew<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:31.919> if<00:04:31.979> you<00:04:32.039> want<00:04:32.220> to

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
little things I knew it if you want to

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.210 
little things I knew it if you want to
