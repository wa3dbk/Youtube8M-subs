00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.130 
something I heard from mass last week is
that<00:02:59.519> Christmas<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.420> time<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.930> celebrate

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
that Christmas is the time to celebrate

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.789 
that Christmas is the time to celebrate
the<00:03:01.620> birth<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:01.980> Jesus<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.790> earth<00:03:03.000> and

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
the birth of Jesus on to earth and

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.960 
the birth of Jesus on to earth and
during<00:03:04.799> this<00:03:04.890> time<00:03:05.040> we<00:03:05.340> should<00:03:05.400> also<00:03:05.670> think

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
during this time we should also think

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.600 
during this time we should also think
about<00:03:06.120> how<00:03:06.510> Jesus<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.409> born<00:03:07.709> within<00:03:07.980> us<00:03:08.310> or

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
about how Jesus can be born within us or

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.400 
about how Jesus can be born within us or
the<00:03:08.790> spirit<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.209> Jesus<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:09.870> be<00:03:09.989> born<00:03:10.200> within

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the spirit of Jesus can be born within

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.259 
the spirit of Jesus can be born within
us<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.370> think<00:03:11.459> that's<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.879> very<00:03:12.030> very
