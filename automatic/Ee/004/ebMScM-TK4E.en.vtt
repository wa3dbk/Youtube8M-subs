doesn't really have anything to do with
the<00:00:48.870> game<00:00:49.220> but<00:00:50.220> I<00:00:50.250> guess<00:00:50.460> we'll<00:00:50.640> see<00:00:56.810> so<00:00:57.810> here

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
the game but I guess we'll see so here

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.210 
the game but I guess we'll see so here
we're<00:00:58.860> back<00:01:00.800> where<00:01:02.450> the<00:01:03.450> game<00:01:03.690> ended<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.829> I
