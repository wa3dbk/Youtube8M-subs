00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
during the Second World War we had of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.060 
during the Second World War we had of
course<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.980> blackout<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.719> buses<00:00:40.290> had<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
course the blackout and so buses had to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
course the blackout and so buses had to
emit<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.420> little<00:00:42.870> light<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.530> possible<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
emit as little light as possible so the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.110 
emit as little light as possible so the
headlamps<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.320> these<00:00:46.590> masks<00:00:47.430> fitted<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
headlamps have these masks fitted to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.279 
headlamps have these masks fitted to
them<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:50.430> show<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:51.030> very<00:00:51.360> small<00:00:51.809> amount<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
them to show a very small amount of

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.840 
them to show a very small amount of
light<00:00:52.530> down<00:00:52.860> onto<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> ground

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
light down onto the ground

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.450 
light down onto the ground
usually<00:00:54.840> these<00:00:55.020> spot<00:00:55.530> lamps<00:00:55.949> here<00:00:56.190> would<00:00:56.399> have

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
usually these spot lamps here would have

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.250 
usually these spot lamps here would have
been<00:00:56.520> disconnected<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.719> were<00:00:57.809> not<00:00:58.020> allowed

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
been disconnected they were not allowed

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.279 
been disconnected they were not allowed
to<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.469> used<00:00:58.829> during<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> war<00:01:00.140> during<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
to be used during the war during the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.100 
to be used during the war during the
blackout<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.190> course<00:01:02.460> people<00:01:03.059> found<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.019> very

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
blackout of course people found it very

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.950 
blackout of course people found it very
difficult<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:05.010> vehicles<00:01:05.339> coming<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.210> so

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
difficult to see vehicles coming and so

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.980 
difficult to see vehicles coming and so
these<00:01:07.380> white<00:01:07.710> patches<00:01:08.070> were<00:01:08.610> painted<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
these white patches were painted on the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.580 
these white patches were painted on the
wings<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.159> mud<00:01:11.310> guards<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.659> buses<00:01:13.049> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
wings the mud guards of the buses to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.270 
wings the mud guards of the buses to
help<00:01:13.830> pedestrians<00:01:14.520> see<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> dark

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
help pedestrians see them in the dark

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.370 
help pedestrians see them in the dark
there's<00:01:17.280> also<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.700> strange<00:01:18.509> little<00:01:18.930> thing

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
there's also this strange little thing

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.340 
there's also this strange little thing
fixed<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.310> mud<00:01:21.119> guard<00:01:21.420> which<00:01:21.689> many<00:01:21.930> people

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
fixed to the mud guard which many people

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.800 
fixed to the mud guard which many people
wonder<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:22.979> they<00:01:23.880> may<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.600> an

people's feet this is one of my local
routes<00:01:44.009> 438<00:01:44.820> although<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> actually<00:01:46.140> rode

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
routes 438 although I actually rode

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.609 
routes 438 although I actually rode
mainly<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> 38<00:01:48.299> ie<00:01:48.630> which<00:01:49.079> was<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> version

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
mainly on the 38 ie which was a version

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.429 
mainly on the 38 ie which was a version
of<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> 38<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.850> lot<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.270> these<00:01:51.390> had<00:01:51.750> petrol

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
of the 38 a lot of these had petrol

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
of the 38 a lot of these had petrol
engines<00:01:52.860> rather<00:01:53.220> than<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> diesel<00:01:54.060> engine

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
engines rather than the diesel engine

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.330 
engines rather than the diesel engine
that<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.780> expect<00:01:55.290> now<00:01:55.500> although<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.829> few<00:01:56.100> have

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that we expect now although a few have

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950 
that we expect now although a few have
diesel<00:01:56.520> engines<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.360> think<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
diesel engines but I think this is a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.789 
diesel engines but I think this is a
petrol<00:01:58.409> engine<00:01:58.700> version<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.469> they<00:02:01.469> were<00:02:01.649> very

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
petrol engine version and they were very

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.240 
petrol engine version and they were very
heavy<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.549> drive<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:04.409> driver<00:02:04.710> had<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.040> work

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
heavy to drive the driver had to work

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.219 
heavy to drive the driver had to work
very<00:02:05.520> hard<00:02:05.610> they<00:02:06.090> had<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> crash<00:02:07.229> gearbox<00:02:09.229> but

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
very hard they had a crash gearbox but

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.690 
very hard they had a crash gearbox but
we're<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> very<00:02:11.160> sturdy<00:02:11.790> vehicle
