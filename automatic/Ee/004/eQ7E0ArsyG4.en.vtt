00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.330
 hello everyone just happened to be an incident 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.320
 small cut wipe glass 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.740
 I did not guess to put the keys 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.289
 machines but ultimately it 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.580
 blocked it is necessary to check the door 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.680
 something on bad kontachit good that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.670
 next to the house 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.000
 I had to run after me with one more 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.820
 crochet well here today we hit it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.309
 lucky such a situation remember in the seven 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:36.530
 I had to kill try to remove 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.530
 codes from cars 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.840
 I listen to the box like this 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.950
 way in without points 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:56.730
 something somewhat unpleasant so mean by 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:59.640
 codes so it means to 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.649
 output self-test more precisely the amount 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.049
 bus showed codes need 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.640
 and turn the handle once 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.060
 a few controversial issues where 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.070
 twist 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.659
 well let's start first what's the key 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.869
 must first put his wife here 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.880
 it now remains to speculate what 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.450
 wow and what is it three times ahead 3 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.970
 times back that is by spear method found out 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.960
 what does it mean it means you need 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.240
 first key until it stops itself that is 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.340
 not the side where the machine starts working 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.770
 ignition appears firmly like a in 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.500
 turn the back side and already out 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.079
 of this position we skip 3 positions 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.619
 On he about concept he this when ignites 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:47.790
 light on the tidy principle, easy and simple 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.689
 all the principle is clear means to yourself and from 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.549
 himself already three times he does not leave him 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.229
 that is, the tidy begins to light up 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.299
 the sensor which purchases are possible 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.310
 read it reads as I understand it 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.180
 5 times, that is, the signal can be two 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.570
 maybe three 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.860
 maybe several times that is necessary 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.069
 subtract this combination that is 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.690
 number of times megane is valid 1 2 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.319
 short pause 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.459
 one two Three 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:23.879
 4 for example or once two three 4 5 here 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:27.319
 try something either come up so 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:34.790
 so we go according to our garbage 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:46.950
 we start it and her on myself until it stops 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:52.769
 there and backward back two back 3 and 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:03:25.650
 leave translate and wait for the translation we 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:03:28.579
 waiting 233 there are 3 4 6 3 4 5 really 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.579
 to focus 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:53.490
 but apparently everything died and such 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.870
 feeling that everything works perfectly and i 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.870
 there are codes again
