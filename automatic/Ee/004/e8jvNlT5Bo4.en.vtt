00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.750
 6 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:27.730
 absorbed oxygen 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:54.019
 in germany it is not a next kamp 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:55.970
 lilian came now no one stands here 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.989
 So the stone age food network 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.519
 dry meat I just say 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.140
 In the Stone Age there was print 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:10.670
 meat yes that's out you hardly like it 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.410
 Do the New Zealand turf believe that 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.940
 were now slaughtered in New Zealand 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.739
 is not on it all cases were 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.980
 then in the usa to this stuff 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.340
 processed and they only take the best 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:27.980
 He also sees that he is not 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:30.440
 a little bit around me that the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.420
 FiletstÃ¼ckchen I mean at 25 grams 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:38.900
 they are even 25 grams even more 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.430
 had wonderful meat smell all 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.430
 vegetarians will not like that 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.290
 meat enjoyment of prices maybe not 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.220
 I already have people vegetarian 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.450
 converted back to meat consumption 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.569
 Let me know again when I do that 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.099
 made 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.560
 yes it is very special on one 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.549
 page that is totally unfamiliar on the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.250
 I can understand the other side already 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:09.109
 that it is cool instead of, so to speak 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:18.100
 now my job to chew you trust 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:18.100
 here a meat broke down 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:38.120
 totally spice mix so these chicken 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.099
 bites just give jerky one back 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.099
 others give another kind so 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:46.550
 in the search box on a canal or on the 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:57.380
 homepage can also be just like google 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:05:00.740
 docs by all means i say yes all 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.180
 So gourmet so you feel like 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.599
 somehow in another world if you can 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.330
 that's just maybe tried 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.520
 that maybe we 'll see that's how it is 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.020
 wanted to say something like that right now 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.550
 I have all the episode messed up here 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.590
 Wanted to say is the chic jackies 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.539
 they seasoned that properly 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.130
 here is almost did not know that is 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:32.630
 is really on the letter taste 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:33.949
 That's enough and better still 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.380

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.680
