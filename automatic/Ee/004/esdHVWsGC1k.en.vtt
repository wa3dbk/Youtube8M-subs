quite as well and any bigger than that I

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.430 
quite as well and any bigger than that I
don't<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:42.690> they<00:00:42.840> work<00:00:43.020> quite<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.410> well

although<00:00:43.800> they<00:00:43.950> will<00:00:44.219> absolutely<00:00:44.820> work<00:00:45.539> now

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
although they will absolutely work now

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.290 
although they will absolutely work now
one<00:00:46.680> thing<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.039> need<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.250> make<00:00:47.370> sure<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.090> do

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
one thing you need to make sure you do

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.910 
one thing you need to make sure you do
when<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.750> get<00:00:48.899> these<00:00:49.079> little<00:00:49.379> crabs<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.800> can

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
when you get these little crabs you can

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.860 
when you get these little crabs you can
if<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.160> buy<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> bait<00:00:50.910> shop<00:00:50.940> more<00:00:51.690> than

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
if you buy from the bait shop more than

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.630 
if you buy from the bait shop more than
likely<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.350> claws<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.920> gone<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.489> they

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
likely the claws will be gone like they

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.600 
likely the claws will be gone like they
are<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.960> see<00:00:55.500> them<00:00:55.649> out<00:00:56.039> swimming

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
are here if you see them out swimming

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.389 
are here if you see them out swimming
and<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.899> dip<00:00:58.170> them<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.530> they'll<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and you dip them up they'll have the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.760 
and you dip them up they'll have the
claws<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
claws and all you have to do is get a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.700 
claws and all you have to do is get a
pair<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.100> pliers<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.660> squeeze<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.379> claw

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
pair of pliers and just squeeze the claw

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.429 
pair of pliers and just squeeze the claw
and<00:01:05.010> he'll<00:01:05.640> let<00:01:05.850> go<00:01:06.119> from<00:01:06.360> right<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and he'll let go from right there the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.490 
and he'll let go from right there the
claw<00:01:07.710> let<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.460> pop<00:01:08.700> off<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> reason

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
claw let go and pop off now the reason

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.399 
claw let go and pop off now the reason
that<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.920> don't<00:01:11.250> use<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.000> claws<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.689> because

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that you don't use the claws is because

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.109 
that you don't use the claws is because
when<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.740> hook<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.130> crab<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.700> your<00:01:14.909> line

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
he'll reach up with his claws and grab

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.429 
he'll reach up with his claws and grab
your<00:01:18.030> leader<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.479> grab<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.900> hook<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.110> won't
