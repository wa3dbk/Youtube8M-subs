 I liked it and you're going to have it here 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.970
 below here in the part of the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.230
 It is here that the truth is that I'm not going 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.140
 to pronounce his name because he has a 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.730
 very weird man is red is worth 82 thousand 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.440
 dollars the truth is that it's a little bit 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.660
 face pass a motorcycle is the most motorcycle 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.780
 faces that are there but good and then the other 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.910
 that we have is this the lfp as a 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.730
 little bit more roll or harley like that and so on and 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.590
 Well, here you have them in the garage 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.240
 Well here you have the first bike that 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.680
 I really want to try it, I have not 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.660
 I've still only tried them here 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.640
 Well, next I'll be tuning them 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.500
 so you can see it because the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.060
 tuneo that can be done to them and others 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.470
 and good if they improve a lot in speed 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.480
 Well, with the speed tests we're going 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.370
 to do well the next thing we have 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.780
 here on the other motorcycle is here that the 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.300
 truth is that it has a very very design 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.340
 handsome very weird too but very cool the 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.740
 I really liked the design 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.410
 so a little bit about the design but very 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.900
 cool and then here we have the furor gt 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.540
 Well, the truth is that it looks like 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.550
 enough to other vehicles already of gta no 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.280
 is that it was a spectacular model 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.410
 and others but good we're going to try it and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.900
 let's see what he is capable of doing against 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.100
 other vehicles of the same category 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.810
 so good guys this is in the 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.880
 Vehicle section 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.890
 now let's go to the weapons section here 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.410
 in the weapons section, because they have 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.030
 put two new weapons that the truth is 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.370
 that I have tried these and tested them 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.510
 that are very cool now you will see it and 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.270
 Well we have put this shotgun 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.830
 heavy and this rifle shooter that good 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.989
 it's like a kind of sniper 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.090
 but now you will see the peculiarity that 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.010
 It's good then we're going to buy the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.690
 two weapons I will put them then 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.880
 absolutely all the improvements that are 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.709
 they can do it to him and other that yes yes I have not 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.040
 put silencer to none then for 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.319
 prevent me from losing a bit of what I know 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.569
 of precision at the time of shooting or of 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.459
 reach is worth but yes I have put the 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.440
 grip and others I have put all 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.239
 the improvements good there is a pink tint 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.190
 so that it looks good that as you see 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.410
 it looks a little more detailed what it is 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.819
 the model of the weapon itself and well then 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.790
 this shotgun 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.620
 he paints very well but I stay more with 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.720
 this rifle the shooter's rifle the truth 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.670
 is that I liked it a lot even though I 've 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.590
 removed an inconvenience that now I'm going 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.989
 to comment since now you are going to be able to 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.430
 see in action these two weapons and good 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.010
 here we have the first shot 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.569
 the heavy shotgun that the truth is that 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.670
 it's very good shoots 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.650
 normal speed is not very fast 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.019
 decadence but yes it is true that 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.370
 it has a pretty good range as 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.870
 you see reaches those vehicles that 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.999
 they are there the truth that is pretty 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.310
 chula I liked it a lot and here we have 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:43.400
 the shooter's rifle that has one thing 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.200
 very good and a very bad thing the first 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.939
 he looks at me personally I do not like 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.469
 this looks but well this is for tastes 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.510
 obviously but it has one thing very 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.790
 good and it is that it is automatic that is not 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.950
 of these bolt that fires once 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.599
 recharge is not firing until it 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.180
 empty the charger as you see is one thing 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.919
 quite very cool but has a 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.659
 big problem and it's that you do not zoom the 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.370
 look at that is the small inconvenience that 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.319
 I ended up with this weapon but 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.849
 the truth is very well that I am 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.769
 he liked it a lot and here in the 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.269
 clothing section as it could not be 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.730
 otherwise you know that in all 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.959
 dlc put us clothes then in this dlc we 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.419
 they have put clothes rolled up do not be 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.280
 special police equipment or something 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.300
 that's fine since the df I think it's about 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.250
 that basically of 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.539
 roll then operation teams 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.909
 special and others the truth is that the 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.810
 water for clothes is very beautiful is 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.310
 very cool 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.289
 the roll as I told you there for 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.940
 infiltrate this has quite molated me 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.680
 as well as the black helmet the mask 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.690
 although I have put more good this 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.520
 it's more clear that it looks a lot more 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.050
 the mask the truth that is very very 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.900
 well and we can alternate then between 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.690
 various types of outfits but also 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.490
 good if you do not like to put yourself 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.139
 attire of a color everything you can 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.210
 vary put the top part of a 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.740
 color the one below, another color and so on and 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.210
 Well then for it all 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.009
 what you have to do is put us here in 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.430
 the zone of posts for example the part 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.409
 above 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.419
 well you can obviously put then 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.940
 your good crew you can put here 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.560
 in the clothing part what is the part 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.599
 top of the clothes and here you can 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.129
 vary where it puts here part of above 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.770
 of equipment here you can vary by 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.750
 colors of the different types of 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.000
 models of both the top and 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.409
 in the bottom part and you will say and 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.050
 If I want to change my helmet and 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.599
 I want to put another helmet of that style and 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.639
 another color simply because nothing you 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.199
 you have to approach the area of ​​the 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.880
 masks that you already know is close to 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.449
 the beach that is the shop of the 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.249
 More expensive 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.949
 and well, here we have the 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:37.319
 masks of this type of these that have 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.120
 Military post here you can 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.919
 vary between different colors if 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.139
 You do not like it as I told you if you do not 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.449
 like to have the equipment of the same color 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.490
 and they have also put some that the truth 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.889
 is that I have not seen them more than here 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.020
 in the mask shop, I have not 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.900

 the colors are the same gray 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.729
 carbon color is worth a little bit like that 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.639
 all the same colors of the equipment 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.479
 that they have put then in the masks 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.430
 they just put on those masks 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.379
 special the truth is that I have not seen 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.770

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:15.300

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.599
 this time they have not put anything they have not 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.729
