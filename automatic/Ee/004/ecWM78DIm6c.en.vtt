00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 very days friends youtube writers 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.330
 a year ago and six months ago I did 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.230
 a video about the cloud and today I want to give 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 as an update to that same situation, 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.950
 I'm going to do a tutorial on how 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.389
 unblock it but I want to talk to you about 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.350
 so let's go with then and let's start 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.350
 with the video 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.349
 ready as I said at the beginning a year ago 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.529
 I made a video where I was 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.570
 talking about the icloud unlocking I was 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.599
 talking about icloud in general how 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.850
 works and that did not exist in that 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.860
 time an unlocking and that's why 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.530
 I decided today to make another video 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.449
 kind of update type to talk 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.550
 a little bit of that situation we're going to 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.559
 start first with what is the 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.600
 icloud unlocking that is icloud 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.410
 I know that many are maybe new and 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.960
 They do not know what this is in ios since 7 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.540
 I think it was that something came out that is like 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.360
 icloud lock the device is a 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.000
 lock more personal type that does 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.640
 directly the user to his device 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.130
 you block it so you can find the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.290
 device in case the one that 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.320
 found or the one who stole your device 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.659
 I have it on you can locate it and 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.760
 look for it and block it and that person does not 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.850
 will be able to use that device that was 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.290
 when it came ios 7 that I 'm going to give 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.170
 video down here where I talk more 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.090
 of the matter my boss missed the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.950
 iphone and he called me and I 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.509
 to find it that video has more flame 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.310
 of half a million visits I will give 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.570
 down here too for you to see it for 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.429
 that they understand a little more how 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.799
 iCloud works now what is the 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.439
 situation when you do that 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.939
 block when you lose your 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.229
 device or when someone is 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.560
 find a device that has that 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.590
 blocking so far or good up 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.840
 a time ago it was impossible to do that 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.459
 unlocking and that the device 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.109
 will work today I said open we are going to 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.149
 start investigating about that because 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:59.149
 many are asking me that if 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.590
 may or may not be like I am in this 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.390
 video from a year ago back day that 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.280
 I was never going to show a tutorial of how 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.810
 do it and I still have the same 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.329
 position will never show a tutorial 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.390
 I have an unlock service but 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:13.370
 is the unlocking of not the angry one 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.049
 but the unlocking that you can use 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.430
 the device with another company by 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.590
 haiti example in you 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.910
 verizon sprint we block that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.470
 let's talk a little bit of Spanish or 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.239
 travel down here in case you 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.920
 want to explain a device that is 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.900
 with that situation that you do not 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.209
 can use with any other company 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.330
 now the icloud you can not use 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:36.530
 I tell you with nothing 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.960
 if we have lasted there, it took us two 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.120
 hours researching we did a livestream 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.010
 also from parrot where we were 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.260
 talking about that and the conclusion is of 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.720
 that if you can there are services that 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.180
 they do I will recommend it none 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.840
 because I did not buy my recommendations 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.550
 a device with icloud try 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.280
 make sure before you buy a 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.420
 device now if you already have one 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.610
 I have heard many cases of scams ok 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.380
 that are robbing people because 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.970
 I can unlock it, send me a 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.260
 device some people that were 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.370
 watching livestream he told me he could 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.810
 do and he told me that I sent him the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.209
 device well no no no no 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.730
 so you have to be careful with that 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.950
 there are people who do it online services and 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.130
 they ask you to pay you have to make sure 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.380
 you know that person and all 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.150
 that so that it is not so and also 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.800
 that if you are in a scam on paypal 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.770
 you can report that and pay for the 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.300
 help I wanted to tell you that unlike 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.390
 from the other video I made a year ago 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.580
 back in that time you could not now if 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.450
 You can follow me in the same position 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.980
 what 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.720
 I recommend anyone to buy 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.200
 devices with icloud 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.170
 they are ripping off many people with 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.879
 that buying selling it on 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.360
 device they sell it to a person who 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.130
 he does not know he has icloud and also that 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.220
 person in desperation looks for one of 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.170
 these services where I was 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.300
 I was talking to an expert who 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.459
 does I also respect your business and 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.709
 everything and he was telling me that to him 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.470
 many people come complaining that 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.910
 They have already stolen and do not trust much in 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.519
 his service and he was ready 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.680
 talking a little about what the process is 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.440
 which it takes for that to so 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.299
 least know in whom to trust who does not 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.040
