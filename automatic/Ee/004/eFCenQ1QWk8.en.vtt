where the pumps going to pump in the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:50.910 
where the pumps going to pump in the
water<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.280> fill<00:00:43.580> it<00:00:43.760> up<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:46.180> yeah<00:00:48.430> um<00:00:49.540> that's

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
water and fill it up and yeah um that's

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.200 
water and fill it up and yeah um that's
pretty<00:00:51.920> much<00:00:52.100> it<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.520> first<00:00:52.760> time<00:00:52.850> I<00:00:52.970> did<00:00:53.090> that

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
pretty much it the first time I did that

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.880 
pretty much it the first time I did that
it<00:00:53.510> sprayed<00:00:53.810> everywhere<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:54.470> I<00:00:54.530> had<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.650> cover

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
it sprayed everywhere so I had to cover

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.980 
it sprayed everywhere so I had to cover
it<00:00:55.100> with<00:00:55.220> that<00:00:55.400> I'm<00:00:56.030> just<00:00:56.330> testing<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.750> pump

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
it with that I'm just testing the pump

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.950 
it with that I'm just testing the pump
here<00:00:57.880> turns<00:00:58.880> on<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.360> you<00:00:59.450> can<00:00:59.570> see<00:00:59.720> the<00:00:59.810> water

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
here turns on and you can see the water

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.310 
here turns on and you can see the water
filling<00:01:00.380> up<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:00.740> fills<00:01:00.980> up<00:01:01.160> really<00:01:01.430> quick<00:01:01.730> that

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
filling up it fills up really quick that

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.869 
filling up it fills up really quick that
the<00:01:03.320> drainage<00:01:03.950> probably<00:01:04.189> came<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:04.460> 10<00:01:04.640> foot

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
the drainage probably came in 10 foot

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.060 
the drainage probably came in 10 foot
lengths<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:05.299> I<00:01:05.360> decided<00:01:05.659> cut<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.470> in<00:01:06.560> five<00:01:06.740> foot

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
lengths so I decided cut it in five foot

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.010 
lengths so I decided cut it in five foot
and<00:01:07.280> that's<00:01:07.490> just<00:01:07.670> going<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.939> use<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.150> 15<00:01:08.810> foot

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
and that's just going to use the 15 foot

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.690 
and that's just going to use the 15 foot
length<00:01:09.259> but<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.560> see<00:01:09.740> now<00:01:09.860> well<00:01:10.070> at<00:01:10.190> pump<00:01:10.400> so

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
length but I see now well at pump so

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.450 
length but I see now well at pump so
it's<00:01:11.390> decided<00:01:11.540> I'd<00:01:11.960> end<00:01:12.200> up<00:01:12.260> using<00:01:12.500> both<00:01:12.860> five

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
it's decided I'd end up using both five

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.160 
it's decided I'd end up using both five
foot<00:01:13.640> lengths<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:14.420> can<00:01:14.570> see<00:01:14.690> when<00:01:14.810> i<00:01:14.840> turn<00:01:15.080> the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
foot lengths you can see when i turn the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.270 
foot lengths you can see when i turn the
pump<00:01:15.380> off<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.490> water<00:01:16.700> will<00:01:16.909> drain<00:01:17.210> from

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
pump off that the water will drain from

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.240 
pump off that the water will drain from
the<00:01:19.280> pipe<00:01:19.820> back<00:01:20.570> into<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.110> reservoir<00:01:21.290> just<00:01:22.100> by

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
the pipe back into the reservoir just by

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.440 
the pipe back into the reservoir just by
its<00:01:22.430> own<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:24.280> that's<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.520> but<00:01:25.909> it<00:01:26.030> will<00:01:26.180> need

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
its own so that's that but it will need

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.860 
its own so that's that but it will need
an<00:01:27.020> overflow<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:28.370> stop<00:01:28.580> it<00:01:28.790> from<00:01:28.940> over<00:01:29.330> when<00:01:29.840> I

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
an overflow to stop it from over when I

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.719 
an overflow to stop it from over when I
go<00:01:30.020> when<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.500> pumps<00:01:30.800> too<00:01:30.950> much<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.400> can't<00:01:31.610> you

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
go when it pumps too much you can't you

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.100 
go when it pumps too much you can't you
own<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:32.000> spilling<00:01:32.240> out<00:01:32.450> everywhere<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.020> you

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
own it spilling out everywhere so you

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.289 
own it spilling out everywhere so you
put<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:33.590> an<00:01:33.680> overflow<00:01:34.190> you'll<00:01:34.729> take<00:01:34.970> a<00:01:35.000> look<00:01:35.210> at

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
put in an overflow you'll take a look at

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.149 
put in an overflow you'll take a look at
that<00:01:35.420> later<00:01:35.720> on<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.409> drains<00:01:36.680> back<00:01:36.920> into

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
that later on and it drains back into

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.080 
that later on and it drains back into
the<00:01:37.280> reservoir<00:01:38.799> mmm<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:40.040> timer<00:01:40.340> system<00:01:40.880> to

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
the reservoir mmm the timer system to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.820 
the reservoir mmm the timer system to
operate<00:01:41.120> the<00:01:41.630> pump<00:01:41.840> originally<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:42.590> thought<00:01:42.650> I

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
operate the pump originally I thought I

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.410 
operate the pump originally I thought I
could<00:01:43.070> do<00:01:43.190> it<00:01:43.220> with<00:01:43.430> something<00:01:43.640> like<00:01:43.909> that<00:01:44.150> but

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
could do it with something like that but

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.440 
could do it with something like that but
that's<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.810> hundred<00:01:45.080> and<00:01:45.290> twenty<00:01:46.030> bolt<00:01:47.030> timer

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
that's a hundred and twenty bolt timer

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.980 
that's a hundred and twenty bolt timer
and<00:01:47.870> i'm<00:01:48.020> running<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.409> 12-volt<00:01:48.920> system<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:50.390> that

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
and i'm running a 12-volt system so that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.899 
and i'm running a 12-volt system so that
wouldn't<00:01:51.979> work<00:01:52.010> even<00:01:52.430> though<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.610> currents

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
wouldn't work even though the currents

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.660 
wouldn't work even though the currents
going<00:01:53.090> through<00:01:53.360> now<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:54.650> power<00:01:54.920> isn't<00:01:55.310> enough

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
going through now the power isn't enough

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.270 
going through now the power isn't enough
to<00:01:55.850> actually<00:01:56.000> get<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.630> for<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.680> timer<00:01:58.159> to

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
to actually get to for the timer to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.550 
to actually get to for the timer to
function<00:01:58.760> so<00:01:59.030> my<00:01:59.180> solution<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.690> here<00:02:00.020> these

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
function so my solution is here these

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.280 
function so my solution is here these
are<00:02:00.740> thermostats<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.520> they<00:02:01.880> work<00:02:02.060> up<00:02:02.299> with<00:02:02.659> 12

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
are thermostats and they work up with 12

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.350 
are thermostats and they work up with 12
volt<00:02:03.500> systems<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.310> that's<00:02:04.790> what<00:02:04.939> I'm<00:02:05.030> using<00:02:05.210> to

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
volt systems so that's what I'm using to

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.090 
volt systems so that's what I'm using to
turn<00:02:05.600> on<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.049> off<00:02:06.170> everything<00:02:06.560> here's<00:02:07.040> the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
turn on and off everything here's the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.219 
turn on and off everything here's the
fan<00:02:07.400> just<00:02:08.239> yell<00:02:08.420> turn<00:02:08.629> down<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.959> temperature

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
fan just yell turn down the temperature

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.880 
fan just yell turn down the temperature
to<00:02:09.909> cool<00:02:10.909> it<00:02:11.090> you'll<00:02:11.330> have<00:02:11.450> your<00:02:11.569> cliq<00:02:11.890> bunk

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
to cool it you'll have your cliq bunk

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.530 
to cool it you'll have your cliq bunk
and<00:02:13.010> then<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:14.060> fan<00:02:14.300> will<00:02:14.510> turn<00:02:14.690> on

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and then the fan will turn on

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.979 
and then the fan will turn on
so<00:02:16.049> I'm<00:02:16.110> going<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.290> have<00:02:16.469> fans<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:18.000> my

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
so I'm going to have fans in my

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.780 
so I'm going to have fans in my
hydroponic<00:02:19.560> greenhouse<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.519> I'm<00:02:20.579> going<00:02:20.700> to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
hydroponic greenhouse that I'm going to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.940 
hydroponic greenhouse that I'm going to
build<00:02:20.969> for<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.299> and<00:02:21.450> then<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.920> other

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
build for it and then the other

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.640 
build for it and then the other
thermostat<00:02:23.670> will<00:02:24.120> operate<00:02:24.719> the<00:02:24.900> pump<00:02:25.140> but

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
thermostat will operate the pump but

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.709 
thermostat will operate the pump but
unfortunately<00:02:26.400> with<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.849> thermostat<00:02:27.569> I

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
unfortunately with this thermostat I

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.199 
unfortunately with this thermostat I
only<00:02:27.989> get<00:02:28.200> four<00:02:28.469> settings<00:02:28.859> per<00:02:29.159> day<00:02:29.340> take<00:02:30.180> a

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
only get four settings per day take a

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.250 
only get four settings per day take a
program<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:32.569> here<00:02:33.569> you'll<00:02:33.750> enter<00:02:33.959> click

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
program to and here you'll enter click

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.349 
program to and here you'll enter click
in<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> pump<00:02:34.829> will<00:02:34.920> turn<00:02:35.099> on<00:02:35.220> four<00:02:36.090> per<00:02:36.239> day

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
in the pump will turn on four per day

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.530 
in the pump will turn on four per day
that<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.599> can<00:02:36.810> program<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.359> means

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
that I can program it to so that means

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.050 
that I can program it to so that means
only<00:02:39.720> two<00:02:39.840> feet<00:02:40.230> cycles<00:02:40.650> per<00:02:40.829> day<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.790> might

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
only two feet cycles per day so I might

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.729 
only two feet cycles per day so I might
break<00:02:42.299> down<00:02:42.359> and<00:02:42.810> actually<00:02:42.930> buy<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> 12<00:02:43.620> volt

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
break down and actually buy a 12 volt

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.080 
break down and actually buy a 12 volt
I'm<00:02:44.040> right<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.430> know<00:02:44.519> they<00:02:44.670> are<00:02:44.760> expensive

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
I'm right you know they are expensive

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.530 
I'm right you know they are expensive
but<00:02:46.099> there<00:02:47.099> you<00:02:47.189> can<00:02:47.400> see<00:02:47.430> if<00:02:48.120> that's<00:02:48.359> all

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
but there you can see if that's all

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.429 
but there you can see if that's all
working<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.319> same<00:02:49.620> thing<00:02:49.859> you<00:02:50.870> shut<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:51.900> off<00:02:52.139> I

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
working the same thing you shut it off I

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.470 
working the same thing you shut it off I
turn<00:02:52.650> off<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:53.189> heater<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:53.909> shuts<00:02:54.120> off<00:02:54.299> the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
turn off the heater and it shuts off the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.170 
turn off the heater and it shuts off the
fan<00:02:54.689> and<00:02:55.049> everything<00:02:55.590> works<00:02:55.829> here's<00:02:56.669> just

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
fan and everything works here's just

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.440 
fan and everything works here's just
another<00:02:57.269> look<00:02:57.689> at<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.919> there's<00:02:58.919> a<00:02:59.069> second<00:02:59.790> 5

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
another look at it there's a second 5

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.929 
another look at it there's a second 5
foot<00:03:00.720> length<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.260> four<00:03:01.769> inch<00:03:01.980> there's<00:03:02.819> a

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
foot length of four inch there's a

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.789 
foot length of four inch there's a
little<00:03:03.180> splitter<00:03:03.510> on<00:03:03.569> that<00:03:03.810> connection<00:03:04.319> so

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
little splitter on that connection so

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.550 
little splitter on that connection so
the<00:03:04.980> pump<00:03:05.220> will<00:03:05.340> now<00:03:05.489> fill<00:03:06.480> up<00:03:06.629> both<00:03:06.900> tubes

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the pump will now fill up both tubes

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.629 
the pump will now fill up both tubes
with<00:03:08.069> water<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:12.680> yeah<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:14.280> worked<00:03:14.489> pretty

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
with water and yeah it worked pretty

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.610 
with water and yeah it worked pretty
good<00:03:14.909> you<00:03:15.090> can<00:03:15.239> see<00:03:15.419> that<00:03:15.750> one's<00:03:15.959> filling<00:03:16.349> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
good you can see that one's filling the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.099 
good you can see that one's filling the
other<00:03:16.739> ones<00:03:16.919> filling<00:03:17.450> this<00:03:18.450> one's<00:03:18.659> draining

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
other ones filling this one's draining

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.059 
other ones filling this one's draining
right<00:03:19.319> now<00:03:19.470> because<00:03:19.889> they<00:03:19.979> don't<00:03:20.159> have<00:03:22.069> the

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
right now because they don't have the

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.970 
right now because they don't have the
overflow<00:03:23.549> properly<00:03:24.209> in<00:03:24.359> place

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.490 

and<00:03:27.900> yeah<00:03:31.379> works<00:03:32.379> like<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.220> charm<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:35.019> then<00:03:35.290> I

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
and yeah works like a charm and then I

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.170 
and yeah works like a charm and then I
got<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.890> guy<00:03:36.040> at<00:03:36.159> walmart<00:03:36.610> is<00:03:36.849> the<00:03:37.000> wireless

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
got that guy at walmart is the wireless

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.440 
got that guy at walmart is the wireless
remote<00:03:38.159> thermometer<00:03:39.159> so<00:03:39.879> I<00:03:39.909> can<00:03:40.090> tell<00:03:40.269> what

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
remote thermometer so I can tell what

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.899 
remote thermometer so I can tell what
the<00:03:40.510> temperature<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:40.989> in<00:03:41.319> there<00:03:41.909> everything

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
the temperature is in there everything

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.970 
the temperature is in there everything
drains<00:03:43.360> everything<00:03:43.810> pumps<00:03:44.140> right<00:03:44.349> so<00:03:46.980> so

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
drains everything pumps right so so

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.190 
drains everything pumps right so so
looking<00:03:48.610> good<00:03:51.299> here<00:03:52.299> i'm<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.629> the<00:03:52.750> grad<00:03:52.989> you're

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
looking good here i'm in the grad you're

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.680 
looking good here i'm in the grad you're
going<00:03:53.379> to<00:03:53.440> build<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.799> little<00:03:54.099> stand<00:03:56.220> tubing<00:03:58.440> and

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
going to build a little stand tubing and

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.190 
going to build a little stand tubing and
just<00:04:01.690> notched<00:04:02.079> it<00:04:02.170> out<00:04:02.290> there<00:04:02.560> with<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.739> jigsaw
