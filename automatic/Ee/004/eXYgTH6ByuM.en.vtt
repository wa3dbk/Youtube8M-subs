00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
in an image it's not what camera you use

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.520 
in an image it's not what camera you use
or<00:02:50.920> how<00:02:51.220> big<00:02:51.460> it<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:52.020> we<00:02:53.020> can<00:02:53.170> say<00:02:53.350> that

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530

photography stopped when the Afghan tick

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.190 
photography stopped when the Afghan tick
stopped<00:02:57.420> because<00:02:58.420> it's<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.690> question<00:02:59.140> of

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
stopped because it's a question of

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.620 
stopped because it's a question of
aperture<00:02:59.710> of<00:02:59.830> lighting<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.490> enough<00:03:01.300> of

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
aperture of lighting of enough of

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.870 
aperture of lighting of enough of
developing<00:03:02.140> in<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.500> certain<00:03:02.830> way<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.640> we<00:03:03.790> can

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
developing in a certain way so we can

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.820 
developing in a certain way so we can
say<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.210> photography<00:03:04.630> stopped<00:03:04.870> at<00:03:05.470> that

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
say that photography stopped at that

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.340 
say that photography stopped at that
time<00:03:06.040> when<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.310> analytics<00:03:06.960> stopped<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
time when the analytics stopped and the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.640 
time when the analytics stopped and the
digital<00:03:08.770> era<00:03:09.550> era<00:03:10.030> arrived<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:11.500> know<00:03:11.620> a

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
digital era era arrived you know a

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.030 
digital era era arrived you know a
nindroid<00:03:11.890> geography<00:03:12.520> you<00:03:12.850> use<00:03:13.060> kilovolts<00:03:13.810> and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
nindroid geography you use kilovolts and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.000 
nindroid geography you use kilovolts and
mass<00:03:15.040> which<00:03:15.790> is<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:15.970> bit<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:16.240> lights<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:17.010> it's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
mass which is a bit like lights and it's

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.470 
mass which is a bit like lights and it's
exactly<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.520> same<00:03:18.700> thing<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.030> then<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.240> take

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
exactly the same thing and then you take

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.090 
exactly the same thing and then you take
them<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:20.020> you<00:03:20.290> work<00:03:20.470> with<00:03:20.500> them<00:03:20.710> in<00:03:20.830> Photoshop

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
them and you work with them in Photoshop

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.460 
them and you work with them in Photoshop
anyway<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.480> be<00:03:22.690> able<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.990> put<00:03:23.230> them<00:03:23.320> together

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
anyway to be able to put them together

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.860 
anyway to be able to put them together
and<00:03:23.920> Photoshop<00:03:24.730> is<00:03:24.880> photolyse<00:03:25.420> it's<00:03:25.630> it's<00:03:25.780> a
