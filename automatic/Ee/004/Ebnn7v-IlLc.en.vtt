into<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:58.309> upgrade<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.520> much<00:00:59.789> as<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.270> now

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
into just upgrade as much as you can now

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
into just upgrade as much as you can now
what<00:01:01.620> with<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.890> glitch<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.280> best<00:01:02.520> because

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
what with this glitch is best because

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.700 
what with this glitch is best because
there<00:01:03.000> develop<00:01:03.750> money<00:01:03.899> put<00:01:04.110> into<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.559> get

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
there develop money put into it you get

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.289 
there develop money put into it you get
back<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.400> put<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> lot<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.909> money<00:01:06.030> into

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
back so if you put a lot of money into

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.700 
back so if you put a lot of money into
it<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.630> get<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.810> lot<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.110> money<00:01:07.229> each<00:01:07.409> time

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it then you get a lot of money each time

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.560 
it then you get a lot of money each time
you<00:01:07.890> burn<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.310> sell<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> bike<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> things

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you burn to sell the bike now the things

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.090 
you burn to sell the bike now the things
I<00:01:09.659> recommend<00:01:10.170> getting<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.590> least<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
I recommend getting at least at the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.340 
I recommend getting at least at the
minimum<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.760> crew<00:01:12.119> colors<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:13.049> they're

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
minimum is that crew colors as they're

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.630 
minimum is that crew colors as they're
like<00:01:13.470> 25<00:01:13.860> grand<00:01:14.130> each<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.930> horn<00:01:16.200> which<00:01:16.439> is

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
like 25 grand each and the horn which is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
like 25 grand each and the horn which is
Carnarvon<00:01:17.640> much<00:01:17.790> tires<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.080> last<00:01:19.259> horn

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
Carnarvon much tires then the last horn

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.530 
Carnarvon much tires then the last horn
there's<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:20.070> these<00:01:20.159> good<00:01:20.430> things<00:01:20.460> they<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
there's all these good things they get a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.600 
there's all these good things they get a
lot<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:21.689> expensive<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:22.979> then<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.369> need<00:01:23.490> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
lot more expensive but then just need to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.600 
lot more expensive but then just need to
go<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:23.970> go<00:01:24.299> back<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:26.340> mines

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
go out and go back in and it mines

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.100 
go out and go back in and it mines
daytime<00:01:27.119> now<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> first<00:01:27.930> time<00:01:28.049> we
