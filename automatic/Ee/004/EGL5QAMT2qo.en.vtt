00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
so it seems to me these days that we

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.770 
so it seems to me these days that we
cannot<00:00:31.070> have<00:00:31.340> a<00:00:31.369> game<00:00:31.610> considered<00:00:32.239> complete

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
cannot have a game considered complete

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.030

multiplayer mode this wasn't always the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.340 
multiplayer mode this wasn't always the
case<00:00:36.680> as<00:00:37.190> far<00:00:37.370> back<00:00:37.489> as<00:00:37.550> just<00:00:38.510> last<00:00:38.690> generation

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.930 
case as far back as just last generation
we<00:00:39.830> have<00:00:40.129> games<00:00:40.430> that<00:00:40.670> were<00:00:40.760> just

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
we have games that were just

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.490 
we have games that were just
single-player<00:00:41.390> experiences<00:00:42.140> and<00:00:42.290> that<00:00:42.379> was

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
single-player experiences and that was

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.290 
single-player experiences and that was
funny<00:00:42.770> we<00:00:43.100> didn't<00:00:43.340> have<00:00:43.430> people<00:00:43.790> complaining

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300

that<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.080> game<00:00:45.260> was<00:00:45.410> in<00:00:45.590> completely<00:00:46.250> lacked

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
replay value and they didn't bother with

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.650 
replay value and they didn't bother with
it<00:00:48.650> but<00:00:49.400> to<00:00:49.580> me<00:00:49.910> this<00:00:50.090> is<00:00:50.269> an<00:00:50.360> unfortunate

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660

they've<00:02:09.850> got<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.270> games<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.660> do<00:02:10.900> that<00:02:11.170> I

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
they've got the games that do that I

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.800 
they've got the games that do that I
don't<00:02:11.920> need<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.250> same<00:02:12.520> experience<00:02:13.270> with<00:02:13.750> a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810

think that there is a president out
there<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.970> says<00:02:19.180> single-player<00:02:19.720> games<00:02:19.900> can

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
there that says single-player games can

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.290 
there that says single-player games can
still<00:02:20.320> sell<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.710> first<00:02:20.920> Bioshock<00:02:21.310> had<00:02:22.090> no

then we get to Bioshock 2 and the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.320 
then we get to Bioshock 2 and the
multiplayer<00:02:26.950> motorists<00:02:27.460> felt<00:02:27.640> it's<00:02:28.060> all<00:02:28.180> and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
multiplayer in a game that never needed

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.640 
multiplayer in a game that never needed
multiplayer<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.220> first<00:02:36.520> place<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.650> I

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
multiplayer in the first place and I

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.770 
multiplayer in the first place and I
just<00:02:38.770> would<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.520> see<00:02:39.970> single<00:02:40.390> kind<00:02:40.690> of

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
just would like to see single kind of

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.060 
just would like to see single kind of
experiences<00:02:41.700> worked<00:02:42.700> upon<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:44.070> encouraged

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
experiences worked upon and encouraged

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.370 
experiences worked upon and encouraged
and<00:02:45.490> I<00:02:45.880> think<00:02:46.090> gamers<00:02:46.450> should<00:02:46.660> encourage<00:02:47.230> it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
and I think gamers should encourage it

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.820 
and I think gamers should encourage it
with<00:02:47.560> their<00:02:47.770> sales<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.490> course<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.000> their

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
with their sales of course and their

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.780 
with their sales of course and their
developers<00:02:50.830> should<00:02:51.010> encourage<00:02:51.400> people<00:02:51.640> to

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
developers should encourage people to

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.060 
developers should encourage people to
enjoy<00:02:52.000> them<00:02:52.510> by<00:02:52.900> making<00:02:53.290> good<00:02:53.530> single-player

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
enjoy them by making good single-player

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.660 
enjoy them by making good single-player
experiences<00:02:54.820> not<00:02:55.300> harming<00:02:55.840> them<00:02:56.050> by

concentrating on a rather poor

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.260 
concentrating on a rather poor
multiplayer<00:03:20.530> mode<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.670> we<00:03:21.790> see<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.240> lot

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
multiplayer mode and we see this a lot

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.730 
multiplayer mode and we see this a lot
with<00:03:22.510> games<00:03:22.780> these<00:03:22.960> days<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:23.620> think

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
with games these days and I just think

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.740 
with games these days and I just think
it's<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:23.950> shame<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.490> I<00:03:24.520> just<00:03:24.730> think<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.030> we

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
it's a shame and I just think that we

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.330 
it's a shame and I just think that we
really<00:03:25.780> shouldn't<00:03:26.470> be<00:03:26.620> saying<00:03:26.920> things<00:03:27.190> like

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
really shouldn't be saying things like

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.130 
really shouldn't be saying things like
I'm<00:03:27.880> not<00:03:28.180> going<00:03:28.300> to<00:03:28.390> buy<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.570> gun<00:03:28.870> because<00:03:29.080> he

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
I'm not going to buy this gun because he

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.710 
I'm not going to buy this gun because he
doesn't<00:03:29.410> have<00:03:29.590> come<00:03:30.040> up<00:03:30.510> really

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
doesn't have come up really
