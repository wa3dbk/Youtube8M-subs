 artist distributed his belongings a 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.989
 to one forming a great spiral for 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:02.050
 then reorganize them methodically 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.180
 of readers interacting with each 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.110
 of the objects was a space of eight 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.510
 hours 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.970

 sofía in madrid in many more scenarios 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.280
 This is one of the key works of art 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.890
 Colombian in the last half like this 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.159
 the artist studied in france 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.100
 indonesia india japan and member of the 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.380
 theatrical group latin act its formation 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.650
 as an actress in the 80s 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.820
 within the holy actor and the performer will 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.399
 allows you to live a land of 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.740

 performance as a means of expression efe 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.350
 they are deadlines 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.240
 but that is not coincidentally the meeting 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.490
 with the dancer and choreographer to the value 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.560
 except it takes us to explore other 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.420
 possibilities of action remaining a 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.810
 came in 1985 a piece of dance theater 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.509
 in homage to federico garcía lorca a 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.220
 year later marathons emphasize the 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.869
 possibility of starting to be a 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.560
 much more extensive work with the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.970
 theater in a one- day evaluation 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:17.000
 we achieve the door to experimentation 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:19.130
 to the plastic with patience is 1987 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.780
 presented at the candelaria theater 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.780
 where you feel that the step has been taken 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.480
 to get away the theater emphasize safe 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.280
 I believe that there begins to develop 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.890
 what could be called a plastic action 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.190
 because it's not theater anymore because there's no 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.350
 very personal story 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.080
 the work in park ages included 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.080
 five TVs with images where 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.140
 they saw parks is that they passed popcorn 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.180
 in the plastic options park of 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.550
 intense gestural and poetic character 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.650
 they revealed problems of 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.470
 gender oppression and loneliness 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.660
 abandonment with a rigorous management of 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.270
 body and a good sense of space 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.180
 intervened management then one of the 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.210
 crucial aspects and are the same 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.670
 detained and tense of their presentations 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.400
 that an environment in many cases excessive 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.260
 and openly critical of a given 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.010
 circumstance of social alignment and 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.830
 sexual the artist performed actions that 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.390
 take physical effort to limits that 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.480
