 experts this ruling marked a before and a 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.849
 then this goes to first recognize the 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.279
 value that today has its own 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.810

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.580
 has within the international trade 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.009
 own intellectual and will call 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.749
 the companies to invest more not only 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.940
 in research and development but to 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.370
 identify your assets and protect them 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.320

 the image and move the screen with a 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.469
 rebound effect 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.510
 at the end of the action, that is a
