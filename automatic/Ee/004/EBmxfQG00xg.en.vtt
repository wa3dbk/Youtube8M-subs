00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:02.820
 be crazy 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.820
 Winnenden 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.249
 Year of study of the closing date on the time strong 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:27.419
 the 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.279
 Handelsblatt s despite the resignation 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.279
 for a short time 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.110
 Arctic Sea time at 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.100
 yes those were still times 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.230
 how nice that it is back on the Virtual Console 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.310
 This game laid the foundation for the newspaper 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.270
 because many features from that time are on today's Friday again 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.090
 These include, among other things, the top was pushing back the engine compartment 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.980
 that would fit 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.720
 get back on the bike 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.910
 and the IAK accusation so that you can align the bike 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.910
 that was optimally ends the wind then quickly progresses again 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.090
 so much for the story Iris Mayer too 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.190
 cleverly 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.230
 he is still open 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.400
 Heinrich briefly on the side, then I may then continue on 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.590
 and then nice march over and off through the rally from the following year 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.460
 the Valais must be the trends 01 clock even if it's only the second place 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.380
 is 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.190
 which goes far as the two game modes with opponents or without 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.790
 and a total of five hotspots here are the routes that one of his 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.610
 See that you build the damage yourself 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.340
 and after that he himself still go the water especially fun when in the evening 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.250
 Loose buddy has then pushed on and added a leaflet to Demant 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.620
 here then desperate 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.180
 However, time remains to forget what retro fans and up 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.060
 definitely worth a look
