00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
like it was probably about two yards and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.789 
like it was probably about two yards and
it<00:04:03.060> was<00:04:03.180> like<00:04:03.329> maybe<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.660> dollar<00:04:03.870> 49<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.709> was

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
it was like maybe a dollar 49 so it was

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.970 
color and that might be coming out a
little<00:04:08.910> bit<00:04:09.150> Pinker<00:04:09.989> than<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.380> actually<00:04:10.530> is

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980
