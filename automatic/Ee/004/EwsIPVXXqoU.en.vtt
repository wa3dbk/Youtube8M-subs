 a layer of cream 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.640

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.760
 they are because the result is going to be great 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.370
 because you are not going to see it is a very 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.040
 economic, because we only need what 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.780
 to be our perfect cake we 're going to 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.540
 to do is to cover it with a film and put it 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.400
 in the fridge until the day after 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.980

 we take a wafer 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.080
 we put it in the center and we give it the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.080
 return 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.219
 we remove the tray 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.270
 and we're going to get a little bit of the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.270
 film paper 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.370
 we have already removed the oven paper that 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.830

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.489
 completely smooth or is it super easy 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.420

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.420
 some chocolate chips 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.510

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.830
