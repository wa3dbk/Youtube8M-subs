we're just launching our new corolla but
when<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:13.910> take<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.120> look<00:04:14.330> at<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:14.660> decorah

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
when you take a look at that decorah

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.830 
when you take a look at that decorah
subcompact<00:04:15.980> vehicle<00:04:16.850> now<00:04:17.000> we<00:04:17.060> it's<00:04:17.690> a

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
subcompact vehicle now we it's a

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.199 
subcompact vehicle now we it's a
different<00:04:18.140> corolla<00:04:18.410> than<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:18.859> globally<00:04:19.400> we<00:04:19.609> we

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
different corolla than so globally we we

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.540 
different corolla than so globally we we
lengthen<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.959> wheelbase<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.380> increase<00:04:22.370> the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
lengthen the wheelbase and increase the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.180 
lengthen the wheelbase and increase the
track<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:24.020> give<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.440> capacity<00:04:25.040> but

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
track to to give it the capacity but

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.490 
track to to give it the capacity but
when<00:04:25.370> you<00:04:25.460> look<00:04:25.610> at<00:04:25.730> that<00:04:25.760> corolla<00:04:26.500> the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
when you look at that corolla the

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.140 
when you look at that corolla the
interior<00:04:28.250> packaging<00:04:29.060> in<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.570> subcompact<00:04:30.080> is

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
interior packaging in the subcompact is

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.350 
interior packaging in the subcompact is
actually<00:04:32.150> as<00:04:32.390> good<00:04:33.790> marginally<00:04:34.790> better<00:04:34.970> by<00:04:35.330> a

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
actually as good marginally better by a

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.450 
actually as good marginally better by a
couple<00:04:35.660> of<00:04:35.720> millimeters<00:04:36.230> then<00:04:36.410> our<00:04:36.980> mid-size

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
couple of millimeters then our mid-size
