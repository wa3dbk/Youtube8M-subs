00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.670
 was a typical Navarre day heavy 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:08.260
 lead- filled skies brought down on 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.679
 Moscow residents then snow 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.049
 then the rain all together godless weather 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:17.350
 I walked along a damp street for a long time 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.080
 but I knew that sooner or later I would be 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.830
 my feet got wet at the destination 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.950
 through 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.820
 spun one head only 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.670
 think 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.020
 what the hell am i walking 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.880
 actually the idea came from here 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.399
 order a taxi with iphone after all 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.989
 applications a bunch a and one over something 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:46.329
 choose therefore now I will give you everything 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:48.460
 tell you go at all actually 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.829
 taxi services that have their own 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.589
 mobile application quite a lot with 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.420
 some of them are my colleagues already 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.489
 faced and told not the most 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.010
 positive stories so i decided 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.170
 try something else plus everything 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.540
 I came to visit the old comrades with 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.430
 distant sunny country so a couple 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.920
 since he had to take a taxi 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.040
 after a brief search, the choice fell on 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.939
 Toxic service will not hide bought into 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.640
 bright icon 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.289
 actually how this service works on 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.509
 in fact , everything is very simple after 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.399
 short registration to us immediately without 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.039
 unnecessary questions will be asked to choose 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.960
 route and already go where we are 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:28.390
 were going to get the right address 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.979
 pressed to continue all the elementary and 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.530
 you know I liked what you don't need 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.030
 enter the address of the point of departure 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.000
 the application itself will understand where we are going 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.750
 the address of the destination by the way is also possible 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.640
 and do not recruit 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.829
 you can immediately click continue on the screen 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.600
 with a map and go as written here 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.299
 instructions ie stay in the role 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.700
 navigator for the driver anyway 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.009
 after pressing the button continue toxic 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.869
 will begin to calculate the cost of the trip and 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.030
 the screen will show a detailed 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.460
 information here you can specify the parameters 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.369
 trips for example you have a lot of money and not 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.009
 I want to go in economy class in general 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.929
 question choose a business class and go as 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.909
 siren on unless the blue bucket on 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.830
 rooftop and install or if you 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.149
 for example the huge friendly crowd that 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.790
 going to the rink 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.920
 you can even order the whole minivan and 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.200
 no matter where this rink is 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.269
 Switzerland to the airport will take you too 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.750
 You can also note additional 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.879
 options 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.640
 child seats smoking and non-smoking 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.430
 payment details and if a taxi you need 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.650
 for example, tomorrow this moment too 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.170
 can be taken into account and the most interesting thing 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.329
 opportunity to specify your price well 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.640
 for example, your limit is 300 rubles 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.349
 iron and not ruble more than that 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.049
 the probability of finding a taxi becomes 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.329
 less but still she is now about 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.510
 tariffs can not say that the toxic 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.430
 more expensive or cheaper than the rest of the taxi prices 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.799
 about the same level everywhere 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.409
 fare we are in the menu on the right 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.379
 there is a message order history 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:59.019
 Profile and item read about the service 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.209
 but we need a tariff here they are here like me 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.010
 everything seems to be described as fully as possible 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.639
 what and how much and at what time 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.220
 days 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.319
 at night by the way sometimes it turns out more expensive 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.260
 also useful will be the opportunity 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.769
 transfers to or from the airport and 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.750
 the cost 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.510
 again not overpriced let's say 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.120
 average hospital and by the way here's what else 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.760
 driver's taximeter is duplicated to you on 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.160
 the phone so we can not blow 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.629
 while the car goes to us you can track 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.400
 its position on the map 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.109
 it's not to look out every two 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.419
 minutes from the window and do not look out for the car 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.639
 just look at the phones and evaluate 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:36.069
 where is our driver a nice bun 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.829
 bonuses for each order 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.930
 15 percent of the cost of each trip 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.269
 we get a calculator and get approximately 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.620
 every seventh and eighth trip 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.629
 absolutely free 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.729
 and free travel is generally straightforward 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.680
 what do i need to design the same application in 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.299
 Basically special raises no objections, I 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.280
 just not really can imagine 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.199
 well, what else might the application look like 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.030
 to order a taxi from iphone 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.680
 the only thing I noticed from 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.959
 disadvantages well, at least that 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.729
 caught the eye spelling 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.159
 an error in the word business true appears 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:07.959
 she is somehow not at all regular and yet 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.479
 It is worth noting that the application will be 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.180
 useful residents of Moscow St. Petersburg 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:15.040
 and Voronezh such things are about it all 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.570
 dear friends thank you for being with us and 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.310
 do not forget to subscribe to like 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.299

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.299
