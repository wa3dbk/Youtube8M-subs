an iPhone 5s now what you do is you

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.120

volume<00:01:53.610> rocker<00:01:53.820> side<00:01:54.180> first<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:54.720> you

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
volume rocker side first and then you

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.270 
volume rocker side first and then you
snap<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.290> other<00:01:55.409> side<00:01:55.650> in<00:01:55.830> just<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.220> that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
snap the other side in just like that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.890 
snap the other side in just like that
and<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:56.850> lock<00:01:57.000> down<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.540> hold<00:01:57.750> your

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
phone in place now this case is a little

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.389 
phone in place now this case is a little
tight<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.930> get<00:02:01.050> on<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.830> not<00:02:01.979> too<00:02:02.190> tight<00:02:02.340> that

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
tight to get on but not too tight that

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.590 
tight to get on but not too tight that
it's<00:02:02.610> hard<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.850> put<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.330> tight<00:02:03.570> enough

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
it's hard to put on just tight enough

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.330 
it's hard to put on just tight enough
that<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.080> not<00:02:04.200> gonna<00:02:04.320> fall<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:05.159> some

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
that it's not gonna fall out like some

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.160 
that it's not gonna fall out like some
of<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.580> cheaper<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.180> cheaply<00:02:06.540> made<00:02:06.750> cases

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
of the cheaper and cheaply made cases

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.109 
of the cheaper and cheaply made cases
are<00:02:07.409> they<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.130> fall<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.850> one<00:02:09.000> is

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
are they can fall out but this one is

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.520 
are they can fall out but this one is
definitely<00:02:09.270> not<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.319> will

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
definitely not like that and it will

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.070

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
we can then change the front cover

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.390 
we can then change the front cover
design<00:04:29.440> we<00:04:29.620> have<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.800> bunch<00:04:30.040> of<00:04:30.130> different

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
design we have a bunch of different

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.920 
design we have a bunch of different
styles<00:04:30.550> we<00:04:30.850> have<00:04:31.000> half<00:04:31.240> coverage<00:04:31.720> full

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
styles we have half coverage full

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.840

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
coverage so I'm gonna go ahead and go

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.460 
coverage so I'm gonna go ahead and go
with<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.270> full<00:04:34.510> coverage<00:04:34.840> because<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.230> think

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
with the full coverage because I think

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.400 
with the full coverage because I think
that<00:04:35.590> personally<00:04:35.890> looks<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.280> best<00:04:37.290> next<00:04:38.290> on

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
that personally looks the best next on

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.320 
that personally looks the best next on
the<00:04:38.530> list<00:04:38.650> is<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.190> bottom<00:04:39.520> opening<00:04:39.880> now<00:04:40.270> the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the list is the bottom opening now the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.310 
the list is the bottom opening now the
case<00:04:40.570> that<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.750> showed<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.020> guys<00:04:41.110> earlier

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
case that I showed you guys earlier

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.900 
case that I showed you guys earlier
today<00:04:41.680> does<00:04:41.890> have<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.190> bottom<00:04:42.430> opening<00:04:42.760> but

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
today does have the bottom opening but

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.340 
today does have the bottom opening but
you<00:04:42.970> can<00:04:43.090> have<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.240> without<00:04:43.420> it<00:04:43.720> I'll<00:04:43.930> then

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
you can have it without it I'll then

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.320 
you can have it without it I'll then
pick<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.830> credit<00:04:45.310> card<00:04:45.430> slot<00:04:45.760> for<00:04:45.790> on<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.150> back

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
pick a credit card slot for on the back

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.850 
pick a credit card slot for on the back
so<00:04:46.540> you<00:04:46.570> can<00:04:46.720> have<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.870> credit<00:04:47.230> card<00:04:47.260> insert<00:04:47.680> and

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
so you can have a credit card insert and

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.470 
so you can have a credit card insert and
then<00:04:48.250> I<00:04:48.430> won't<00:04:48.640> pick<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.790> strap<00:04:49.150> because<00:04:49.330> I

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
then I won't pick a strap because I

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.970 
then I won't pick a strap because I
wouldn't<00:04:49.690> really<00:04:49.810> use<00:04:49.900> one<00:04:50.140> of<00:04:50.260> those<00:04:50.410> you<00:04:50.920> can

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980

and then it will be custom-built to

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.100 
and then it will be custom-built to
those<00:05:15.760> dimensions<00:05:16.210> as<00:05:16.720> you<00:05:16.840> guys<00:05:16.960> can<00:05:17.050> see

those dimensions as you guys can see

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.690 
those dimensions as you guys can see
here<00:05:17.350> it<00:05:17.500> cost<00:05:17.650> about<00:05:17.860> ninety<00:05:18.220> dollars<00:05:18.520> for

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
here it cost about ninety dollars for

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.400 
here it cost about ninety dollars for
this<00:05:18.760> customized<00:05:19.210> case<00:05:19.450> so<00:05:19.990> it<00:05:20.110> is<00:05:20.200> not<00:05:20.320> the

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410
