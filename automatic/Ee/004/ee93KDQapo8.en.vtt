00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.510 

it's<00:01:36.020> my<00:01:36.140> first<00:01:36.410> time<00:01:36.620> teaching<00:01:36.860> here

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
it's my first time teaching here

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.210 
it's my first time teaching here
actually<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.450> uh<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:39.650> level<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.010> good

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
actually and uh the level is good

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.650 
actually and uh the level is good
they're<00:01:40.340> at<00:01:40.430> their<00:01:40.550> learners<00:01:40.820> like<00:01:41.150> they<00:01:41.360> they

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
they're at their learners like they they

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.970 
they're at their learners like they they
really<00:01:41.780> soak<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:42.290> up<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.620> they<00:01:42.680> can<00:01:42.830> really

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
really soak it up and they can really

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.980 
really soak it up and they can really
catch<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.700> feeling<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:44.540> that's<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.840> most

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
catch the feeling so that's the most

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.930 
catch the feeling so that's the most
important<00:01:45.440> part<00:01:45.650> when<00:01:45.830> people<00:01:46.130> come<00:01:46.760> in<00:01:46.910> to

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
important part when people come in to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.850 
important part when people come in to
krump<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.360> are<00:01:47.450> new<00:01:47.630> it's<00:01:48.200> hard<00:01:48.500> for<00:01:48.620> them<00:01:48.710> to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
krump that are new it's hard for them to

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.440 
krump that are new it's hard for them to
catch<00:01:49.010> the<00:01:49.250> feeling<00:01:49.460> but<00:01:49.910> they<00:01:50.060> caught<00:01:50.270> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
catch the feeling but they caught the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.600 
catch the feeling but they caught the
feeling<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:50.900> they<00:01:51.260> can<00:01:51.470> go<00:01:52.010> nowhere<00:01:52.370> but<00:01:52.550> up

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
feeling and they can go nowhere but up

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.820 
feeling and they can go nowhere but up
from<00:01:52.880> here<00:01:52.910> so<00:01:53.390> that's<00:01:53.840> all<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.110> need<00:01:54.290> is<00:01:54.530> to

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
from here so that's all you need is to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:13.020 
from here so that's all you need is to
fill<00:01:55.010> it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.090
