00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.499 
just you know gets larger and like he
just<00:02:05.299> you<00:02:05.689> know<00:02:05.720> flies<00:02:06.320> down<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.509> I'm

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
just you know flies down and I'm

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.929 
just you know flies down and I'm
thinking<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:10.129> it's<00:02:10.369> like<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.549> weird

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
thinking that it's like a weird

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.320 
thinking that it's like a weird
extension<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.049> blue<00:02:12.260> vein<00:02:12.500> cuz<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.640> has

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
extension of the blue vein cuz it has

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.250 
extension of the blue vein cuz it has
the<00:02:14.689> same<00:02:16.720> confounds<00:02:17.720> has<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.049> same

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
the same confounds has the same

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.589 
the same confounds has the same
structure<00:02:18.739> as<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.099> blue<00:02:19.459> thing<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:20.360> more

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
structure as the blue thing just more

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.869 
structure as the blue thing just more
refinement<00:02:21.290> clearly<00:02:21.769> much<00:02:22.069> more<00:02:22.099> powerful

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
refinement clearly much more powerful

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.259 
refinement clearly much more powerful
it's<00:02:23.150> very<00:02:23.389> very<00:02:23.629> obvious<00:02:23.799> now<00:02:24.999> what's<00:02:25.999> also

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
it's very very obvious now what's also

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.140 
it's very very obvious now what's also
fascinating

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
fascinating

what's also fascinating is you have we

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.729 
what's also fascinating is you have we

x-axis worst hash fund
I<00:02:50.180> still<00:02:50.900> believe<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.409> Royal<00:02:51.590> Guard<00:02:51.889> are

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
I still believe that the Royal Guard are

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.399 
I still believe that the Royal Guard are
a<00:02:53.359> factor<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.349> this<00:02:54.530> even<00:02:55.010> though<00:02:55.040> they<00:02:56.030> were

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
a factor in this even though they were

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.830 
a factor in this even though they were
taken<00:02:57.409> out<00:02:57.609> for<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.639> most<00:02:58.879> part<00:02:59.090> off<00:02:59.209> screen<00:02:59.510> I

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
taken out for the most part off screen I

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.259 
taken out for the most part off screen I
mean<00:03:00.260> man<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:01.040> didn't<00:03:01.280> have<00:03:01.370> any<00:03:01.579> Maya<00:03:01.790> do

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
mean man you didn't have any Maya do

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.909 
mean man you didn't have any Maya do
have<00:03:03.109> a<00:03:03.139> speed<00:03:03.590> session<00:03:04.280> however<00:03:04.939> I<00:03:05.919> think

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
have a speed session however I think

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.159 
have a speed session however I think
hash<00:03:07.489> fault<00:03:07.849> is<00:03:08.000> there<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.510> make<00:03:08.689> sure<00:03:08.959> that

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
hash fault is there to make sure that

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.619 
hash fault is there to make sure that
there<00:03:09.439> are<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.590> lot<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:11.000> make<00:03:11.209> sure<00:03:11.389> that<00:03:11.480> that

there are a lot to make sure that that

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.780 
there are a lot to make sure that that
their<00:03:11.810> heads<00:03:12.049> have<00:03:12.379> left<00:03:13.099> their<00:03:13.340> shoulders

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
their heads have left their shoulders

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.020 
their heads have left their shoulders
clean<00:03:14.169> because<00:03:15.169> I<00:03:15.739> still<00:03:16.579> got<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.760> funny

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
clean because I still got a funny

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.559 
clean because I still got a funny
feeling<00:03:17.540> that's<00:03:18.230> somehow<00:03:18.680> someway<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:20.269> Royal

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
Guard are gonna come back into this and

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.020 
Guard are gonna come back into this and
be<00:03:22.519> a<00:03:22.549> factor<00:03:23.439> now<00:03:24.439> that<00:03:25.400> being<00:03:25.549> said<00:03:27.849> you<00:03:28.849> are

be a factor now that being said you are

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.929 
be a factor now that being said you are
right<00:03:29.209> now<00:03:29.359> is<00:03:29.569> it<00:03:29.629> gonna<00:03:29.750> stop<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.769> you<00:03:31.729> have

number<00:03:46.189> one<00:03:46.370> but<00:03:46.970> also<00:03:47.180> number<00:03:47.419> two<00:03:48.669> it's<00:03:49.669> the

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
number one but also number two it's the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.390 
number one but also number two it's the
fact<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.180> he<00:03:50.540> didn't<00:03:50.840> let<00:03:50.930> x-axis<00:03:51.799> shoot<00:03:52.250> at

Ichigo x axis I can pierce all things
that's<00:03:56.750> a<00:03:56.840> pretty<00:03:57.109> pawn<00:03:57.470> power<00:03:57.909> however<00:03:59.349> who

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
that's a pretty pawn power however who

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:01.899 
that's a pretty pawn power however who
you<00:04:00.620> decide<00:04:00.739> to<00:04:00.949> shoot<00:04:01.159> an<00:04:01.250> arrow<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.579> eat<00:04:01.759> you

you decide to shoot an arrow I eat you

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.770 
you decide to shoot an arrow I eat you
up<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:03.790> it's<00:04:04.790> because<00:04:05.120> he<00:04:05.299> wants<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.659> leave

him alive when he was falling down
that's<00:04:07.400> kind<00:04:07.609> of<00:04:07.669> weird<00:04:07.849> because<00:04:07.970> that's<00:04:08.389> kind

should say give a less of a of a severe

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.399 
should say give a less of a of a severe
wound<00:04:28.340> there's<00:04:28.940> no<00:04:29.060> guarantee<00:04:29.659> that<00:04:29.690> x-axis

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
wound there's no guarantee that x-axis

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.320 
wound there's no guarantee that x-axis
would<00:04:30.500> have<00:04:30.919> actually<00:04:31.009> kill<00:04:31.340> Ichigo<00:04:31.729> but

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
would have actually kill Ichigo but

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.089 
would have actually kill Ichigo but
still<00:04:32.599> the<00:04:32.840> wound<00:04:32.990> will<00:04:33.169> be<00:04:33.199> more<00:04:33.469> severe<00:04:33.800> cuz

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
still the wound will be more severe cuz

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.040 
still the wound will be more severe cuz
if<00:04:34.219> he<00:04:34.310> can<00:04:34.430> just<00:04:34.520> puncture<00:04:34.940> anything<00:04:35.300> he<00:04:35.840> in

case of ichigo's arrow is not severe
damage<00:04:40.950> standpoint<00:04:41.340> so<00:04:42.150> Ichigo<00:04:42.600> has<00:04:42.750> the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840

chance to recover it made flight

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.790 
chance to recover it made flight
especially<00:04:45.090> if<00:04:45.570> he<00:04:45.660> does<00:04:45.810> his<00:04:45.930> bankai<00:04:46.170> and<00:04:46.650> he
