00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:04.000
 - Waves of Visible Light - 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.000
 All electromagnetic radiation is light. 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.010
 Visible light is the only part of the spectrum that you can see. 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 Throughout your life, your eyes have been based on this narrow band 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.030
 EM radiation to get information about your world. 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.040
 Even though the visible light of our Sun appears white, it is really the combined light 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.050
 of the individual colors of the rainbow with wavelengths ranging from violet 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.060
 from 380 nanometers to red 700 nanometers. 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.070
 Before the famous experiment of Isaac Newton in 1665, 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.080
 people thought that a prism somehow colored 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.100
 the white light of the sun as it tilted and scattered a ray of light. Newton refuted this 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.110
 idea using two prisms. To show that white light is made of 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.110
 the bands of colored lights, Newton used a second prism to show that the bands 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.120
 of colored lights combine to make white light again. Visible light 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.130
 contains important scientific keys that reveal hidden properties of objects 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.140
 of the universe. Small differences in the energy of certain 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.150
 Visible wavelengths can identify the physical condition and composition 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.170
 of a stellar and interstellar matter. Human eyes are not 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.180
 sensitive enough to detect those tenuous charges, but 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.190
 Scientific instruments can. Scientists can learn the composition of an atmosphere 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.210
 considering how the particles of the atmosphere scatter visible light. 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.220
 The atmosphere of the Earth, for example, generally looks blue 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.240
 because it contains nitrogen and oxygen particles that are precisely 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.250
 of the right size to disperse the energy with a wavelength of blue light. 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.260
 When the Sun is down in the sky, however, light travels more through 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.280
 of the atmosphere and more blue light is scattered from the sun's beam before 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.300
 that comes to your eyes. Only the longest wavelengths such as red and yellow 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.310
 They are able to pass, often creating stunning sunsets. 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.330
 When scientists look at the sky, they do not just look at the blue, 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 they see clues about the chemical composition of our atmosphere. 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.370
 However, visible light reveals more than just its composition. 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.380
 When the objects get hotter, they radiate energy with a 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.390
 shorter wavelength, changing the color before our eyes. Look at one 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.400
 Flame change from yellow to blue as it adjusts to burn hotter. 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.420
 In the same way, the color of stellar objects tell scientists 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.450
 a lot about its temperature. Our Sun produces more light 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.470
 Yellow than any other due to the temperature of its surface. 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.490
 If the surface of the Sun were colder, say 3,000 degrees Celsius, 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.510
 it would look reddish, like the stars Antares and Betelgeuse. 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.540
 If the sun were hotter, say 12,000 degrees centigrade, 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.560
 it would look blue like the star Rigel. 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.620
 Like all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, visible light information can also 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.680
 help scientists study the changes on Earth as assess the damage caused by 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.700
 a volcanic eruption This image EO-1 of NASA 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.730
 combines visible and infrared data to distinguish between snow 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.760
 and the volcanic ash and see the vegetation more clearly. 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.810
 Since 1972, NASA's Landsat satellite imagery 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.850
 have combined visible and infrared information to allow scientists 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.870
 study changes in cities, neighborhoods, forests, and farms over time. 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.900
 The visible light images taken by the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.930
 Mars Landers of NASA has shown us what it would look like to be on another planet. 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.960
 They have expanded our minds, our imagination, and our understanding. 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.990
 NASA instruments can do more than passively detect 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.020
 radiation, they can actively send electromagnetic waves 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.050
 to a topographic map. The 'Laser Altimeter of the Mars Orbiter' 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.090
 sends a laser pulse to the planet's surface and the sensors measure the amount of 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.120
 time it takes for this signal to return. The time passed 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.150
 allows the calculation of the distance from the satellite to the surface. 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.180
 As the ship flies over hills, valleys, craters, and other features 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.200
 from the surface, the return time varies and provides a map 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.230
 topographic of the surface of the planet. Back to Earth orbit, 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.250
 NASA's ICESat mission uses the same technique to gather information about 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.270
 the elevation of the polar ice caps to help observe the changes in the amount 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.290
 of water stored as ice on our planet. 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.320
 Laser altimeters can also make unique measurements of cloud heights, 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.340
 the upper part of the forest cover vegetation, and they can 'see' the distribution 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.370
 of aerosols from sources such as dust storms and forest fires. 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.390
 Finally, visible light helps us explore the 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.430
 confines of the universe that humans could not expect to physically reach. 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.480
 Using visible light, the Hubble Space Telescope has created 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.500
 innumerable images that awaken our imagination, that ignite our curiosity 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.980
 and it increases our understanding of the Universe.
