00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.629
 Yes 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.910
 today is April 17, 2008 and today is the open day for the navy 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:16.039
 and where better to give the open day to be on such a beautiful ship we are 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.550
 today at her majesty the rotterdam 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.640
 and we are not the only one who came to this event, I really see it 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.750
 a very often still fresh I think I'm just asking what these people here 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.749
 do and 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.749
 yes, what they are up to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.840
 why are you interested in a home 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.380
 from the last years 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.180
 seems right I would like to work concorde on the boat can yes 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.980
 r suddenly did a lot more of the world 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.900
 I think that would be nice where you will see yourself in five years 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.400
 is sudden 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 the problem is not everywhere in the city 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.710
 what are you doing this ship i don't need anything 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.869
 i am to katyn we are very aboard it is a buyer always out of service 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.420
 operational service and I am in charge of the vehicle and I along with 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.230
 fellow worker 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.150
 the courses and I am talking about the 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.670
 what do you need now to come and work here 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.710
 so it becomes real 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.010
 Certainly the desire to work Veolia very long days makes humor 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.290
 flexibility 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.690
 if we are still good 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.140
 enthusiasm to learn little the will to give up correct dose of humor 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.830
 Hester is also important for the atmosphere on the shop floor or the other 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.590
 way to work 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.600
 last word 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.749
 you can see that of the world 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.519
 now nine years ago and still have a lot of fun 

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:09.519
 zazi works 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.089
 the midfielder I am in it and I thought that was something 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.799
 very nice 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.749
 there have been a few weeks ago with the Marines 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.929
 and now we are down with the navy 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:36.599
 yes a good atmosphere 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.049
 what is more fun 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.869
 in short this fun 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.349
 then why all a bit more sociable 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.039
 who knows that I do not know anything even though maybe 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.029
 maybe all these subjects have miss 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.829
 but yes we should be able to decide for ourselves what to do with what a pity for that 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.969
 I learned a lot about the 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.599
 what you can do 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.139

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.060
