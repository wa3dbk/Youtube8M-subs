of<00:00:05.279> course<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:06.170> to<00:00:07.170> lose<00:00:07.379> at<00:00:07.770> home<00:00:07.849> and

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
of course to to lose at home and

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.180 
of course to to lose at home and
probably<00:00:09.900> concede<00:00:10.290> three<00:00:10.500> goals<00:00:10.769> we're<00:00:11.040> not

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
probably concede three goals we're not

probably concede three goals we're not
used<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.570> but<00:00:13.549> the<00:00:14.549> way<00:00:14.730> we<00:00:14.880> control<00:00:15.269> I

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
used to that but the way we control I

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.689 
used to that but the way we control I
think<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:15.630> respond<00:00:16.139> okay<00:00:16.740> after<00:00:17.160> 10-15

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
think we respond okay after 10-15

think we respond okay after 10-15
minutes<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.420> first<00:00:18.630> half<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.199> they

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
minutes in the first half when they

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.900 
minutes in the first half when they
score<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> first<00:00:19.980> one<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:20.699> still<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
score the first one because it's still a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.779 
score the first one because it's still a
lot<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.270> time<00:00:21.480> together<00:00:21.769> at<00:00:22.769> side<00:00:23.070> game<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.699> go

lot of time together at side game and go
through<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.510> way<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:25.019> control<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> second

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
through the way we control the second

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.650 
through the way we control the second
half<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> number<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.939> chances<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
half and the number of chances in the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.410 
half and the number of chances in the
second<00:00:28.050> after<00:00:28.199> possession<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:28.980> had<00:00:29.269> but<00:00:30.269> at

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
second after possession we had but at

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.260 
second after possession we had but at
some<00:00:30.840> times<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.410> happens<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.189> football<00:00:32.700> at<00:00:33.059> you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
some times it happens in football at you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.940 
some times it happens in football at you
don't<00:00:33.690> take<00:00:33.899> your<00:00:33.930> chances<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.620> you're

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
don't take your chances and you're

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.729 
don't take your chances and you're
vulnerable<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.910> for<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> brakes<00:00:36.510> done<00:00:36.870> even

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
vulnerable for for the brakes done even

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.970 
vulnerable for for the brakes done even
if<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.370> will<00:00:38.520> stop<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.760> brakes

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
if I think that will stop the brakes

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.119 
if I think that will stop the brakes
most<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> time<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.590> anyhow<00:00:43.590> they<00:00:43.770> scored

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
most of the time but anyhow they scored

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.790 
most of the time but anyhow they scored
you<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> second<00:00:45.809> half<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.110> second<00:00:46.620> half

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you in the second half a second half

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400 
you in the second half a second half
which<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.399> control<00:00:47.879> that's<00:00:48.480> through<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.079> mean

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
which we control that's through I mean

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.569 
which we control that's through I mean
it's<00:00:49.680> kind<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.520> weird<00:00:52.100> doesn't<00:00:53.100> feel<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.430> we

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
it's kind of weird doesn't feel like we

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.099 
it's kind of weird doesn't feel like we
should<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.760> done<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:55.309> mean<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.989> playoffs<00:00:57.989> or
