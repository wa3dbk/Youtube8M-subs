there is a leggy clan I would assume or

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.720 
there is a leggy clan I would assume or
it's<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.470> two<00:00:22.710> people<00:00:22.740> who<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.550> same

it's just two people who have the same
name<00:00:24.170> anyway<00:00:25.170> either<00:00:25.590> way<00:00:26.000> they<00:00:27.000> are<00:00:27.590> making

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
name anyway either way they are making

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.099 
name anyway either way they are making
these<00:00:29.240> aesthetic<00:00:30.240> maps<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.689> they<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:30.810> pretty

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
these aesthetic maps and they are pretty

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.010 
these aesthetic maps and they are pretty
sweet<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.610> them<00:00:32.759> made<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.329> Corvette<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
sweet so one of them made a Corvette and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.920 
sweet so one of them made a Corvette and
the<00:00:34.200> other<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.620> made<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> cruiser<00:00:35.630> so<00:00:36.630> i

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
the other one made a cruiser so i

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.040 
the other one made a cruiser so i
decided<00:00:37.500> i<00:00:37.770> would<00:00:38.329> go<00:00:39.329> ahead<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.989> put

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
decided i would go ahead and just put

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.049 
decided i would go ahead and just put
them<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.590> video<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:41.579> their<00:00:41.760> clan

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
them in one video because if their clan

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.510 
them in one video because if their clan
i'd<00:00:42.410> assume<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:43.829> don't<00:00:44.100> really<00:00:44.250> care

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
i'd assume that they don't really care

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.580 
i'd assume that they don't really care
if<00:00:44.550> they<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.270> both<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.960> their<00:00:46.200> maps<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
if they have both of their maps in the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.250 
if they have both of their maps in the
same<00:00:46.829> video<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.399> um<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.020> little

Banshees on the sides here's they can

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
fly out and then you've got your

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.719 
fly out and then you've got your
revenants<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.090> other<00:02:04.020> random<00:02:04.619> stuff<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.579> can

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
revenants and other random stuff you can

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.169 
revenants and other random stuff you can
just<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.090> drive<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.540> here<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.020> land<00:02:07.710> in

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
just kind of drive out here and land in

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.010 
just kind of drive out here and land in
looks<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.300> you're<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.599> land<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
looks like you're going to land in the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.570 
looks like you're going to land in the
ocean<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.649> actually<00:02:10.800> land<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.459> a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
ocean but you actually land in a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.890 
ocean but you actually land in a
teleporter

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
teleporter

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.270 
teleporter
and<00:02:13.019> he<00:02:13.260> gets<00:02:13.409> stuck<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.769> a<00:02:13.829> tree<00:02:14.069> here<00:02:14.250> I

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
and he gets stuck in a tree here I

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.640 
and he gets stuck in a tree here I
thought<00:02:14.519> it<00:02:14.610> was<00:02:14.670> kind<00:02:14.909> of<00:02:14.939> funny<00:02:15.530> just<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
thought it was kind of funny just the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.740 
thought it was kind of funny just the
way<00:02:16.739> he<00:02:16.890> got<00:02:17.010> stuck<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.400> you'd<00:02:17.579> think<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.120> has

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
way he got stuck like you'd think it has

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.630 
way he got stuck like you'd think it has
enough<00:02:19.110> reverse<00:02:19.620> power<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.040> get<00:02:20.189> out<00:02:20.310> which<00:02:20.489> it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
enough reverse power to get out which it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.300 
enough reverse power to get out which it
does<00:02:20.879> but<00:02:21.500> you'd<00:02:22.500> think<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.860> would<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.159> kind

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
does but you'd think it would just kind

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.920 
does but you'd think it would just kind
of<00:02:23.400> instantly<00:02:23.549> get<00:02:23.970> out<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.269> so<00:02:24.480> that's

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
of instantly get out of there so that's

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.780 
of instantly get out of there so that's
the<00:02:25.140> first<00:02:25.230> map<00:02:25.500> hope<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.799> guys<00:02:25.950> enjoy<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.489> and

remember if this was the cruiser or the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.099 
remember if this was the cruiser or the
Corvette<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.019> think<00:02:47.060> let's<00:02:48.060> see<00:02:48.269> this<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.079> the

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.960 
Corvette I think let's see this is the
cruiser<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.920> other<00:02:50.040> one<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:50.819> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
cruiser so the other one was the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.520 
cruiser so the other one was the
Corvette<00:02:51.329> this<00:02:51.510> one<00:02:51.690> was<00:02:51.840> made<00:02:51.870> by<00:02:52.260> leggy

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
Corvette this one was made by leggy

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.949 
Corvette this one was made by leggy
Pluto<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.609> one's<00:02:53.790> pretty<00:02:53.970> awesome<00:02:54.480> he<00:02:54.810> had<00:02:54.930> a

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
Pluto this one's pretty awesome he had a

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.569 
Pluto this one's pretty awesome he had a
little<00:02:55.200> bit<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.609> flying<00:02:56.609> out<00:02:57.409> before<00:02:58.409> this<00:02:58.620> in

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
little bit of flying out before this in

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.490 
little bit of flying out before this in
the<00:02:59.819> Banshee<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.389> I<00:03:00.450> cut<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:00.930> out<00:03:01.079> just

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
the Banshee so I cut that out just

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.860 
the Banshee so I cut that out just
because<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:02.090> wasn't<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.209> know<00:03:03.299> he<00:03:03.450> wasn't<00:03:03.599> at

because it wasn't you know he wasn't at
the<00:03:03.900> at<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.739> actual<00:03:05.159> map<00:03:05.489> at<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:06.209> point<00:03:06.540> in

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
the at the actual map at that point in

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.539 
the at the actual map at that point in
time<00:03:06.689> but<00:03:07.049> here<00:03:07.319> you've<00:03:07.739> got<00:03:07.769> kind<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.400> like

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
time but here you've got kind of like

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.179 
time but here you've got kind of like
the<00:03:08.730> beam<00:03:09.000> me<00:03:09.180> up<00:03:09.209> Scotty<00:03:09.750> area<00:03:10.319> where<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:10.950> can

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
the beam me up Scotty area where you can

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.750 
the beam me up Scotty area where you can
get<00:03:11.370> up<00:03:11.879> and<00:03:12.060> down<00:03:12.299> from<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:13.730> from<00:03:14.730> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
get up and down from the from the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.479 
get up and down from the from the
Corvette<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:16.409> pretty<00:03:16.680> sweet<00:03:17.069> it's<00:03:17.340> a

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
Corvette and it's pretty sweet it's a

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.069 
Corvette and it's pretty sweet it's a
it's<00:03:17.819> really<00:03:18.329> big<00:03:19.310> no<00:03:20.310> pun<00:03:20.849> intended<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.690> guess

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
it's really big no pun intended I guess

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.530 
it's really big no pun intended I guess
I<00:03:22.290> can<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:22.889> even<00:03:23.040> say<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.370> for<00:03:24.030> like

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
I can you can you even say that for like

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.280 
I can you can you even say that for like
an<00:03:24.690> implied<00:03:25.109> that's<00:03:25.530> what<00:03:25.680> she<00:03:25.889> said<00:03:26.160> I'm<00:03:26.699> mo

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
an implied that's what she said I'm mo

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.780 
an implied that's what she said I'm mo
probably<00:03:28.290> doesn't<00:03:28.650> even<00:03:28.680> qualify<00:03:29.010> as<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.459> pun

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
probably doesn't even qualify as a pun

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.449 
probably doesn't even qualify as a pun
because<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.329> not<00:03:30.540> really<00:03:30.810> that

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
because it's not really that

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.319 
because it's not really that

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
who don't know in the campaign that like

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.559 
who don't know in the campaign that like
freaking<00:04:06.900> destroys<00:04:07.409> the<00:04:07.889> the<00:04:08.760> one<00:04:08.940> America<00:04:09.329> I

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
freaking destroys the the one America I

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.509 
freaking destroys the the one America I
almost<00:04:09.900> said<00:04:10.019> American<00:04:10.500> that's<00:04:10.919> a<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.190> guess<00:04:11.280> it

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
almost said American that's a I guess it

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.599 
almost said American that's a I guess it
would<00:04:11.669> be<00:04:11.699> American<00:04:12.299> it's<00:04:12.530> UNSC<00:04:13.530> but<00:04:14.159> i<00:04:14.190> think

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
would be American it's UNSC but i think

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.670 
would be American it's UNSC but i think
that<00:04:14.639> stands<00:04:15.510> for<00:04:15.750> something<00:04:15.900> else<00:04:16.139> since

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
that stands for something else since

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.000 
that stands for something else since
like<00:04:16.919> United<00:04:17.599> Nations<00:04:18.599> space<00:04:19.079> Corps

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
like United Nations space Corps

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.589 
like United Nations space Corps
something<00:04:20.519> stupid<00:04:20.909> like<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.239> don't<00:04:21.389> know

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
something stupid like that I don't know

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.930 
something stupid like that I don't know
anyway<00:04:22.260> moving<00:04:22.770> on<00:04:23.010> I'll<00:04:23.190> put<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.370> picture<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.849> a

and I get I don't know ah that's just
what<00:05:28.169> I<00:05:28.199> imagined<00:05:28.979> the<00:05:29.159> first<00:05:29.370> time<00:05:29.550> I<00:05:29.580> saw

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
what I imagined the first time I saw

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.219 
what I imagined the first time I saw
that<00:05:30.030> so<00:05:30.300> whatever<00:05:30.900> but<00:05:32.270> here<00:05:33.270> is<00:05:33.479> your<00:05:33.960> little

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
that so whatever but here is your little

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.089 
that so whatever but here is your little
launch<00:05:34.620> Bay<00:05:34.949> you've<00:05:35.190> got<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:36.650> jet<00:05:37.650> packs<00:05:37.860> here

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
launch Bay you've got the jet packs here

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.330 
launch Bay you've got the jet packs here
and<00:05:38.310> sadly<00:05:38.819> you<00:05:38.849> can't<00:05:39.000> go<00:05:39.389> through<00:05:39.719> the

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
and sadly you can't go through the

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.409 
and sadly you can't go through the
shields<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.430> theater<00:05:41.789> mode<00:05:41.909> and<00:05:42.120> I<00:05:42.180> don't

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
shields and theater mode and I don't

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.050 
shields and theater mode and I don't
know<00:05:42.690> if<00:05:42.810> he<00:05:42.930> knew<00:05:43.080> that<00:05:43.259> or<00:05:43.409> not<00:05:43.440> but<00:05:43.770> yeah<00:05:44.729> so

know if he knew that or not but yeah so

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.659 
know if he knew that or not but yeah so
you<00:05:45.479> I<00:05:45.509> can<00:05:45.870> just<00:05:46.020> imagine<00:05:46.139> like<00:05:46.650> about<00:05:47.190> 50<00:05:47.639> of

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
you I can just imagine like about 50 of

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.339 
you I can just imagine like about 50 of
those<00:05:47.940> little<00:05:48.120> brutes<00:05:48.509> just<00:05:48.779> flying<00:05:49.110> out<00:05:49.319> of

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
those little brutes just flying out of

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.939 
those little brutes just flying out of
that<00:05:49.590> like<00:05:49.740> they're<00:05:49.919> bees<00:05:50.509> and<00:05:51.509> you<00:05:52.409> know<00:05:52.529> just

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
that like they're bees and you know just

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.339 
that like they're bees and you know just
trying<00:05:53.250> to<00:05:53.430> destroy<00:05:53.819> people<00:05:54.229> with<00:05:55.229> their

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
trying to destroy people with their

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.080 
trying to destroy people with their
little<00:05:55.500> jet<00:05:55.740> packs<00:05:55.949> and<00:05:56.159> so<00:05:56.310> here<00:05:56.550> also<00:05:56.729> he's

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
little jet packs and so here also he's

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.019 
little jet packs and so here also he's
got<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:57.539> lasers<00:05:58.319> at<00:05:58.949> how<00:05:59.129> it<00:05:59.310> you<00:05:59.729> know<00:05:59.819> goes

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
got the lasers at how it you know goes

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:03.019 
got the lasers at how it you know goes
around<00:06:00.270> on<00:06:00.449> like<00:06:01.069> glasses-free<00:06:02.069> can<00:06:02.340> reach<00:06:02.639> at

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:03.029 
around on like glasses-free can reach at

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.100 
around on like glasses-free can reach at
the<00:06:03.180> end<00:06:03.330> I'm<00:06:03.509> pretty<00:06:03.690> sure<00:06:03.810> that's<00:06:03.960> what

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
the end I'm pretty sure that's what

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.930 
the end I'm pretty sure that's what
happened<00:06:04.409> anyway<00:06:05.190> moving<00:06:05.430> on<00:06:07.190> just<00:06:08.190> yeah<00:06:08.699> so

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
happened anyway moving on just yeah so

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.730 
happened anyway moving on just yeah so
you've<00:06:09.060> got<00:06:09.090> a<00:06:09.210> little<00:06:09.360> hole<00:06:09.569> for<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:09.900> lasers

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
you've got a little hole for the lasers

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.159 
you've got a little hole for the lasers
and<00:06:11.009> whatnot<00:06:11.669> and<00:06:11.879> then<00:06:12.000> up<00:06:12.300> on<00:06:12.449> the<00:06:12.599> top<00:06:12.900> here

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
and whatnot and then up on the top here

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:14.480 
and whatnot and then up on the top here
which<00:06:13.440> you<00:06:13.560> will<00:06:13.680> see<00:06:13.710> in<00:06:13.830> a<00:06:13.979> second<00:06:14.340> they've

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
which you will see in a second they've

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.269 
which you will see in a second they've
got<00:06:14.759> the<00:06:15.090> little<00:06:15.659> defense<00:06:16.110> turrets<00:06:16.529> I<00:06:16.860> suppose

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:17.279 
got the little defense turrets I suppose

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.360 
got the little defense turrets I suppose
and<00:06:17.520> it's<00:06:17.699> actually<00:06:18.629> pretty<00:06:18.810> smart<00:06:19.370> tactical

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
and it's actually pretty smart tactical

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.300 
and it's actually pretty smart tactical
wise<00:06:20.550> in<00:06:20.849> like<00:06:21.029> real<00:06:21.389> life<00:06:21.629> I<00:06:21.870> suppose<00:06:22.310> there's

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
wise in like real life I suppose there's

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.360 
wise in like real life I suppose there's
a<00:06:23.370> nice<00:06:23.580> little<00:06:23.759> bridge<00:06:24.919> hoverboard<00:06:25.919> thing

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
a nice little bridge hoverboard thing

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.930 
a nice little bridge hoverboard thing
actually<00:06:27.210> hover<00:06:27.539> ceiling<00:06:28.110> thing<00:06:28.409> I<00:06:28.590> guess<00:06:28.940> to

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
actually hover ceiling thing I guess to

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.850 
actually hover ceiling thing I guess to
move<00:06:30.120> from<00:06:30.389> each<00:06:30.629> side<00:06:30.930> in<00:06:31.349> case<00:06:31.560> you<00:06:31.740> know

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
move from each side in case you know

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.459 
move from each side in case you know
you're<00:06:31.979> getting<00:06:32.069> swarmed<00:06:32.580> by<00:06:33.289> Falcons<00:06:34.289> or

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469 
you're getting swarmed by Falcons or

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.339 
you're getting swarmed by Falcons or
whatever<00:06:34.740> I<00:06:35.039> don't<00:06:35.610> know<00:06:35.699> but<00:06:36.599> yes<00:06:36.750> as<00:06:37.080> you<00:06:37.229> can

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
whatever I don't know but yes as you can

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.920 
whatever I don't know but yes as you can
see<00:06:37.620> it's<00:06:38.460> a<00:06:38.580> pretty<00:06:38.610> sweet<00:06:39.270> map

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
see it's a pretty sweet map

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.749 
see it's a pretty sweet map
and<00:06:40.020> he<00:06:40.560> made<00:06:40.740> it<00:06:40.770> fairly<00:06:41.130> quickly<00:06:41.340> i'm

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 
and he made it fairly quickly i'm

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.090 
and he made it fairly quickly i'm
thinking<00:06:42.150> he<00:06:43.050> said<00:06:43.229> he<00:06:43.350> made<00:06:43.470> it<00:06:43.620> specifically

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
thinking he said he made it specifically

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.969 
thinking he said he made it specifically
for<00:06:44.370> shuttles<00:06:44.639> featured<00:06:45.090> so<00:06:45.630> and<00:06:46.590> now<00:06:46.680> that

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
for shuttles featured so and now that

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.590 
for shuttles featured so and now that
it's<00:06:47.130> been<00:06:47.220> like<00:06:47.490> two<00:06:47.759> weeks<00:06:47.789> and<00:06:48.270> this<00:06:48.449> would

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
it's been like two weeks and this would

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.240 
it's been like two weeks and this would
take<00:06:48.810> probably<00:06:48.990> like<00:06:49.380> a<00:06:49.410> month<00:06:49.560> for<00:06:50.070> me<00:06:50.160> to

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
take probably like a month for me to

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.680 
take probably like a month for me to
make<00:06:50.400> but<00:06:50.820> there<00:06:50.970> you<00:06:51.060> go<00:06:51.180> there's<00:06:51.360> the<00:06:51.539> nice

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
little hover ceiling and the other side

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.570 
little hover ceiling and the other side
of<00:06:54.210> the<00:06:54.780> the<00:06:55.410> turrets<00:06:55.740> there<00:06:55.889> so<00:06:56.100> hope<00:06:56.550> you
