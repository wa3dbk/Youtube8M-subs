go
so<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:20.160> checked<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> out<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:21.119> actually<00:00:21.539> went<00:00:21.869> to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
so I checked it out I actually went to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.370 
so I checked it out I actually went to
the<00:00:22.050> site<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:23.430> found<00:00:23.850> my<00:00:24.000> profile<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.869> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the site and I found my profile and I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.170 
the site and I found my profile and I
saw<00:00:25.619> what<00:00:25.830> was<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.820> thought<00:00:27.000> well

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
saw what was in it and I thought well

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.910 
saw what was in it and I thought well
you<00:00:27.330> know<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.689> know<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.230> publicly

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
you know I know this is publicly

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.609 
you know I know this is publicly
available<00:00:29.429> information<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:31.349> being

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
available information but it's being

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.049 
available information but it's being
collected<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> option<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
collected here and I have the option to

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.000 
collected here and I have the option to
opt<00:00:33.210> out<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.260> gonna<00:00:34.380> go<00:00:34.620> ahead<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.920> do

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
opt out so I'm gonna go ahead and do

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.170 
opt out so I'm gonna go ahead and do
that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.360 
that
it<00:00:36.360> might<00:00:36.540> discourage<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.680> person<00:00:38.129> from

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
it might discourage one person from

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.360 
it might discourage one person from
invading<00:00:39.090> my<00:00:39.210> privacy<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.290> suits<00:00:41.160> me

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
invading my privacy so that suits me

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.840 
invading my privacy so that suits me
just<00:00:41.399> fine

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
just fine

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.869 
just fine
so<00:00:42.840> rather<00:00:43.200> than<00:00:43.460> make<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.640> big

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
so rather than make this a big

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.119 
so rather than make this a big
discussion<00:00:45.390> about<00:00:45.450> why<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.800> thought<00:00:46.920> I'd

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
discussion about why I just thought I'd

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.790 
discussion about why I just thought I'd
just<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> quick<00:00:47.730> video<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.120> show<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.360> how<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
just do a quick video to show you how to

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.560 
just do a quick video to show you how to
delete<00:00:49.800> your<00:00:49.860> profile<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:51.000> basically<00:00:51.390> you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
just go to Spokeo comm and you type in

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.189

just thought I'm a big video guy so I
thought<00:01:03.539> video<00:01:03.690> would<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.019> appropriate<00:01:05.010> for

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
thought video would be appropriate for

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.940 
thought video would be appropriate for
this<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.479> I'm<00:01:06.570> searching<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:06.990> John<00:01:07.470> Doe<00:01:07.740> right
