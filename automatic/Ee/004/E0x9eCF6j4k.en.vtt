00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
also like to use it for rolling or you

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420 
also like to use it for rolling or you
can<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.570> an<00:01:45.659> extender<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.439> want<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.799> roll

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that we're not using

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.340 
that we're not using

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
it's a textured wall or a flat wall so

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.119 
it's a textured wall or a flat wall so
you're<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> need<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> flat<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.709> case

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
you're going to need a flat in this case

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.650 
you're going to need a flat in this case
and<00:02:11.580> then<00:02:11.700> you're<00:02:11.849> also<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.269> to<00:02:12.330> need<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
line on your edges and cutting in is a

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.449 
line on your edges and cutting in is a
short-handled<00:02:27.720> angled<00:02:28.260> brush<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.950> really

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
to start painting

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.430

okay<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.340> we<00:03:05.579> have<00:03:05.819> poured<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.510> paint<00:03:06.810> into

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
okay so we have poured the paint into

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.110 
okay so we have poured the paint into
our<00:03:07.739> paint<00:03:08.130> tray<00:03:08.370> right<00:03:08.549> here<00:03:08.639> and<00:03:09.030> we're

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
our paint tray right here and we're

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.699 
our paint tray right here and we're
going<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.299> start<00:03:09.630> cutting<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.139> with<00:03:10.260> our<00:03:10.440> brush

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
going to start cutting in with our brush

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.220 
going to start cutting in with our brush
so<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.880> want<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.239> get<00:03:12.359> a<00:03:12.420> little<00:03:12.840> bit<00:03:13.019> of

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
so you just want to get a little bit of

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.800 
so you just want to get a little bit of
paint<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.280> brush<00:03:14.400> not<00:03:15.209> too<00:03:15.450> much<00:03:15.630> because

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
paint on the brush not too much because

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.569 
paint on the brush not too much because
that<00:03:16.170> causes<00:03:16.709> drips<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:20.130> you're<00:03:20.459> going

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
that causes drips and then you're going

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.390 
that causes drips and then you're going
to<00:03:20.670> climb<00:03:20.970> up<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.389> start<00:03:21.900> on<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.470> corners<00:03:23.040> and

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
to climb up and start on the corners and

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.390 
to climb up and start on the corners and
a<00:03:24.299> really<00:03:24.630> good<00:03:24.780> way<00:03:24.959> is<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.290> kind<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.590> start<00:03:26.160> a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
a really good way is you kind of start a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.160 
a really good way is you kind of start a
little<00:03:26.700> outside<00:03:26.940> where<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.660> want<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.989> line

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
little outside where you want the line

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.309 
little outside where you want the line
then<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.590> just<00:03:28.799> move<00:03:29.639> in<00:03:30.329> with<00:03:30.870> your<00:03:31.049> breath

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
then you just move in with your breath

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.309 
then you just move in with your breath
so<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.829> get<00:03:32.099> right<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.790> edge<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:34.109> you<00:03:34.139> can

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
so you get right to that edge so you can

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.490 
so you get right to that edge so you can
have<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.500> lot<00:03:34.829> of<00:03:35.010> control<00:03:35.430> right<00:03:35.670> there<00:03:36.500> go

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
have a lot of control right there go

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.839 
have a lot of control right there go
back<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.010> forth<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:39.169> and<00:03:40.519> then<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.639> just

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
back and forth on that and then you just

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.729 
back and forth on that and then you just
continue<00:03:42.000> around<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.780> corners<00:03:43.200> just<00:03:43.230> slowly

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
continue around the corners just slowly

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.339 
continue around the corners just slowly
moving<00:03:44.519> in<00:03:44.730> okay<00:03:45.299> now<00:03:45.599> we<00:03:45.660> have<00:03:46.079> finished

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
moving in okay now we have finished

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.620 
moving in okay now we have finished
cutting<00:03:46.889> in<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.609> can<00:03:47.760> see<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.000> just<00:03:48.150> cut

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
cutting in and you can see I just cut

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.170 
cutting in and you can see I just cut
around<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:49.799> edges<00:03:50.190> of<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.459> ceiling<00:03:50.970> and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
around the edges of the ceiling and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.990 
around the edges of the ceiling and
around<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:52.290> fan<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:54.480> means<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.500> time

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
around the fan and that means it is time

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.559 
around the fan and that means it is time
to<00:03:57.200> roll<00:03:58.200> because<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.459> cutting<00:03:59.790> in<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.239> all

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
to roll because the cutting in is all

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.710 
to roll because the cutting in is all
