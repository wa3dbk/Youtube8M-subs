kind of want to make sure that we're
doing<00:00:59.680> our<00:01:00.160> bit<00:01:00.460> because<00:01:01.000> we<00:01:01.210> know<00:01:01.390> Roland<00:01:01.780> are

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.310 
doing their bit with a fantastic bit of
kit<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:06.580> would<00:01:07.360> say<00:01:07.540> that<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.840> machine<00:01:08.170> has

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
kit so I would say that the machine has

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.960 
kit so I would say that the machine has
definitely<00:01:08.770> helped<00:01:09.070> us<00:01:09.130> expand<00:01:09.640> our<00:01:09.820> business

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
there's no doubt about it having this

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.960 
there's no doubt about it having this
machine<00:01:13.030> has<00:01:13.799> allowed<00:01:14.799> us<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:15.100> open<00:01:15.280> up<00:01:15.640> so

tried<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:55.830> latex<00:02:56.830> machine<00:02:57.250> we<00:02:57.430> have<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.850> latex

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
tried a latex machine we have a latex

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.430 
tried a latex machine we have a latex
machine<00:02:58.840> we've<00:02:59.410> had<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.710> for<00:02:59.740> approximately

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
machine we've had it for approximately

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.100 
machine we've had it for approximately
four<00:03:02.440> months<00:03:02.650> now<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.880> would<00:03:04.840> say<00:03:04.990> it's

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
four months now and I would say it's

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.480 
four months now and I would say it's
probably<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.380> biggest<00:03:05.530> mistake<00:03:05.830> we<00:03:06.190> made<00:03:06.370> as

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
probably the biggest mistake we made as

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.270 
probably the biggest mistake we made as

a business purchasing one selling points
of<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.490> machine<00:03:09.790> were<00:03:09.940> great<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.600> inks

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
of the machine were great that the inks

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.770 
of the machine were great that the inks
instantly<00:03:11.320> drying<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:12.100> we<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.430> print

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
instantly drying that we can print

vehicle wraps have we done straight off

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.230 
vehicle wraps have we done straight off
the<00:03:19.840> machine<00:03:20.110> probably<00:03:20.380> two<00:03:20.770> so<00:03:21.700> does<00:03:22.090> it

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
the machine probably two so does it

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.690 
the machine probably two so does it
warrant<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.630> money<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:22.990> pay<00:03:23.170> for<00:03:23.440> it<00:03:23.700> probably

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
warrant the money we pay for it probably

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.590 
warrant the money we pay for it probably
not<00:03:26.100> so<00:03:27.100> now<00:03:27.880> we're<00:03:28.060> stuck<00:03:28.270> with<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.510> because

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
not so now we're stuck with it because

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.120 
not so now we're stuck with it because
we've<00:03:28.900> paid<00:03:29.080> for<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.380> we<00:03:29.560> can't<00:03:29.800> really<00:03:29.950> do

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
we've paid for it we can't really do

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.240 
we've paid for it we can't really do
anything<00:03:30.160> with<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:32.830> be<00:03:32.920> honest<00:03:33.130> with

anything with it so to be honest with

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.610 
anything with it so to be honest with
you<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.820> machine<00:03:34.150> sits<00:03:34.450> there<00:03:34.690> with<00:03:35.170> white

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620
