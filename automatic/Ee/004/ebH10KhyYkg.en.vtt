00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:06.580
 come tankers with you john silver and you 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:11.179
 watch this video because you bought 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:14.889
 t-54 you paid for it and now you do not know 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:18.589
 what to do with this good tank 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:21.830
 everything is very simple to listen to smart 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.509
 people and do as they say pay 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.570
 attention let's look at the tree 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.650
 research here was t-44 here became t-54 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.710
 I have it in the top 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.689
 because I was waiting for him when but since 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.420
 Recently, there was an action, then most likely 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.640
 many on on buy and 54 and now on 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:46.550
 Well, it goes to the top of the harmony in general the essence 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.149
 This video is that for example, let's 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.239
 we'll see 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:55.870
 development of this tank you from t-44 should 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.809
 was to get lp1 guns 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.379
 100 mm with medium penetration 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.720
 175 millimeters 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:10.040
 my advice is to sell t-44 to leave lp1 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:13.270
 leave the radio era era 113 and which engine 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.270
 there g54 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:22.410
 no engine apparently not necessary yes for sure and 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.020
 then the radio will stay and fluff 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:30.650
 in principle, you should have nothing more 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:34.680
 be in this tank openly the bottom line is that 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.520
 as soon as you bought the t-54 you should 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:45.450
 a tool that is not very good let's say 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:52.979
 even hard mastered and the difference is how 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:55.200
 see in the firing speed well 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.950
 and a little bit of a mass of course here 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.869
 interesting joke turns 154 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.080
 pay attention to me now 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.580
 running stock set let's 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.990
 let's see how they differ 38.7 tons 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.440
 this is the maximum load for this 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.870
 running let's understand now 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.090
 usually on tanks you have to open 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.730
 started running then everything else here 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.500
 the opposite occurs in case please 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.070
 My attention is set to rammer 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.860
 weighing 200 kilograms stabilizer 100 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:33.300
 kilogram and fan 150 kilograms in 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.820
 the sum gives 250 plus 200 450 kilograms then 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.130
 There is a note here is 38 mm 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.680
 we have a maximum mass of thirty-five and 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.170
 five we still have a reserve to 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.950
 more probably let's say you 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.660
 install the radio station t-44 down from 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.840
 t-44 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.690
 tower you 7 500 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.030
 and 8,500, as you see, now stands with me 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.220
 top tower that is even she became 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.019
 calmly 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.670
 let's just look further set 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:10.390
 engine yes yes as you can see weight 700 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.390
 kilogram and 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.920
 700 meaning nothing will change if we 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:29.799
 then put the engine to study 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:34.549
 I recommend before studying the chassis 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:38.480
 many will agree with me top tower 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:41.620
 enter any stock guns 2 300 and 2 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.829
 557 let's take even the hardest 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.829
 as you can see it is even 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.829
 by stock 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:04:00.230
 but also the crew let's return my gun 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:04:04.040
 which I usually use but all I 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.189
 I wanted to say that pumping this 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.250
 tank starts with pumping the tower behind there 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:14.200
 then any of these guns is better 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:18.190
 lower because even 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 with all the advantages of a break through which 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.590
 gives this upper arms lower 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.970
 more comfortable in the game we see that 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.580
 rate of fire a little bit more 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.600
 armor penetration less but cumulative 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:40.500
 or there subcaliber more than 330 no no 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.500
 more the same but all the other roofs 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:51.070
 scatter less than 35 not 39 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.870
 time information 2 and 3 places 290 and weight 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.490
 naturally easier that machine easier 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.110
 ride 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.500
 principle dynamics of course is added 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.200
 when the next 700 engine is studied 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.050
 horses instead of 620 and but not so 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.830
 much as it would seem and 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.750
 at least put the chassis in the end 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.300
 we get mass 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.900
 thirty nine and eight having on board 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:21.790
 only 35 and 4 that is, it makes it easier 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.990
 our tank is in motion with turns 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.300
 some and 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.380
 on the initial speed set 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.490
 as far as I understand it, as it were , 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.680
 engine power to the current mass 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.350
 we get the mass per kilogram limit 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.610
 the mass is already too 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.540
 hard for tanks and all the best of luck for you 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.540
 is happy
