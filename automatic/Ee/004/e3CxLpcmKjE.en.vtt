In this excerice rememebr about few key
elements during your demonstraton.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.000
The first thing is to show clearly that you are
flooding the mask slowly.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It is very important especially when you plan to go with your students to the cold open water.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.500
If you teach them from the beggining to flood the mask slowly, they will be better prepered for the cold water entering thier mask.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.000
The second key element occurs after you replace the mask.
This is clearing the mask by the nose.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.340
It is important to show clearly that you first
start to clear the mask with your nose

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.260
and then bent your head backwards.
