00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello we are Carlos and Sergio and we are going to 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.980
 explain the work we are going to do 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.219
 then download the program and 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.929
 contact us as a server and 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.110
 we proceed to the installation of said 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.110
 Program 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.740
 and we're downloading, we're going 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.740
 installing 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.090
 We accept the license conditions 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.960
 of the program we agree and 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.699
 we mark all the actions 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.699
 corresponding - scott 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.540
 we follow our our program the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.370
 we keep 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.510
 on the desk 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.510
 we leave it with 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.300
 and we continue installing the program as 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.300
 I have already installed correctly 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.859
 we leave everything you wanted 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.409
 default with your port runs by 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.090
 my corresponding below 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.630
 we will do the program and create a user 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.630
 called anonymous 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.689
 and then we will add it to 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.689
 a folder that we have created 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.760
 later on our desk the 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.880
 folder is called dragons 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.510
 and we will add the permissions 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.590
 corresponding reading 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.560
 Y 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.190
 list and we will create another user that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.710
 will call Carlos 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.020
 we will also add in the folder 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.860
 dragons and we will put you with your permissions 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:51.990
 corresponding reading writing 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.990
 deleted and listed 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.829
 so that all this becomes practical 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.829
 it will be necessary to restart the service first 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.690
 we look for the server and we organize it 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.560
 to be started and then 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.050
 we open a command interpreter 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.050
 we put in ftp and the ip of the server 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.510
 here we put the anonymous user that 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.739
 we have created previously 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.739
 and your password 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.910
 now let's create 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.910
 a document in the dragons folder 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.720
 and from the tv we are going to try 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.720
 download us 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.770
 and it leaves us effectively and now we're going to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.170
 try to upload it 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.590
 and he does not leave us since we told him that 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.030
 we could not 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.030
 now we put the same 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.040
 we put user carlos had the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.490
 indicated elements the password 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.950
 and we downloaded the file 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.430
 and effectively the sheep and now we're going to 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.430
 upload it 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.730
 and it effectively leaves us
