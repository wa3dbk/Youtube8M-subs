00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.030
 1 I have 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.780
 p 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:13.459
 the very good ones were not deactivated by starting a new job in states 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:14.310
 United 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.680
 desserts a game to search and destroy this on the apadis map with the mpl 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.999
 Foreign bulletproof vests prestidigitación pro and marathon pro 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.720
 but I bring them today is a good that different is something that wen 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.680
 yesterday in fact put in practices and is that we are as we are ones of customs 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.800
 with this I mean that by bad mind I for example on this map led to 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.770
 find and destroy in a cape what is what yesterday or did not come by 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.060
 the area where 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.440
 where are you right now but you knew it by the ramp that there just 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.830
 we are together to take out i pd I realized another one will be practiced something that 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.120
 It was p yes I repeated 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.250
 an action in the first three rounds to destroy would always find me 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.250
 the same people living for the same place 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.090
 evidently 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.830
 the proof all my suspicion was true and we are chicken I think we are people of 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.330
 custom because he thinks that 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.880
 because we do all these months we do the same thing we're going to work for the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.870
 same place 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.290
 but we are going to study we have coffee in the same bar 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.320
 and in the world of employment and we play in the same way always always use in 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.890
 all the maps more or less we repeat the same colony miramar the grenade by 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.440
 the same place that we jumped the same wall then that's what I wanted 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.850
 check how you have seen the apra rounds 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.740
 taboo subject a series of percent players in the central part of the building 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.229
 of the map and right now as you are watching, I repeat exactly what 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.190
 same 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.540
 I am a person of customs although I do not usually play in this area 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.040
 never especially about semapa pd I realized that percent 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.170
 in this second round of six watching I am finding the same people 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.170
 in the same place exactly what has not been found 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.659
 previously 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.659
 Per hundred I think that somehow 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.580
 by the way we always repeat the same thing for that reason it is necessary to leave that post 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.530
 comments and you are mostly of the people who have played seeks to destroy 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.279
 because we who play 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:28.649
 the consortium destroy domain comparable efe by equipment for example what 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.509
 what is we fight for success? 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:35.929
 oo domains equalizer the report of dead more than 700 grams ie 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.039
 normally the same actions are always repeated 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:43.029
 then all those people who bet seek to destroy and those who are not well 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.219
 I would like to let me show you comments is really 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.579
 extensive and it sounded that we are for example usual people 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.879
 as I have seen this has been the second round and now we start with the third 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.939
 round this third round again I repeat exactly the same as there was 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.840
 done in the two previous rounds 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.610
 Cohen identical result has been raised again by the races down the ladder 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.209
 as you are seeing and I come back to find them in the same place 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.479
 percent was something I wanted to prove none is a grace it's worth because 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.919
 to be honest 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.009
 by the way this guy always in the assumption of equal does not seem to be joseph 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.180
 put to the repetition is also because it was an entity well cut and 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:27.189
 you can see from another point of view what happened and the temper 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:33.359
 but as you can see now that there is one who is smarter than hunger and she is 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.079
 as you can see there is waiting for me ready grave they have put the repetition 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.169
 to see it left 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.849
 they go around because I'm a person of customs and she was waiting for me 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.439
 there which lizard lying on the ground watching how it crawls 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:50.169
 and then to illa corzine kill me because I already knew I was going to come over there 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.959
 he commented and he was going to kill me 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.839
 It's a funny thing, not me, especially 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:58.939
 yes it is true that in all the wines duplicate or playing from the caduf 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:59.749
 and 4 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:05.149
 the normally always when you trust an area a way to do in that in that 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:09.069
 map is passed the same is done the ramada by the same site the polisher 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.610
 for a hundred or you always try to move around it for the same place not then 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.820
 That's why I wanted you to clear up and show up to comment if you really 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.170
 especially on the issue of searching and destroying what to see there is no comeback to 6 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.510
 or do not do the same in each vehicle 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.710
 per hundred as you see good hour threw a seemingly taken out world 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.330
 percent exposed I run away because I have always custom 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.129
 burn me known my own napalm if I did not want what would happen to me then 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:38.400
 mozart a little 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.500
 efe under what is this is the business name of it normally when I go out 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.900
 when it's time to attack on that map, I go up on this side, okay, I do not get in there because of the 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.210
 center but I wanted to try is to know what was happening 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.160
 here goes for my partner I find the character I say because his partner 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.560
 miguel otero that the most details and then I cost the other cetarsa ​​that 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.130
 I got it right and I hope you drive it showed comments if you are or 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.749
 no personal habits 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:05.959
 I hope you liked it I hope you leave me your post has become bush too 

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:08.499
 obviously nothing we see the next until then
