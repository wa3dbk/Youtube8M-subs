and<00:00:00.599> what<00:00:00.750> we're<00:00:00.870> gonna<00:00:00.930> do<00:00:01.170> here<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.650> we're

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
and what we're gonna do here is we're

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.260 
and what we're gonna do here is we're
gonna<00:00:02.909> stretch<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:04.140> muscles<00:00:04.589> that<00:00:05.549> basically

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
gonna stretch the muscles that basically

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.820 
gonna stretch the muscles that basically
are<00:00:06.450> involved<00:00:06.899> when<00:00:07.049> you're<00:00:07.200> playing<00:00:07.379> guitar

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
are involved when you're playing guitar

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.459 
are involved when you're playing guitar
and<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.940> really<00:00:09.389> think<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.780> essential<00:00:10.200> to

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
and I really think this is essential to

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.830 
and I really think this is essential to
having<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.800> productive<00:00:11.300> practice<00:00:12.300> session<00:00:12.690> or

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
having a productive practice session or

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.839 
having a productive practice session or
gig<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.380> it's<00:00:13.769> also<00:00:13.950> essential<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.580> not

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
gig and it's also essential to not

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.960 
gig and it's also essential to not
hurting<00:00:15.269> yourself<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.520> cramping<00:00:17.520> up<00:00:17.699> and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
hurting yourself and cramping up and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.910 
hurting yourself and cramping up and
it's<00:00:18.600> very<00:00:18.660> similar<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.320> what<00:00:19.439> an<00:00:19.529> athlete

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
it's very similar to what an athlete

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.609 
it's very similar to what an athlete
would<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.279> before<00:00:21.210> they<00:00:21.630> went<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.170> play<00:00:22.590> a

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
would do before they went in to play a

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.750 
would do before they went in to play a
game<00:00:22.920> or<00:00:23.220> do<00:00:23.580> some<00:00:23.789> exercising<00:00:24.710> okay<00:00:25.760> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
game or do some exercising okay the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.540 
game or do some exercising okay the
first<00:00:26.970> one<00:00:27.240> begins<00:00:28.109> with<00:00:28.230> stretching<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
first one begins with stretching the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.359 
first one begins with stretching the
back<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.210> shoulders<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.929> arms<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.560> guitar

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
back and shoulders and arms and guitar

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.750 
back and shoulders and arms and guitar
players<00:00:32.700> tend<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.120> slouch<00:00:33.680> when<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:35.219> practice

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
players tend to slouch when we practice

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.549 
players tend to slouch when we practice
so<00:00:35.910> these<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.239> really<00:00:36.510> important<00:00:36.989> I'm<00:00:37.410> going
