00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
this clip piece right here clip it onto

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.560 
this clip piece right here clip it onto
there<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:21.160> stick<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.430> over<00:02:21.700> there<00:02:22.030> not

there and just stick it over there not
permanently<00:02:23.170> but<00:02:23.290> do<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.370> want<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.700> to

permanently but do you want that to
stick<00:02:25.060> on<00:02:25.210> there<00:02:25.420> then<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.410> need<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.650> do<00:02:26.800> that

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
stick on there then you need to do that

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.420 
stick on there then you need to do that
before<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.400> do<00:02:27.490> anything<00:02:27.730> else<00:02:29.160> now<00:02:30.160> we're

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
before you do anything else now we're

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:38.330 
before you do anything else now we're
going<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.870> leave<00:02:33.480> six<00:02:34.480> spaces<00:02:34.720> right<00:02:35.140> here<00:02:36.360> and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
going to leave six spaces right here and

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.440 
going to leave six spaces right here and
so<00:02:39.340> you're<00:02:39.520> going<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.670> put<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.180> right<00:02:40.239> there

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
so you're going to put that right there

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.650 
so you're going to put that right there
and<00:02:43.470> then<00:02:44.790> you're<00:02:45.790> going<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.030> continue<00:02:46.360> the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
and then you're going to continue the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.780 
and then you're going to continue the
row<00:02:46.810> over<00:02:47.230> here<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:48.220> you're<00:02:48.340> going<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.520> leave

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
row over here so you're going to leave

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.130 
row over here so you're going to leave
these<00:02:49.600> spaces<00:02:50.020> over<00:02:50.410> here<00:02:51.930> then<00:02:52.930> we're<00:02:53.110> just

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
these spaces over here then we're just

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:15.860 
these spaces over here then we're just
going<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.530> continue<00:02:53.980> making<00:02:54.459> another<00:02:54.880> row

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.070 

just<00:03:16.870> like<00:03:16.989> that<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.630> should<00:03:19.660> have

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
just like that so you should have

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.030 
just like that so you should have
something<00:03:20.320> like<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:22.530> now<00:03:23.530> we're<00:03:23.680> just<00:03:23.830> going

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
something like that now we're just going

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.690 
something like that now we're just going
to<00:03:24.070> make<00:03:24.250> another<00:03:24.310> row<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:26.380> time

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
to make another row and this time

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:37.800 
to make another row and this time
we're<00:03:28.569> going<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.750> go<00:03:29.490> over<00:03:30.490> top<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:36.810> like

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
we're going to go over top of this like

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:46.440 
we're going to go over top of this like
that<00:03:42.930> I'm<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.500> going<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.739> compute<00:03:45.360> making<00:03:46.360> a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
that I'm just going to compute making a

00:03:46.450 --> 00:04:17.009 
that I'm just going to compute making a
row<00:04:02.670> okay<00:04:14.790> okay<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.810> should<00:04:16.989> have

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
row okay okay so you should have

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.680 
row okay okay so you should have
something<00:04:17.440> like<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.769> now<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:18.570> we're<00:04:19.570> going

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
something like that now and we're going

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.420 
something like that now and we're going
to<00:04:19.720> make<00:04:19.959> one<00:04:20.500> more<00:04:20.739> row<00:04:21.900> just<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.020> secure<00:04:23.440> this

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
to make one more row just to secure this

00:04:24.430 --> 00:05:04.860 
to make one more row just to secure this
part

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.280 

continue<00:05:05.870> on<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.290> back<00:05:06.970> so<00:05:07.970> this<00:05:08.480> structure

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
continue on the back so this structure

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.870 
continue on the back so this structure
is<00:05:09.530> pretty<00:05:09.800> much<00:05:09.980> balls<00:05:12.370> but<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:13.490> looks<00:05:13.670> pretty

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
is pretty much balls but it looks pretty

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:22.480 
is pretty much balls but it looks pretty
good<00:05:14.030> once<00:05:14.420> you're<00:05:14.600> finished<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:21.370> there<00:05:22.370> you

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
good once you're finished and there you

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.780 
good once you're finished and there you
go<00:05:22.670> so<00:05:24.010> you're<00:05:25.010> still<00:05:25.220> going<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.490> keep<00:05:25.640> this

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
go so you're still going to keep this

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.030 
go so you're still going to keep this
doorway<00:05:26.180> space<00:05:26.750> right<00:05:27.710> there<00:05:28.960> so<00:05:29.960> now<00:05:30.040> what

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
doorway space right there so now what

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.800 
doorway space right there so now what
we're<00:05:31.190> going<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.400> do<00:05:31.640> I'll<00:05:32.180> just<00:05:32.240> flip<00:05:32.630> it<00:05:32.750> like

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
we're going to do I'll just flip it like

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.730 
we're going to do I'll just flip it like
this<00:05:33.170> for<00:05:33.410> you

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
this for you

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.460 
this for you
and<00:05:34.370> what<00:05:35.360> we're<00:05:35.540> going<00:05:35.660> to<00:05:35.720> do<00:05:35.930> is<00:05:36.200> we're

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
and what we're going to do is we're
