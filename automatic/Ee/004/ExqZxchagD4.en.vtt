Ranger let's take a look here this is a
test<00:00:46.260> range<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.100> retail<00:00:47.460> beer<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.180> we

test range on the retail beer for as we

test range on the retail beer for as we
can<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.050> there's<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.440> much<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
can see there's not much going on on the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.029 
can see there's not much going on on the
Left<00:00:50.850> island<00:00:51.390> part<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.710> look<00:00:52.739> on

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
Left island part here but if we look on

CTA<00:00:53.579> dice<00:00:53.910> I've<00:00:54.120> added<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.570> hovertank

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
CTA dice I've added a hovertank

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.680 
CTA dice I've added a hovertank
snowmobile<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.579> hovercraft<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.510> is

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
snowmobile and one hovercraft which is

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.020 
snowmobile and one hovercraft which is
really<00:00:57.989> cool<00:00:58.230> seen<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.100> these<00:00:59.370> vehicles<00:00:59.730> are

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
really cool seen as these vehicles are

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.430 
really cool seen as these vehicles are
in<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> game<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> makes<00:01:00.780> sense<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.260> them<00:01:01.410> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
in the game it makes sense for them to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.590 
in the game it makes sense for them to
be<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.980> test<00:01:02.219> range<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.820> well<00:01:03.000> though

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
be on the test range as well though

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
be on the test range as well though
crossing<00:01:04.260> over<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> bridge<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.159> hover

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
crossing over the bridge on the hover

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.429 
crossing over the bridge on the hover
tank<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> little<00:01:06.540> bit<00:01:06.659> difficult<00:01:06.900> as<00:01:07.320> you

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
tank is a little bit difficult as you

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.469 
tank is a little bit difficult as you
can<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.920> pretty<00:01:07.950> much<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.580> destroys<00:01:09.240> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
can see it pretty much just destroys it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.600 
can see it pretty much just destroys it
and<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.409> back<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> test<00:01:11.100> range<00:01:11.369> on

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and if we go back to the test range on

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.730 
and if we go back to the test range on
retail<00:01:12.090> beer<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.260> see<00:01:13.500> there's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
retail beer for as you can see there's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.670 
retail beer for as you can see there's
no<00:01:13.979> cover<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.850> really<00:01:15.600> anything<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> help

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
no cover or really anything here to help

no cover or really anything here to help
us<00:01:16.890> learn<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.280> improve<00:01:17.430> our<00:01:17.850> skill<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509

technique but on CT there's a nice

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.730 
technique but on CT there's a nice
section<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.479> resembles<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.140> typical

section here that resembles a typical

some of the balls are actually hitting

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.670 
some of the balls are actually hitting
the<00:01:26.220> top<00:01:26.520> instead<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.240> magically<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.229> over

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the top instead of magically going over

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.319 
the top instead of magically going over
like<00:01:28.860> how<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.310> at<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> moment<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:30.150> the

though<00:04:06.870> but<00:04:07.229> as<00:04:07.379> you<00:04:07.530> can<00:04:07.620> see<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:07.949> dirt<00:04:08.159> bike

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
though but as you can see the dirt bike

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.819 
though but as you can see the dirt bike
catches<00:04:09.030> some<00:04:09.359> air<00:04:09.599> and<00:04:09.629> and<00:04:10.079> like<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.769> said

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
catches some air and and like I said

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.589 
catches some air and and like I said
actually<00:04:11.459> kills<00:04:11.819> you<00:04:12.000> we<00:04:12.180> thought<00:04:12.389> maybe

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
actually kills you we thought maybe

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.869 
actually kills you we thought maybe
because<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.169> catches<00:04:13.560> air<00:04:13.769> that's<00:04:14.069> why<00:04:14.400> kills

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
because it catches air that's why kills

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.000 
because it catches air that's why kills
you<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.299> in<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.750> normal<00:04:16.019> situation<00:04:16.260> when<00:04:16.979> I

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
you but in a normal situation when I

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.219 
you but in a normal situation when I
friendly<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:17.880> driving<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.539> dirt<00:04:18.720> bike<00:04:18.959> and

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
friendly is driving the dirt bike and

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.500 
friendly is driving the dirt bike and
jumps<00:04:19.560> off<00:04:19.709> as<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.340> can<00:04:20.459> see<00:04:20.639> catches<00:04:21.120> air<00:04:21.329> as

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
jumps off as you can see catches air as

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.540 
jumps off as you can see catches air as
well<00:04:21.719> but<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.109> doesn't<00:04:22.440> seem<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.650> kill<00:04:23.159> me<00:04:23.310> and

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
well but it doesn't seem to kill me and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.089 
well but it doesn't seem to kill me and
just<00:04:24.270> before<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.630> finish<00:04:25.020> a<00:04:25.080> video<00:04:25.409> one<00:04:25.770> feature

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
just before I finish a video one feature

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.060 
just before I finish a video one feature
I've<00:04:26.310> been<00:04:26.460> asking

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
I've been asking

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.850 
I've been asking
for<00:04:27.190> such<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:28.120> long<00:04:28.300> time<00:04:28.570> now<00:04:28.810> we<00:04:29.260> can<00:04:29.440> finally

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
for such a long time now we can finally

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.010 
for such a long time now we can finally
turn<00:04:30.250> off<00:04:30.490> automatic<00:04:31.150> parachute<00:04:31.690> deploy

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
turn off automatic parachute deploy

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.140 
turn off automatic parachute deploy
which<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.380> such<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.590> simple<00:04:33.070> tweak<00:04:33.550> but<00:04:34.030> it

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
which is such a simple tweak but it

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.090 
which is such a simple tweak but it
makes<00:04:34.330> such<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.720> huge<00:04:34.750> difference<00:04:35.170> if<00:04:35.770> we<00:04:35.830> go<00:04:36.040> to

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
makes such a huge difference if we go to

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.310 
makes such a huge difference if we go to
the<00:04:36.310> gameplay<00:04:36.580> options<00:04:37.180> then<00:04:37.720> advanced

the gameplay options then advanced

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.530 
the gameplay options then advanced

and just die or deploy your parachute

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.280 
and just die or deploy your parachute
just<00:04:52.030> before<00:04:52.360> you<00:04:52.450> hit<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.750> ground<00:04:52.900> that

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.140 
minimizes time spent in the air slowly
falling<00:04:56.500> down<00:04:56.680> which<00:04:56.980> greatly<00:04:57.310> exposes<00:04:58.030> you

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
falling down which greatly exposes you

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.880 
falling down which greatly exposes you
and<00:04:58.300> that's<00:04:58.450> always<00:04:58.780> really<00:04:58.890> frustrating

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
and that's always really frustrating

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.160 
and that's always really frustrating
when<00:04:59.950> that<00:05:00.100> happens<00:05:00.490> anyway<00:05:01.330> guys<00:05:01.540> that's<00:05:01.600> it

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
when that happens anyway guys that's it

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.660 
when that happens anyway guys that's it
for<00:05:02.320> today's<00:05:02.650> video<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:03.070> just<00:05:03.310> thought<00:05:03.460> I'll

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
for today's video I just thought I'll
