00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
at the beginning we try to make this

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.319 
at the beginning we try to make this
bike<00:00:27.950> more<00:00:28.810> beautiful<00:00:30.189> so<00:00:31.189> I<00:00:31.460> was<00:00:31.730> about<00:00:31.880> color

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
bike more beautiful so I was about color

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.460

yeah

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.819 
yeah
because<00:00:34.070> before<00:00:34.250> was<00:00:34.640> not<00:00:34.850> very<00:00:35.560> it<00:00:36.560> was<00:00:36.770> a

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
because before was not very it was a

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.750 
because before was not very it was a
little<00:00:37.040> bit<00:00:37.190> ugly<00:00:38.079> so<00:00:39.079> we<00:00:39.410> we<00:00:40.280> make<00:00:40.489> a<00:00:40.520> good

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
little bit ugly so we we make a good

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.350 
little bit ugly so we we make a good
designer<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:41.840> we<00:00:42.290> put<00:00:42.530> some<00:00:42.950> of<00:00:43.310> my<00:00:43.370> yellow<00:00:43.910> on

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
designer and we put some of my yellow on

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.310 
designer and we put some of my yellow on
the<00:00:45.079> on<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.410> blue<00:00:45.590> on<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.609> blue<00:00:46.730> design<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.449> I

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
the on the blue on the blue design and I

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.110 
the on the blue on the blue design and I
think<00:00:48.350> at<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.800> end<00:00:48.829> of<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.100> bike<00:00:49.280> was<00:00:49.519> was

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
think at the end of the bike was was

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.029 
think at the end of the bike was was
beautiful<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.460> we<00:00:52.460> work<00:00:52.640> very<00:00:53.649> much<00:00:54.649> on<00:00:54.920> the

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
beautiful and we work very much on the

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.069 
beautiful and we work very much on the
engine<00:00:55.340> at<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.789> beginning<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:58.809> mr.<00:00:59.809> furusawa

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
engine at the beginning and mr. furusawa

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.299 
engine at the beginning and mr. furusawa
prepared<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:01.010> me<00:01:01.390> three<00:01:02.390> different<00:01:02.839> engines

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
prepared to me three different engines

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.940 
prepared to me three different engines
for<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:05.000> side<00:01:05.740> for<00:01:06.740> 2004<00:01:07.550> season<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.950> we

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
for the side for 2004 season and we

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.070 
for the side for 2004 season and we
decided<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.460> further<00:01:10.700> for<00:01:11.060> this<00:01:11.210> one<00:01:11.450> that

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
decided the further for this one that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.550 
decided the further for this one that
have<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.890> little<00:01:13.220> bit<00:01:13.340> less<00:01:13.550> less<00:01:14.180> power<00:01:14.560> than

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
have a little bit less less power than

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.940 
have a little bit less less power than
the<00:01:15.740> previous<00:01:16.159> but<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.660> lot<00:01:18.110> more<00:01:19.270> soft<00:01:20.270> feeling

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
the previous but a lot more soft feeling

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.040 
the previous but a lot more soft feeling
smooth<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:23.540> easy<00:01:24.050> to<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.740> ride<00:01:25.210> so<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.600> the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
smooth and easy to to ride so the the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.080 
smooth and easy to to ride so the the
engine<00:01:27.320> delivery<00:01:28.600> was<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:30.020> lot<00:01:30.290> more<00:01:30.320> sweet

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
engine delivery was a lot more sweet

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.560 
engine delivery was a lot more sweet
compared<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.900> previous<00:01:33.710> engine<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.570> a

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
compared to the previous engine and a

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.770 
compared to the previous engine and a
step<00:01:35.840> by<00:01:36.020> step<00:01:36.290> Yamaha<00:01:36.880> try<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:37.940> improve<00:01:38.600> the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
step by step Yamaha try to improve the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.620 
step by step Yamaha try to improve the
power<00:01:39.070> that<00:01:40.070> was<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:40.970> main<00:01:41.120> the<00:01:41.420> main<00:01:41.450> issue

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
power that was the main the main issue

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.460 
power that was the main the main issue
in<00:01:44.630> all<00:01:45.080> is<00:01:45.440> history<00:01:46.010> usually<00:01:46.280> Yama<00:01:47.140> was<00:01:48.140> very

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
in all is history usually Yama was very

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.530 
in all is history usually Yama was very
is<00:01:48.680> very<00:01:48.830> good<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.400> make<00:01:49.850> sacis<00:01:50.660> so<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.170> bike<00:01:51.320> a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
is very good to make sacis so the bike a

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.480 
is very good to make sacis so the bike a
good<00:01:53.540> agility<00:01:53.990> good<00:01:54.980> turning<00:01:56.380> but<00:01:57.380> we<00:01:57.950> have<00:01:58.310> to

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
good agility good turning but we have to

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.280 
good agility good turning but we have to
to<00:01:58.850> work<00:01:59.030> a<00:01:59.150> little<00:01:59.240> bit<00:01:59.420> on<00:01:59.540> on<00:01:59.870> the<00:02:00.080> stability

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
to work a little bit on on the stability

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.670 
to work a little bit on on the stability
the<00:02:00.680> stability<00:02:00.910> braking<00:02:01.910> and<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:03.380> try<00:02:03.620> to

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
the stability braking and we try to

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.199 
the stability braking and we try to
improve<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.370> real<00:02:05.120> gripper<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.140> bike<00:02:06.290> and
