00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.370
 sometimes 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.430
 Hi, guys and girls, how are you? 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.840
 yours car extra since a new 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.939
 video and world congress we are in the 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.400
 tutorial on how to create our face for 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.140
 fix 14 that is to say we need to go into 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.619
 the en face application that is in the 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.140
 as port website is worth more or 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.430
 least the people who use ultimate ima 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.110
 through the web you will know more or less 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.510
 locate them if you can not leave the link 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.690
 the description and good first of all 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.559
 we need to be inside our 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.500
 account 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.000
 ea sports is worth to create the avatar and 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.949
 then once we are in this menu 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.690
 we have to go to help install these 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.640
 two plugins that one is for the vision of 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.510
 three from here as it is now like that in 3d 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.489
 and the other one is for him 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.440
 so to speak of the little program 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.940
 that opens up now to be able to create 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.949
 what's the load once downloaded 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.839
 all the plugins we can start 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.130
 create our character so nothing that 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.479
 we are going to do to be and with one that does not 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.670
 are some options that we can choose 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.140
 and man for the game and such and this is 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.399
 very important since if clan we are going to 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.009
 create a black or white character 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.990
 we must choose a mold not in this 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.729
 if it is black he will choose us this seems 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.009
 a no- brainer but there are many people who 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.420
 forget and in the end it is black body 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.490
 white no one can be something pretty 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.480
 curious so nothing once this is done 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.150
 we will just have to give 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.620
 generate photos we give here and we will leave 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.820
 this little square that is the one that I have 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.160
 said before why we need the 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.440
 plugin and well we see before tried a 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.810
 with lebron james a little how would it be 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.100
 from scratch it will give next or here 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.510
 It explains a bit how it has to be 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.310
 the face that has to come out front not 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.350
 can be neither asleep nor for the dyna 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.330
 nothing so that very easy success of 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.800
 understand and here we will get the options 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.390
 already to choose our photos first of 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.790
 everything tells us that the photos have to 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.600
 be in jpg png that size 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.600
 recommended is 1024 768 that the size 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.490
 maximum of 4096 x 4,096 and that size 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.430
 maximum of the file if they have has to 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.540
 be 10 megabytes down and one thing 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.050
 very important is that the photos do not 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.540
 can be of a lower resolution to 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.340
 480 x 480 has to be greater than that 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.130
 so, nothing, I 'm going to give him a brow 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.510
 if I'm going to choose a photo that in this 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.910
 case is the hard alfredo that already 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.200
 I taught yesterday by twitter and such and such 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.910
 more or less what to explain how we have 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.260
 what to do this is worth as you see here 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.790
 they mark more or less some guidelines that 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.800
 we have to continue then I'm going to 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.630
 rotate it a bit this is not recommended 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.160
 what do you do because it always goes wrong 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.090
 but I've done it a bit like that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.540
 with the hard zero 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.569
 for me 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.650
 as a special way so to speak 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.989
 we have to go when a little bit with the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.609
 district and I do not want to say it like that and here 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.599
 we would get these little dots that we have 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.670
 as you see we have to select 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.620
 more or less like the character then 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.859
 we have to put not here this for 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.430
 example if here the eye is worth the eyes 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:59.720
 and such here we are with the nose after 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.080
 the little mouth out there 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.260
 this here for the jaw and this here 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.269
 for the 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.860
 the chin so none of this would be 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.599
 more or less what we have to do already 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.250
 you know you have to choose a photo 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.560
 that's how this is not like the one 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.090
 chose me because this has been because 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.010
 this character is very difficult to find 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.450
 a photo that is this way in front but 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.700
 well we give to next here he asks us for a 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.140
 photo of the side or the side of 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.269
 our face in this case I do not have it 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.680
 so we give it to you not to start 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.500
 to analyze the photo is worth once this 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.970
 we give to generate and this depends on 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.440
 computer as you can see there may take 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.319
 up to 10 minutes in this case my 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.109
 computer will take about 20 seconds or so 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.180
 and this basically starts generating the 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.379
 photo and such once the photo is generated 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.299
 The only thing we have to do is wait for 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.040
 that is uploaded to the server and once it 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.870
 about followed we give to keep and already 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.250
 we can use in the game so 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.840
 nothing, let's wait for this to go 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.000
 completing as there is very little left 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.159
 come on, 67 percent is also 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.680
 I have a computer, it takes more or less two or 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.620
 three minutes but good 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.299
 it has a lot to do with the computer and 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.489
 this with the rise of your connection 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.799
 old is not a pretty minimal rise 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.469
 As you can see, it is uploading to the server 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.719
 the created image and from here we are going to 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:13.030
 can see how a bit more is 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:14.469
 nothing we are going to give to close and now we are going 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.090
 let's see how it is asking us if 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.919
 we want to apply we are going to 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.389
 apply as it will not let you see how it has 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.549
 stayed more or less our photo there what 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.900
 you see that it has remained so not in the 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.400
 photo was not of very good quality but 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.530
 later in the game more will not stay 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.240
 well and through here from this 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.229
 own menu we can go to change the hair 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.630
 in this case I'm going to change it 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.419
 from here it's worth that in this case I think 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.789
 that Alfredo Hard had this one that did not 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.530
 I remember more with white hair so 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.680
 let's also give the facial air 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.380
 we're going to put this one here in 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.620
 white we will not put it because it goes wrong 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.040
 so this nothing 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.040
 let's go back 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:55.100
 we put nothing 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.560
 but we have white this we have to hair 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.780
 hair color and we put it in white 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.449
 although it is not a very white target but 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.570
 good and once you have created all this just 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.889
 we have to give save will ask us to 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.930
 if we want to save the face we give to 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.479
 keep it and once it has been 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.770
 saved all this and all the settings 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.290
 all the configurations that we have 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.360
 done in our virtual tronista in 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.860
 our face in this case then only 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.060
 we have to go to the game and give 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.220
 download so nothing I will teach you 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.210
 in a little while once in the game like 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.320
 you have already created the 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.210
 character happens what I have in the 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.710
 career of lebron james that I did before and 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.900
 we just have that was not tab 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.060
 appearance download and apply well face 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.490
 it will be automatically downloaded and the 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.190
 we will have ready to use our 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.600
 alfredo hard steam in our game 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.150
 As you can see, it's quite similar 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.830
 pretty well with ice cream is the 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.979
 problem that if we are going to do 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.419
 we procure or seek to have a 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.970
 front photo and make a side 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.860
 so that it is the best possible but 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.720
 well you see that it looks pretty good 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.570
 we can all modify it too 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.810
 around here the color and such and nothing else like that 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.520
 what 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.310
 Pretty simple, it's pretty cool 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.800
 as you see you have to take into account the 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.180
 quality of the photo and that we are very 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.430
 straight to get the best 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.510
 possible details and nothing else I hope that 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.710
 you liked the tutorial that yes 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.060
 If you have any doubt, you can leave it in 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.940
 the comments and how good you can see how 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.490
 our friend is here the plug 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:20.000
 It's pretty cool so nothing I leave 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:23.390
 here some images of the mole in action and 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.900
 nothing more a greeting to all 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.900
 and good bye
