00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.830
 The newspaper of the globe begins today, increasing reality. 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.710
 you are a computer graphics technology that adds elements 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.969
 to the real world this is called augmented reality is in our 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.549
 column connect 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.549
 good virtual trip 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.030
 looks like ordinary cards 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.910
 but just approach one of them from the camera 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.930
 the whole industry said soltanieh said peter 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.560
 the bid angered the elite 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.220
 the players this Wednesday becomes 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.840
 and a three-dimensional character 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.230
 it appears on the screen but it's like it's on the desk 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.940
 And that's not all 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.520
 with the help of the keyboard 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.730
 it's possible to play pehis drag 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.190
 throw 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.190
 when rebating a chive 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.800
 if the incorporation in the accounts of a year 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.300
 we will offer more quiet height to the technology that made this 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.290
 possible system increased reality the principle to simple the camera that 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.040
 recognizes printed codes of cards 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.400
 each code trigger a program that creates the virtual characters the first 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.380
 we are the first to bring augmented reality to the following 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.130
 and put in the hands of people supported by the US 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.080
 French dominated prison 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.300
 shows us the book of the future 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.250
 he looks well without problem 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.250
 but when placed in front of the computer camera 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.930
 an 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.830
 the parents 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.670
 she likes to be a sketch that only gets complete in front of the camera one 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.810
 Accident is more a way to combine - something real than virtual to interact 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.960
 Pedro and his brother, and I left India, I decided to try 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.309
 was a race a paper a landscape draw 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.309
 in a few seconds everything is transformed 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.109
 here in the United States are beginning to appear the first 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.950
 car ads 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.950
 companies in augmented reality 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.539
 so you can see the internal space 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.329
 and even change the color 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.840
 enjoy the artist prints truth and augmented reality is still very new 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.219
 a mix of merchant 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.060
 many evolutions of the last years and months of Cassio and 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:59.479
 separatists who were not treated at Columbia University in New York 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.009
 that much of this story began 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.219
 and it is also here that her future is being written 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.819
 this will fail the pioneers and augmented reality research works on a new 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.059
 project 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.529
 Couple a webcam there are a pair of glasses 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.049
 this would eliminate the use of the computer 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.099
 everything a person sees in augmented reality will be projected onto the lens of the 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.769
 glasses 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.169
 recent one of them would leave the club I think in the future we may have others 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.609
 much more like the Communists is not what I got 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.139
 french sirkis games will show 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.079
 depends on the creativity of researchers 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.829
 an idea is to install a gps 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.669
 so that the driver poles and grabs the information we get today from the 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.319
 screen of one of these browsers that return here in the United States or there in Brazil 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.330
 the bm military brig of bento xvi that can happen in the near future 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.230
 but nobody solves anything of surprises like this in the world of business time to 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.300
 england augmented reality is a powerful weapon 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:06.760
 due 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.189
 the officers 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.709
 real estate launches 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.419
 I'm going to get real employs more closely see exactly anyone the 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.839
 voter who has pending has pool account in parking more than 

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:25.099
 selling buildings to gonzalo martínez augmented reality can revolutionize the 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:30.210
 way of projecting new ones and how one evolution leads to another 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.629
 to the head of state 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:36.879
 can be with the days told to Carol posted an image that will not speak there I 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.350
 I can not figure out how to major all these buildings that way with a keyboard 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.400
 the same interactive with an absence if I can do this with my hands do not 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.669
 I really need too bad was scored 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.900
 but for this 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.900
 speech 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.509
 augmented reality has left the laboratories reflected in the skin of 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.360
 patients 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.360
 W 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.189
 in the middle by chance 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:14.189
 he was trying to find a way to use the infrared 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.849
 to assist the visually impaired to see made a prototype pairs 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.410
 deal with this and during experiments 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.650
 accidentally 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.120
 he passed his hand through the beam of light and noticed that the veins were projected 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.210
 on the skin 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.860
 The next step was to talk to the doctors. 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.990
 to find out how this can be used 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.770
 initially doctors thought 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.990
 This is going to help us get blood collected. 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.350
 elderly patients obese patients than children where they are 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.759
 the more difficult it will be to see the laws of a Brazilian team 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.750
 adapt the equipment to a very common treatment 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.240
 the varicose veins 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.909
 the image is perfect 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.939
 the veins before invisible seems to be at the edge of the skin 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:58.669
 if someone is cleared 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.449
 just click on the link 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.869
 pure 100 min 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:05.989
 before many of these table surgery procedures 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.930
 needed to refer the patient to a surgical procedure that ended 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.979
 limiting their way of life 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.249
 the diagnosis begins with a series of novelties for the infrared rays 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:24.779
 they cross it find the veins have a special camera records a 

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:25.879
 reflection 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.490
 the information goes to a computer in the base of the equipment 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.460
 in fraction of seconds he created an animation to reproduce exactly the 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.349
 position of the times the design in this new image on the skin 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.849
 showing an image 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:50.860
 the treatment hurts in my pocket 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.250
 but the body felt nothing and this is good in the opinion of Angela who escaped 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.210
 of a painful operation thanks to augmented reality 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.710
 she also has an idea of ​​what that is but she already speaks well of technology 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:05.509
 for me 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:07.069
 enough said 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.680
 I came the mayor handed over to 34 billion 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.110
 I find it excellent 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.759
 it was a crime of passion 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:17.759
 as 

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:22.719
 now 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:29.249
 and you yourself can now experience this news the newspaper published the globe 

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:32.219
 today some newspapers of the country an advertisement with 

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:36.979
 marker for augmented reality this marker is also on our page 

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:40.659
 on the internet if you think if you prefer pimp
