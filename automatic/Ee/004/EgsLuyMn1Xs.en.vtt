00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
and restarting I mean if you're at one

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.890 
and restarting I mean if you're at one
year<00:03:12.580> you're<00:03:12.760> kinda<00:03:13.060> on<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.270> borderline<00:03:13.720> I'd

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
year you're kinda on the borderline I'd

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.210 
year you're kinda on the borderline I'd
say<00:03:14.050> if<00:03:14.170> your<00:03:14.290> dreadlocks<00:03:14.620> are<00:03:14.740> less<00:03:14.920> than<00:03:15.100> one

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
say if your dreadlocks are less than one

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.280 
say if your dreadlocks are less than one
year<00:03:15.430> then<00:03:15.910> it's<00:03:16.150> probably<00:03:16.540> better<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.900> brush

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
year then it's probably better to brush

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.350 
year then it's probably better to brush
it<00:03:17.470> out<00:03:17.590> resection<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.700> then<00:03:18.970> you'd<00:03:19.120> still

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
it out resection and then you'd still

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.240 
it out resection and then you'd still

then you can air dry them for people

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.080 
then you can air dry them for people
that<00:05:11.350> are<00:05:11.530> not<00:05:11.800> in<00:05:11.950> a<00:05:12.010> situation<00:05:12.250> where<00:05:12.940> you

the Sun or you don't have the Sun and
you<00:05:17.290> just<00:05:17.440> need<00:05:17.590> to<00:05:17.680> get<00:05:17.770> your<00:05:17.890> dreadlocks<00:05:18.190> dry

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
you just need to get your dreadlocks dry

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.550 
you just need to get your dreadlocks dry
and<00:05:18.880> just<00:05:18.910> get<00:05:19.120> on<00:05:19.210> with<00:05:19.360> your<00:05:19.480> day<00:05:19.660> then<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:20.290> lot

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
and just get on with your day then a lot

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.660 
and just get on with your day then a lot
of<00:05:20.590> people<00:05:20.890> in<00:05:20.980> a<00:05:21.010> situation<00:05:21.490> where

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
of people in a situation where

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.700 
of people in a situation where
blow-drying<00:05:22.480> is<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.750> only<00:05:22.930> option<00:05:23.200> because

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
blow-drying is the only option because

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.930 
blow-drying is the only option because
it's<00:05:23.890> not<00:05:24.010> really<00:05:24.220> a<00:05:24.250> whole<00:05:24.400> lot<00:05:24.430> you<00:05:24.670> can<00:05:24.820> do

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
it's not really a whole lot you can do

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.280 
it's not really a whole lot you can do
with<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.150> dreadlocks<00:05:25.480> until<00:05:25.780> they<00:05:25.900> are<00:05:26.050> dry

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
with the dreadlocks until they are dry

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.200 
with the dreadlocks until they are dry
because<00:05:26.560> it's<00:05:26.770> like<00:05:26.920> they're<00:05:27.550> damp<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:27.970> need

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
because it's like they're damp you need

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.610 
because it's like they're damp you need
to<00:05:28.270> get<00:05:28.390> them<00:05:28.510> dry<00:05:28.690> so<00:05:28.870> they<00:05:28.990> don't<00:05:29.140> become

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
to get them dry so they don't become

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.920 
to get them dry so they don't become
like<00:05:29.650> moldy<00:05:30.370> and<00:05:30.550> nasty<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.660> can't

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
like moldy and nasty and you can't

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.360 
like moldy and nasty and you can't
really<00:05:32.080> tie<00:05:32.350> them<00:05:32.560> up<00:05:32.650> because<00:05:33.130> then<00:05:33.250> they'll

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
really tie them up because then they'll

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.490 
really tie them up because then they'll
stay<00:05:33.610> down<00:05:33.820> for<00:05:34.030> longer<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:34.900> it's<00:05:35.200> just<00:05:35.320> sort

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
stay down for longer so it's just sort

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500 
stay down for longer so it's just sort
