00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
moonwalk that you're going to learn and

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.400 
moonwalk that you're going to learn and
make<00:00:11.670> your<00:00:11.820> charcoal<00:00:12.179> starting<00:00:12.809> with<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.170> toe

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
make your charcoal starting with the toe

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.210 
make your charcoal starting with the toe
here<00:00:14.070> I'm<00:00:14.580> gonna<00:00:14.670> start<00:00:14.940> up<00:00:15.680> things<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.980> up

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
here I'm gonna start up things so up

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.090 
here I'm gonna start up things so up
you're<00:00:17.850> gonna<00:00:18.000> push<00:00:18.720> off<00:00:19.199> kind<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:19.980> like

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
you're gonna push off kind of like

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.460 
you're gonna push off kind of like
gravity<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.330> best<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.750> kind<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.170> start

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
gravity it's best to kind of like start

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.820 
gravity it's best to kind of like start
off<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:23.010> place<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:24.180> really<00:00:24.420> get<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.439> moonwalk

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
off in place to really get the moonwalk

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.880 
off in place to really get the moonwalk
going<00:00:26.310> because<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.849> get<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.300> part<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.890> that

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
going because you get this part on that

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.589 
going because you get this part on that
so<00:00:29.279> basically<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.000> you're<00:00:30.240> doing

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
so basically this is what you're doing

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.049 
so basically this is what you're doing
when<00:00:31.380> you're<00:00:31.470> moonwalking<00:00:31.790> so<00:00:32.790> you're<00:00:32.940> going

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
when you're moonwalking so you're going

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.510 
when you're moonwalking so you're going
to<00:00:33.120> start<00:00:33.510> here<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> push<00:00:34.410> off<00:00:34.680> push

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
to start here you want to push off push

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.229 
to start here you want to push off push

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
from here another way to start learning

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.689 
from here another way to start learning
it<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.969> at<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> grocery<00:01:00.449> store<00:01:01.039> it's<00:01:02.039> very<00:01:02.219> slick

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
it is at a grocery store it's very slick

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.130 
it is at a grocery store it's very slick
it's<00:01:03.059> kind<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.329> close<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.719> my<00:01:03.840> view<00:01:03.989> Jackson

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
it's kind of close to my view Jackson

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.050 
it's kind of close to my view Jackson
stage<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.070> my<00:01:05.220> rejected<00:01:05.610> stage<00:01:05.790> but

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
stage it's not my rejected stage but

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.510 
stage it's not my rejected stage but
it's<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> closest<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.650> being<00:01:07.860> as<00:01:08.159> smooth

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it's the closest to it being as smooth

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.190 
it's the closest to it being as smooth
so<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.030> start<00:01:09.240> there<00:01:09.540> also<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.930> could

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
so you can start there also you could

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.770 
so you can start there also you could
rehearse<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.430> socks<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.600> at

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
rehearse with your socks you know at

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.960 
rehearse with your socks you know at
home<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> kitchen<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
home in the kitchen or just not on a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.429 
home in the kitchen or just not on a
road<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.540> not<00:01:15.689> good<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> road

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
road it's not good to do it on the road

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.820 
road it's not good to do it on the road
but<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.700> start<00:01:18.210> off<00:01:18.360> by<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.439> ball<00:01:19.680> of

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
but really just start off by the ball of

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560 
but really just start off by the ball of
your<00:01:19.890> foot<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.189> really<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.790> kind<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.450> like

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
your foot and really just kind of like

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.469 
your foot and really just kind of like
pushing<00:01:22.049> off<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.270> way

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
pushing off like that but the right way

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.240 
pushing off like that but the right way
to<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.110> always<00:01:25.409> start<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.040> top

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
to do it is to always start from the top

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.460 
to do it is to always start from the top
to<00:01:26.460> really<00:01:26.759> get<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> slickness<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
to really get that slickness in that

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
to really get that slickness in that
gliding<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.220> we're<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.579> try<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> I'm

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
gliding so we're going to try it I'm

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.499 
gliding so we're going to try it I'm
going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> push<00:01:30.840> off<00:01:31.159> slow<00:01:32.509> push<00:01:33.770> here<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:35.759> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
going to push off slow push here here so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.270 
going to push off slow push here here so
the<00:01:36.659> reason<00:01:36.810> why<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.200> focused<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.619> my<00:01:37.680> toe<00:01:38.009> so

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the reason why I'm focused on my toe so

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.130 
the reason why I'm focused on my toe so
much<00:01:38.570> because<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:41.659> drag<00:01:42.659> you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
