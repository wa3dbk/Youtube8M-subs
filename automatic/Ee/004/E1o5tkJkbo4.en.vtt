00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
which is recommended then you can do

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.890 
which is recommended then you can do
that<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.939> included<00:01:15.450> cleaning<00:01:15.750> cloth

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
that with this included cleaning cloth

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.570 
that with this included cleaning cloth
but<00:01:16.590> all<00:01:16.770> you're<00:01:16.890> gonna<00:01:16.979> get<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> packaging

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
but all you're gonna get the packaging

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.460 
but all you're gonna get the packaging
besides<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> skin<00:01:18.479> itself<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
besides that is the skin itself with the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.800 
besides that is the skin itself with the
xbox<00:01:19.830> 360<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.400> ps3<00:01:20.580> controllers<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> just

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
xbox 360 and ps3 controllers you just

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.359 
xbox 360 and ps3 controllers you just
get<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> front<00:01:22.409> plate<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:22.920> you're<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.159> gonna

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
get the front plate so you're just gonna

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.980 
get the front plate so you're just gonna
get<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.759> skin<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> go<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> very<00:01:24.600> front

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
get one skin to go on the very front

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.780 
get one skin to go on the very front
there's<00:01:25.560> no<00:01:25.740> need<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.100> really<00:01:26.460> put<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
there's no need to really put on the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.130 
there's no need to really put on the
back<00:01:26.939> or<00:01:27.090> anything<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
back or anything so I think that the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.929 
back or anything so I think that the
front<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.590> pretty<00:01:28.770> nice<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.490> said<00:01:29.700> it's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
front is pretty nice like I said it's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.999 
front is pretty nice like I said it's
listed<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.360> 995<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> website<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.860> it's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
listed for 995 on the website so it's

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.100 
listed for 995 on the website so it's
pretty<00:01:32.250> inexpensive<00:01:32.490> which<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.150> nice<00:01:33.329> just

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
pretty inexpensive which is nice just

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.300 
pretty inexpensive which is nice just
because<00:01:34.200> you're<00:01:34.380> only<00:01:34.470> gonna<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> front

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
because you're only gonna get the front

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
because you're only gonna get the front
part<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> actual<00:01:36.000> controller<00:01:36.659> alright<00:01:37.259> so

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
part of the actual controller alright so

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.170 
part of the actual controller alright so
let<00:01:37.560> me<00:01:37.619> go<00:01:37.740> ahead<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.979> apply<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.280> skin<00:01:38.880> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
let me go ahead and apply this skin to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.789 
let me go ahead and apply this skin to
the<00:01:39.210> actual<00:01:39.659> controller<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.500> I'll<00:01:40.590> show<00:01:40.770> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the actual controller and I'll show you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.200 
the actual controller and I'll show you
guys<00:01:40.920> what<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.340> looks<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.729> once<00:01:42.030> I'm

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
guys what it looks like once I'm

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.370 
guys what it looks like once I'm
finished<00:01:42.390> I'll<00:01:42.720> probably<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.110> speed<00:01:43.350> this

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
finished I'll probably just speed this

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.770 
finished I'll probably just speed this
up<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.979> you'll<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:44.790> see<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> time-lapse<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.630> me

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
up so you'll just see a time-lapse of me

00:01:45.780 --> 00:02:34.110 
up so you'll just see a time-lapse of me
applying<00:01:46.110> it

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.370 

all<00:02:35.120> right<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:35.480> as<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.690> can<00:02:35.780> see<00:02:35.840> right<00:02:36.110> here<00:02:36.140> I

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
all right so as you can see right here I

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.530 
all right so as you can see right here I
have<00:02:36.530> these<00:02:37.010> skin<00:02:37.280> fully<00:02:37.520> installed<00:02:38.210> on<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
have these skin fully installed on the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.580 
have these skin fully installed on the
controller<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:38.990> I'll<00:02:39.140> be<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.350> first<00:02:39.380> to

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
controller and I'll be the first to

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.720 
controller and I'll be the first to
admit<00:02:39.740> that<00:02:39.950> I'm<00:02:40.070> not<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.370> best<00:02:40.580> at

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
admit that I'm not the best at

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.760 
admit that I'm not the best at
installing<00:02:41.150> skins<00:02:41.660> on<00:02:41.930> iPhones<00:02:42.470> or

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
installing skins on iPhones or

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.900 
installing skins on iPhones or
controllers<00:02:43.160> or<00:02:43.250> anything<00:02:43.400> like<00:02:43.550> that<00:02:43.610> but<00:02:43.820> I

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
controllers or anything like that but I

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.400 
controllers or anything like that but I
think<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:44.150> turned<00:02:44.360> out<00:02:44.450> pretty<00:02:44.600> decent<00:02:44.900> um

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
think this turned out pretty decent um

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.470 
think this turned out pretty decent um
so<00:02:46.250> as<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.520> can<00:02:46.640> see<00:02:46.760> right<00:02:46.880> here<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:47.240> is<00:02:47.300> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
so as you can see right here this is the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.570 
so as you can see right here this is the
skin<00:02:47.900> installed<00:02:48.620> on<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.070> controller<00:02:49.520> right

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
skin installed on the controller right

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.610 
skin installed on the controller right
here<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.150> got<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.690> green<00:02:50.840> model<00:02:51.230> there's<00:02:51.560> a

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
here I got the green model there's a

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.870 
here I got the green model there's a
bunch<00:02:51.800> of<00:02:51.830> different<00:02:51.920> colors<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.400> like<00:02:52.730> the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
bunch of different colors I like the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.580 
bunch of different colors I like the
blue<00:02:53.060> one<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.300> looks<00:02:53.450> pretty<00:02:53.690> pretty<00:02:54.140> awesome

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
blue one it looks pretty pretty awesome

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.170 
blue one it looks pretty pretty awesome
but<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.220> green<00:02:55.370> one<00:02:55.490> looks<00:02:55.640> pretty<00:02:55.730> sick<00:02:56.060> as

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
but the green one looks pretty sick as

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.240 
but the green one looks pretty sick as
well<00:02:56.360> as<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:57.200> can<00:02:57.260> see<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:57.560> have<00:02:57.710> cutouts<00:02:58.040> for

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
well as you can see you have cutouts for

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.680 
well as you can see you have cutouts for
all<00:02:58.340> your<00:02:58.490> buttons<00:02:58.760> so<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:59.030> still<00:02:59.330> be<00:02:59.420> able<00:02:59.540> to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
all your buttons so you still be able to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.590 
all your buttons so you still be able to
use<00:02:59.780> your<00:03:00.590> start<00:03:01.010> your<00:03:01.250> select<00:03:01.700> your<00:03:02.150> extra

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
use your start your select your extra

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.110 
use your start your select your extra
why<00:03:02.810> your<00:03:03.050> a<00:03:03.260> all<00:03:03.770> those<00:03:04.250> as<00:03:04.520> well<00:03:04.790> as<00:03:04.940> your

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
why your a all those as well as your

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.920 
why your a all those as well as your
triggers<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:06.820> your<00:03:07.820> d-pad<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.330> your<00:03:08.720> thumb

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
triggers and your d-pad and your thumb

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.480 
triggers and your d-pad and your thumb
sticks<00:03:09.170> right<00:03:09.290> there<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.830> home<00:03:09.980> button<00:03:10.010> I

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
sticks right there and the home button I

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.340 
sticks right there and the home button I
think<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:11.000> looks<00:03:11.120> pretty<00:03:11.210> cool<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.690> like<00:03:12.080> the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
think it looks pretty cool I like the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.000 
think it looks pretty cool I like the
carbon<00:03:12.590> fiber

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
carbon fiber

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.640 
carbon fiber
kind<00:03:13.580> of<00:03:13.610> carbon<00:03:14.060> fiber<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.960> actually<00:03:15.350> adds<00:03:15.500> a

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
kind of carbon fiber it actually adds a

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.750 
kind of carbon fiber it actually adds a
little<00:03:15.800> bit<00:03:15.890> of<00:03:16.010> grip<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.430> controller

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
little bit of grip to the controller

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.950 
little bit of grip to the controller
when<00:03:16.970> you're<00:03:17.090> playing<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.630> could<00:03:17.810> like

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
when you're playing so you could like

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.300 
when you're playing so you could like
rest<00:03:18.200> your<00:03:18.380> hand<00:03:18.500> right<00:03:18.650> there<00:03:18.800> now<00:03:18.980> add<00:03:19.220> a

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
rest your hand right there now add a

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.980 
rest your hand right there now add a
little<00:03:19.550> bit<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:19.760> extra<00:03:20.120> grip<00:03:20.360> compared<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.900> the

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
little bit of extra grip compared to the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.510 
little bit of extra grip compared to the
actual<00:03:21.350> like<00:03:21.680> plastic<00:03:22.040> on<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.190> Xbox

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
actual like plastic on the Xbox

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.460 
actual like plastic on the Xbox
controller<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:23.510> that's<00:03:23.660> always<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.990> plus<00:03:24.080> right

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
controller so that's always a plus right

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.780 
controller so that's always a plus right
there<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.740> think<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.310> pretty<00:03:25.520> cool<00:03:25.730> idea

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
there I think this is a pretty cool idea

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.020 
there I think this is a pretty cool idea
for<00:03:26.980> 9.95<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.160> think<00:03:28.550> it's<00:03:28.640> pretty<00:03:28.820> inexpensive

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
for 9.95 I think it's pretty inexpensive

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.400 
for 9.95 I think it's pretty inexpensive
so<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.540> would<00:03:29.660> definitely<00:03:29.750> say<00:03:29.990> it's<00:03:30.080> worth

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
so I would definitely say it's worth

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.870 
so I would definitely say it's worth
your<00:03:30.590> money<00:03:30.800> if<00:03:30.980> it<00:03:31.100> was<00:03:31.190> more<00:03:31.340> expensive<00:03:31.550> I'd

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
your money if it was more expensive I'd

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.220 
your money if it was more expensive I'd
probably<00:03:32.090> say<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.420> wasn't<00:03:32.630> just<00:03:32.900> because<00:03:32.990> it's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
probably say it wasn't just because it's

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.650 
probably say it wasn't just because it's
the<00:03:33.290> front<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.680> controller<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.400> it's<00:03:35.360> you

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
the front of the controller and it's you

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.840 
the front of the controller and it's you
know<00:03:35.750> just<00:03:36.410> one<00:03:36.650> skin<00:03:37.100> but<00:03:37.310> I<00:03:37.340> think<00:03:37.580> that<00:03:37.700> for

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
know just one skin but I think that for

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.100 
know just one skin but I think that for
nine<00:03:37.970> ninety-five<00:03:38.240> this<00:03:38.570> is<00:03:38.690> probably<00:03:38.960> worth

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
nine ninety-five this is probably worth

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.680 
nine ninety-five this is probably worth
it<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.770> adds<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:40.010> little<00:03:40.250> bit<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.610> aesthetics<00:03:41.570> to

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
it it adds a little bit of aesthetics to

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.780 
it it adds a little bit of aesthetics to
your<00:03:41.780> controller<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.260> looks<00:03:42.440> pretty<00:03:42.650> cool<00:03:42.830> but

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
your controller it looks pretty cool but

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.400 
your controller it looks pretty cool but
yeah<00:03:44.360> that's<00:03:44.510> pretty<00:03:44.630> much<00:03:44.900> all<00:03:45.050> I<00:03:45.080> have<00:03:45.290> for

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
yeah that's pretty much all I have for

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.840 
yeah that's pretty much all I have for
you<00:03:45.470> guys<00:03:45.530> today<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:46.010> hope<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.340> did<00:03:46.520> enjoy<00:03:46.550> the
