00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 welcome hello my name is itzel 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.790
 welcome to my channel I will speak 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.980
 about some tricks that I personally 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.290
 I do to give a little more volume to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.170
 my hair all starts in the shower 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.870
 what I do first is that obviously 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.330
 then you have to use the shampoo and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.560
 conditioner that are for the volume 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.859
 I personally use what is soft 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.529
 volumizing shampoo that is for hair 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.929
 thin my hair is not very thin but 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.960
 Well, it's not as thick as I'd like 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.180
 that was so I use this soft 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.399
 obviously you are going to look for anything 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.239
 better for you but personally I use 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.520
 the soft and I also use the conditioner 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.629
 of pantene that is also to give 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.720
 volume in what is conditioner I 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.210
 I think that less is more 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.350
 if you put too many plants 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.910
 of conditioner your hair is also 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.130
 it feels like you're putting 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.140
 too much product in your hair and it 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.210
 can crush a little bit other than 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.250
 you can do is use toral baking 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.950
 vikings now I also accept grabs 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.350
 just a shot and you mix it with your 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.280
 shampoo and you put it on your hair more 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.650
 that nothing in what is this the root and 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.230
 this will help you to have a lot of volume 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.750
 After the bath I will give you the 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.640
 technique of how to dry it and how 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.290
 ironing to dry it is simply 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.960
 comb it completely in front and 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.479
 this is going to be that it gives a lot of volume to 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.020
 your hair because it is drying it from a 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.740
 way completely opposite to how it is 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.770
 normally your hair and like giving a 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.290
 little dead here, I'm just going to 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.940
 use a little bit of magic to put on a 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.700
 little makeup 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.060
 and the way you're going to iron 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.790
 is that you are going to use a horizontal shape 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.710
 more grab your iron and you're going to comb 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.680
 but where are you going to iron the hair 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.800
 completely out right and 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.810
 this makes it give a lot of volume to the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.790
 root 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.440
 obviously we are going to do it in all your 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.130
 hair 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.590
 if you use smaller parts better like that 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.890
 you have to give less passes and so 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.120
 do not burn both hair is 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.940
 always to raise in what is in the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.099
 Root tries to hit a crooked guy 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.970
 but not much because you do not think that you 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.970
 is as well as box 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.150
 I had not seen it until a bit 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.549
 right now I'm looking closer 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.650
 today this camera is very good it looks 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.650
 look up the burned hair 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.750
 but well that's how they're going to 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.700
 iron I hope you do not have the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.299
 hair that I have to give a 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.299
 disputed 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.319
 and after this if you are going to use some 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.269
 type of oil try to use it 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:16.290
 this year here is not like that 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:19.739
 ubs and dub yes I think it continues the world you 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.260
 you are going to put it in the root these you what 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.000
 You are in the double swing 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.310
 molar I found it to a dollar and 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.170
 notice that it serves me very well has to 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.900
 be low imagine mus 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.959
 you put it in the root and with a brush 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.780
 round fat you dry it you put the 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.290
 brush directly on the root so that 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.160
 I'll pick you up and with the dryer, I'll tell you 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.379
 dry and it does not stay hard if you think that 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.629
 will be hard hair have not 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.690
 you will be soft with much 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.640
 movement this and obviously well with 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.270
 a lot of volume that is what we are 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.910
 pulling 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.400
 try to turn the brush so that it goes 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.099
 circling this 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.409
 I say so that the air in the 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.599
 in the hair and that helps so 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.220
 obviously stay with the volume what 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.640
 you are going to do in the areas that you create 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.250
 you need more and now yes if you go to 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.109
 use some kind of oil try to 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.509
 use it only at the tips because if 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.710
 you are in the root you can be crushed 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:26.930
 I use my extensions cost me super 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.759
 cheap and I got super good this 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.800
 it also helps that you gently 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:35.090
 finish more hair have more volume 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:39.260
 in the hair obviously not 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.180
 We want to look like a lion but good at 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.220
 finish you just do all your 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.220

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.900
 hairspray and the is 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.380
 finished these are multiple I have 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.770
