 tire for feast 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.620
 wheel marking we need 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.480
 tire stand 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.880
 recently received wide 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.980
 spread alloy wheels and 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.180
 low profile tires impose 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.089
 new equipment requirements 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.829
 tire repair station to repair them 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.769
 on semi-automatic stands it is impossible 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.789
 since the probability is extremely high 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.069
 damage to metal faces 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.150
 working elements as the most wheel 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.150
 disk and tires 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.290
 in this regard for rebasing cast 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.190
 rims and low profile 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.260
 tires 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.420
 most appropriate use 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.340
 automatic tire stands 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.770
 such stands have a variety of 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.270
 advantages over their 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.250
 semi-automatic first 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.590
 mounting stand automatic stand 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.120
 displayed in working position 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.650
 by means of a special drive that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.570
 allows her to borrow strictly 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.050
 perpendicular position relative to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.150
 wheel axles thereby remove all risks 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.949
 associated with not accurate enough 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.560
 installing the mounting head and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.450
 subsequent damage 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.729
 in contact with the surface of it in 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.290
 second automatic stands equipped with 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.530
 additional mechanical device 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.630
 the so-called 3 hand which gives 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.540
 the ability to implant as accurately as possible 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.119
 wheel on self centering faceplate 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.979
 desktop with four cam 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.930
 clamps using this device 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.570
 easier implementation of the most difficult 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.550
 operations requiring a stand operator 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.350
 extra effort 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.360
 associated with the service extremely 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.690
 hard side low profile tires 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.789
 to prevent damage cast 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.170
 wheel drive in automatic stands 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.940
 provided for using 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.100
 plastic nozzles on clamping 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.750
 cams in third in automatic 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.390
 tire stands mainly 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.490
 explosive tire inflation and her 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.319
 the essence of graduation they are constant as in 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.050
 semi-automatic tire changers 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.240
 air supply 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.450
 air allows better and faster 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.100
 pump up without chamber rubber in 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.440
 cam mechanisms are available 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.000
 special holes through which on 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.110
 wheel in the process of explosive pumping 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.270
 air is supplied 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.100
 this ensures the best and 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.970
 more reliable fit of the tire on 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.920
 wheel disk 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.870
 explosive pumping is provided 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.240
 by means of a receiver fixed to 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.430
 rear panel of the stand compressed air 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.819
 fed to the receiver after passing 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.120
 through 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.150
 Lubricator pressure gauges rigidly attached to 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.800
 stand now let's see how 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.080
 there is a tire fitting process with 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.090
 applying 3 hands on modern 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.490
 automatic tire changer 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.800
 completely blow air out of the tire 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.599
 remove balancing weights from the outside 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.879
 rim sides if any 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.380
 put the tire between the paddles device 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.020
 side separation and rubber 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.290
 focus insert the blade between the board 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.330
 tires and rim to tear off the board from 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.870
 wheel rim click on the drive 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.060
 pedal 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.070
 repeat the procedure for the reverse side 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.070
 tires to complete separation from the rim 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.280
 set the wheel on 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.280
 self centering faceplate 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.420
 sum 30 hand with centering cone 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.280
 and clearly fix the wheel on klochkova 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.230
 clamps while centering cone 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.480
 presses the center of the wheel and 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.310
 upset him down allowing 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.920
 cam clamp without any 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.220
 problems without damaging the tires or the wheel 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.220
 disk 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.020
 securely and firmly record the experience when 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.390
 using semi-automatic stands 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.550
 without 3 hands the machine operator would have to 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.410
 make an extremely big effort in 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.810
 in this case, all the work to do 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.320
 special device we remove 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.880
 centering cone set 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.060
 vertical rod to working position 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.170
 so that the mounting head is about 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.180
 wheel rim 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.890
 mounting roller should 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.510
 be two millimeters from the rim 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.209
 to avoid surface damage 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.340
 contact with a third hand 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.350
 squeeze the board and hook it on 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.230
 mounting head by mounting 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.360
 blades are recommended to be placed mounting 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.460
 head about 10 millimeters right 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.350
 from the air valve chamber if 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.000
 such is not to damage 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.500
 the camera 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.780
 set in motion self-centering 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.780
 faceplate to complete separation of the board 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.800
 dismantle the bottom board 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.870
 minutes 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.419
 after tire repair, proceed to 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.460
 wheel mounting 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.349
 fix the wheel on 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.149
 self-centering in the faceplate abundantly 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.159
 lubricates the sides of the tire special 

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:10.289
 tire posts in order to avoid 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:14.119
 rubber damage as well as for 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.119
 so that the tire clearly sits on the disk 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.399
 feed the mounting head and put on 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.399
 bottom tire experience 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.820
 3 hand pinch the tire bead and 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.800
 we make final installation on 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.570
 At this stage, the third hand allows us to 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.910
 during the whole operation save 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.730
 same bead angle 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.040
 regarding the mounting head as we can see 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.960
 it was the use of 3 hands that allowed 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.420
 us very quickly without any 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.180
 effort to unlock and install 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.980
 wheels for pumping wheels 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.600
 use explosive pumping technology 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.600
 monitor the pressure gauge
