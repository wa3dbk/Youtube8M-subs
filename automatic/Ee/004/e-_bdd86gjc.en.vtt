00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
to do is not do well it says on the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.709 
to do is not do well it says on the
bucket<00:00:32.009> page<00:00:32.189> because<00:00:32.610> when<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> tried<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.690> I

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
bucket page because when I tried that I

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.260 
bucket page because when I tried that I
got<00:00:33.960> an<00:00:34.020> error<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:35.280> did<00:00:35.520> exactly<00:00:35.940> what<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
got an error and I did exactly what it

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.900 
got an error and I did exactly what it
said<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.980> didn't<00:00:38.219> work<00:00:38.280> messing<00:00:38.879> with

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
said but that didn't work messing with

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.530 
said but that didn't work messing with
my<00:00:39.180> bucket<00:00:39.840> ymail<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.610> I<00:00:41.610> found<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> better

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
my bucket ymail and I found the better

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.440 
my bucket ymail and I found the better
easier<00:00:43.200> methods<00:00:43.620> which<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.280> using<00:00:44.850> multiverse

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
easier methods which is using multiverse

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.060 
easier methods which is using multiverse
so<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:45.960> mV<00:00:46.610> create<00:00:48.559> cool<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:49.739> something

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
so you do mV create cool it's something

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.209 
so you do mV create cool it's something
like<00:00:50.370> test<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:52.260> world's<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.800> normal

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
like test the world's gonna be normal

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.970 
like test the world's gonna be normal
and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:54.120> you're<00:00:54.449> gonna<00:00:54.539> want<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:54.989> -<00:00:55.260> G<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and then you're gonna want to do - G and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.130 
and then you're gonna want to do - G and
paste<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.030> generator<00:00:57.449> which<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.750> guys

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
paste in the generator which is guys

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.990 
paste in the generator which is guys
stone<00:00:58.440> Jen<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.949> then<00:00:59.520> you're<00:00:59.640> gonna<00:00:59.730> want<00:00:59.969> to

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
stone Jen and then you're gonna want to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.720 
stone Jen and then you're gonna want to
hit<00:01:00.270> enter<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.930> I've<00:01:01.890> already<00:01:02.039> done<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.489> but

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
hit enter so I've already done that but

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.429 
hit enter so I've already done that but
you<00:01:03.480> will<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:04.220> two<00:01:05.220> messages<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.540> console

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
you will get two messages in the console

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.280 
you will get two messages in the console
telling<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.070> how<00:01:08.540> much<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> world<00:01:10.110> has

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
telling you how much of the world has

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.780 
telling you how much of the world has
been<00:01:10.439> generated<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.189> when<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> gets<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
been generated and when it gets for a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.840 
been generated and when it gets for a
hundred<00:01:12.060> percent<00:01:12.140> um<00:01:13.140> VTP<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> world

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
hundred percent um VTP and in the world

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.200 
hundred percent um VTP and in the world
so<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> world<00:01:17.460> actually<00:01:17.640> looks

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
so this is what the world actually looks

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.600 
so this is what the world actually looks
like<00:01:18.560> as<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.860> did<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> earlier<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.830> might<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
like as I did it earlier so might get a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.820 
like as I did it earlier so might get a
bit<00:01:23.850> lag<00:01:24.090> while<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.479> loading<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.229> let<00:01:25.740> me

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
bit lag while it's loading so let me

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.469 
bit lag while it's loading so let me
just<00:01:26.040> go<00:01:26.250> down<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> bit<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.850> looks<00:01:27.060> really

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
just go down a bit it looks really

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.390 
just go down a bit it looks really
really<00:01:27.509> cool<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.020> there's<00:01:28.200> cave<00:01:28.500> systems<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
really cool so there's cave systems and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.960 
really cool so there's cave systems and
here<00:01:29.579> there<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.909> lava<00:01:31.070> there's<00:01:32.070> water<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
here there is lava there's water and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.840 
here there is lava there's water and
some<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.960> them<00:01:34.079> connect<00:01:34.500> some<00:01:34.740> floating<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
some of them connect some floating and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.319 
some of them connect some floating and
there's<00:01:36.600> mushrooms<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.409> trees<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.130> ores<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
there's mushrooms and trees and ores so

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.789 
there's mushrooms and trees and ores so
you<00:01:39.390> could<00:01:39.780> definitely<00:01:39.930> survive<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.680> it

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
you could definitely survive in it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.039 
you could definitely survive in it
that's<00:01:41.009> everything<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.610> need<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.570> really

so yeah there is caves and there's mobs
lots<00:01:50.850> lots<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.930> mobs<00:01:52.200> let's<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.130> go<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
lots lots of mobs let's just go for and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.620 
lots lots of mobs let's just go for and
just<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> look-see<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> there<00:01:57.509> is

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.459 
just have a look-see so there is
different<00:01:57.960> biomes<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.560> them<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.869> there<00:02:00.869> I

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
different biomes on them so there I

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.410 
different biomes on them so there I
don't<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.340> biomes<00:02:02.700> off<00:02:02.909> by<00:02:03.090> heart<00:02:03.299> but

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
don't know the biomes off by heart but

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.700 
don't know the biomes off by heart but
there's<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> dark<00:02:04.530> spruce<00:02:05.250> biome

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
there's the dark spruce biome

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.169 
there's the dark spruce biome
there's<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:08.190> oak<00:02:08.849> biome

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
there's the oak biome

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.500 
there's the oak biome
and<00:02:11.670> that's<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.819> new<00:02:13.260> dark<00:02:14.260> oak<00:02:14.500> isn't<00:02:14.890> it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and that's the new dark oak isn't it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.630 
and that's the new dark oak isn't it
biome<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.659> this<00:02:16.900> does<00:02:17.469> it<00:02:17.620> say<00:02:17.829> roofed<00:02:18.489> forest
