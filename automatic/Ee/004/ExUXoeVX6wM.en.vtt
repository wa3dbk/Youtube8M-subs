00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.830
 Hello there a 123 and want to continue to be carried out stupid dog recommend it is this time 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.020
 I think 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:15.760
 Before here , there was this among the things I bought at Soundhouse Yes this is 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.770
 ken smith You are a cross for guitar rather than saying smith a cross 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.120
 The maker named ken smith 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.870
 We were also introduced me this Ne' 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.830
 Formula Poly I'm calling it Pori only , I'm calling it a sharp fall 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:32.570
 But I think that it is the best policy because it can get rid of dirt very much 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:37.070
 I think that it is a Smith Polish Cross that you should use in conjunction with this 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.880
 I guess I guess it 's a combination of the two . 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.110
 Is it 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.010
 I will try to use it from now, but cigarette 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.199
 Because it is the end turn, I think that it is good to use it according to the use 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.199
 I love you-not yet- 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.930
 There is no feeling that Do with so much doing something based Tot also try Tsuke moving at about 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.219
 is not it 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:03.539
 It 's a pair after I finished playing, but it may be a bit hard to see 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.979
 In this way you not have Toka or with a fingerprint there, not in the pick guard in this way 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.340
 Well, the fingerprints are betting, and this is the case with this cross. 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.380
 Let it I such that blowing 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.920
 Well roughly No. 1 in I, for example, something like a feeling strong Do is to put the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.920
 And unfair 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.580
 You can get rid of rice dirt properly 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.580
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 Hmm 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.270
 me 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.290
 5 wiped is but we look for that after I have it also to clean it Toka here 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.290
 Since also attached 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.380
 me 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.380
 is not it 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:52.020
 Yes, it looks great was snugly properly Pa Te mu 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.020
 Well here is also great 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.870
 Yes, very beautiful leakage In this way, in Massara 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.870
 After all I can take it a 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:07.250
 Though I think that the power of Omiya polish itself is also great 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.670
 Even after using that violet policy cross, it will take dirt cleanly after all 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.740
 If you say something or something 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.740
 I have an impression that I can 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.000
 I can see say Datte dirt and column even firmly though you might was also ugly part 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.620
 I think I might have given you 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.270
 Even a little multi-put about three or four times I was pushed around a little while ago Well 3 times 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:37.090
 About too conspicuous treasure 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:41.980
 Say also made it okay not to say Kana number of times push so much and about 2 times 1 times 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:47.620
 It's a costume, it's sure that it will spread out something like that you want to go with policy 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:51.580
 It feels like I got it and I feel it got it on the guitar a body 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:57.080
 Not only because there is also the perfection that other parts seem to be improved 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:01.790
 One, for example, one to buy several sheets is whether the use of the guitar Tomo is lightly taking the game 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.620
 The impression that say Toka Do not know you and do the best that the Tteyuu distinguish it in like that 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.330
 It means that there is 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.560
 We introduced this Smith Polish Cross this time, but everyone through this video 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:16.420
 I think it would be appreciated if you could check out 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.420
 Let me prepare for that 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.890
 me 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.610
 Hmm 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.610
 me 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.050
 me 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.220
 dee
