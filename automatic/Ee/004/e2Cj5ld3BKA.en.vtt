love together that's kind of the color

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.700 
love together that's kind of the color
you'd<00:04:00.010> get<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.670> put<00:04:00.820> that<00:04:01.000> on<00:04:01.120> first<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:04.710> that

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
you'd get and put that on first and that

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.810 
you'd get and put that on first and that
gives<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:06.040> really<00:04:06.190> nice<00:04:06.370> sort<00:04:06.580> of<00:04:06.610> neutral
