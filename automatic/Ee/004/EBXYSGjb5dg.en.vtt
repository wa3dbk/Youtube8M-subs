00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.430
 good morning today I'll show you how 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.780
 be able to build a full hd antenna for 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.570
 be able to watch digital television open 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.540
 and you can install it on the roof of your 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.759
 house to start by opening the box these 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.000
 are the elements that brings we have the 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.000
 wings 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.930
 the main pipe the secondary pipe the 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.390
 wings and the container box well that all 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.950
 explain how to start putting together the per 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.840
 start let's grab the pipe 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.640
 main which is the one that comes with this 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.900
 capital where you are going to put the mast 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.700
 once it is finished 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.070
 next to this capital to know that 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.470
 has a screw that is already coming 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.140
 inside the spout with his responds butterfly 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.670
 well here we are going to put these wings 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.860
 I'm going to put both and I'm going to 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.470
 show how it is once we take out 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.260
 the screw we grabbed one of the wings and 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.700
 we are going to put it to coincide 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.160
 this hole and the next hole 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.540
 as you will see the first installation of the 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.540
 first of the rooms would be like this 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.479
 how will you see the a 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.250
 one big butt and then the other 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.869
 side has a hole well this we're going 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.869
 to match together with this one 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.030
 already the wings are put in the hole 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.909
 corresponding that we did 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.030
 as you will see 6 match everything so that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.030
 now the screw that we take out easy 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.450
 well once we've passed the butterfly 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.179
 and we passed the screw remember that 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.310
 it's always better to do things than strength to 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.270
 do this sort of thing must be 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.350
 lots of patience 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.689
 let's put the butterfly in its place 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.840
 corresponding once we already put 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.850
 the butterfly we are going to install the box 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.799
 Container in the container box 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.980
 we're going to see that we have a 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.950
 butterfly that is already in the pipe 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.110
 forgive a screw which has no 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.159
 butterfly this is because we're going to 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.159
 install in this way 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.550
 let's grab the box and if we give it 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.820
 back let's see what it has a 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.820
 bellows 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.140
 that has a bellows at this height with a 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.240
 stick on this side and nothing of this other 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.370
 well then what we are going to do is what 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.370
 next let's grab the antenna 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.269
 and let's match 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.269
 the connective hole 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.180
 with this screw and the little hole 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.960
 little one that many of us are just going to 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.220
 match for 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.200
 well as you will see we put the box 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.640
 on the cloth and now what are we going to 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.910
 to do is to pass the cable through this hole 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.110
 what's here if the next rg6 cable 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.240
 here you are going to adjust the cable 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.470
 and you go to previously previously previously 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.280
 to the cable and you're going to have to have 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.870
 peeling truth has to be the mesh 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.390
 free copper here in this screw you 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.240
 is to adjust it and you're going to put the mesh 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.280
 copper in there you're going to re-adjust 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.280
 the cable and then you're going to close 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.260
 stable that you have to go directly to 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.700
 what is the converter and you can be 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.700
 enjoying the open television 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.250
 well as you will see the butterfly is 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:55.330
 composed of a plastic containing 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.330
 four irons and 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.170
 then a screw with its 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.510
 corresponding butterfly 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.200
 and the plastic is shaped so that 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.170
 hooked right here'll put one of 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.640
 While this fire also putting you 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.640
 it would be this way 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.540
 so you have to do is put the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.540
 remaining in this place 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.699
 one that finished that 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.830
 to tip of sheet 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.320
 You pass the mast pipe here 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.810
 notice that you have the bellows of the year 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.600
 be fair 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.320
 put a mast that is very hard that 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.520
 support the winds well and install it to 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.050
 a high place in your house or building 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.389
 ready that's it, you can start 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.530
 connect the cable to your converter and 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.650
 start watching digital television 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.650
 open more plural free and for all
