00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
motivated it's one of those things where

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.450 
motivated it's one of those things where
you<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.479> dedicated<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.829> task<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
you have to be dedicated to the task and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.219 
you have to be dedicated to the task and
the<00:01:44.520> task<00:01:44.700> may<00:01:44.939> be<00:01:45.000> anything<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.750> example<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the task may be anything for example and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.770 
the task may be anything for example and
this<00:01:46.320> applies<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.829> real<00:01:46.860> life<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.369> well<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
this applies to real life as well so you

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.120

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
the high schools obviously I'll have to

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.290 
the high schools obviously I'll have to
get<00:03:07.860> divination<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.490> a<00:03:08.520> higher<00:03:08.730> level<00:03:08.760> because

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
get divination to a higher level because

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.630 
get divination to a higher level because
I'm<00:03:09.420> really<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.530> low<00:03:10.650> at<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.860> moment<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.280> do

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
I'm really really low at the moment I do

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.940 
I'm really really low at the moment I do
believe<00:03:11.940> my<00:03:12.090> total<00:03:12.420> experience<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.950> 661

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
believe my total experience is 661

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.180 
believe my total experience is 661
million<00:03:14.880> experience<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.920> that's<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:17.010> decent

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
million experience and that's a decent

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.380 
million experience and that's a decent
amount<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:17.730> it's<00:03:17.850> something<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.210> hasn't

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
amount but it's something that hasn't

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.620 
amount but it's something that hasn't
improved<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.110> very<00:03:19.350> very<00:03:19.410> long<00:03:19.650> time<00:03:20.630> and

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
improved for a very very long time and

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.290 
improved for a very very long time and
the<00:03:22.110> reason<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.470> thumbnail<00:03:22.770> is<00:03:22.920> the

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
the reason the thumbnail is the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.280 
the reason the thumbnail is the
dependence<00:03:24.300> is<00:03:24.450> because<00:03:24.750> I've<00:03:24.900> got<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.080> lot<00:03:25.260> of

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
dependence is because I've got a lot of

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.690 
dependence is because I've got a lot of
them<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.590> use<00:03:25.800> I<00:03:25.830> have<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.370> much<00:03:26.520> experience
