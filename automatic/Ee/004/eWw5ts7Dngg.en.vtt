either<00:04:22.590> across<00:04:22.889> the<00:04:23.010> screen<00:04:23.250> now<00:04:23.430> or

either across the screen now or
somewhere<00:04:24.539> below<00:04:25.729> but<00:04:26.729> what<00:04:27.389> I<00:04:27.419> found<00:04:27.690> was

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
somewhere below but what I found was

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.890 
somewhere below but what I found was
that<00:04:28.760> we<00:04:29.760> were<00:04:29.910> originally<00:04:30.120> going<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.599> come

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
that we were originally going to come

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.100 
that we were originally going to come
with<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:32.449> converse<00:04:33.449> of<00:04:33.479> that<00:04:33.720> came<00:04:33.930> with<00:04:34.080> a

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
with the converse of that came with a

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.890 
with the converse of that came with a
HDMI<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.889> DVI<00:04:35.180> we<00:04:36.180> were<00:04:36.360> going<00:04:36.599> to<00:04:36.750> then

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
HDMI to DVI we were going to then

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.080 
HDMI to DVI we were going to then
convert<00:04:37.110> DVI<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.620> VGA<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.460> connected<00:04:38.970> that

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
convert DVI to VGA and connected that

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.810 
convert DVI to VGA and connected that
way<00:04:39.270> but<00:04:39.840> unfortunately<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.620> found<00:04:40.949> that<00:04:41.190> a<00:04:41.460> few

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
way but unfortunately I found that a few

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.189 
way but unfortunately I found that a few
complications<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.630> bit<00:04:43.610> advanced<00:04:45.199> basically

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
complications a bit advanced basically

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.350 
complications a bit advanced basically
Apple<00:04:46.770> didn't<00:04:47.010> really<00:04:47.340> specify<00:04:47.550> which<00:04:48.000> DVI

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
Apple didn't really specify which DVI

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.300 
Apple didn't really specify which DVI
came<00:04:48.990> with<00:04:49.199> it<00:04:49.320> but<00:04:49.530> what<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:49.830> actually<00:04:49.979> was<00:04:50.160> a

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
came with it but what it actually was a

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.040 
came with it but what it actually was a
Stevie<00:04:50.699> I<00:04:50.729> digital<00:04:51.240> which<00:04:51.449> makes<00:04:51.690> sense

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
Stevie I digital which makes sense

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.189 
Stevie I digital which makes sense
this<00:04:52.800> tool<00:04:53.039> I<00:04:53.280> hate

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
this tool I hate

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.260 
this tool I hate
so<00:04:54.409> digital<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:55.520> you<00:04:55.580> won't<00:04:55.909> be<00:04:55.969> able<00:04:56.029> to

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
so digital so you won't be able to

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.920 
so digital so you won't be able to
convert<00:04:56.599> it<00:04:56.749> to<00:04:56.779> analog<00:04:57.199> which<00:04:57.909> AJ<00:04:58.909> is<00:04:59.120> so

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
convert it to analog which AJ is so

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.619 
convert it to analog which AJ is so
instead<00:05:00.139> I<00:05:00.199> had<00:05:00.469> to<00:05:00.499> wait<00:05:00.680> about<00:05:00.919> a<00:05:01.099> week

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
instead I had to wait about a week

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.939 
instead I had to wait about a week
before<00:05:02.629> I<00:05:02.659> could<00:05:02.960> use<00:05:03.080> my<00:05:03.259> Mac<00:05:03.469> mainly<00:05:03.800> because

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
before I could use my Mac mainly because

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.409 
before I could use my Mac mainly because
I<00:05:04.340> then<00:05:04.580> have<00:05:04.729> to<00:05:04.759> order<00:05:05.029> the<00:05:05.270> mini

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
I then have to order the mini

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.100 
I then have to order the mini
DisplayPort<00:05:05.599> to<00:05:06.319> VGA<00:05:07.189> adapter<00:05:07.539> so<00:05:08.539> it<00:05:08.900> was<00:05:09.080> a

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
DisplayPort to VGA adapter so it was a

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.119 
DisplayPort to VGA adapter so it was a
bit<00:05:09.259> of<00:05:09.319> a<00:05:09.349> downfall<00:05:09.529> but<00:05:10.039> just<00:05:10.759> remember<00:05:11.210> to

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 
bit of a downfall but just remember to

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:15.850 
bit of a downfall but just remember to
do<00:05:13.129> your<00:05:13.249> homework<00:05:13.460> on<00:05:13.819> those<00:05:14.620> those<00:05:15.620> went<00:05:15.800> to

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
do your homework on those those went to

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.589 
do your homework on those those went to
