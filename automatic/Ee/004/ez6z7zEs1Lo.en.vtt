are a beginner you can stick with

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.840 
are a beginner you can stick with
dumbbells<00:00:09.559> and<00:00:09.799> only<00:00:10.129> later<00:00:10.280> when<00:00:10.639> you<00:00:10.760> are

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
dumbbells and only later when you are

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.449 
dumbbells and only later when you are
more<00:00:11.180> advanced<00:00:11.750> you<00:00:11.900> should<00:00:12.440> go<00:00:12.709> for<00:00:13.160> a

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:13.459 
more advanced you should go for a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.109 
more advanced you should go for a
barbell<00:00:13.969> now<00:00:14.869> for<00:00:15.230> the<00:00:15.410> longer<00:00:16.160> there<00:00:17.029> are

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
barbell now for the longer there are

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.820 
barbell now for the longer there are
three<00:00:17.300> major<00:00:17.480> differences<00:00:18.170> between<00:00:18.230> a

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
three major differences between a

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.310 
three major differences between a
dumbbell<00:00:19.340> and<00:00:19.520> a<00:00:19.789> barbell<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:20.600> first<00:00:20.870> is<00:00:21.110> that

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
dumbbell and a barbell the first is that

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.070 
dumbbell and a barbell the first is that
a<00:00:21.500> barbell<00:00:22.010> can<00:00:22.250> handle<00:00:22.700> way<00:00:23.120> more<00:00:23.570> weight

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
a barbell can handle way more weight

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
a barbell can handle way more weight
than<00:00:24.860> a<00:00:25.070> dumbbell<00:00:26.000> your<00:00:26.600> usual<00:00:27.470> dumbbell

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
than a dumbbell your usual dumbbell

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.319 
than a dumbbell your usual dumbbell
maxes<00:00:28.820> out<00:00:29.000> at<00:00:29.060> around<00:00:29.890> 130<00:00:30.890> pounds<00:00:31.340> or<00:00:31.460> 60

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
maxes out at around 130 pounds or 60

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.459 
maxes out at around 130 pounds or 60
kilograms<00:00:32.629> and<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.710> barbell<00:00:34.219> can<00:00:34.820> take<00:00:35.469> 350

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
kilograms and the barbell can take 350

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.990 
kilograms and the barbell can take 350
pounds<00:00:36.950> 160<00:00:37.790> kilograms<00:00:38.000> or<00:00:38.600> even<00:00:39.350> more<00:00:40.000> number

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
pounds 160 kilograms or even more number

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.300 
pounds 160 kilograms or even more number
two<00:00:41.180> when<00:00:41.810> you<00:00:41.930> do<00:00:42.079> a<00:00:42.110> movement<00:00:42.680> with<00:00:43.100> a

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
two when you do a movement with a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.620 
two when you do a movement with a
barbell<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:45.430> whole<00:00:46.430> movement<00:00:46.700> is<00:00:47.120> more

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
barbell the whole movement is more

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.260 
barbell the whole movement is more
stable<00:00:48.050> than<00:00:48.470> when<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.340> have<00:00:49.579> to<00:00:49.760> do<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.059> with

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
stable than when you have to do it with

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.700 
stable than when you have to do it with
dumbbells<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.140> each<00:00:51.800> arm<00:00:52.070> has<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:53.000> work<00:00:53.180> in

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
dumbbells and each arm has to work in

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.639 
dumbbells and each arm has to work in
its<00:00:54.710> side<00:00:55.149> independently<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:56.809> when<00:00:57.290> you<00:00:57.440> use<00:00:57.620> a

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
its side independently so when you use a

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.040 
its side independently so when you use a
barbell<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.489> whole<00:00:59.210> movement<00:00:59.450> is<00:00:59.840> more

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
barbell the whole movement is more

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.350 
barbell the whole movement is more
stable<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.559> that<00:01:01.100> means<00:01:01.370> less<00:01:01.730> stabilizer

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
stable and that means less stabilizer

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.830 
stable and that means less stabilizer
muscles<00:01:02.540> are<00:01:03.079> involved<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.980> number<00:01:04.369> tree<00:01:05.210> we

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
muscles are involved a number tree we

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.929 
muscles are involved a number tree we
all<00:01:05.990> have<00:01:06.229> a<00:01:06.259> stronger<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:07.040> weaker<00:01:07.399> side<00:01:07.729> in

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
all have a stronger and weaker side in

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.870 
all have a stronger and weaker side in
our<00:01:08.090> bodies<00:01:08.509> and<00:01:08.689> when<00:01:09.350> both<00:01:09.920> hands<00:01:10.490> do<00:01:10.850> a

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
our bodies and when both hands do a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.379 
our bodies and when both hands do a
movement<00:01:11.509> together<00:01:11.899> the<00:01:12.770> stronger<00:01:13.429> side<00:01:13.789> can

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:14.389 
movement together the stronger side can

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:17.379 
movement together the stronger side can
make<00:01:14.630> up<00:01:14.869> for<00:01:15.109> the<00:01:15.799> week<00:01:16.069> aside<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.819> that

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:17.389 
make up for the week aside and that

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.410 
make up for the week aside and that
means<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:18.229> if<00:01:19.009> you<00:01:19.159> are<00:01:19.310> beginner<00:01:19.700> your

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
means that if you are beginner your

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.929 
means that if you are beginner your
weakest<00:01:20.840> I'd<00:01:21.079> won't<00:01:21.679> be<00:01:21.829> able<00:01:22.039> to<00:01:22.340> catch<00:01:22.639> up

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
weakest I'd won't be able to catch up

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.050 
weakest I'd won't be able to catch up
because<00:01:23.719> the<00:01:23.869> stronger<00:01:24.319> side<00:01:24.499> always<00:01:25.279> helps

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
because the stronger side always helps

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
because the stronger side always helps
out

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.610 

so<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.120> not<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:33.480> a<00:01:33.510> question<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:34.110> one

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
so it's not really a question of one

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.890 
so it's not really a question of one
being<00:01:34.920> better<00:01:35.220> than<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> other<00:01:35.760> but<00:01:36.570> more<00:01:36.870> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
being better than the other but more a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.230 
being better than the other but more a
question<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.500> your<00:01:37.920> current<00:01:38.520> training

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
question of your current training

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.930 
question of your current training
experience<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.440> which<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.130> should<00:01:41.670> work

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
experience and which one should work

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.360 
experience and which one should work
better<00:01:42.330> for<00:01:42.660> you<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> beginner<00:01:43.890> you

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
better for you if you are a beginner you

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.200 
better for you if you are a beginner you
won't<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.910> able<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.620> use<00:01:46.620> or<00:01:46.920> need<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.970> big

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
won't be able to use or need the big

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.870 
won't be able to use or need the big
weights<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.960> barbell<00:01:49.440> can<00:01:49.680> handle<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.730> you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
weights a barbell can handle and if you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120 
weights a barbell can handle and if you
use<00:01:51.120> a<00:01:51.150> barbell<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.170> also<00:01:52.560> won't<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.980> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
use a barbell you also won't get the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.700 
use a barbell you also won't get the
benefit<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.760> evening<00:01:54.450> hours<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:55.140> weaker<00:01:55.470> and

benefit of evening hours the weaker and

benefit of evening hours the weaker and
stronger<00:01:56.130> side<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.550> your<00:01:56.700> body<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.240> the

more weight to have a enough training

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.830 
more weight to have a enough training
input<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.190> bubble<00:02:11.550> really<00:02:12.060> comes<00:02:12.540> in

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
input then the bubble really comes in

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.740 
input then the bubble really comes in
