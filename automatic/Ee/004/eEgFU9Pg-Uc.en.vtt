00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.780 
of the preseason against San Francisco

those<00:04:03.590> interceptions<00:04:04.590> because<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.160> just

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
those interceptions because you just

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.009 
those interceptions because you just

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
Wilson was not looking good in the

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.309 
Wilson was not looking good in the
preseason<00:05:06.190> here<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.599> got<00:05:07.780> picked<00:05:07.990> off<00:05:08.139> their

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:08.319 
preseason here you got picked off their

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.649 
preseason here you got picked off their
the<00:05:08.560> very<00:05:08.770> next<00:05:09.009> play<00:05:09.220> he<00:05:09.970> got<00:05:10.150> picked<00:05:10.389> off

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
the very next play he got picked off

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.370 
the very next play he got picked off
again<00:05:11.349> on<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:12.550> same<00:05:12.880> exact<00:05:13.599> play<00:05:13.900> there<00:05:14.139> so

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
again on the same exact play there so

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.260 
again on the same exact play there so
Wilson<00:05:14.680> needs<00:05:14.889> to<00:05:14.979> hit<00:05:15.159> that<00:05:15.340> film<00:05:15.819> room<00:05:16.060> and

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
Wilson needs to hit that film room and

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.499 
Wilson needs to hit that film room and
just<00:05:16.840> dial<00:05:17.710> down<00:05:17.919> those<00:05:18.099> interceptions<00:05:18.520> 143

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
just dial down those interceptions 143

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.420 
just dial down those interceptions 143
passing<00:05:19.900> yards<00:05:20.110> that<00:05:20.229> game<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.979> I<00:05:21.039> believe<00:05:21.099> he

passing yards that game and I believe he

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.520 
passing yards that game and I believe he

here<00:05:51.880> they<00:05:52.270> would<00:05:52.419> get<00:05:52.569> a<00:05:52.599> touchdown<00:05:52.870> and<00:05:53.319> this

here they would get a touchdown and this
one's<00:05:54.039> hit<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:54.550> gray<00:05:54.819> I<00:05:54.849> believe<00:05:55.270> that<00:05:55.509> was<00:05:55.630> a

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
one's hit to gray I believe that was a

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.899 
one's hit to gray I believe that was a
screen<00:05:55.960> pass<00:05:56.110> he's<00:05:56.409> down<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:57.009> sideline<00:05:57.669> out

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
screen pass he's down the sideline out

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.839 
screen pass he's down the sideline out
of<00:05:58.150> bounds<00:05:58.949> later<00:05:59.949> on<00:06:00.159> in<00:06:00.310> the<00:06:00.370> fourth<00:06:00.639> quarter

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
of bounds later on in the fourth quarter

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.790 
of bounds later on in the fourth quarter
Wilson's<00:06:01.360> gonna<00:06:01.419> get<00:06:01.659> picked<00:06:01.960> off<00:06:02.139> by<00:06:02.409> Sam

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
Wilson's gonna get picked off by Sam

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.499 
Wilson's gonna get picked off by Sam
Shields<00:06:03.159> I<00:06:03.430> think<00:06:03.580> that<00:06:03.699> Sam<00:06:03.909> Shields<00:06:04.210> and

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
Shields I think that Sam Shields and

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.240 
Shields I think that Sam Shields and
shields<00:06:04.900> I<00:06:05.050> don't<00:06:05.469> know<00:06:05.530> if<00:06:05.590> it's<00:06:05.710> Sam<00:06:05.919> but

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
shields I don't know if it's Sam but

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.430 
shields I don't know if it's Sam but
it's<00:06:06.789> picked<00:06:07.180> off<00:06:07.330> by<00:06:07.539> shields<00:06:07.990> there<00:06:08.169> and<00:06:08.409> I

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
it's picked off by shields there and I

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.920 
it's picked off by shields there and I
believe<00:06:08.710> Wilson<00:06:09.219> ins<00:06:09.430> with<00:06:09.669> 126<00:06:10.479> yards<00:06:10.659> I

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
believe Wilson ins with 126 yards I

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.360 
believe Wilson ins with 126 yards I
think<00:06:10.960> he<00:06:11.169> had<00:06:11.289> two<00:06:11.500> interceptions<00:06:11.770> in<00:06:12.190> this

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
think he had two interceptions in this

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.939 
think he had two interceptions in this
game<00:06:12.550> as<00:06:12.729> well<00:06:13.150> so<00:06:13.870> Wilson<00:06:14.380> really<00:06:14.680> needs<00:06:14.860> to

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
game as well so Wilson really needs to

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:16.770 
game as well so Wilson really needs to
hit<00:06:15.099> the<00:06:15.219> practice<00:06:15.610> field<00:06:15.819> and<00:06:16.030> dial<00:06:16.509> down<00:06:16.719> the

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
hit the practice field and dial down the

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.120 
hit the practice field and dial down the
interceptions<00:06:17.469> we're<00:06:17.650> going<00:06:17.770> to<00:06:17.860> go<00:06:17.979> ahead

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
interceptions we're going to go ahead

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.510 
interceptions we're going to go ahead
