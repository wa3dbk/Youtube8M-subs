00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.710
 start the road many years ago 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.570
 with the common denominator of all 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.300
 that we started the way many, many 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.340
 years and that is that we were alone the truth 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.800
 we were not clear about anything that was the 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.660
 I really adopted the idea that we had 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.300
 zero good one can not have children 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.700
 biologically then it adopts 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.820
 translation is a theme that begins 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.870
 in the family of origin the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.870
 people who want to talk 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.660
 we noticed that there was a lot of misinformation 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.690
 then we started dreaming about the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.030
 possibility of a place to collect the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.579
 as much information as possible and 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.579
 start spreading things 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.370
 pieces of paper 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.550
 We could not start contacting more 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.769
 people from the interior of the country 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.780
 we realized that there were other types 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.659
 of self-management and from there 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.530
 We began to invite to be formed 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.940
 others went to listen to representatives and 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.670
 legislators all announced new 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.140
 projects and there in a place where 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.390
 you had to talk about 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.119
 adoption I heard that we were the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.100
 appropriators of the children of poverty 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.420
 that we were narcissists that we wanted 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.790
 the government provides us with what is not 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.280
 we could have biologically when 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 someone asks me what are the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.500
 difficulties or obstacles to 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.850
 adopt I wonder for whom for the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.240
 who wants to be a father or what does he want 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.030
 be son 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.939
 being adoptive parents is not the same as 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.000
 being biological parent records comes from 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.409
 outside you have to internalize the through 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.600
 of the link to then go back to 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.850
 leave it 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.070
 one of the difficulties that I see that 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.320
 there is that the marriages that come 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.000
 with this intention of adoption many 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.800
 Sometimes they are not prepared for 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.560
 adoption 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.870
 we can notice that the system is common 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.960
 what about being with many holes and in 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.960
 those holes are lost children 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.120
 when one knows testimonies as 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.860
 that we have seen in some meetings of 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.320
 guys who were institutionalized 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.030
 if they are telling you what happened and 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.640
 you realize you can not leave 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.200
 three years or four 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.200
 suspend your life 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.850
 and we have to stop looking at his 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.940
 just our desire to start 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.040
 offer us or perhaps offer this wish 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.820
 like the possibility that that guy 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.820
 have the family
