doesn't really matter the bus coming up
is<00:02:54.700> really<00:02:55.209> easy<00:02:55.360> especially<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> ebonys

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
is really easy especially in the ebonys

version<00:02:57.269> because<00:02:58.269> of<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.540> right<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
version because of the right of the

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.100 
version because of the right of the
screen<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.819> enemy<00:03:01.120> can't<00:03:01.330> walk<00:03:01.569> past<00:03:01.870> there

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
screen the enemy can't walk past there

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.949 
screen the enemy can't walk past there
so<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.530> don't<00:03:02.709> have<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:02.980> like<00:03:03.190> jump<00:03:03.489> around<00:03:03.959> we

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
so you don't have to like jump around we

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.840 
so you don't have to like jump around we
avoid<00:03:05.260> him<00:03:05.470> like<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:06.160> had<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.400> do<00:03:06.519> in<00:03:06.700> the
