they're going to have ears as well but
they're<00:02:10.530> also<00:02:10.650> going<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.980> have<00:02:11.160> data<00:02:11.520> input

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
they're also going to have data input

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.560 
they're also going to have data input
and<00:02:12.360> they're<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.290> sensors<00:02:13.980> and

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
and they're going to have sensors and

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.240 
and they're going to have sensors and
the<00:02:15.570> kids<00:02:15.810> learn<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.290> they<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.680> write<00:02:17.220> a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
the kids learn that they can write a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.140 
the kids learn that they can write a
program<00:02:17.610> using<00:02:18.510> our<00:02:19.160> netbooks<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.490> then<00:02:21.030> they

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
program using our netbooks and then they

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.020 
program using our netbooks and then they
yell<00:02:21.420> load<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.870> wirelessly<00:02:22.500> right<00:02:22.890> into<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
yell load it wirelessly right into the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.350 
yell load it wirelessly right into the
robot<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.800> robot<00:02:26.190> stores<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.850> program

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
robot then that robot stores the program

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.290 
robot then that robot stores the program
and<00:02:27.510> they<00:02:27.630> can<00:02:27.810> run<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.040> robot<00:02:29.580> think

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
and they can run it so this robot think

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.590 
and they can run it so this robot think
it's<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.600> program<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.830> remove<00:02:32.490> both<00:02:33.240> motors

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
it's a program to remove both motors

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.410 
it's a program to remove both motors
forward<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:35.160> one<00:02:35.340> second<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:35.940> then<00:02:36.000> stop

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
forward for one second and then stop

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.150 
forward for one second and then stop
that's<00:02:37.140> because<00:02:37.350> we<00:02:37.470> don't<00:02:37.650> want<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.010> run

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
that's because we don't want it to run

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.240 
that's because we don't want it to run
off<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.400> side<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.240> table<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:43.290> may<00:02:43.950> life

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
made them closer together so they would

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.360 
made them closer together so they would
move<00:03:08.400> faster<00:03:08.870> they<00:03:09.870> even<00:03:10.050> used<00:03:10.500> sensors<00:03:11.070> like

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
move faster they even used sensors like

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.160 
move faster they even used sensors like
a<00:03:11.430> touch<00:03:11.730> sensor<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.390> helps<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> robot<00:03:13.140> to

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
a touch sensor that helps the robot to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.199 
a touch sensor that helps the robot to
back<00:03:13.500> up<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.950> redirect<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.970> can<00:03:15.120> get

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
back up and redirect so it can get

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.050 
back up and redirect so it can get
around<00:03:15.420> obstacles<00:03:16.280> there's<00:03:17.280> another<00:03:17.610> sensor

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
around obstacles there's another sensor

around obstacles there's another sensor
the<00:03:18.180> kids<00:03:18.390> learn<00:03:18.540> about<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.900> that's<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:19.110> light

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
the kids learn about and that's a light

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.260 
the kids learn about and that's a light
sensor<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.459> one<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.820> going<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.060> take

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
sensor so this one is going to take

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.540 
sensor so this one is going to take
readings<00:03:21.630> from<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.200> table<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.860> it's<00:03:23.370> going

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
readings from the table and it's going

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.030 
readings from the table and it's going
to<00:03:23.670> determine<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.750> light<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.709> color<00:03:25.950> of

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
to determine that the light the color of

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.740 
to determine that the light the color of
the<00:03:26.190> table<00:03:26.580> has<00:03:26.700> changed<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.390> when<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.630> gets

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
the table has changed and when it gets

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.170 
the table has changed and when it gets
off<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.709> table<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.310> knows<00:03:29.580> it's<00:03:29.880> at<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.150> very

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
off the table it knows it's at the very

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.120 
off the table it knows it's at the very
edge<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.870> something<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.500> doesn't<00:03:31.830> want<00:03:32.010> to

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
edge of something and it doesn't want to

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.160

jump<00:03:32.310> off<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.520> cliff<00:03:32.610> so<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.750> kids<00:03:33.989> are

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
jump off a cliff so the kids are

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.620 
jump off a cliff so the kids are
programmed<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.770> to<00:03:34.800> come<00:03:35.130> back<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:36.000> change

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
programmed it to come back and change

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.710 
programmed it to come back and change
direction<00:03:37.020> so<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.530> doesn't<00:03:37.860> go<00:03:37.950> off<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.280> table

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720
