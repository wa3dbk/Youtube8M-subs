00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.140
 The problem today is that 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.160
 Recently, I heard people say that all people can be saved. 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.200
 is this real? 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.960
 This is in terms of special terms, 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.980
 Is called [Universalism] 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.340
 That is, universalism, the meaning of philanthropism. 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.620
 Or called [universal salvation]. 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.720
 It means universal relief. 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.300
 No matter who is close to being relieved. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.020
 Even if it is not a Christian, it has been relieved. 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.500
 Because God is broad-minded, 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.960
 I will answer this question. 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.860
 Today’s question, 3 minutes is unexplained. 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.280
 So it may take 4 minutes, 5 minutes. 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.360
 Please be mentally prepared. 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.520
 As usual, say three key points, 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.000
 the first, 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.980
 Is [cause]. The reason for this teaching will come out. 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.920
 Actually, these ideas 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.840
 As a person, it is very understandable. 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.740
 Because, as a person. 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.000
 To imagine the eternal demise, 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.920
 Or people who suffer in hell. 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.140
 Our hearts are unbearable. 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380
 The more I think, the more I feel too pitiful. 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.440
 Why are you so cruel, 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.180
 Is God in love? 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.120
 So the first reason is that 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.640
 Hold one, as a person’s compassion, 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 To imagine eternal dying or hell and other teachings 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.280
 It is very difficult. 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.620
 Second point, 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.540
 This is related to the first point, 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.060
 Because I want everyone to be saved. 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.940
 So focus on the love and grace of God. 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.160
 God is love. 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.400
 Full of grace. and so, 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.740
 All people can be saved. 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.235
 To emphasize this. 

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:46.445
 It’s all out of being a person 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.320
 Sympathy and opinion ideas. 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.720
 So where are the problems of this teaching? 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.160
 The biggest problem is the lack of balance. 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.020
 God is indeed a person of love and full of grace. 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.960
 At the same time, God is righteous and holy. 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.880
 and so, 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.260
 The lack of balance in these teachings means that 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.540
 They completely ignored 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.480
 God is righteousness. Therefore, God cannot ignore any sin. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.740
 The nature of this god. 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.120
 In the Gospel, about hell, etc. 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.520
 The most warning is 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.120
 Christ itself. 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.260
 therefore 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.640
 If someone denies the existence of hell, 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.700
 At the same time, it is against 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.360
 The words of Christ. 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.220
 This [universalism] position is that 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.840
 I didn’t go to see the teachings of the Bible at all. 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.500
 Instead, look at some of the places you want to see. 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.940
 If you go to see the books of [universalism] 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.700
 Or an article, you will find 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.260
 There are no more saints in their articles. 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.680
 Their articles are not based on the Bible, 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.160
 Even if there are very few, 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.620
 Just quote some of the places you want to say. 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.220
 In this way, what is the teaching of [universalism]? 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.660
 Just like the new clothes in the [New Clothes of the King]. 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.760
 Say it well, you can get everyone’s praise, 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.820
 In fact, there is no entity in wearing it. 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.080
 This kind of teaching, especially the Japanese people like it. 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.780
 But, in the Bible, there is no entity, 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.855
 So when you die in front of God, 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.260
 This is not there for you at all. 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.440
 For me, the person who teaches this kind of teaching 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.740
 Or believe in this teaching, 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.460
 Really feel very sad for them. 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.640
 I feel very painful in my heart. 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.600
 So how does the Christianity of the Bible teach? 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.840
 For example, a famous saint 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.780
 John chapter III, verse 16, 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.160
 There is such a sentence. 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.900
 '"God loves the world, 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.200
 Even gave his only child, 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.180
 Calling everything that believes in him, 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.100
 Not to perish, 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.720
 Inverse eternal life. ' 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.500
 God is indeed a person of love and full of grace. 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.720
 therefore, 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.480
 God gave us his only begotten Son 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.060
 Come to love us like this. 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.920
 but, 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.380
 Not written, so all people are saved. 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.160
 Calling all who believe in him will not perish, 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.520
 That is, believe him 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.420
 This is the responsibility of our side. 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.220
 It is important to answer God and accept the love of God. 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.860
 John 14:6 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.240
 'Jesus said: 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.460
 "I am the way, the truth, the life; 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.500
 If you don’t borrow me, 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.580
 No one can go to the Father without me. ' 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.780
 Jesus said, 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.520
 If you don’t borrow me, 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.560
 So even if you are not a Christian, you can be saved. 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.720
 This statement is not the words of Jesus. 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.940
 it is good. Sum up, 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.560
 Universalism, 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.700
 Everyone can be saved, what is this teaching? 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.500
 This is just that people have expressed their hopes. 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.580
 The result is the same as [the king's new clothes]. 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.640
 I hope that you can believe in Christ and accept the love of God. 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.420
 See you next time in the Q&amp;A session.
