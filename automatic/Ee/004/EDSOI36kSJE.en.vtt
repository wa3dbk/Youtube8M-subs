what I think that's why to answer your
question<00:05:16.039> that<00:05:17.000> is<00:05:17.210> why<00:05:17.360> I<00:05:17.419> think<00:05:17.779> of<00:05:17.960> the

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
question that is why I think of the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.330 
question that is why I think of the
vulture<00:05:18.379> because<00:05:18.680> they're<00:05:18.919> I<00:05:18.949> don't<00:05:19.159> see<00:05:19.310> a

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
vulture because they're I don't see a

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.920 
vulture because they're I don't see a
purpose<00:05:19.849> for<00:05:19.879> the<00:05:20.120> vulture<00:05:20.479> being<00:05:20.659> in<00:05:20.810> this

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
purpose for the vulture being in this

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.480 
purpose for the vulture being in this
movie<00:05:21.319> see<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.919> think<00:05:22.219> that<00:05:22.370> that's

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
movie see I think that that's

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.399 
movie see I think that that's
unnecessary<00:05:22.849> I<00:05:23.389> don't<00:05:23.569> believe<00:05:23.750> that<00:05:23.810> rumor<00:05:24.259> I

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
unnecessary I don't believe that rumor I

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.320 
unnecessary I don't believe that rumor I
believe<00:05:24.740> comfier<00:05:25.159> is<00:05:25.340> in<00:05:25.460> fact<00:05:25.639> going<00:05:25.879> Adrian
