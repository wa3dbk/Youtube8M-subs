00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
but rather a divisive issue for feminism

but rather a divisive issue for feminism
at<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> time<00:01:56.430> basically<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.000> came<00:01:57.090> down<00:01:57.270> to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
at the time basically it came down to

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.330 
at the time basically it came down to
two<00:01:57.570> camps<00:01:57.960> anti-porn<00:01:58.619> feminists<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.159> one

other where anti-porn feminists saw porn

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.639 
other where anti-porn feminists saw porn
is<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> focal<00:02:03.780> point<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:04.049> women's<00:02:04.439> oppression

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
is a focal point for women's oppression

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.740 
is a focal point for women's oppression
specifically<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.820> regards<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.299> controlling

women sex positive feminists believe
that<00:02:10.440> sexual<00:02:11.039> freedom<00:02:11.340> was<00:02:11.610> an<00:02:11.760> important

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
that sexual freedom was an important

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
that sexual freedom was an important
component<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.690> women's<00:02:13.050> freedom<00:02:13.349> as<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> whole

component of women's freedom as a whole

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.200 
component of women's freedom as a whole
as<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:14.040> discussed<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.520> last<00:02:14.580> video<00:02:15.000> there

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
as we discussed in the last video there

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.520 
as we discussed in the last video there
are<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.360> lot<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.570> reasons<00:02:15.990> why<00:02:16.050> second<00:02:16.440> wave

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
are a lot of reasons why second wave

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.080 
are a lot of reasons why second wave
feminism<00:02:16.890> lost<00:02:17.250> its<00:02:17.460> momentum

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
feminism lost its momentum

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.610 
feminism lost its momentum
but<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:18.360> Ripton<00:02:18.660> feminist<00:02:19.080> discussion

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
but this Ripton feminist discussion

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.900 
but this Ripton feminist discussion
played<00:02:19.860> an<00:02:19.980> important<00:02:20.370> role<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
played an important role in the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.610 
played an important role in the
development<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.450> third<00:02:21.660> wave<00:02:21.870> feminism<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
development of third wave feminism and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.720 
development of third wave feminism and
is<00:02:22.680> one<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.980> reasons<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.520> tension

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
is one of the reasons for the tension

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.160 
is one of the reasons for the tension
that<00:02:23.970> exists<00:02:24.300> between<00:02:24.390> second<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.050> third

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
that exists between second and third

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.570 
that exists between second and third
wave<00:02:25.470> feminists<00:02:25.980> today<00:02:26.190> part<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.490> that

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
wave feminists today part of that

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.220 
wave feminists today part of that
tension<00:02:26.790> being<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.330> third<00:02:27.510> wave<00:02:27.720> feminists

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
tension being that third wave feminists

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.110 
tension being that third wave feminists
just<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.830> second<00:02:29.220> wave<00:02:29.310> feminists<00:02:29.790> before

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
just like second wave feminists before

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.280 
just like second wave feminists before
them<00:02:30.270> attempted<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.750> distance<00:02:31.050> themselves

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
them attempted to distance themselves

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.930 
them attempted to distance themselves
from<00:02:31.560> previous<00:02:31.980> movements<00:02:32.430> by<00:02:32.580> saying<00:02:32.820> that

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
from previous movements by saying that

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.250 
from previous movements by saying that
while<00:02:33.060> they<00:02:33.180> recognize<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.750> importance<00:02:34.140> of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
while they recognize the importance of

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.110 
while they recognize the importance of
past<00:02:34.500> work<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:35.040> new<00:02:35.220> wave<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.580> going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.910> fix

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
past work this new wave is going to fix

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.640 
past work this new wave is going to fix
the<00:02:36.300> problems<00:02:36.690> left<00:02:36.930> behind<00:02:37.320> by<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.530> previous

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
the problems left behind by the previous

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.590 
the problems left behind by the previous
generation<00:02:38.070> which<00:02:38.790> brings<00:02:39.000> us<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.360> next

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
generation which brings us to the next

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.150 
generation which brings us to the next
issue<00:02:39.750> between<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.320> two<00:02:40.470> waves<00:02:40.680> which<00:02:40.980> is

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
issue between the two waves which is

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.070 
issue between the two waves which is
that<00:02:41.310> third<00:02:41.610> wave<00:02:41.790> feminism<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.480> often<00:02:42.840> framed

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
that third wave feminism is often framed

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.170 
that third wave feminism is often framed
as<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.380> generational<00:02:44.250> movement<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.850> daughters

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
as a generational movement the daughters

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.820 
as a generational movement the daughters
of<00:02:45.360> second<00:02:45.690> wave<00:02:45.780> feminism<00:02:46.140> striking<00:02:46.680> out<00:02:46.800> on

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
of second wave feminism striking out on

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.110 
of second wave feminism striking out on
their<00:02:47.040> own<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.400> basically<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:47.940> we<00:02:48.030> have

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
their own so basically what we have

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.760 
their own so basically what we have
going<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.870> we<00:02:48.959> have<00:02:49.080> some<00:02:49.290> feminists

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
going on is that we have some feminists

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.410 
going on is that we have some feminists
saying<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.580> third<00:02:50.820> wave<00:02:51.030> isn't

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
saying that the third wave isn't

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.360 
saying that the third wave isn't
necessarily<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:52.080> movement<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.010> itself

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
necessarily a movement in and of itself

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.340 
necessarily a movement in and of itself
but<00:02:53.820> just<00:02:53.880> an<00:02:54.239> extension<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.840> second<00:02:55.230> wave

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
but just an extension of the second wave

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.620 
but just an extension of the second wave
you<00:02:55.680> know<00:02:55.800> like<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.520> second<00:02:57.120> wave<00:02:57.239> was<00:02:57.450> an

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
you know like the second wave was an

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.270 
you know like the second wave was an
extension<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.350> first<00:02:58.530> wave<00:02:58.830> it's<00:02:59.100> almost

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
extension of the first wave it's almost

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.830 
extension of the first wave it's almost
like<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.670> wave<00:02:59.820> model<00:03:00.030> doesn't<00:03:00.510> even<00:03:00.600> matter

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
like the wave model doesn't even matter

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.240 
like the wave model doesn't even matter
kind<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.380> how<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.530> say<00:03:01.680> you'll<00:03:01.860> never<00:03:01.890> turn

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
kind of how you say you'll never turn

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.560 
kind of how you say you'll never turn
into<00:03:02.370> your<00:03:02.580> mother<00:03:02.610> until<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.120> wake<00:03:03.300> up<00:03:03.450> one

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
into your mother until you wake up one

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.910 
into your mother until you wake up one
morning<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.959> realize<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.530> already<00:03:04.680> have

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
morning to realize that you already have

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.410 
morning to realize that you already have
but<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> debate<00:03:05.550> itself<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.030> kind<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.270> really

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
but the debate itself is kind of really

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.210 
but the debate itself is kind of really
silly<00:03:06.750> because<00:03:06.989> regardless<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.770> whatever<00:03:07.980> you

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
silly because regardless of whatever you

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.650 
silly because regardless of whatever you
call<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.489> feminist<00:03:09.090> action<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.570> still

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
call it feminist action is still

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.180 
call it feminist action is still
occurring<00:03:10.050> it's<00:03:10.350> really<00:03:10.560> always<00:03:10.890> occurring

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
occurring it's really always occurring

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.650 
occurring it's really always occurring
no<00:03:11.430> matter<00:03:11.580> what<00:03:11.790> wave<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.120> claim<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.360> belong

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
no matter what wave you claim to belong

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.229 
no matter what wave you claim to belong
to<00:03:12.860> so<00:03:13.860> let's<00:03:14.040> talk<00:03:14.190> about<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:14.910> if<00:03:15.120> we

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
to so let's talk about it so if we

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.610 
to so let's talk about it so if we
accept<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.690> third<00:03:15.870> wave<00:03:16.080> is<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.260> separate

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
accept the third wave is a separate

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.380 
accept the third wave is a separate
movement<00:03:16.950> from<00:03:17.040> second<00:03:17.459> wave<00:03:17.580> what<00:03:18.180> are<00:03:18.269> its

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
movement from second wave what are its

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.030 
movement from second wave what are its
goals<00:03:18.450> well<00:03:18.930> I'm<00:03:19.019> glad<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.350> asked<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.830> to

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
goals well I'm glad you asked you to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.710 
goals well I'm glad you asked you to
third<00:03:20.370> wave<00:03:20.580> while<00:03:20.880> still<00:03:21.209> focusing<00:03:21.630> on

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
third wave while still focusing on

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.690 
third wave while still focusing on
legislative<00:03:22.320> changes<00:03:22.680> also<00:03:23.130> focuses<00:03:23.610> on

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
legislative changes also focuses on

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.130 
legislative changes also focuses on
changing<00:03:24.120> cultural<00:03:24.450> norms<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:24.900> stereotypes

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
changing cultural norms and stereotypes

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.840 
changing cultural norms and stereotypes
and<00:03:25.890> while<00:03:26.040> those<00:03:26.190> things<00:03:26.310> might<00:03:26.549> sound<00:03:26.760> like

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
and while those things might sound like

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.490 
and while those things might sound like
trivial<00:03:27.239> issues<00:03:27.600> these<00:03:27.900> norms<00:03:28.290> while

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
trivial issues these norms while

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.320 
trivial issues these norms while
individually<00:03:29.100> appearing<00:03:29.580> harmless<00:03:30.000> work

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
individually appearing harmless work

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.580 
individually appearing harmless work
together<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.840> create<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.080> foundation<00:03:31.230> of

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
together to create a foundation of

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.199 
together to create a foundation of
attitudes<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.220> make<00:03:32.400> existing<00:03:32.700> social

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
attitudes that make existing social

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.670 
attitudes that make existing social
inequalities<00:03:33.750> appear<00:03:34.140> normal<00:03:34.320> and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
inequalities appear normal and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.140 
inequalities appear normal and
inevitable<00:03:35.220> which<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.610> why<00:03:35.700> when<00:03:35.880> we<00:03:35.940> talk

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
inevitable which is why when we talk

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.400 
inevitable which is why when we talk
about<00:03:36.180> third<00:03:36.540> wave<00:03:36.720> feminism<00:03:37.049> you're<00:03:37.320> gonna

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
about third wave feminism you're gonna

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.080 
about third wave feminism you're gonna
hear<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.739> lot<00:03:37.799> about<00:03:38.220> things<00:03:38.459> like<00:03:38.640> breaking

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
hear a lot about things like breaking

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.300 
hear a lot about things like breaking
down<00:03:39.239> essentialism<00:03:39.900> where<00:03:40.350> persons<00:03:40.709> biology

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
down essentialism where persons biology

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.140 
down essentialism where persons biology
means<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.670> they<00:03:41.760> have<00:03:41.910> certain

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
means that they have certain

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.400 
means that they have certain
characteristics<00:03:42.570> ie

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
characteristics ie

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.020 
characteristics ie
women<00:03:43.860> are<00:03:43.950> nurturing<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.640> men<00:03:44.910> are

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
women are nurturing and men are

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.430 
women are nurturing and men are
aggressive<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.750> you'll<00:03:45.959> also<00:03:46.080> hear<00:03:46.380> about

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
aggressive and you'll also hear about

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.800 
aggressive and you'll also hear about
breaking<00:03:47.040> down<00:03:47.070> binaries<00:03:47.820> like<00:03:48.120> male-female

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
breaking down binaries like male-female

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.600 
breaking down binaries like male-female
white<00:03:49.230> black<00:03:49.530> there'd<00:03:49.890> my<00:03:50.010> focus<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.489> on

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
white black there'd my focus is on

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.580 
white black there'd my focus is on
intersectionality<00:03:51.450> whoa<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.989> feminism<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:52.560> a

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
intersectionality whoa and feminism on a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.560 
intersectionality whoa and feminism on a
global<00:03:52.860> scale<00:03:53.040> which<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.640> made<00:03:53.820> more<00:03:54.060> possible

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
global scale which is made more possible

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.300 
global scale which is made more possible
through<00:03:54.870> things<00:03:55.110> like<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.530> internet<00:03:55.860> yeah<00:03:56.130> it

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
through things like the internet yeah it

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.710 
through things like the internet yeah it
is<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:56.880> because<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.269> this<00:03:57.360> there's<00:03:57.630> an

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
is so because of this there's an

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.449 
is so because of this there's an
emphasis<00:03:57.840> on<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.590> multiplicity<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.250> voices

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
emphasis on the multiplicity of voices

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.030 
emphasis on the multiplicity of voices
rather<00:04:00.000> than<00:04:00.239> just<00:04:00.510> one<00:04:00.989> person<00:04:01.019> speaking<00:04:01.860> for

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
rather than just one person speaking for

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.410 
rather than just one person speaking for
the<00:04:02.100> imagined<00:04:02.519> whole<00:04:02.700> which<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> really

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
the imagined whole which is a really

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.539 
the imagined whole which is a really
cool<00:04:03.720> but<00:04:03.959> often<00:04:04.380> critiqued<00:04:04.799> facet<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.400> the

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
cool but often critiqued facet of the

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.220 
cool but often critiqued facet of the
third<00:04:05.730> wave<00:04:05.940> as<00:04:06.269> some<00:04:06.540> people<00:04:06.660> claim<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.110> it

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
third wave as some people claim that it

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.960 
third wave as some people claim that it
is<00:04:07.320> too<00:04:07.530> crowded<00:04:07.769> with<00:04:08.010> voices<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.610> organize

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
is too crowded with voices to organize

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.400 
is too crowded with voices to organize
in<00:04:09.180> any<00:04:09.299> meaningful<00:04:09.570> way<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.140> what<00:04:10.260> are<00:04:10.350> the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
in any meaningful way so what are the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.900 
in any meaningful way so what are the
key<00:04:10.590> issues<00:04:10.739> at<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.160> third<00:04:11.370> wave<00:04:11.549> here's

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
key issues at the third wave here's

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:12.949 
key issues at the third wave here's
where<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:12.120> see<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.269> lot<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.570> overlap<00:04:12.930> between

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
where we see a lot of overlap between

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.330 
where we see a lot of overlap between
