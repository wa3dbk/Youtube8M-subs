point<00:02:29.350> here<00:02:29.680> on<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.890> passenger<00:02:30.280> side<00:02:30.459> keep<00:02:31.150> in

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
point here on the passenger side keep in

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.030 
point here on the passenger side keep in
mind<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.989> two<00:02:32.140> weld<00:02:32.380> nuts<00:02:32.620> are<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.860> same

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
mind that the two weld nuts are the same

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.100 
mind that the two weld nuts are the same
on<00:02:33.220> both<00:02:33.370> sides<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:34.060> each<00:02:34.330> process<00:02:34.810> we<00:02:34.900> do<00:02:35.080> here

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
on both sides so each process we do here

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.630 
on both sides so each process we do here
to<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.410> passenger's<00:02:35.830> side<00:02:36.040> will<00:02:36.550> get

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
to the passenger's side will get

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.190
