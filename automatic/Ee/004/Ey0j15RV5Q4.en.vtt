00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.020 

all<00:00:47.770> right<00:00:47.860> so<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.100> actually<00:00:48.250> threw<00:00:48.640> it<00:00:48.760> up<00:00:48.880> a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
all right so I actually threw it up a

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.970 
all right so I actually threw it up a
lot<00:00:49.210> but<00:00:49.870> that<00:00:49.900> because<00:00:50.470> it<00:00:50.590> wasn't<00:00:50.890> deep

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
lot but that because it wasn't deep

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.470 
lot but that because it wasn't deep
inside<00:00:51.340> enough<00:00:51.610> it<00:00:51.730> didn't<00:00:51.940> blow<00:00:52.090> it<00:00:52.120> up<00:00:52.330> so

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
inside enough it didn't blow it up so

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.820 
inside enough it didn't blow it up so
we're<00:00:52.630> gonna<00:00:52.720> try<00:00:52.960> it<00:00:53.020> with<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.320> big<00:00:53.470> one<00:00:53.620> and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
we're gonna try it with the big one and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.530 
we're gonna try it with the big one and
put<00:00:54.250> it<00:00:54.370> all<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.670> way<00:00:54.790> deep<00:00:55.000> I<00:00:55.180> think<00:00:55.390> there's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
put it all the way deep I think there's

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.420 
put it all the way deep I think there's
going<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.810> be<00:00:55.870> enough<00:00:56.140> space<00:00:56.260> all<00:00:57.130> right<00:00:57.280> so

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
going to be enough space all right so

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.890 
going to be enough space all right so
this<00:00:57.610> thing<00:00:57.880> is<00:00:58.000> going<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.240> actually<00:00:58.540> go<00:00:58.690> all

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
this thing is going to actually go all

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.630 
this thing is going to actually go all
the<00:00:59.110> way<00:00:59.260> in<00:00:59.470> so<00:00:59.920> I'm<00:01:00.040> hoping<00:01:00.370> it's<00:01:00.550> gonna

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
the way in so I'm hoping it's gonna

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:22.810 
the way in so I'm hoping it's gonna
explode<00:01:01.030> it<00:01:01.270> let's<00:01:01.450> try<00:01:01.630> it

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.649 

looks<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.180> thing<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.479> actually

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
looks like this thing is actually

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.590 
looks like this thing is actually
firecracker<00:01:25.320> proved<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.369> let's<00:01:27.119> check<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> out

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
firecracker proved so let's check it out

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.270 
firecracker proved so let's check it out
and<00:01:27.810> let's<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.470> sledgehammer

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and let's see if it's sledgehammer

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.630 
and let's see if it's sledgehammer
proved<00:01:29.670> let's<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:31.130> alright<00:01:32.130> let's<00:01:32.430> hit<00:01:32.580> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
proved let's do it alright let's hit it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:48.720 
proved let's do it alright let's hit it
hard
