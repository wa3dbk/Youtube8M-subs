00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.410
 we will prepare muffins or cupcakes 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.270
 chocolate the ingredients that 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.150
 we need are for about 20 units 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:15.170
 approximately 220 grams of flour 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:18.590
 280 wheat sugar 70 pure cocoa in 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.439
 powder without sugar 4 eggs 125 grams of 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.689
 custard or chocolate yogurt 125 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.820
 grams of butter a tablespoon of 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.640
 vanilla aroma 2 teaspoons 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.660
 yeast royal or baking powder a 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.720
 spoonful of vinegar and a pinch of salt 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.730
 and let's start by taking the bowl where 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.640
 we are going to beat everything with our 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.670
 electric blender and let's sift 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.670
 all the dry ingredients we put 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.379
 directly in a large colander the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.379
 flour with cocoa 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.830
 the sugar 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.730
 there are 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.870
 and baking powder or yeast 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.060
 and since I do not want it to come out of the bowl 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.420
 and it's easy if you waved it because it's very 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.850
 I use a spoon and I will move it 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.850
 everything so that it falls little by little 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.660
 until you are sure that at 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.390
 shake it and it does not come out we shake it and if 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.400
 we have many cocoa balls left 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.860
 crush with the help of the spoon to 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.560
 that go through the colander now we add 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.910
 the chocolate custard if you do not have or 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.700
 you do not find them in your 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.310
 supermarket you can use natural yogurt or 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.300
 bani vanilla yogurt or custard 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.720
 vanilla we also put the 4 eggs the 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.280
 butter melted but already cold and the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.800
 teaspoon of vinegar that is very 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.320
 important since it does not provide flavor but 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.290
 helps the cake then keep 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.410
 the humidity and it is much more juicy and 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.850
 Let's discuss all the ingredients 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.460
 first a little bit at slow speed 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.680
 to integrate the ingredients and then 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.899
 a couple of minutes at fast speed 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.160
 to mix and stay 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.680
 homogeneous 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.620
 also the eggs will grow a bit and the 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.780
 mass will be more spongy once 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.240
 After the time we have our 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.069
 prepared molds we are going to put the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.920
 paper for the cupcake 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.319
 and with the help of a pastry bag 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.900
 let's fill them in this is the way 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.389
 easier and more hygienic refill 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.489
 if you do not want to pring all the kitchen the 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.920
 truth is that to me this system is the 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.739
 What I like most helped me with a jug 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.250
 to place the sleeve and fill it more 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.250
 easily 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.850
 as it fits all the mix but pretty 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.190
 justita what I do is that I put a 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.230
 clamp on top of the sleeve 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.870
 so that it does not come out 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.849
 we cut the tip carefully or very 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.810
 small or too big to fill 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:05.819
 the muffins with precision and we're going 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.680
 to fill only half the mold 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.200
 because we want our future 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.650
 muffins become a cupcake 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.870
 the oven is preheated to 200 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.060
 degrees and with the grate out of the oven 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.359
 we put the molds if we had 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.220
 inside then it would cost us a lot of work 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:27.280
 put them because they are silicone 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:31.330
 we have them baking between 15 and 20 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.300
 minutes at 200 degrees I was about 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.390
 16 minutes approximately because no 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.190
 I wanted them to stay too dry 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.620
 If we click off the needle and clean 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.780
 you know that they are perfect and ready 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.940
 we have our muffins or muffins 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.830
 chocolate will soon become 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.930
 terrific cupcakes of the 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.150
 cemetery that you can see in the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.100
 next video and we hope that you 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.160
 please because the truth is that both 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.830
 for breakfast cupcake as for 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.720
 chocolate cupcakes the truth is that 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.720
 they are delicious
