00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
aluminum look and it looks really cool

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.609

because<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:02.450> iPod<00:02:02.840> did<00:02:03.049> have<00:02:03.170> some<00:02:03.349> really

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
because this iPod did have some really

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.149 
because this iPod did have some really
nasty<00:02:03.920> scratches<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.819> it<00:02:05.649> just<00:02:06.649> general<00:02:07.039> wear

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
nasty scratches in it just general wear

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.759 
nasty scratches in it just general wear
and<00:02:07.189> tear<00:02:07.429> scuffs<00:02:07.849> so<00:02:08.239> I<00:02:08.509> figured<00:02:09.319> I'd<00:02:09.410> start

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
and tear scuffs so I figured I'd start

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.360 
and tear scuffs so I figured I'd start
from<00:02:09.890> scratch<00:02:10.099> and<00:02:10.310> do<00:02:10.489> that<00:02:12.190> another<00:02:13.190> thing

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.500 
down here was pretty messed up and bent
up<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.540> bet<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.290> all<00:02:54.440> flat<00:02:54.769> so<00:02:55.400> now<00:02:55.609> when

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
up so I bet that all flat so now when

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:07.460 
up so I bet that all flat so now when
you<00:02:56.630> laid<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.109> on<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.739> iPod<00:02:58.480> it's<00:02:59.500> this<00:03:00.500> in

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.070 

now<00:03:08.010> when<00:03:08.160> you're<00:03:08.250> late<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.580> iPod<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.870> can

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
now when you're late in the iPod you can

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.910 
now when you're late in the iPod you can
barely<00:03:10.380> tell<00:03:10.530> that's<00:03:10.740> up<00:03:10.920> there<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:12.920> that

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
barely tell that's up there and that

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.280 
barely tell that's up there and that
lays<00:03:14.100> perfectly<00:03:14.220> flat<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.660> if<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.840> got<00:03:16.050> one
