00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello you know what's really great 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.429
 is when you do an unboxing and then 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.320
 I realize in retrospect I have that 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.920
 external micro not turned on 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.289
 that happened to me so I discuss 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.750
 now just my unboxing here yet 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.130
 times so do not be surprised if what 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.660
 I just do not always talk 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.260
 Together with what you see in the video 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.349

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.090

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.840

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.090
 this box is this box was us 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.590
 presented at the blogger event here in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.539
 Hanover by Rossmann 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.219
 I packed this box myself 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.610
 so knows what's inside accordingly 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.710
 is and I would say we are looking now 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.200
 Just go in together as I said 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.060
 only the first box is known to all 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.420
 other boxes are surprise boxes 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.090
 By the way, every month, these 5,000 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.250
 limited boxes re-launched with nothing 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.430
 three month subscription and co but really 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.930
 new chance every month so that was just 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.700
 the outer carton now we come to 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.720
 actual box I like in front of everyone 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.729
 I like the design 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.710
 somehow alive, fresh and cheerful 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.030
 I like it so you have to say 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.170
 I made a nice loop 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.430
 So you can me my quiet 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.590
 I have good comments there 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.140
 i can only unpack with me 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.939
 can wrap up as well yes yes here 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.100
 See that I packed that nicely 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.950
 have with the ausparken has a bit 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.079
 As I like you so are the products 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.210
 nine pieces are in it as I said five to 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.860
 nine are actually always in the box 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.649
 the current value I can already 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.710
 betrayed just under 33 euros five euros paid 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.680

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.469
 golgatha max meid toothpaste we have 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.270
 My husband is the first product here 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.590
 I myself may lighten this 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.599
 Do not use toothpastes for mine 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.220
 Enamel is not good therefore has mine 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.480
 a lot to do with 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.090
 then we have here in saana 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.590
 nail polish remover petz I think that 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.740
 very practical especially if you are so 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.300
 Glitter nail polish on it has like me 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.590
 just put it on aluminum foil threaten 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.170
 get a little bit of action then get it 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.670
 you can do it off perfectly or with great ease 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.200
 if you just have a nail 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.370
 somehow and not only now 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.020
 wants to start drinking 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.200
 Great for that so next we have 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.030

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.480

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.640
 the box 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.130
 no wonder he is brand new in 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.380
 The shelves do not bother me because he is 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.640
 good is really good he makes the lips 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.140
 scary soft I use it now 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.680
 already three weeks and I'm super 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.870
 Satisfied with the pen so grab it now 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.530
 Let's go to the next one and there we have 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.270

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.670

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.820

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.680
 stable toi toi toi 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.530

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.239
 By the way, just under 10 euros and then have 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.630

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.459

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.650
 He 's still nice and he has a lot 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.209
 interesting brush that will wrap 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.540
 there really was the name 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.040
 Twist is really fitting because I am 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.780
 strained how he then on the eyes 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.640

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.709

 complain I'm curious costume 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.380
 By the way, almost ten euros 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.810
 and there are my favorite books 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.880
 rivaldo pedro 3 1 1 mild 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.500
 cleaning towels I use scary 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.940
 like to make the first layer of makeup 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.070
 down from the face, so to speak 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.870
 filling also works well with 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.510
 normal mascara also supposedly for 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.340
 waterproof with me not so then 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.350
 we have the two feet here 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.950
 I have even shimmered that before 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.930
 empty 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.180
 I do not need this shimmer effect 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.580
 Definitely not no with my stomping 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.350
 But she does a lot of good and so 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.820
 the skin becomes nice and soft and therefore 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.770
 I liked to use them anyway 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.590
 only I need as I said this 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.780
 I do not need any shimmer effects 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.090
 who has pretty slim legs and 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.300
 summer like to run around please girls 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.160
 happy to buy recommendation and then we have 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.030
 by the way , the skin of the cuticle is the same 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.770
 also new from reval de luca and yes only 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.660
 soft cuticles if you like them then 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.290
 wants to remove and so nagl skin cream and 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.950
 You can always do it in a practical way 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:50.230
 Now we only have one vehicle left 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.389
 and that was the whole box 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.850
 So we have the story here and stingy 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.180
 the two students listen to the 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.980
 cuticle cream and then we have here 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.410
 The nail harder because of the 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.980
 cleaning cloths the lip care sticks 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.480
 mascara and a toothpaste that's what I call 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.490
 really mixed colorful 18 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.910
 nail polish remover pads we have yes 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.580
 also 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:17.020
 So I really would really say that 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.760
 mixed so I like the box I like 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.460
 above all things as I said this 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.130
 This mixture of things is very 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.350
 Interestingly, one has something for one 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.510
 the hair is made for the face 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.000
 up here the mascara one has different 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.790
 nail stuff what teeth for those 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.460
 I really like lip care 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.640
 Well mixed and the products are too 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.360
 Interesting is nothing from old and new 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.910
 products that last a bit longer 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.419
 My classics are like that 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:49.270
 seen and products are quite new 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.430
 On the shelf I think I'm well done 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.340
 yes so and now I would be interested 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.900
 how do you think the box writes me that 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.330
 please in the comments 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.020

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.020
