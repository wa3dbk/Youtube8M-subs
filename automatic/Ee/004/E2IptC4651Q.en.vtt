Mazda 3 now a blown motor mount can be
quite<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> common<00:00:09.389> problem<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:10.050> these<00:00:10.260> vehicles

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
quite a common problem in these vehicles

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.310 
quite a common problem in these vehicles
because<00:00:11.190> these<00:00:11.639> have<00:00:11.940> hydraulic<00:00:12.929> fluid<00:00:13.259> in

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
because these have hydraulic fluid in

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.350 
because these have hydraulic fluid in
them<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.130> sacks<00:00:14.370> are<00:00:14.670> someone<00:00:14.969> easy<00:00:15.150> to

um<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:19.140> easiest<00:00:19.500> way<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.770> tell<00:00:20.070> if<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
um the easiest way to tell if you have a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
um the easiest way to tell if you have a
blown<00:00:20.699> motor<00:00:20.820> mount<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.510> you'll<00:00:21.630> see

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
blown motor mount is that you'll see

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.990 
blown motor mount is that you'll see
some<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> hydraulic<00:00:23.160> fluid<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.699> side

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
some of the hydraulic fluid on the side

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.150 
some of the hydraulic fluid on the side
here<00:00:24.449> or<00:00:24.570> another<00:00:25.140> way<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.439> tell<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.890> if<00:00:26.039> you

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
here or another way to tell is if you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.040 
here or another way to tell is if you
may<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:26.340> having<00:00:26.730> some<00:00:26.910> more<00:00:26.939> vibration<00:00:27.720> inside

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
may be having some more vibration inside

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.140 
may be having some more vibration inside
your<00:00:28.740> car<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.279> that's<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.550> good<00:00:29.699> way<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.910> come

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
your car and that's a good way to come

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.560 
your car and that's a good way to come
out<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.810> check<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:32.210> these<00:00:33.210> tend<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
out and just check on it these tend to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.520 
out and just check on it these tend to
last<00:00:33.840> about<00:00:34.430> 50,000<00:00:35.430> miles<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.780> once

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
last about 50,000 miles or so so once

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.860 
last about 50,000 miles or so so once
you<00:00:37.620> fix<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.040> no<00:00:38.820> worries<00:00:39.180> you're<00:00:39.510> good<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.840> go

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
you fix it no worries you're good to go

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.900 
you fix it no worries you're good to go
for<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.260> while<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:41.160> you're<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.550> seeing<00:00:41.820> how

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
for a while if you're just in seeing how

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.389 
for a while if you're just in seeing how
we<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.329> stay<00:00:42.629> tuned<00:00:42.890> for<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> first<00:00:44.219> step

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
we do this stay tuned for the first step

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.830 
we do this stay tuned for the first step
we're<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> roll<00:00:44.940> under<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.480> remove<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
we're going to roll under and remove the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.889 
we're going to roll under and remove the
under<00:00:46.050> tray<00:00:50.180> to<00:00:51.180> remove<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.570> we're<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
under tray to remove it we're going to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.470 
under tray to remove it we're going to
unfasten<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.680> seven<00:00:53.190> bolts<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.879> hold<00:00:54.300> down

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
unfasten the seven bolts and hold down

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:09.660 
unfasten the seven bolts and hold down
the<00:00:54.629> inner<00:00:54.750> tray

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.920 

so<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.790> reason<00:01:11.060> we<00:01:11.150> removed<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.510> under<00:01:11.750> tray

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
so the reason we removed the under tray

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.440 
so the reason we removed the under tray
is<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:12.680> we<00:01:12.860> could<00:01:13.040> put<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> support<00:01:13.850> under

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
is so that we could put a support under

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.570 
is so that we could put a support under
the<00:01:14.540> engine<00:01:14.720> as<00:01:15.229> we're<00:01:15.920> removing<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.340> motor

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
the engine as we're removing the motor

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.790 
the engine as we're removing the motor
mount<00:01:16.850> now<00:01:17.659> we're<00:01:17.840> going<00:01:18.050> to<00:01:18.200> go<00:01:18.409> ahead<00:01:18.500> and

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
mount now we're going to go ahead and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.830 
mount now we're going to go ahead and
push<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:19.340> up<00:01:19.759> if<00:01:20.119> you<00:01:20.210> have<00:01:20.330> a<00:01:20.360> piece<00:01:20.540> of<00:01:20.659> wood

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
push this up if you have a piece of wood

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.230 
push this up if you have a piece of wood
that's<00:01:21.080> ideal<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:22.009> support<00:01:22.520> as<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:22.729> barrier

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
that's ideal to support as a barrier

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.430 
that's ideal to support as a barrier
between<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.810> oil<00:01:23.840> pan<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.430> lift<00:01:29.440> just

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
between the oil pan and the lift just

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.870 
between the oil pan and the lift just
some<00:01:30.649> support<00:01:31.130> it<00:01:31.280> doesn't<00:01:31.580> need<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.790> be

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
some support it doesn't need to be

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.410 
some support it doesn't need to be
lifted<00:01:32.180> very<00:01:32.360> high<00:01:33.909> now<00:01:34.909> that<00:01:35.090> we<00:01:35.149> have<00:01:35.300> the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
lifted very high now that we have the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.240 
lifted very high now that we have the
engine<00:01:35.570> safely<00:01:36.140> supported<00:01:36.590> we<00:01:36.710> can<00:01:36.860> start<00:01:37.130> the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
engine safely supported we can start the

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.639 
engine safely supported we can start the
removal<00:01:37.520> process<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.540> motor<00:01:38.720> mount<00:01:38.990> first

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
removal process of the motor mount first

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.139 
removal process of the motor mount first
we're<00:01:39.860> going<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.039> be<00:01:40.130> taking<00:01:40.460> off<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.910> coolant

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
we're going to be taking off the coolant

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.090 
we're going to be taking off the coolant
reservoir<00:01:41.530> we're<00:01:42.530> going<00:01:42.679> to<00:01:42.740> tell<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:42.979> now

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
reservoir we're going to tell you now

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.620 
reservoir we're going to tell you now
because<00:01:43.220> it's<00:01:43.520> kind<00:01:43.670> of<00:01:43.700> hard<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:43.970> film<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:44.509> in

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
because it's kind of hard to film but in

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.120 
because it's kind of hard to film but in
order<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.899> get<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.200> reservoir<00:01:45.619> off<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:45.950> have

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
order to get the reservoir off you have

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.130 
order to get the reservoir off you have
to<00:01:46.310> pull<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.640> plastic<00:01:47.149> piece<00:01:47.330> up<00:01:47.660> over<00:01:48.020> the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
now that the Mount is visible you can

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.020 
now that the Mount is visible you can
actually<00:02:27.140> see<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.920> fluid<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:28.880> was

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
actually see the fluid that I was

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.700 
actually see the fluid that I was
talking<00:02:29.150> about<00:02:29.300> earlier<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.410> definitely

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
to remove the motor mount you're going

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.780 
to remove the motor mount you're going
to<00:03:26.810> want<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.050> wiggle<00:03:27.320> it<00:03:27.530> out<00:03:27.650> of<00:03:27.830> place<00:03:28.160> but<00:03:28.610> we

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
to want to wiggle it out of place but we

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.729 
to want to wiggle it out of place but we
found<00:03:29.030> what<00:03:29.390> really<00:03:29.540> helped<00:03:29.959> us<00:03:30.110> was<00:03:30.350> pushing

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
found what really helped us was pushing

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.470 
found what really helped us was pushing
the<00:03:30.830> engine<00:03:30.980> up<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.640> little<00:03:31.880> bit<00:03:32.030> more<00:03:32.209> so

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
the engine up just a little bit more so

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.240 
the engine up just a little bit more so
that<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.690> popped<00:03:32.930> out<00:03:33.110> if<00:03:33.290> it's<00:03:33.440> kind<00:03:34.040> of<00:03:34.160> it

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
that it popped out if it's kind of it

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.770 
that it popped out if it's kind of it
was<00:03:34.340> kind<00:03:34.520> of<00:03:34.580> down<00:03:34.820> in<00:03:34.850> there<00:03:35.239> really<00:03:35.480> tight

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
was kind of down in there really tight

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.750 
was kind of down in there really tight
so<00:03:36.200> doing<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.680> really<00:03:36.980> helped<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:37.489> now<00:03:37.670> I'm

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
so doing that really helped this now I'm

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.510 
so doing that really helped this now I'm
just<00:03:37.880> going<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.260> take<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.410> on<00:03:39.680> out<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:43.370> see

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
just going to take this on out you see

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.430 
just going to take this on out you see
this<00:03:43.640> ground<00:03:44.000> wire<00:03:44.180> here<00:03:44.570> some<00:03:44.900> of<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.200> may

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
this ground wire here some of you may

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.440 
this ground wire here some of you may
actually<00:03:45.590> have<00:03:45.800> it<00:03:46.130> bolted<00:03:46.580> on<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:47.060> your<00:03:47.270> motor

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
actually have it bolted on to your motor

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.090 
actually have it bolted on to your motor
mount<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:47.930> you're<00:03:48.020> just<00:03:48.080> going<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.440> unbolt<00:03:48.830> it

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
mount so you're just going to unbolt it

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.170 
mount so you're just going to unbolt it
