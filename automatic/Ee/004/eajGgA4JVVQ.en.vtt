00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.740
 and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.700
 Hello all friends of this visit today 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.280
 let's see a very interesting topic that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.260
 is improvisation with yourself not 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.239
 because you do not have friends or is it a little 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.300
 special but because sometimes it's cool 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.300
 create a group a group a part 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.850
 repetitive and interleave that part 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.879
 with small or improvised or blix 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 that you know or in short pieces of 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.920
 sounds that fit into the 4x4 rhythm that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.260
 you are doing the pace that is for 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.710
 go integrating with the other part let's go 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.860
 to see 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.470
 first of all is to establish the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.360
 repetitive groove that we're going to play in 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.310
 my case has occurred to me that this is 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.680
 based on the oscar mint tonic in 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.340
 yes and that has very few really follows 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.340
 advancing something 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.189
 it is important that in this cross we are going 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.679
 to make it be quite marked 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.390
 algorithmic because we're not going to have a 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.250
 accompaniment are we alone and 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.899
 this is the part as rhythmic and then 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.180
 is the one of the solos but there is the part 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:38.340
 rhythmic and that's why I make a string of 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.750
 on the sixth string on the 7th fret is a 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.080
 yes and then 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.460
 he pays with his fingers and hits him 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.340
 to all the ropes 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:57.290
 so I'm already starting a pattern 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.290
 quite rhythmic then I do 5 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.140
 one 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.780
 and that again 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:30.610
 again two three and ended with fret 7 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:32.080
 39 and fret 7 I would have everything together in 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.480
 the latter would also be water 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.360
 do 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.360
 touch and suffer on the second string 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.430
 this pattern has occurred to me but 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.200
 could anyone who is in the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.370
 same hue could anyone I do not know 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.200
 That is the first one that has come to me 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.890
 the head but something that is a bit 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.700
 rhythmic 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.310
 then what is the idea to that and you 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.980
 adding phrases and I have been 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.709
 happened one that are roughly the ones that 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.870
 I have my knowledge and I'm going 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.709
 leaving these kinds of phrases mostly 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.709
 based on this book 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:21.740
 after nine we make a veil 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.930
 and then seven and seven is a link like 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.940
 start 10 which is used in very many 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.330
 topics in many blues links 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.200
 so I based that much on my 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.430
 improvisation in starts very roll 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.430
 hendrix or sting breogÃ¡n 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.209
 for example that does not touch the intro and 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.390
 it could also be very good and 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.390
 simply 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.189
 it is not even necessary and it is so far away 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:57.629
 If we are beginners we can use 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.629
 the box of the tony plant like this 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.810
 and do something very simple we can do 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.670
 to me 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.250
 and 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.820
 very important never to lose the rhythm 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.639
 so as not to lose the rhythm, I do not know if 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.070
 you are hearing 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.950
 hit on foot 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.600
 the first cruisers had a little box 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.660
 and it is still used is called 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.210
 stone box stone box is a box of 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.260
 wood to which they put touches and that 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.270
 currently some people 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.310
 amplified that is for the typical sir 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.320
 blouse or solitary has a company 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.420
 of nobody or his cat then he goes with that 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.180
 box and he accompanies himself so 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:01.110
 less having a bit of rhythm 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.630
 and already to put phrases not confused with 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.940
 the time that you do not arrive to return to 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.070
 put the phrase you pass the compass that 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.050
 never have to go through then it's better 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.320
 Initially put slow sentences 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.320
 do 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.020
 ah 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.370
 a little has to go to everyone's taste 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.080
 always inside this box I 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.950
 I highly recommend the link east of 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.950
 booty initiation 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.640
 because they always look great and 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.840
 from there you can throw things away 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:49.080
 you can make it up or pull 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.080
 down 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.639
 always kawai 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.060
 ah 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.360
 good boys I hope you have fun 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.729
 playing this kind of groups with liz and 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.560
 they are on you is a very funny way 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.840
 to play if you're alone or if you just 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.090
 you want to have fun with your guitar and 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.300
 remember that on our website we have a 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.280
 course of blues and lix improvisation in the 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.030
 blues field that maybe I can 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.440
 interest 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.440
 keep an eye on you see you
