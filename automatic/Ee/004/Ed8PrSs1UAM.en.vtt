can<00:01:13.530> blow<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.710> candles<00:01:13.890> by<00:01:14.670> jumping<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
can blow out candles by jumping and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.399 
can blow out candles by jumping and
doing<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.530> few<00:01:16.890> Isis<00:01:17.460> that's<00:01:17.850> why<00:01:18.409> there's

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
doing that a few Isis that's why there's

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.830 
doing that a few Isis that's why there's
much<00:01:19.680> easier<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.369> jump<00:01:20.580> them<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
much easier to jump them and so you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.920 
much easier to jump them and so you
don't<00:01:25.680> need<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.159> brave<00:01:26.610> pieces<00:01:27.119> so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
don't need these little brave pieces so

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.130 
don't need these little brave pieces so
this<00:01:28.200> stuff<00:01:28.729> because<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:30.540> don't<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:30.900> do

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
this stuff because they don't really do

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.120 
this stuff because they don't really do
anything<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.400> smash<00:01:35.759> objects<00:01:36.570> like

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
anything and you can smash objects like

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.330 
anything and you can smash objects like
bosses<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.909> might<00:01:39.180> need<00:01:39.329> backup<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.930> why

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
bosses like I might need backup and why

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.510 
bosses like I might need backup and why
right<00:01:42.079> what<00:01:43.079> stuff<00:01:44.960> don't<00:01:45.960> touch<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.950> stores
