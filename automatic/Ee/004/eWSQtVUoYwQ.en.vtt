00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
old ones so much more detail and you do

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.950 
old ones so much more detail and you do
get<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.860> face<00:03:22.310> which<00:03:22.610> is<00:03:22.640> black<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.810> then<00:03:23.930> you

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
get a face which is black and then you

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.370 
get a face which is black and then you
see<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:25.190> regular<00:03:25.580> person's<00:03:26.180> face<00:03:26.660> in<00:03:26.960> there

heads or something really cool and again

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.400 
heads or something really cool and again
that<00:03:36.800> detail<00:03:37.250> on<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.490> torso<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:38.030> just

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
that detail on that torso is just

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.380 
that detail on that torso is just
phenomenal<00:03:39.410> oh<00:03:41.020> and<00:03:42.020> on<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.620> back<00:03:42.920> there<00:03:43.390> it's

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
phenomenal oh and on the back there it's

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.040 
phenomenal oh and on the back there it's
very<00:03:44.720> similar<00:03:45.050> to<00:03:45.380> just<00:03:45.590> regular<00:03:45.800> Chrome<00:03:46.280> or

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
very similar to just regular Chrome or

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.230 
very similar to just regular Chrome or
printing<00:03:48.050> on<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:49.070> back<00:03:49.220> of<00:03:49.460> the<00:03:49.580> torso<00:03:49.790> and

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
printing on the back of the torso and

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.600 
printing on the back of the torso and
then<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.170> helmet<00:03:51.350> spray<00:03:51.710> generic<00:03:52.190> I'll<00:03:52.310> think

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
then the helmet spray generic I'll think

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.540 
then the helmet spray generic I'll think
there's<00:03:53.240> little<00:03:53.540> if<00:03:53.720> any<00:03:53.870> changes<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.560> but

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
there's little if any changes to it but

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.640 
there's little if any changes to it but
it's<00:03:55.760> still<00:03:56.390> a<00:03:56.540> pretty<00:03:56.720> cool<00:03:56.990> design<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.590> he

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
it's still a pretty cool design and he

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.140 
it's still a pretty cool design and he
comes<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:58.010> regular<00:03:58.370> short<00:03:58.850> blaster<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:01.220> our

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
comes the regular short blaster and our

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.400 
comes the regular short blaster and our
next<00:04:02.300> minifig<00:04:02.780> is<00:04:02.960> the<00:04:03.170> scout<00:04:03.590> trooper<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.280> I

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
next minifig is the scout trooper and I

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.050 
next minifig is the scout trooper and I
believe<00:04:06.410> there's<00:04:06.740> been<00:04:06.980> no<00:04:07.310> changes<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.850> the

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
believe there's been no changes to the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.670 
believe there's been no changes to the
torso

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
torso

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.760

to my knowledge to the older ones from
the<00:04:12.920> older<00:04:13.130> ones<00:04:13.310> there's<00:04:13.490> been<00:04:13.730> no<00:04:13.880> change

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
the older ones there's been no change

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.610 
the older ones there's been no change
but<00:04:14.540> it's<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.900> great<00:04:15.290> torso<00:04:15.830> still<00:04:17.440> this<00:04:18.440> is

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
tree structure so if you're building

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.960 
tree structure so if you're building
like<00:05:41.420> a<00:05:41.840> chic<00:05:42.140> MOC<00:05:42.410> or<00:05:42.590> an<00:05:42.650> end<00:05:42.800> or<00:05:42.980> mock<00:05:43.220> or<00:05:43.820> any

type<00:05:44.150> of<00:05:44.180> forest<00:05:44.870> MOC<00:05:45.200> you<00:05:45.890> get<00:05:46.100> this<00:05:46.760> pretty

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
type of forest MOC you get this pretty

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.810 
type of forest MOC you get this pretty
cool<00:05:47.240> mini<00:05:47.690> tree<00:05:48.100> which<00:05:49.100> is<00:05:49.250> great<00:05:49.490> if<00:05:49.610> you<00:05:49.700> get

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
cool mini tree which is great if you get

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.180 
cool mini tree which is great if you get
a<00:05:49.850> ton<00:05:50.090> of<00:05:50.120> these<00:05:50.300> battlepacks

a ton of these battlepacks

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.410 
a ton of these battlepacks
especially<00:05:52.190> if<00:05:52.280> you're<00:05:52.370> building<00:05:52.520> a<00:05:52.790> war<00:05:53.180> MOC

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
especially if you're building a war MOC

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.410 
especially if you're building a war MOC
in<00:05:53.660> a<00:05:53.810> forest<00:05:54.320> because<00:05:54.680> you<00:05:54.800> get<00:05:54.980> two<00:05:55.640> soldiers

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
in a forest because you get two soldiers

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.560 
in a forest because you get two soldiers
and<00:05:57.190> then<00:05:58.190> a<00:05:58.220> tree<00:05:58.640> and<00:05:58.940> then<00:05:59.360> a<00:05:59.390> little

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
and then a tree and then a little

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.350 
and then a tree and then a little
outpost<00:05:59.870> I<00:06:00.260> guess<00:06:00.410> you<00:06:00.530> could<00:06:00.680> say<00:06:01.150> this<00:06:02.150> is

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
outpost I guess you could say this is

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.000 
outpost I guess you could say this is
just<00:06:02.600> a<00:06:02.660> little<00:06:02.840> turret<00:06:03.260> oh<00:06:03.410> this<00:06:03.770> looks<00:06:03.980> like

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
just a little turret oh this looks like

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.500 
just a little turret oh this looks like
the<00:06:04.250> aiming<00:06:04.640> device<00:06:04.940> or<00:06:05.120> something<00:06:05.330> right

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
the aiming device or something right

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.740 
the aiming device or something right
here<00:06:05.750> and<00:06:06.520> then<00:06:07.520> just<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.940> flick<00:06:08.210> fired<00:06:08.420> missile

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
here and then just a flick fired missile

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.980 
here and then just a flick fired missile
which<00:06:09.170> I'm<00:06:09.350> fine<00:06:09.530> with

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
which I'm fine with

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.550 
which I'm fine with
we<00:06:11.990> can<00:06:12.170> flick<00:06:12.950> it<00:06:13.070> off<00:06:13.190> of<00:06:13.370> there<00:06:13.490> there<00:06:13.910> we<00:06:14.560> go

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
we can flick it off of there there we go

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.120 
we can flick it off of there there we go
perfect<00:06:16.660> so<00:06:17.660> that's<00:06:17.750> it<00:06:17.990> for<00:06:18.170> the<00:06:18.290> little<00:06:18.410> base

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
perfect so that's it for the little base

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.390 
perfect so that's it for the little base
but<00:06:19.520> still<00:06:19.820> it's<00:06:19.940> pretty<00:06:20.090> cool<00:06:20.860> again<00:06:21.860> perfect

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
but still it's pretty cool again perfect

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.820 
but still it's pretty cool again perfect
for<00:06:22.460> making<00:06:22.760> forest<00:06:23.390> mocks<00:06:23.690> and<00:06:24.020> you<00:06:24.500> can<00:06:24.650> put

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
for making forest mocks and you can put

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.280 
for making forest mocks and you can put
a<00:06:24.860> minifig<00:06:25.220> back<00:06:25.580> there<00:06:26.110> you<00:06:27.110> can<00:06:27.230> probably

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.290 
a minifig back there you can probably

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.060 
a minifig back there you can probably
even<00:06:27.530> fit<00:06:27.890> two<00:06:28.960> you<00:06:29.960> kind<00:06:30.590> of<00:06:30.680> stuff<00:06:30.860> them<00:06:30.980> in

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
even fit two you kind of stuff them in

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.920 
even fit two you kind of stuff them in
there

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
there
