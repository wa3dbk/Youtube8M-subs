day six of the velomobile build past

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.419 
day six of the velomobile build past
three<00:00:09.929> days<00:00:10.170> we've<00:00:10.559> been<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:10.889> here

we've<00:00:12.420> been<00:00:12.840> remaking<00:00:13.549> fork<00:00:14.549> tubes<00:00:15.289> since<00:00:16.289> I

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
we've been remaking fork tubes since I

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.160 
we've been remaking fork tubes since I
can't<00:00:17.010> weld<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.600> actually<00:00:18.690> talked<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
can't weld and I actually talked to a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.349 
can't weld and I actually talked to a
professional<00:00:19.500> who's<00:00:20.189> told<00:00:20.580> me<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.820> my

professional who's told me that my
welder<00:00:21.840> flux<00:00:22.439> core<00:00:22.970> was<00:00:24.949> too<00:00:25.949> much<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.849> this

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
welder flux core was too much for this

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.659 
welder flux core was too much for this
steel<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.869> today<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.199> had<00:00:31.529> one<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.890> family

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
friends go in and professionally weld

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.200 
friends go in and professionally weld
our<00:00:36.079> fork<00:00:37.079> tubes<00:00:37.579> with<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.840> big<00:00:39.840> MIG<00:00:40.350> welder

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
our fork tubes with a big MIG welder

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.350 
our fork tubes with a big MIG welder
came<00:00:42.210> out<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.570> nice<00:00:44.120> definitely<00:00:45.120> trust

came out really nice definitely trust

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.490 
came out really nice definitely trust
these<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.340> first<00:00:47.340> part<00:00:47.579> fork<00:00:48.239> tubes

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
these so first part fork tubes

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.160 
these so first part fork tubes
officially<00:00:49.500> done<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.719> we're<00:00:51.930> gonna<00:00:51.989> be

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
officially done and so we're gonna be

officially done and so we're gonna be
making<00:00:52.320> more<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:53.160> parts<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.329> next<00:00:54.750> week

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
making more more parts and next week

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.889 
making more more parts and next week
he's<00:00:55.440> gonna<00:00:55.559> come<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.890> again<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.600> weld<00:00:57.600> them

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
he's gonna come in again and weld them

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.569 
he's gonna come in again and weld them
for<00:00:58.230> us<00:00:58.410> and<00:01:00.350> hopefully<00:01:01.350> within<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> couple

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
for us and hopefully within a couple

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.810 
for us and hopefully within a couple
weeks<00:01:03.619> should<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.100> frame<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.670> bike

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
weeks should have the frame of the bike

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.980 
weeks should have the frame of the bike
done<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:07.549> then<00:01:08.549> after<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.479> start<00:01:09.810> on

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
done and then after that we can start on

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:28.360 
done and then after that we can start on
the<00:01:10.080> fiberglassing

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.620 

and<00:01:30.500> here's<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:32.580> bracket<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.090> got<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.510> it

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and here's the bracket we got out of it

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.830 
and here's the bracket we got out of it
for<00:01:33.810> their<00:01:33.930> rear<00:01:34.140> dropouts<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.730> gotta<00:01:35.940> send

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
for their rear dropouts so I gotta send

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.790 
for their rear dropouts so I gotta send
it<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> grind<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.620> down<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> line<00:01:39.800> and

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
it to grind that down to the line and

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.530 
it to grind that down to the line and
then<00:01:41.130> we'll<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.760> of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> rear<00:01:42.120> brackets

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
then we'll have one of the rear brackets

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:52.800 
then we'll have one of the rear brackets
and<00:01:43.440> then<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.770> keep<00:01:43.890> going

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.969 

we<00:01:53.440> came<00:01:53.860> out<00:01:54.040> with<00:01:54.280> after<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.729> grinding<00:01:55.979> much

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
we came out with after the grinding much

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.539 
we came out with after the grinding much
better

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:05.980 

they're<00:02:05.180> gonna<00:02:05.270> mount<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.600> rear<00:02:05.750> wheels

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
they're gonna mount the rear wheels

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.990 
they're gonna mount the rear wheels
still<00:02:06.619> day<00:02:06.920> six<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.610> velomobile<00:02:08.300> build<00:02:08.989> I

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
still day six the velomobile build I

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.089 
still day six the velomobile build I
showed<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.120> before<00:02:11.209> we<00:02:11.720> finished<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.349> bees

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
showed you before we finished the bees

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.979 
showed you before we finished the bees
except<00:02:13.610> for<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.819> end<00:02:13.970> caps<00:02:14.209> which<00:02:14.569> we'll<00:02:14.780> do

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
except for the end caps which we'll do

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.699 
except for the end caps which we'll do
later<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:17.180> also<00:02:17.330> finished<00:02:17.599> this<00:02:18.110> seat<00:02:18.920> tube

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
later we also finished this seat tube

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.110 
later we also finished this seat tube
we're<00:02:21.709> just<00:02:21.860> right<00:02:22.400> now<00:02:22.550> we're<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:22.819> fitting

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
we're just right now we're just fitting

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.290 
we're just right now we're just fitting
it<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.330> see<00:02:23.420> how<00:02:23.510> about<00:02:23.750> how<00:02:23.900> big<00:02:24.140> could<00:02:24.260> be<00:02:25.300> so

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
it to see how about how big could be so

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.839 
it to see how about how big could be so
you<00:02:26.360> cut<00:02:26.660> those<00:02:26.840> angles<00:02:27.260> in<00:02:27.440> there<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:29.140> then

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
you cut those angles in there and then

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.350 
you cut those angles in there and then
45-degree<00:02:32.769> fit<00:02:33.769> down<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.910> we're<00:02:35.060> trying<00:02:35.269> to

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
45-degree fit down and we're trying to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.590 
45-degree fit down and we're trying to
get<00:02:35.420> an<00:02:35.540> idea<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.050> length<00:02:36.260> right<00:02:36.650> now

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
get an idea of the length right now

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.940 
get an idea of the length right now
she's<00:02:38.600> wide<00:02:38.810> sit<00:02:39.049> up<00:02:39.170> like<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.739> we

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
she's wide sit up like this and we

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.500 
she's wide sit up like this and we
figured<00:02:40.430> it's<00:02:40.580> gonna<00:02:40.700> be<00:02:40.910> about<00:02:41.290> nine<00:02:42.290> foot<00:02:42.709> to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
figured it's gonna be about nine foot to

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.050 
figured it's gonna be about nine foot to
nine<00:02:44.510> feet<00:02:44.870> two<00:02:45.019> inches<00:02:45.049> long<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:46.910> is

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
nine feet two inches long so this is

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.190 
nine feet two inches long so this is
just<00:02:47.299> the<00:02:47.420> inside<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.900> frame<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:50.200> just

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
just the inside of the frame and just

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.199 
just the inside of the frame and just
trying<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.040> get<00:02:52.160> an<00:02:52.220> idea<00:02:52.519> of<00:02:52.610> how<00:02:52.850> big<00:02:53.030> the

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
trying to get an idea of how big the

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.350 
trying to get an idea of how big the
shell<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.110> gonna<00:02:54.230> be<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:56.560> as<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.680> can<00:02:57.799> see

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
shell is gonna be and as you can see

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.080 
shell is gonna be and as you can see
here<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.510> diagram<00:03:00.110> where<00:03:00.790> frames<00:03:01.790> gonna<00:03:02.000> be

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
here you a diagram where frames gonna be

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.520 
here you a diagram where frames gonna be
written<00:03:02.299> up<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.660> little<00:03:02.810> bit<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.140> there's<00:03:03.319> like

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
written up a little bit and there's like

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.339 
written up a little bit and there's like
a<00:03:03.769> couple<00:03:04.069> of<00:03:04.099> angles<00:03:04.549> in<00:03:04.730> there<00:03:04.940> which

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
a couple of angles in there which

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.240 
a couple of angles in there which
haven't<00:03:06.349> made<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.500> because<00:03:06.769> we<00:03:06.980> do<00:03:07.069> not<00:03:07.160> have

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
haven't made that because we do not have

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.870 
haven't made that because we do not have
this<00:03:07.459> rear<00:03:07.700> wheel<00:03:08.470> but<00:03:09.470> as<00:03:10.130> you<00:03:10.340> can<00:03:10.430> see<00:03:10.489> there

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
this rear wheel but as you can see there

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.160 
this rear wheel but as you can see there
corks<00:03:11.600> goes<00:03:12.350> down<00:03:14.380> your<00:03:15.380> horse<00:03:15.650> goes<00:03:15.950> down<00:03:17.170> and

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
corks goes down your horse goes down and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.979 
corks goes down your horse goes down and
then<00:03:18.950> this<00:03:19.519> these<00:03:20.299> are<00:03:20.450> two<00:03:20.570> different<00:03:20.690> pieces

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
then this these are two different pieces

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.180 
then this these are two different pieces
that's<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.590> piece<00:03:21.850> which<00:03:22.850> is<00:03:22.970> right<00:03:24.190> there

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
that's the piece which is right there

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.340 
that's the piece which is right there
and<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.459> picture<00:03:26.299> just<00:03:26.420> took<00:03:26.630> off<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:27.109> that

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
and the picture just took off is that

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.650 
and the picture just took off is that
one<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.799> that<00:03:27.859> one<00:03:28.459> is<00:03:29.030> definitely<00:03:29.299> longer

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
one and that one is definitely longer

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.550 
one and that one is definitely longer
than<00:03:29.930> 24<00:03:30.380> inches<00:03:30.620> it's<00:03:30.769> actually<00:03:31.040> 44<00:03:31.790> inches

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
than 24 inches it's actually 44 inches

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.080 
than 24 inches it's actually 44 inches
