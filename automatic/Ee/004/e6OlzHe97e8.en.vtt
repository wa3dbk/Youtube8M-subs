00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
off this is just a beautiful spot and if

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.649 
off this is just a beautiful spot and if
they<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> diffuse<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:18.390> autumn

they do go for the diffuse the autumn
right<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.610> also<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> think<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:20.970> worth

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
right there also I think it's worth

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.210 
right there also I think it's worth
mentioning<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.439> are<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.009> side

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
mentioning that if they are on the side

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.640 
mentioning that if they are on the side
and<00:01:23.250> they<00:01:23.580> try<00:01:23.850> not<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.720> seen<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.350> guess<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and they try not to be seen I guess you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.960 
and they try not to be seen I guess you
could<00:01:25.680> say<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.189> there<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> left<00:01:26.759> or<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
could say and there on the left or the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.730

right<00:01:27.030> way<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.420> can't<00:01:27.689> see<00:01:27.840> them<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.290> you

you could say just the left side of the
bomb

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
bomb

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.420
