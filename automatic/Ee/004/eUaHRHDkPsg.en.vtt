small<00:02:08.610> amazing<00:02:09.119> they<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.300> one<00:02:09.539> gram<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.810> carb

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
small amazing they have one gram of carb

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.530 
small amazing they have one gram of carb
and<00:02:10.380> carb<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.009> yeah<00:02:11.580> which<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.060> part<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and carb so yeah which is part of the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.390 
and carb so yeah which is part of the
