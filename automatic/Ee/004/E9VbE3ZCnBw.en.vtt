00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.410
 Here such a court and the next chord will be 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.020
 a-d major 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.750

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:40.380
 chords for this song let's go to battle 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.169
 played closer to the thug he in my 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:48.479
 opinion most approached this song 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:51.720
 the song is a comic look means on the chord 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.110
 in d minor on this example i will tell you 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.510
 Now on the example of this chord 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:02.580
 bass string is played 4 5 I'm already about 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:07.490
 this said means bases and down the stub 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:17.840
 do further 2 base note is played 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:17.840
 5 strings playing up and down first 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:33.250
 Look here depending on how 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:38.470
 the duration of a chord will be possible 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:48.490
 play immediately with a stub all the time or 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:52.030
 do not leave strangers if not 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:56.360
 jamming the strings we get so you 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:59.180
 down stub with then second bass 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.990
 and we are not jamming the strings next bass 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.990
 play again all over again 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:17.630
 so we can do it 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:23.050
 one by one 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:25.400
 like the whole song 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.680
 I wish you all success 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.330
 get a cool song 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.330
 all success for now
