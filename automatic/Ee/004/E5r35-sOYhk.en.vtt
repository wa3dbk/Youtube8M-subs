plate and you can check out and I an

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.340 
plate and you can check out and I an
edit<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.130> identity<00:01:50.579> plate<00:01:50.880> right<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:51.689> in

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
edit that identity plate right here in

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.760 
edit that identity plate right here in
the<00:01:53.100> identity<00:01:53.520> plate<00:01:53.790> editor<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> sometimes

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
the identity plate editor so sometimes

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.499 
the identity plate editor so sometimes
getting<00:01:55.950> multiple<00:01:56.369> lines<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.790> difficult<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.479> I

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
getting multiple lines is difficult so I

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.910 
getting multiple lines is difficult so I
always<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:57.990> take<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.439> from<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.770> word

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
always just take it in from a word

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.190 
always just take it in from a word
processor<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.820> get<00:01:59.939> multiple<00:02:00.210> lines<00:02:00.689> for<00:02:01.049> my

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
processor to get multiple lines for my

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.800 
processor to get multiple lines for my
slideshow<00:02:01.860> introductory<00:02:02.520> screens<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.360> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
slideshow introductory screens and I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.620 
slideshow introductory screens and I
just<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> copy<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.770> paste<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.420> case

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
just do a copy and paste so in this case

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.969 
just do a copy and paste so in this case
the<00:02:06.869> disappearing<00:02:07.320> American<00:02:07.680> landscape

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979

the title information there's a little

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.590 
the title information there's a little
piece<00:02:35.990> down<00:02:36.230> here<00:02:36.530> called<00:02:36.770> ABC<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:38.420> if<00:02:38.510> you

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
piece down here called ABC and if you

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.140 
piece down here called ABC and if you
click<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.230> there<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.340> pulldown<00:02:40.760> menu

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
click on it there is a pulldown menu

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.940 
click on it there is a pulldown menu
right<00:02:41.360> here<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.380> can<00:02:42.530> insert

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
right here and you can insert

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.310 
right here and you can insert
information<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.540> this<00:02:44.630> case<00:02:44.840> here<00:02:45.140> let's

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
information so in this case here let's

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.610 
information so in this case here let's
go<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.500> edit<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:47.230> basically<00:02:48.230> instead<00:02:48.530> of

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
go to edit and basically instead of

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.830 
go to edit and basically instead of
adding<00:02:48.920> custom<00:02:49.190> text<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:50.300> would<00:02:50.450> appear<00:02:50.750> in

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
adding custom text that would appear in

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.080 
adding custom text that would appear in
every<00:02:50.959> slide<00:02:51.350> I'd<00:02:51.560> like<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:51.920> hook<00:02:52.130> into<00:02:52.580> that

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
every slide I'd like to hook into that

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.000 
every slide I'd like to hook into that
iptc<00:02:53.720> data<00:02:54.170> individually<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.220> each<00:02:55.280> slide<00:02:57.010> so

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
iptc data individually for each slide so

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.440 
iptc data individually for each slide so
I'm<00:02:58.070> going<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.250> move<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.670> title<00:02:59.090> rather

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
I'm going to move to the title rather

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.970 
I'm going to move to the title rather
than<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.780> caption<00:03:00.230> information<00:03:00.800> because

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
than the caption information because

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.530 
than the caption information because
that's<00:03:01.160> where<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.370> inserted<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.970> information

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
that's where I inserted the information

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.190 
that's where I inserted the information
in<00:03:02.630> metadata<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.440> say<00:03:04.340> insert<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.330> then<00:03:05.360> I

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
in metadata and say insert and then I

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.250 
in metadata and say insert and then I
would<00:03:06.350> save<00:03:06.709> that<00:03:06.980> as<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.190> title<00:03:08.030> field<00:03:08.540> so

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
would save that as a title field so

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.570 
would save that as a title field so
you're<00:03:09.410> going<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.560> hit<00:03:09.830> save<00:03:10.280> current

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
you're going to hit save current

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.449 
you're going to hit save current
