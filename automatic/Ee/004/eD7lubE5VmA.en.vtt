00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
so now we're gonna set up the radio now

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.430 
so now we're gonna set up the radio now
I<00:00:08.610> just<00:00:08.790> have<00:00:09.120> my<00:00:09.300> battery<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:10.019> isn't<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:10.410> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
I just have my battery this isn't in the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.350 
I just have my battery this isn't in the
same<00:00:10.650> battery<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.340> recommended<00:00:11.910> from<00:00:12.150> our

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
same battery that I recommended from our

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.270 
same battery that I recommended from our
seafoam<00:00:12.690> calm<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.259> it's<00:00:13.380> very<00:00:13.500> similar<00:00:13.950> I'm

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
seafoam calm but it's very similar I'm

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.369 
seafoam calm but it's very similar I'm
gonna<00:00:14.460> be<00:00:14.549> using<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.910> battery<00:00:15.330> one<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
gonna be using this battery one of the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.230 
gonna be using this battery one of the
only<00:00:16.710> differences<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.369> it's<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.699> little<00:00:18.060> bit

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
only differences is it's a little bit

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.210 
only differences is it's a little bit
heavier<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.650> not<00:00:19.770> gonna<00:00:19.859> make<00:00:20.010> too<00:00:20.130> much

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
heavier so it's not gonna make too much

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.800 
heavier so it's not gonna make too much
of<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.430> difference<00:00:20.520> from<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:21.119> I'm<00:00:21.240> doing<00:00:21.600> from

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
of a difference from what I'm doing from

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.570 
of a difference from what I'm doing from
what<00:00:21.930> you're<00:00:22.080> doing<00:00:22.320> if<00:00:22.890> you're<00:00:23.070> using<00:00:23.340> that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
what you're doing if you're using that

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.790 
what you're doing if you're using that
recommended<00:00:24.060> battery<00:00:24.410> you<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.529> want<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> use

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
recommended battery you just want to use

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.200 
recommended battery you just want to use
a<00:00:25.830> two<00:00:26.010> cell<00:00:26.220> not<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> three<00:00:26.640> cell<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.090> when

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
a two cell not a three cell so when

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.179 
a two cell not a three cell so when
you're<00:00:27.330> setting<00:00:27.570> up<00:00:27.630> your<00:00:27.810> radio<00:00:28.019> I'm<00:00:28.980> not

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
you're setting up your radio I'm not

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.200 
you're setting up your radio I'm not
gonna<00:00:29.340> tell<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.609> how<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.090> because

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
gonna tell you how to do that because

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.609 
gonna tell you how to do that because
everyone<00:00:30.599> has<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> different<00:00:30.840> kind<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.289> radio

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
everyone has a different kind of radio

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.810 
everyone has a different kind of radio
um<00:00:32.149> basically<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.390> want<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.820> your

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
um basically you want it so that your

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.549 
um basically you want it so that your
elevator<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.719> with<00:00:36.870> dual<00:00:37.020> rates<00:00:37.320> off

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
elevator this is with dual rates off

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.220 
elevator this is with dual rates off
right<00:00:37.829> now<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.360> my<00:00:39.360> control<00:00:39.690> services<00:00:40.079> are

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
right now so my control services are

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.830 
right now so my control services are
moving<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> most<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.540> that's<00:00:42.540> up

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
moving the most that they can that's up

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.630 
moving the most that they can that's up
elevator<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.530> down<00:00:43.680> elevator<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.370> see<00:00:44.520> how

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
elevator and down elevator you see how

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.500 
elevator and down elevator you see how
much<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.000> moving

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
much it's moving

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.119 
much it's moving
and<00:00:45.690> that's<00:00:46.500> turn<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
and that's turn right there now so you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.560 
and that's turn right there now so you
don't<00:00:50.430> want<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.879> that's<00:00:51.180> actually

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
don't want to have it that's actually

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
don't want to have it that's actually
moving<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.079> ton<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.010> that'll<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.399> if<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.640> want<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
moving a ton so that'll be if I want to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
moving a ton so that'll be if I want to
do<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.180> super<00:00:54.570> air<00:00:54.750> acrobatic<00:00:55.500> flight<00:00:55.710> or

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
do like super air acrobatic flight or

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.860 
do like super air acrobatic flight or
something<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.850> my<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.239> how<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> should

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
something but my know how I should

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.229 
something but my know how I should
normally<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.410> flying<00:00:58.770> they<00:00:59.670> only<00:00:59.820> move<00:01:00.059> this

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
normally be flying they only move this

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.930 
normally be flying they only move this
much<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.199> that's<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.129> dual<00:01:02.340> rates<00:01:02.640> on

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
much you see that that's a dual rates on

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.910 
much you see that that's a dual rates on
so<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.420> wanna<00:01:03.809> set<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.559> they<00:01:04.680> move

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
so you wanna set it up so they move

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.760 
so you wanna set it up so they move
about<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.309> much<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.049> course<00:01:07.320> follow<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
about that much and of course follow the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.250 
about that much and of course follow the
rule<00:01:07.890> where<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.490> you're<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
rule where if you're like they have the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.649 
rule where if you're like they have the
control<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.920> controller<00:01:11.340> facing<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.510> same

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
control the controller facing the same

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.630 
control the controller facing the same
way<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> face<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.650> planes<00:01:13.979> facing<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.580> you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
way the face the planes facing and you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.660 
way the face the planes facing and you
move<00:01:14.790> over<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.479> far<00:01:16.259> Elavon<00:01:17.040> should<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.400> up

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
move over that far Elavon should go up

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.969 
move over that far Elavon should go up
right<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:19.200> when<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.409> pull<00:01:19.619> down<00:01:19.650> on

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
right and then when you pull down on

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.280 
right and then when you pull down on
your<00:01:20.159> stick<00:01:20.430> both<00:01:21.030> those<00:01:21.330> should<00:01:21.600> go<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
your stick both those should go up and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.749 
your stick both those should go up and
then<00:01:23.630> yes<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:25.259> make<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
then yes just make it like that and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.910 
then yes just make it like that and
another<00:01:27.180> thing<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:28.259> pay<00:01:28.500> attention<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
another thing to really pay attention to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.190 
another thing to really pay attention to
on<00:01:29.070> Delta<00:01:29.310> wings<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.390> move<00:01:30.540> your<00:01:30.780> stick

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
on Delta wings is if you move your stick

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.190 
on Delta wings is if you move your stick
like<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.890> that's<00:01:32.790> moving<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.720> servo<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
like this that's moving that servo to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.760 
like this that's moving that servo to
its<00:01:34.470> fullest<00:01:35.100> extent<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.790> notice<00:01:36.570> how<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:37.259> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
its fullest extent and notice how if you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.069 
its fullest extent and notice how if you
listen<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.909> can't<00:01:39.180> hear<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.509> servo<00:01:39.840> under

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
listen you can't hear that servo under

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:40.940 
listen you can't hear that servo under
strain<00:01:40.439> at<00:01:40.619> all

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
strain at all

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.460 
strain at all
so<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.520> servo<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.119> pulling<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.290> no

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
so that servo is pulling that up with no

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.389 
so that servo is pulling that up with no
problem<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.240> good<00:01:45.869> um

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
problem like that so that's good um

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.010 
problem like that so that's good um
that's<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.729> course<00:01:47.880> way<00:01:48.119> too<00:01:48.180> much<00:01:48.420> throw<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
that's of course way too much throw and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
that's of course way too much throw and
then<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.259> did<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.820> servo

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
then if I did to this one that servo

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.760 
then if I did to this one that servo
isn't<00:01:51.420> under<00:01:51.630> stress<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.259> your<00:01:52.380> servos

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
isn't under stress so if your servos

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.380 
isn't under stress so if your servos
under<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> lot<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.280> stress<00:01:53.700> when<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.149> up<00:01:54.299> like

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
under a lot of stress when it's up like

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.380 
under a lot of stress when it's up like
that<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:55.079> its<00:01:55.710> fullest<00:01:56.130> extent<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:57.270> you're

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
that at its fullest extent then you're

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.080 
that at its fullest extent then you're
gonna<00:01:57.509> want<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.810> dial<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.170> down<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.409> lot<00:01:59.030> now<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
gonna want to dial it down a lot now you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.370 
gonna want to dial it down a lot now you
can<00:02:00.329> hear<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:00.630> under<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:01.170> bit<00:02:01.290> of

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
can hear it's under a little bit of

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.550 
can hear it's under a little bit of
stress<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:01.979> still<00:02:02.189> fine<00:02:02.490> aren't<00:02:02.880> that

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
stress but it's still fine aren't that

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.920 
stress but it's still fine aren't that
and<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:04.220> one<00:02:04.400> too<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.180> it's<00:02:05.420> not<00:02:05.479> too<00:02:05.690> bad

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
and that one too so it's not too bad

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.169 
and that one too so it's not too bad
it'll<00:02:06.140> go<00:02:06.500> it'll<00:02:07.040> go<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.549> fullest<00:02:07.940> extent

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
it'll go it'll go to the fullest extent

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.790 
it'll go it'll go to the fullest extent
without<00:02:08.390> breaking<00:02:09.050> anything<00:02:09.259> that's<00:02:09.619> just

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
without breaking anything that's just

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.670 
without breaking anything that's just
what<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.160> want<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.369> make<00:02:10.550> sure<00:02:10.990> so<00:02:11.990> they'll

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
what you want to make sure so they'll

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.220 
what you want to make sure so they'll
move<00:02:12.890> all<00:02:13.100> around<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.760> my<00:02:13.819> dual<00:02:14.090> rates<00:02:14.300> move

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
move all around and my dual rates move

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.590 
move all around and my dual rates move
all<00:02:15.350> around<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.740> little<00:02:15.890> bit<00:02:16.240> my<00:02:17.240> dual<00:02:17.450> rates

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
all around a little bit my dual rates

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.140 
all around a little bit my dual rates
again<00:02:17.840> we've<00:02:18.050> done<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.470> lot<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.430> then<00:02:19.940> for

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
again we've done a lot so and then for

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.970 
again we've done a lot so and then for
the<00:02:20.239> throttle<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.870> mean<00:02:21.200> from<00:02:21.319> my<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> camera

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
the throttle I mean from my a camera

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.180 
the throttle I mean from my a camera
down<00:02:22.180> here's<00:02:23.180> my<00:02:23.750> propeller<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.560> it's<00:02:24.980> pretty

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
down here's my propeller and it's pretty

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.059 
down here's my propeller and it's pretty
smooth<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.850> can<00:02:25.910> listen<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:30.050> it's<00:02:30.350> powerful

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
smooth you can listen so it's powerful

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.460 
smooth you can listen so it's powerful
and<00:02:31.430> smooth<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.300> once<00:02:32.540> again<00:02:32.690> if<00:02:33.080> your<00:02:33.260> motor

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
and smooth and once again if your motor

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.820 
and smooth and once again if your motor
spins<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.430> wrong<00:02:34.670> way<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:36.290> if<00:02:36.410> it's<00:02:36.560> pushing

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
spins the wrong way so if it's pushing

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.530 
spins the wrong way so if it's pushing
the<00:02:36.950> plane<00:02:37.160> backwards<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.850> just<00:02:37.880> reverse<00:02:38.300> two

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the plane backwards and just reverse two

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.449 
the plane backwards and just reverse two
of<00:02:38.660> those<00:02:38.780> wires<00:02:39.019> just<00:02:39.470> whips<00:02:40.900> whip<00:02:41.900> or<00:02:42.459> change

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
of those wires just whips whip or change

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.910 
of those wires just whips whip or change
any<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.880> one<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.180> them<00:02:44.360> now<00:02:44.930> center<00:02:45.350> of<00:02:45.500> gravity

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
any to one of them now center of gravity

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.100 
any to one of them now center of gravity
wise<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.430> just<00:02:46.580> have<00:02:46.700> my<00:02:46.820> battery<00:02:47.239> on<00:02:47.450> there

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
wise I just have my battery on there

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.559 
wise I just have my battery on there
because<00:02:48.800> I'm<00:02:49.100> gonna<00:02:49.310> take<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.670> out<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.060> guess<00:02:50.450> to

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
because I'm gonna take it out I guess to

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.729 
because I'm gonna take it out I guess to
the<00:02:50.660> center<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:50.959> gravity<00:02:51.290> is<00:02:51.350> about<00:02:51.530> right

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
the center of gravity is about right

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.110 
the center of gravity is about right
here<00:02:51.890> but<00:02:52.040> I'm<00:02:52.100> gonna<00:02:52.250> take<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.580> out<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.880> make

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
here but I'm gonna take it out and make

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.830 
here but I'm gonna take it out and make
sure<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.569> that

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
sure of that

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.600 
sure of that
and<00:02:54.110> then<00:02:54.530> I'll<00:02:54.620> bring<00:02:54.769> it<00:02:54.950> back<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.250> tell<00:02:55.459> you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
and then I'll bring it back and tell you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.610 
and then I'll bring it back and tell you
guys<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.180> exact<00:02:56.569> center<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:56.959> gravity<00:02:57.470> that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
guys the exact center of gravity that

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.540 
guys the exact center of gravity that
you<00:02:57.830> should<00:02:58.040> use

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
you should use

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.970 
you should use
now<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.420> plane<00:02:59.720> with<00:03:00.050> this<00:03:00.200> battery<00:03:00.620> on<00:03:00.800> it

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
now this plane with this battery on it

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.120 
now this plane with this battery on it
weighs<00:03:01.310> about<00:03:01.730> 11<00:03:02.500> ounces<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:03.830> if<00:03:03.890> yours

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
weighs about 11 ounces so if yours

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.949 
weighs about 11 ounces so if yours
weighs<00:03:04.670> on<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:05.510> lot<00:03:06.340> more<00:03:07.340> than<00:03:07.670> 11<00:03:08.090> ounces<00:03:08.540> or

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
weighs on a lot more than 11 ounces or

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.280 
weighs on a lot more than 11 ounces or
you're<00:03:09.860> gonna<00:03:09.980> have<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.190> problem<00:03:10.489> so<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.390> when

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
you're gonna have a problem so you when

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
you're gonna have a problem so you when
you're<00:03:12.410> building<00:03:12.739> this<00:03:12.829> you<00:03:13.010> just<00:03:13.100> want<00:03:13.280> to

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
you're building this you just want to

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.009 
you're building this you just want to
keep<00:03:13.459> in<00:03:13.579> mind<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:13.910> it's<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.239> white<00:03:14.480> plane<00:03:14.810> it

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
keep in mind that it's a white plane it

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.630 
keep in mind that it's a white plane it
needs<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.290> be<00:03:15.410> pretty<00:03:15.650> light<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:15.920> I'm<00:03:16.489> gonna

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
needs to be pretty light so I'm gonna

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.640 
needs to be pretty light so I'm gonna
fly<00:03:16.850> mine<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:17.450> get<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.989> perfect<00:03:18.470> center

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
fly mine so you get the perfect center

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.470 
fly mine so you get the perfect center
of<00:03:18.739> gravity<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.220> not<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.430> port<00:03:19.850> back<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.390> you

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
of gravity and not a port back to you

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.100 
of gravity and not a port back to you
guys<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.459> just<00:03:22.820> went<00:03:23.000> out<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.120> flew<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.660> and

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
guys so I just went out and flew it and

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.140 
guys so I just went out and flew it and
I<00:03:24.410> found<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.860> good<00:03:25.070> center<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.610> gravity<00:03:26.030> is

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
I found that a good center of gravity is

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.560 
I found that a good center of gravity is
about<00:03:26.390> 8<00:03:26.600> inches<00:03:26.630> back<00:03:27.320> from<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.739> tip<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:29.390> that

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
about 8 inches back from the tip so that

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.180 
about 8 inches back from the tip so that
line<00:03:29.750> right<00:03:29.959> there<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:30.440> where<00:03:30.769> your<00:03:30.950> plane

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
line right there is where your plane

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.870 
line right there is where your plane
should<00:03:31.400> balance<00:03:31.579> like<00:03:32.269> if<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:33.459> if<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.640> go

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
should balance like if you if you go

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.420 
should balance like if you if you go
over<00:03:35.359> here<00:03:35.390> and<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.530> put<00:03:36.799> your<00:03:36.950> fingers<00:03:37.400> on

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
over here and you put your fingers on

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.780 
over here and you put your fingers on
that<00:03:38.090> line<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:39.530> plane<00:03:39.799> should<00:03:40.100> balance<00:03:40.370> and

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
that line the plane should balance and

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.130 
that line the plane should balance and
that's<00:03:40.850> with<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.269> battery<00:03:41.600> on<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.750> so

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
that's with the battery on it so

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.360 
that's with the battery on it so
shouldn't<00:03:45.140> balance<00:03:45.470> exactly<00:03:46.010> of<00:03:46.130> course

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
shouldn't balance exactly of course

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.920 
shouldn't balance exactly of course
it'll<00:03:46.579> fall<00:03:46.850> over<00:03:46.880> but<00:03:47.329> it's<00:03:47.450> nothing<00:03:47.780> like

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
it'll fall over but it's nothing like

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.349 
it'll fall over but it's nothing like
super<00:03:48.829> quickly<00:03:49.100> fall<00:03:49.489> to<00:03:49.640> one<00:03:49.730> side<00:03:49.790> it'll

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
super quickly fall to one side it'll

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.890 
super quickly fall to one side it'll
kind<00:03:50.540> of<00:03:50.600> be<00:03:50.660> neutral<00:03:52.510> what<00:03:53.510> you<00:03:53.600> want<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:53.840> do

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
kind of be neutral what you want to do

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.729 
kind of be neutral what you want to do
is<00:03:54.049> find<00:03:54.380> you<00:03:54.950> wanna<00:03:55.100> move<00:03:55.489> your<00:03:55.670> battery

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
is find you wanna move your battery

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.729 
is find you wanna move your battery
around<00:03:57.739> until<00:03:58.400> your<00:03:58.670> plane<00:03:58.970> balances<00:03:59.690> at<00:04:00.290> that

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
around until your plane balances at that

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.949 
around until your plane balances at that
line<00:04:00.980> that's<00:04:01.310> once<00:04:01.579> again<00:04:01.700> eight<00:04:02.120> inches<00:04:02.630> back

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
line that's once again eight inches back

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.819 
line that's once again eight inches back
from<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.440> tip<00:04:03.709> so<00:04:04.070> wanted<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.670> resonate<00:04:05.570> and

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
from the tip so wanted to resonate and

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.410 
from the tip so wanted to resonate and
then<00:04:06.829> um<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.760> want<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:07.940> find<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.209> place

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
then um so you want to find a place

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.750 
then um so you want to find a place
where<00:04:08.600> your<00:04:08.750> battery<00:04:08.900> balances<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:10.489> plane

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
where your battery balances the plane

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.850 
where your battery balances the plane
out<00:04:10.940> and<00:04:11.209> then<00:04:11.299> you<00:04:11.390> want<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.599> put<00:04:11.750> some<00:04:11.870> velcro

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
out and then you want to put some velcro

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.500 
out and then you want to put some velcro
down<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.550> then<00:04:13.670> just<00:04:13.850> stick<00:04:14.030> your<00:04:14.150> battery

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
down and then just stick your battery

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.870 
down and then just stick your battery
onto<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:14.930> velcro<00:04:15.200> oh<00:04:15.710> and<00:04:16.459> of<00:04:16.519> course<00:04:16.579> you'll

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
onto that velcro oh and of course you'll

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.280 
onto that velcro oh and of course you'll
need<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.120> other<00:04:17.239> kind<00:04:17.510> of<00:04:17.570> velcro<00:04:17.780> on<00:04:18.109> your

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
need the other kind of velcro on your

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.229 
need the other kind of velcro on your
battery<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:18.890> I<00:04:19.340> just<00:04:19.549> went<00:04:19.640> out<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:19.790> flew<00:04:20.060> it

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
battery so I just went out and flew it

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:20.949 
battery so I just went out and flew it
um

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
um

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.750 
um
it<00:04:21.590> flies<00:04:21.799> nicely<00:04:22.280> with<00:04:22.660> lower<00:04:23.660> rates<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:25.280> what

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
it flies nicely with lower rates so what

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.240 
it flies nicely with lower rates so what
the<00:04:25.850> dual<00:04:26.000> rates<00:04:26.270> on<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.770> can't<00:04:28.010> the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
the dual rates on so you can't the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.730 
the dual rates on so you can't the
control<00:04:28.670> surfaces<00:04:29.090> don't<00:04:29.270> move<00:04:29.420> as<00:04:29.630> much<00:04:29.840> and

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
control surfaces don't move as much and

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.810 
control surfaces don't move as much and
then<00:04:30.830> if<00:04:30.920> you<00:04:31.010> want<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.220> do<00:04:31.310> some<00:04:31.550> quicker

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
then if you want to do some quicker

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.610 
then if you want to do some quicker
rolls<00:04:32.090> or<00:04:32.420> something<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:32.930> can<00:04:33.110> just<00:04:33.140> set<00:04:33.530> the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
rolls or something you can just set the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.440 
rolls or something you can just set the
dual<00:04:33.770> rate<00:04:34.040> switch<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:34.640> you'll<00:04:34.820> be<00:04:35.060> fully

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
dual rate switch and you'll be fully

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.520 
dual rate switch and you'll be fully
aerobatic<00:04:36.370> um<00:04:37.370> it's<00:04:37.850> pretty<00:04:38.000> fast<00:04:38.390> it's<00:04:39.110> nice

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
aerobatic um it's pretty fast it's nice

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.560 
aerobatic um it's pretty fast it's nice
it<00:04:39.800> glides<00:04:40.040> really<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:40.730> glides<00:04:41.120> pretty<00:04:41.390> good

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
it glides really it glides pretty good

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.840 
it glides really it glides pretty good
for<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.810> little<00:04:42.050> foam<00:04:42.320> wing<00:04:42.560> like<00:04:42.830> this<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.730> I'm

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
for a little foam wing like this and I'm

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.820 
for a little foam wing like this and I'm
overall<00:04:44.240> very<00:04:44.510> impressed<00:04:44.990> with<00:04:45.230> it<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.620> one

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
overall very impressed with it the one

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.830 
overall very impressed with it the one
thing<00:04:46.100> that<00:04:46.460> I<00:04:46.610> knew<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:46.940> didn't<00:04:47.419> do<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:47.780> I

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
thing that I knew I didn't do that I

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.020 
thing that I knew I didn't do that I
need<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.290> change<00:04:48.500> a<00:04:48.710> little<00:04:48.830> bit<00:04:49.070> or<00:04:49.640> I'm

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
need to change a little bit or I'm

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.610 
need to change a little bit or I'm
probably<00:04:50.330> not<00:04:50.510> gonna<00:04:50.720> change<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.200> but<00:04:51.410> if<00:04:51.530> I

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
probably not gonna change it but if I

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.530 
probably not gonna change it but if I
wanted<00:04:51.890> this<00:04:51.980> plane<00:04:52.250> to<00:04:52.340> fly<00:04:52.850> perfectly<00:04:53.510> I

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
wanted this plane to fly perfectly I

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.840 
wanted this plane to fly perfectly I
would<00:04:53.810> change<00:04:54.050> it<00:04:54.320> which<00:04:54.530> on<00:04:54.800> this<00:04:55.610> plane

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
would change it which on this plane

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.820 
would change it which on this plane
flies<00:04:56.090> good<00:04:56.419> or<00:04:56.900> just<00:04:57.169> there's<00:04:57.440> just<00:04:57.650> one

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
flies good or just there's just one

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.540 
flies good or just there's just one
little<00:04:58.010> problem

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
little problem

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.310 
little problem
and<00:04:58.970> that's<00:04:59.180> just<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.450> motors<00:04:59.810> thrust<00:05:00.110> angle

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
and that's just the motors thrust angle

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.360 
and that's just the motors thrust angle
if<00:05:00.919> I<00:05:01.040> were<00:05:01.190> building<00:05:01.700> this<00:05:01.970> again<00:05:02.300> I<00:05:02.630> would

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
if I were building this again I would

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.340 
if I were building this again I would
angle<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.580> motor<00:05:04.760> up<00:05:05.030> just<00:05:05.690> a<00:05:05.780> little<00:05:06.140> bit

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
angle the motor up just a little bit

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.770 
angle the motor up just a little bit
like<00:05:06.650> maybe<00:05:06.890> two<00:05:07.370> degrees<00:05:07.790> because<00:05:08.570> when<00:05:08.690> you

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
like maybe two degrees because when you

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.300 
like maybe two degrees because when you
go<00:05:08.900> full<00:05:09.110> throttle<00:05:09.140> the<00:05:09.560> plane<00:05:09.860> kind<00:05:10.100> of<00:05:10.160> wants

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
go full throttle the plane kind of wants

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.740 
go full throttle the plane kind of wants
to<00:05:10.370> nosedive<00:05:10.610> a<00:05:10.850> little<00:05:11.180> bit<00:05:11.330> but<00:05:11.480> once<00:05:11.630> again

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
to nosedive a little bit but once again

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.450 
to nosedive a little bit but once again
it's<00:05:11.960> not<00:05:12.080> a<00:05:12.110> huge<00:05:12.560> problem<00:05:12.860> I'm<00:05:13.160> gonna<00:05:13.310> be

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
it's not a huge problem I'm gonna be

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.520 
it's not a huge problem I'm gonna be
flying<00:05:13.700> this<00:05:13.880> plane<00:05:13.940> a<00:05:14.120> ton<00:05:14.419> without<00:05:14.810> changing

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
flying this plane a ton without changing

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.909 
flying this plane a ton without changing
that<00:05:15.680> just<00:05:16.460> cuz<00:05:16.610> I'm<00:05:16.700> lazy<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.680> anyways<00:05:18.680> yeah

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
that just cuz I'm lazy so anyways yeah

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.180 
that just cuz I'm lazy so anyways yeah
that's<00:05:19.220> the<00:05:19.780> that's<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:21.020> video<00:05:21.229> that's<00:05:21.919> the

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
that's the that's the video that's the

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.880 
that's the that's the video that's the
instructional<00:05:22.790> video<00:05:23.090> that<00:05:23.390> sums<00:05:24.320> it<00:05:24.530> up

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
instructional video that sums it up

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.930 
instructional video that sums it up
so<00:05:25.160> anyways<00:05:26.030> um<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:27.590> fly<00:05:27.890> it<00:05:27.950> here's<00:05:28.490> basically

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
so anyways um to fly it here's basically

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.409 
so anyways um to fly it here's basically
how<00:05:29.570> to<00:05:30.530> launch<00:05:30.770> it<00:05:30.979> you<00:05:31.100> just<00:05:31.280> give<00:05:32.000> I<00:05:32.150> do<00:05:32.330> I

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
how to launch it you just give I do I

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.040 
how to launch it you just give I do I
just<00:05:32.630> hold<00:05:32.840> it<00:05:33.020> by<00:05:34.150> like<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.330> back<00:05:35.540> like<00:05:35.840> that

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
just hold it by like the back like that

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.860 
just hold it by like the back like that
you<00:05:36.500> see<00:05:36.710> and<00:05:37.010> then<00:05:37.190> just<00:05:37.400> hold<00:05:38.060> my<00:05:38.240> throttle

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
you see and then just hold my throttle

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.110 
you see and then just hold my throttle
stick<00:05:39.169> with<00:05:39.380> my<00:05:39.620> other<00:05:39.919> hand<00:05:40.280> if<00:05:40.460> my<00:05:40.610> left<00:05:40.820> hand

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
stick with my other hand if my left hand

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.180 
stick with my other hand if my left hand
hold<00:05:42.050> my<00:05:42.140> transmitter<00:05:42.590> with<00:05:42.770> that<00:05:42.890> hand<00:05:43.070> and

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
hold my transmitter with that hand and

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.000 
hold my transmitter with that hand and
throttle<00:05:43.520> up<00:05:43.640> to<00:05:43.760> about<00:05:43.940> half<00:05:44.419> throttle<00:05:44.810> or<00:05:45.470> if

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
throttle up to about half throttle or if

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.260 
throttle up to about half throttle or if
I<00:05:46.100> just<00:05:46.280> want<00:05:46.460> to<00:05:46.520> launch<00:05:46.669> this<00:05:46.820> straight<00:05:47.120> up

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
I just want to launch this straight up

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.650 
I just want to launch this straight up
go<00:05:47.570> full<00:05:47.810> throttle<00:05:47.840> and<00:05:48.470> just<00:05:48.850> toss<00:05:49.850> it<00:05:50.150> this

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
go full throttle and just toss it this

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.360 
go full throttle and just toss it this
plane<00:05:50.870> is<00:05:50.900> really<00:05:51.260> quiet<00:05:51.530> because<00:05:51.710> my<00:05:51.919> prop<00:05:52.190> is

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
plane is really quiet because my prop is

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.100 
plane is really quiet because my prop is
balanced<00:05:52.760> so<00:05:53.030> if<00:05:53.120> your<00:05:53.240> plane<00:05:53.419> vibrates<00:05:53.990> a

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
balanced so if your plane vibrates a

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.140 
balanced so if your plane vibrates a
bunch<00:05:54.550> and<00:05:55.550> you're<00:05:55.669> gonna<00:05:55.760> want<00:05:55.970> to<00:05:56.030> balance

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
bunch and you're gonna want to balance

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.340 
bunch and you're gonna want to balance
your<00:05:56.390> prop<00:05:56.630> more<00:05:57.250> but<00:05:58.250> I<00:05:58.460> just<00:05:59.120> took<00:05:59.690> it<00:05:59.900> go<00:06:00.169> on

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
your prop more but I just took it go on

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.830 
your prop more but I just took it go on
to<00:06:00.470> like<00:06:00.590> half<00:06:00.860> throttle<00:06:01.190> and<00:06:01.490> just<00:06:01.760> you<00:06:02.690> don't

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
to like half throttle and just you don't

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.270 
to like half throttle and just you don't
even<00:06:02.990> really<00:06:03.169> have<00:06:03.290> to<00:06:03.560> push<00:06:03.830> it<00:06:04.010> just<00:06:04.040> I'd

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
even really have to push it just I'd

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.800 
even really have to push it just I'd
just<00:06:04.310> kind<00:06:04.760> of<00:06:04.790> like<00:06:04.850> toss<00:06:05.150> it<00:06:05.360> a<00:06:05.419> little<00:06:05.600> bit

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
just kind of like toss it a little bit

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.440 
just kind of like toss it a little bit
and<00:06:05.990> then<00:06:06.320> it'll<00:06:06.830> fly<00:06:07.040> away<00:06:07.310> if<00:06:07.850> I<00:06:08.030> had<00:06:08.060> about

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
and then it'll fly away if I had about

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.690 
and then it'll fly away if I had about
this<00:06:08.690> angle<00:06:09.140> if<00:06:09.710> you're<00:06:09.950> going<00:06:10.220> half<00:06:10.400> throttle

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
this angle if you're going half throttle

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.219 
this angle if you're going half throttle
maybe<00:06:11.060> a<00:06:11.150> little<00:06:11.300> less<00:06:11.540> if<00:06:11.720> you're<00:06:11.780> going<00:06:11.930> full

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
maybe a little less if you're going full

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.219 
maybe a little less if you're going full
throttle<00:06:12.650> you<00:06:12.680> can<00:06:12.919> just<00:06:13.070> toss<00:06:13.250> it<00:06:13.490> like<00:06:13.669> a

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
throttle you can just toss it like a

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.110 
throttle you can just toss it like a
steeper<00:06:15.229> angle<00:06:15.260> um<00:06:16.250> it<00:06:16.550> doesn't<00:06:16.700> have<00:06:16.910> much

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
steeper angle um it doesn't have much

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.530 
steeper angle um it doesn't have much
torque<00:06:17.510> roll<00:06:17.780> its<00:06:18.740> flies<00:06:19.280> pretty<00:06:19.640> nicely<00:06:19.970> um

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
torque roll its flies pretty nicely um

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.010 
torque roll its flies pretty nicely um
just<00:06:21.050> make<00:06:21.229> sure<00:06:21.729> to

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
just make sure to

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.520 
just make sure to
like<00:06:24.740> not<00:06:25.610> crash<00:06:26.030> it<00:06:26.270> I<00:06:26.570> don't<00:06:27.230> know<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.350> was

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
like not crash it I don't know I was

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.050 
like not crash it I don't know I was
going<00:06:27.650> to<00:06:27.710> say<00:06:27.830> there<00:06:28.040> but<00:06:28.340> my<00:06:28.460> stickers<00:06:28.820> kind

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
going to say there but my stickers kind

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.170 
going to say there but my stickers kind
of<00:06:29.120> coming<00:06:29.390> off<00:06:29.540> so<00:06:30.260> anyways<00:06:30.590> on<00:06:30.950> if<00:06:31.250> you<00:06:31.580> just

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
of coming off so anyways on if you just

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.060 
of coming off so anyways on if you just
built<00:06:32.450> this<00:06:32.570> plane<00:06:32.900> and<00:06:33.170> it<00:06:33.260> flies<00:06:33.470> nicely

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
built this plane and it flies nicely

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.730 
built this plane and it flies nicely
then<00:06:34.790> you<00:06:34.970> can<00:06:35.150> make<00:06:35.330> a<00:06:35.360> video<00:06:35.660> and<00:06:36.170> put<00:06:36.530> it<00:06:36.560> on

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
then you can make a video and put it on

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.180 
then you can make a video and put it on
as<00:06:37.100> a<00:06:37.270> video<00:06:38.270> response<00:06:38.330> to<00:06:39.140> that<00:06:39.290> first<00:06:39.680> video

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
as a video response to that first video

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.350 
as a video response to that first video
in<00:06:41.030> this<00:06:41.210> series<00:06:41.690> that<00:06:42.590> like<00:06:42.800> says<00:06:43.400> all<00:06:44.090> the

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
in this series that like says all the

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.940 
in this series that like says all the
stuff<00:06:44.630> that<00:06:44.870> you<00:06:44.930> need<00:06:45.140> and<00:06:45.500> just<00:06:45.530> like<00:06:45.800> the

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
stuff that you need and just like the

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.390 
stuff that you need and just like the
intro<00:06:46.250> kind<00:06:46.490> of<00:06:46.550> video<00:06:46.820> so<00:06:47.660> um<00:06:47.960> I<00:06:48.380> flew<00:06:49.190> it<00:06:49.310> for

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
intro kind of video so um I flew it for

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.760 
intro kind of video so um I flew it for
about<00:06:49.550> five<00:06:49.820> minutes<00:06:50.060> and<00:06:50.570> the<00:06:51.230> motor<00:06:51.470> was

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
about five minutes and the motor was

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.860 
about five minutes and the motor was
still<00:06:52.040> cold<00:06:52.460> and<00:06:52.820> so<00:06:52.970> was<00:06:53.090> the<00:06:53.240> ESC<00:06:53.660> they

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
still cold and so was the ESC they

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.930 
still cold and so was the ESC they
didn't<00:06:54.080> heat<00:06:54.230> up<00:06:54.260> at<00:06:54.500> all<00:06:54.680> so<00:06:55.070> that's<00:06:55.370> good<00:06:55.640> I

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
didn't heat up at all so that's good I

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.910 
didn't heat up at all so that's good I
wasn't<00:06:56.690> at<00:06:56.750> full<00:06:56.930> throttle<00:06:57.140> very<00:06:57.500> much<00:06:57.710> at<00:06:57.830> all

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
wasn't at full throttle very much at all

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.900 
wasn't at full throttle very much at all
though<00:06:58.130> so<00:06:58.730> it'll<00:06:59.360> go<00:06:59.570> vertical<00:07:00.790> it'll<00:07:01.790> go

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
though so it'll go vertical it'll go

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.270 
though so it'll go vertical it'll go
forever<00:07:02.390> vertical<00:07:03.080> unlimited<00:07:03.740> vertical<00:07:04.130> at

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
forever vertical unlimited vertical at

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.880 
forever vertical unlimited vertical at
full<00:07:04.520> throttle<00:07:04.730> so<00:07:05.510> that's<00:07:05.660> nice<00:07:05.870> so<00:07:06.440> anyways

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
full throttle so that's nice so anyways
