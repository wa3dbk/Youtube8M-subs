00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.120 
really wrong with her but these for some
reason<00:05:40.340> okay<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:42.020> packaging<00:05:42.560> that<00:05:42.650> came<00:05:42.890> from

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
reason okay the packaging that came from

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.230 
reason okay the packaging that came from
Target<00:05:43.730> does<00:05:44.450> not<00:05:44.660> fall<00:05:44.840> apart<00:05:45.730> the<00:05:46.730> packaging

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
Target does not fall apart the packaging

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.580 
Target does not fall apart the packaging
that<00:05:47.270> comes<00:05:47.540> from<00:05:47.780> Walmart<00:05:48.260> falls<00:05:48.950> apart<00:05:50.590> so

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
that comes from Walmart falls apart so

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.310
