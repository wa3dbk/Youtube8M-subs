00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.520
 storm 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.530
 we developed the michelin pilot road 4 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.570
 trail well- versed sports 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.610
 tourist motorcycles we are beautiful 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.740
 we understand that a motorcyclist often 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.479
 you have to ride in bad weather so you 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.070
 just need tires with the newest 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.469
 characteristics that would

 met your expectations 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:49.479
 safety comfort and durability 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.350
 at the same time by this principle we 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.729
 we are guided by the creation of new tires 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.039
 our chosen strategy we called 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.829
 michelin crowd performance &amp; shine pilot 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.130
 road 4 is no exception 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.140
 thanks to numerous 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.299
 production innovations such as 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.520
 updated rubber compound improved 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.709
 slotted protectors thread samples these 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.869
 tires will be indispensable for you when driving 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.970
 on wet is more expensive 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.890
 tread surfaces 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.870
 we used the technology of their site 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.299
 which was first used in 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.530
 michelin pilot road 3 tire designs 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.209
 This technology provides 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.209
 optimal wet grip 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.010
 surface but that's not all we went 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.110
 further and modernized the front tire 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.120
 pilot road 4 adding in extra 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.069
 cross lamella it allowed 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.409
 improve wet braking 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.230
 and rounding at the slots prevents 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.299
 out of the car when extreme driving thread 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.280
 front rear tires have been developed 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.799
 thus to improve grip 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.959
 at any angle as well as provide 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.150
 even tire wear and all these leading 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.220
 technologies enable the michelin pilot tire 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.379
 road 4 when driving on wet 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.359
 start faster than their spartina 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.920
 travel competitors it was 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.079
 proven during testing 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.030
 independent experts on wet 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.730
 motorcycle surface fitted tires 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.349
 michelin pilot road 4 stop 18 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.370
 percent faster than their main 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:10.079
 competitors in second sports cars on 24 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.450
 percent faster accelerate to 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.790
 slippery surface it means that 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.260
 by choosing pilot road 4 tires you will 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.700
 feel safer and more comfortable 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.220
 when driving in the rain 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.530
 tires michelin pilot road 4 is made with 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.019
 we use technology of double compound 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.579
 and rubber compounds used in 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.859
 creating front and rear tires 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.569
 prolong tire life by 20 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.709
 percent compared to michelin tires 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.780
 pilot road 3 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.269
 silicone blamed used in the frame 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.519
 tires were created using but one 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.739
 washing rubber which allowed 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.870
 maximize the balance between grip 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.480
 a set of coatings and tire durability and 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.669
 safety and ride comfort provide 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.470
 hard yarn frame softening in 7 and 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.449
 braking comfort isn't it 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.849
 and maneuvering cream is not rubber 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.889
 compound and advanced yarn layers 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.750
 on the front and rear tires helped 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.109
 optimize traction when tilted 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.530
 ride 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.420
 whatever and head 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.040
 she together they provide 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.410
 excellent grip on all kinds 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.700
 surfaces including marking lines and 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.010
 crosswalks 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.760
 if you are motorcycle owner 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.560

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.450
 You can also rate the technology. 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.790
 complex angle which is equipped 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.280
 back tire in michelin pilot road 4g 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.350
 Tilly architecture of these tires brings together in 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.770
 elements of the diagonal and radial 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.240
 structures taking the best of both types 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.040
 stability diagonal tires and comfort 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.630
 from driving on radial tires of without 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.880
 increasing the number of cords 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.950
 as a result we have and 15 percent 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.540
 clearer cornering 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.520
 compared with michelin pilot road 3 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.250
 increased stability exceeding 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.830
