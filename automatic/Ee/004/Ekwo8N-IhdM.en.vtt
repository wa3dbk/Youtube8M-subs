00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.119
 in the Lombard route of franciacorta 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.189

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.180
 fifth and penultimate round of the championship 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.550
 italian pre gp 125 as almost always 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.279
 happens in this exciting category 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.919
 the final was uncertain and the 25 pilots 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.980
 at the start between the two 2 and 4 engines 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:39.660
 times have fought far below 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.090
 the checkered flag on the grid of 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.489
 starting to take the pole position is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.410
 the usual steers that seem like two rounds 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.110
 the undisputed ruler of the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.079
 category second pitch for tap 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.390
 always on honda which precedes zaccone and a 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.920
 surprising and unexpected 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.920
 ciprietti su rmu 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.560
 ready to go to the first corner and for the 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.869
 usually steers that after running all over 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.240
 the race paired with touches when the two 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.240
 they showed up at the entrance 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.890
 of the last hairpin of the last lap 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.259
 to the attack inside the Roman but 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.090
 indeed it loses the front it slips and sends 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.569
 a race that would have brought it to smoke 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.069
 at the top of the championship 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.950
 pity that touch the author of the race 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.459
 most beautiful staff of 2012 have 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.840
 exceeded in yellow flags 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.090
 maneuver this that then in place of 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.130
 verification cost him the victory e 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.890
 then relegation to third place 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.560
 after adding 20 seconds to his 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.689
 absolute time the stage victory a 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.390
 surprise went to alessandro zaccone 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.939
 honda thus winning the first podium 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.979
 of the year and confirm the vouchers in the race 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.219
 times indeed during the day of 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.659
 test last August 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.360
 second place went to Lorenzo instead 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.079
 honda gabellos three and a half seconds from 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.959
 winner 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:13.870
 third as mentioned touches after the penalty 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.730
 and to close the top five malone good at 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.190
 back from the last position of 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.940
 departure and Cypriots with his best 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.940
 seasonal placement 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.630
 badly bad bulega entered the track 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.420
 from the championship leader 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.319
 disappoints with a twelfth place to almost 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.319
 one minute from the winner 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.120
 but the race went very well we are 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.069
 parties second row quarters 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.080
 do n't expect you it was a weekend 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.170
 very difficult because it was a destination 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.739
 wet half dry and qualify 1 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.780
 we went right away but I was 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.010
 fourth I had the best last lap 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.440
 intermediate times in all sectors 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.610
 after I found it 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.100
 another opponent who was going slower 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.680
 and I was not able to make the pole is the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.440
 first race I play as a misano because 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.790
 for a disqualified stuff and we're there 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.890
 resumed well by 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.150
 let's say this was a weekend 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.070
 positive since yesterday is because Friday in 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.080
 of shifts I failed to go that the 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.030
 non- mental motion in temperature and ho 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.900
 only took a turn on the water and I have 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:37.120
 made the pole then Friday on Saturday and 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.220
 the first round I did tenth I had 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.710
 shock absorber problems 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.870
 back then second round was 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.300
 on the water I did the pole there too 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.960
 I thank my parents and the sponsor 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.870
 anthony left well i went out 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.600
 immediately the step of parents to you 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.490
 imagine then I passed by giannantonio 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.100
 and I put novels to the last one 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.800
 curve can not but all dropped 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.720
 I thank all my brothers and 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.910
 above all I cook myself gospel that me 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.430
 I'm going to see hi everyone in the 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.100
 4-time ranking has hit right in the middle 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.970
 the fabio objective of giannantonio il 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.130
 thirteen year old Roman wanted to redeem the 0 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.260
 remedied by varanus and franciacorta 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.950
 so he returned to playing the role of 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.870
 leader of the pre gp 250 did it in 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.300
 kawasaki saddle with a race 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.910
 magnificent that earned him the victory a 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.700
 arms raised with over 11 seconds of 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.310
 advantage over the most direct pursuer 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.160
 alex bassani the seren pilot of 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.770
 sherco color grappa tried to 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.330
 keep the pace of the leader 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.480
 but in the end he was content with 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.610
 second place of honor of the season 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.220
 third position to over one minute per 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.860
 the sanmarinese andrea zanotti moriwaki 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.230
 at the fourth podium of the season after three 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.690
 second places 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.620
 to report the scene outings of 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.910
 federico marsili and thomas de marini 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.660
 respectively to the fourteenth e 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.660
 fifth round 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.880
 let's say I could go better than that 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:18.000
 because it was a bit of a clip but come on 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.870
 suicide parties quite well 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.410
 at the beginning of a way and a half to the group 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.210
 so you after he had tried to save 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.840
 to manage my advantage points e 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.550
 Now we want this victory the 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.210
 race went well I found myself 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.560
 immediately well with the track then to the last 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.150
 I had a short relationship 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.940
 so I lost some positions though 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.210
 all in all it's fine for for the 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.030
 championship this position but it is also 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.610
 terrible than all weekend we 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.710
 to do two falls on a Friday 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.530
 just the other day map 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.510
 back after Saturday I could do better 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.070
 second round I didn't do it at random 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.570
 from the rain and when not 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.030
 improve it and Sunday is gone 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.880
 very well, however, from the third floor itself 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.660
 waiting to enact the championship 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.670
 Italian 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.970
