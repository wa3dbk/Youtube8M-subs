can see the laces have got quite a few

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.950 
can see the laces have got quite a few
dirty<00:02:35.050> marks<00:02:35.530> on<00:02:35.830> them<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.390> they're<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.420> bit

soak in some laundry detergent for about
an<00:02:52.180> hour<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.960> I've<00:02:53.350> removed<00:02:53.500> all<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.250> dirt

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
an hour so I've removed all of the dirt

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.000 
an hour so I've removed all of the dirt
that<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:55.090> from<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.840> sole<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.560> shoe<00:02:56.590> and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
that I can from the sole of the shoe and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.670 
that I can from the sole of the shoe and
from<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.700> lever<00:02:57.940> so<00:02:58.240> what<00:02:59.140> I'm<00:02:59.230> going<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.500> do

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
from the lever so what I'm going to do

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.920 
from the lever so what I'm going to do
now<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.270> condition<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.390> leather<00:03:01.600> which<00:03:01.900> is

now is condition the leather which is

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.230 
now is condition the leather which is
very<00:03:02.290> important<00:03:02.890> because<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.430> alcohol<00:03:03.940> can

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
very important because the alcohol can

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.820 
very important because the alcohol can
try<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.570> leather<00:03:04.900> out<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.410> I'm<00:03:05.470> going<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.650> use

absorbed<00:03:50.830> into<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.250> leather<00:03:51.400> I'm<00:03:51.640> just<00:03:51.820> going

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
absorbed into the leather I'm just going

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.550 
absorbed into the leather I'm just going
to<00:03:52.060> buff<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.480> leather<00:03:52.690> with<00:03:52.989> a<00:03:53.260> clean

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
to buff the leather with a clean

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.160 
to buff the leather with a clean
microfiber<00:03:54.100> cloth<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.780> will<00:03:55.959> just

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
microfiber cloth and that will just

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.840 
microfiber cloth and that will just
bring<00:03:56.290> out<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.650> natural<00:03:56.860> shine<00:03:57.489> in<00:03:57.730> the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
bring out the natural shine in the

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:06.000 
bring out the natural shine in the
leather<00:04:03.930> these<00:04:04.930> are<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.350> finished<00:04:05.709> shoes

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
leather these are the finished shoes

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.280 
leather these are the finished shoes
after<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.670> restoration<00:04:07.450> process<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.230> I

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
after the restoration process and I

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.830 
after the restoration process and I
think<00:04:08.530> they<00:04:08.620> look<00:04:08.769> pretty<00:04:09.070> good<00:04:09.340> for<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.840> six

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
think they look pretty good for a six

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.470 
think they look pretty good for a six
year<00:04:11.050> old<00:04:11.230> pair<00:04:11.530> of<00:04:11.620> sneakers<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:13.209> took<00:04:13.450> a

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
year old pair of sneakers it took a

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.449 
year old pair of sneakers it took a
little<00:04:13.660> bit<00:04:13.959> of<00:04:14.050> work<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.590> think<00:04:14.680> it<00:04:15.040> probably

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
little bit of work I think it probably

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.120 
little bit of work I think it probably
took<00:04:15.640> about<00:04:15.700> two<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.570> half<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:17.140> three<00:04:17.169> hours

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
took about two and a half to three hours

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.969 
took about two and a half to three hours
altogether<00:04:18.479> but<00:04:19.479> I'm<00:04:19.690> pretty<00:04:20.229> happy<00:04:20.350> with<00:04:20.799> the

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
altogether but I'm pretty happy with the

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.460 
altogether but I'm pretty happy with the
end<00:04:21.130> result<00:04:21.609> so<00:04:22.510> that's<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.990> for<00:04:23.140> this<00:04:23.260> video

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
end result so that's it for this video

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.610 
end result so that's it for this video
