00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 the eternal question arising from each 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.180
 new generation of parents to take or not 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.280
 take and if you take how much is about 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.530
 first things newborn make up 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.500
 a list of the essentials we asked 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.960
 mother of three children 1 diaper 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.520
 even if mom won't pass 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.039
 baby diapers are always needed 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.320
 place it in a crib somewhere under 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.359
 swaddle a little after swimming 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.949
 I mean, I think it should 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.750
 be sure to have three flannel 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.359
 3-4 diaper 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.579
 calico diapers in the world of fresh diapers 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.480
 offer diaper knitted not 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.750
 much softer flannel ki more tender they 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.890
 much larger than flannel ki 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.379
 standard go that is in these diapers 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.820
 baby wrap much more convenient and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.219
 and now he can glasses then 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.010
 use as a new bedspread 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.230
 man new towel special 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.750
 stuff on your head dress this towel 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.340
 enough baby up again and sliders 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.469
 today they are worn even on the most 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.629
 little from the first days of life babes 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.320
 the standard we are born 54 52 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.019
 centimeter 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.939
 that is, on newborns this is the most 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.070
 suitable size but such sliders are not 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.680
 you need to buy a lot of things that kids grow up 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.810
 very quickly and usually also give very 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.880
 many crawlers relatives that is 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.610
 such in size 56 you need literally 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.590
 a couple of pieces but sliders are sized 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.960
 more need to take about ten if you 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.450
 do you intend to do without diapers or 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.939
 5 if you still want diapers 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.920
 little baby gathered and clothed 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.420
 socks fixed that is these 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.369
 the slider is enough for more 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.520
 if the apartment is warm, you can buy 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.280
 a couple of these and they are not close but that is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.460
 they rise rise to the classics 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.990
 very economical option for legless 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.970
 undershirts or blouses out of undershirts 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.590
 grow quickly but they get dirty quickly 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.860
 we take 8 blouses 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.710
 4 and fasteners, I would still advise 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.290
 take buttons buttons they do not 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.200
 fall off they do not need to sew as 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.189
 Buttons very conveniently undid 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.590
 buttoned that is if baby 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.689
 Mom is going through everything can quickly 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.670
 do all the manipulations but there are times 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.129
 that children are allergic to metal is very 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.069
 rarely but in such a case 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.620
 Of course you need to take clothes only with 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.370
 buttons either 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.519
 swing and for example here's a gate on 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.900
 caps look to have us behind 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:26.090
 only you must be outside 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.900
 baby when his head is not lying 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.790
 rubbed about the seams and basically we look 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.599
 the smallest size is 36 for 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.879

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.220
 cap one thin other for denser 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.829

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.019
 month of life and it is not necessary she advises 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.909

 hood leadership grabko whether freedom 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.750
 legs so sleep well in the list 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.750
 essentials also include 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.670

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.209
 a pair of bedding sets afterwards 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.940
 necessarily 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.769
 bath for bathing is necessarily a ladle 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.650
 for rinsing water 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.629
 baby must-gather herbal because 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.730
 that now children do not bathe potassium permanganate 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.620
 it is harmful to the skin can be burns 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.440
 maybe peeling so better 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.190
 bath herbs need for treatment 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:20.349

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.590
 blushed under the green it near 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.230

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.349
 priority things for a newborn 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.180
