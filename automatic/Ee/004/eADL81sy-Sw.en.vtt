00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.500
 video 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:13.259
 which is attached to this archive i 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.890
 I wanted to show how this works 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:23.720
 sp football program for urine analysis 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:27.000
 results and outcomes so click 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.140
 By the way, some of you, you can not 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 download because of the antivirus so its 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.780
 need from key download now 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.370
 My antivirus works and monitor 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.610
 system that's all okay what 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.820
 viruses are not present just whether 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:54.420
 download archive started calling and virus 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:57.780
 so here the fields are fields given 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.280
 cage for the hosts and guests of the games and the victory 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.120
 draws and defeat 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 hammered swords missed balls from everything 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.060
 cells 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.010
 personal opinion is you can arrange 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:16.020
 on coefficients team boosting then 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:24.150
 roughly equal and or who is the leader so here 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:30.570
 here you will see the result of di pisa 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:33.810
 championship game so points per game in 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.979
 championship this average goals 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.920
 for the championship in one match and a chance to 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.329
 a victory here as a percentage 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.350
 the result will be displayed 2 and now 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.920
 let's see no matiz jesus yes here 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.640
 take sho i namaskar here numbers at random 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:59.100
 let's say not standing higher or bean watching 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:03.860
 so here we open the match with measles 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.860
 go to the menu item table 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:16.430
 all results are visible here and that is 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.630
 games defeat defeat draw missed 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:32.390
 we don't need glasses 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:34.350
 so the last command to have it 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:48.470
 we have an outsider 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:55.740
 so we write 2 and there is no faith ig30 here 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:03:12.050
 win 2 draws and 5 losses 23 goals 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:12.050
 4 so as less than 16 Tallinn exposing games 31 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:20.120
 wins 8 4 draws 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:39.200
 19 losses scored 26 so bits 61 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.420
 missed personal opinion who is stronger and 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.850
 so personal opinion I think that is stronger 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:51.560
 guests so push the calculate button here 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:55.709
 match result he flashed in 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.840
 the result of the mod the approximate result is not 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.220
 always true shows the program but 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.640
 average clean result 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.530
 according to the indicators of the table to say so 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.620
 you can say an approximate result on 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.680
 which it is worth counting it calculates 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.919
 score 12 a 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.669
 points here for the game how many points are gaining 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:24.300
 the hosts are the guests 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:29.120
 both teams are outsiders but even the guests are at 3 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:35.759
 times more points scored than the home team 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:39.979
 so the chances of winning here at home 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:45.560
 teams are only 12 percent and 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:50.789
 tallina colin 30 percent everything else 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:53.099
 the remaining odds are a draw she 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:57.289
 more likely fund of urine 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:05:04.289
 Well then analyze the match of you all 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:07.530
