00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
so everything sits nice flat and even

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.270 
so everything sits nice flat and even

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
when we talk about bass drum technique

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.270 
when we talk about bass drum technique
then<00:01:36.800> this<00:01:37.280> allows<00:01:37.610> me<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.030> stay<00:01:38.210> steady<00:01:38.540> and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
then this allows me to stay steady and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.360 
then this allows me to stay steady and
centered<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.490> everything<00:01:40.970> I<00:01:41.060> want<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:42.130> have<00:01:43.130> my

bass<00:01:43.610> drum<00:01:44.260> easily<00:01:45.260> here<00:01:45.590> I'm<00:01:45.800> not<00:01:46.190> offset<00:01:46.400> I

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
bass drum easily here I'm not offset I

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.810 
bass drum easily here I'm not offset I
don't<00:01:47.240> feel<00:01:47.450> jagged<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.229> can<00:01:49.130> play<00:01:49.340> each<00:01:49.640> of

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
don't feel jagged I can play each of

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.950 
don't feel jagged I can play each of
these<00:01:49.940> independently<00:01:50.900> and<00:01:51.710> feel<00:01:52.460> comfortable

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960

okay

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
okay

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.800

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
so we'll move on to the bass drum

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.359 
so we'll move on to the bass drum
technique<00:01:57.200> while<00:01:57.500> we<00:01:57.650> have<00:01:57.800> everything<00:01:58.100> in

this position and then in the end of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.080 
this position and then in the end of
setting<00:02:00.920> up<00:02:01.040> after<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.490> base<00:02:01.640> jump<00:02:01.910> technique

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
setting up after the base jump technique

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.510 
setting up after the base jump technique
section<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:03.140> get<00:02:03.290> involved<00:02:03.590> with<00:02:03.860> how<00:02:04.369> we're
