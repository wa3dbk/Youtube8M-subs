 hello everyone is steven is 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.639
 today in this new video I 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.710
 will explain to you how to achieve the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.480
 ios 7.1 jailbreak 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.789
 it is a type jailbreak 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.090
 tethered and that only works 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.560
 on the iphone 4 which I am equipped here 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.359
 to start you connect your iphone 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.820
 4 to your computer with the dock cable 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.890
 usb and then you will open the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.750
 program called geeks our like 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.219
 this is a little software that 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.540
 you will be able to download thanks to 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.320
 links that is in the description 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.899
 video 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.190
 it only works on windows a 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.540
 mac version is not expected so it 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.090
 should you use windows for 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.469
 this jailbreak you run it and then 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.270
 that's how it looks 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.450
 we will be able to start the procedure 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.469
 clicking here on the jailbreak button 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.910
 now you want to have three 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.039
 possible choices so we will have to 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.340
 specify agx no what is our model 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.969
 iphone 4 so the iphone 4 gsm the iphone 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.559
 4 cdma or iphone 4 models 8 gigas 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.760
 so I'll let you watch the link 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.989
 once again it's in the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.820
 description of the video if you do not 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.619
 do not know your model mine 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 it is an iphone 4 gsm 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.950
 once it's done you see that 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.619
 geeks does not tell us we're going to have to 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.880
 place our iphone 4 in dfu mode so 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.470
 for that it's very simple you go 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.390
 simultaneously press the buttons 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.490
 home &amp; power for a dozen 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.409
 seconds so you keep good support 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.930
 the 2 7 8 9 10 you release the button 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.130
 power the power button and you 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.670
 continue to hold the button 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.049
 Home 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.180
 once again for a little bit more 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.979
 almost 10 seconds and once your 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.880
 iphone is in dfu mode as it is 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.939
 the case here 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.229
 the screen stays black then that's it 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.329
 good we can again click on 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.920
 jailbreak to continue and if you 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.280
 fact is that this message does not appear to 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.079
 panic 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.670
 the program just tells you that 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.420
 the java version is not up to date on 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.340
 your computer 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.869
 so installed what you are told before 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.659
 continue it's really important for 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.950
 that your jailbreak is going well 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.750
 then you see that the procedure of 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.590
 jailbreak starts a small bar of 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.020
 loading we will fill 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.070
 gradually just above you 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.010
 indicates what is happening 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.690
 on your device 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.850
 after a while he goes 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.950
 restart so you wait for it 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.720
 do not disconnect especially so it can 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.160
 take a while me to go 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.020
 the faster I accelerated all that in the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.730
 video you wait while it 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.230
 is done and then once the logo 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.670
 itunes and cable appear at 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.130
 the screen we must again place our 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.180
 iphone 4 in dfu mode so exactly 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.980
 as earlier we could 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.730
 simultaneously on home &amp; buttons 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:32.800
 power for 10 seconds 6 7 8 9 and 10 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.720
 games can release the power button and 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.310
 continue to hold the home button 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:44.350
 my iphone again for 10 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:45.880
 seconds 5 6 7 8 9 10 it's good my 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.350
 iphone 4 is in dfu mode 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.390
 now I have to boot 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.670
 tethered with geeks our i click on the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.230
 my iphone model and it's gray screen 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.560
 appears a few seconds to 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.170
 the screen 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.209
 then the white lines will scroll 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.830
 on the black background like this so no 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.360
 panic that's quite normal it's 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.709
 what's called the verbose mode and 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.330
 while that's it you do not disconnect 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.930
 and especially not your iphone you 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.690
 wait 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.790
 then your screen is one and your 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.350
 iphone reboots you end up 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.600
 then on the lock screen you 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.850
 can unlock your iphone 4 and 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.380

 of user and now you 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.030
 wait a few seconds while 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.920
 if there is load homepage and all 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.030

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.880
