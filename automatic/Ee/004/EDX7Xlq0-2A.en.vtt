00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.519 

no<00:00:03.090> I'm<00:00:03.389> starting<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.779> get<00:00:03.900> that<00:00:04.080> roundness

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
no I'm starting to get that roundness

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.860 
no I'm starting to get that roundness
now<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.009> have<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.399> find<00:00:05.609> out<00:00:05.850> where<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.689> that

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
now I have to find out where is that

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.030 
now I have to find out where is that
that<00:00:07.769> part<00:00:08.100> here<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:08.630> if<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.840> aim<00:00:10.080> up<00:00:10.380> here<00:00:10.830> I'm

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
that part here so if I aim up here I'm

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.619 
that part here so if I aim up here I'm
gonna<00:00:11.190> see<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.790> far<00:00:12.089> away<00:00:12.240> from<00:00:12.360> the

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.629 
gonna see it's that far away from the

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.310 
gonna see it's that far away from the
mouth<00:00:12.839> so<00:00:13.830> that's<00:00:14.219> pretty<00:00:14.519> good<00:00:14.730> clue<00:00:15.320> Grill

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
mouth so that's pretty good clue Grill

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.340 
mouth so that's pretty good clue Grill
it<00:00:16.440> opportunity<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.160> me<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.370> now<00:00:18.150> develop<00:00:19.020> a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
it opportunity for me to now develop a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.590 
it opportunity for me to now develop a
little<00:00:19.710> bit<00:00:19.830> more<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.160> corner<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.420> can

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
little bit more of that corner so we can

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.140 
little bit more of that corner so we can
have<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.080> little<00:00:22.650> more<00:00:22.770> shape<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.190> her<00:00:23.550> chin

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.250 

don't<00:00:30.150> want<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> get<00:00:30.510> too<00:00:30.660> bold<00:00:30.930> with<00:00:31.110> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
don't want to get too bold with that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.049 
don't want to get too bold with that
corner<00:00:31.620> it's<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.219> suggestion

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
corner it's just a suggestion

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.319 
corner it's just a suggestion
just<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.929> subtle<00:00:34.589> part<00:00:34.859> they're<00:00:35.550> stronger

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
just that subtle part they're stronger

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.889 
just that subtle part they're stronger
curves<00:00:37.289> and<00:00:37.710> shapes<00:00:38.339> than<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.870> I

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
curves and shapes than that and so I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.329 
curves and shapes than that and so I
don't<00:00:40.140> want<00:00:40.289> that<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> become<00:00:40.649> dominant<00:00:40.980> but

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
don't want that to become dominant but

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.970 
don't want that to become dominant but
it's<00:00:41.460> important<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.059> me<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:43.219> know<00:00:45.769> where<00:00:46.769> that

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
it's important for me to know where that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.250 
it's important for me to know where that
is<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.519> can<00:00:47.850> decide<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.690> know<00:00:48.809> how<00:00:48.989> wide

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
is so I can decide you know how wide

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.079 
is so I can decide you know how wide
this<00:00:49.499> is<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.920> again<00:00:49.980> where<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> lines<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.940> with

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
this is and again where it lines up with

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.000 
this is and again where it lines up with
something<00:00:51.449> else<00:00:51.629> you'll<00:00:52.499> notice<00:00:52.859> that

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
something else you'll notice that

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.430 
something else you'll notice that
there's<00:00:53.249> an<00:00:53.399> angle<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.170> thing

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
there's an angle here I think this thing

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.139 
there's an angle here I think this thing
tilts<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.249> like<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.469> level<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.309> so

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
tilts down like so it's not level and so

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.569 
tilts down like so it's not level and so
I<00:01:00.420> want<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.749> make<00:01:00.870> sure<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.579> capturing

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
I want to make sure that I'm capturing

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.009 
I want to make sure that I'm capturing
that<00:01:02.760> well<00:01:02.999> if<00:01:03.089> I<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.569> in<00:01:03.780> pretty<00:01:03.929> much

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
that well if I have this in pretty much

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.890 
that well if I have this in pretty much
the<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:04.500> place<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.130> can<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:06.000> come<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:06.330> here

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the right place I can now come down here

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.410 
the right place I can now come down here
and<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> little<00:01:08.430> better<00:01:08.610> shape<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.210> that

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and get a little better shape on that

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.200 
and get a little better shape on that
chin<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:10.620> I<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.950> make<00:01:11.190> it<00:01:11.340> round<00:01:11.580> or<00:01:11.880> level

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
chin if I just make it round or level

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.330 
chin if I just make it round or level
there<00:01:12.420> I'm<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:13.020> give<00:01:13.320> her<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.770> larger

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
there I'm going to give her a larger

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.120 
there I'm going to give her a larger
chin<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:15.050> around<00:01:16.050> her<00:01:16.290> chin<00:01:16.560> than<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:16.980> she

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
chin or around her chin than what she

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.200 
chin or around her chin than what she
actually<00:01:17.160> has<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:20.370> yet<00:01:20.550> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:21.000> there's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
actually has and yet you can see there's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.470 
actually has and yet you can see there's
a<00:01:21.270> reflective<00:01:21.980> part<00:01:22.980> here<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.400> hope<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.300> can

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
a reflective part here I hope you can

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.790 
a reflective part here I hope you can
see<00:01:24.660> it<00:01:24.780> maybe<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.080> should<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.410> in<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> little

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
see it maybe I should get in a little

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.680 
see it maybe I should get in a little
closer<00:01:25.980> here<00:01:26.210> well<00:01:27.210> wrong<00:01:27.690> way<00:01:29.030> yeah<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.540> can

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
closer here well wrong way yeah you can

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.330 
closer here well wrong way yeah you can
see<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.870> little<00:01:31.020> reflective<00:01:31.530> light<00:01:31.680> that's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
see a little reflective light that's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.180 
see a little reflective light that's
because<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.000> chin<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.570> room<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.860> chin

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
because this chin is room is this chin

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.410 
because this chin is room is this chin
is<00:01:35.600> rounded<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.820> it's<00:01:38.820> ever<00:01:39.210> so

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
is rounded like here and it's ever so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.110 
is rounded like here and it's ever so
slightly<00:01:39.960> catching<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.860> light<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.970> is

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
slightly catching this light that is

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.000 
slightly catching this light that is
shining<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.200> little<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.680> an<00:01:43.800> edge

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
shining on that little bit of an edge

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.310 
shining on that little bit of an edge
even<00:01:45.000> though<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.300> majority<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.870> the<00:01:45.960> light<00:01:46.140> is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
even though the majority of the light is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800 
even though the majority of the light is
here<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.830> want<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.850> want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.300> that<00:01:48.540> see

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
here I want to I want to know that see

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.990 
here I want to I want to know that see
how<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.110> around<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.010> lip<00:01:50.220> some<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.910> these

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
how it's around the lip some of these

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.930 
how it's around the lip some of these
are<00:01:51.300> tilted<00:01:52.080> just<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:52.740> way<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.730> is

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
are tilted just the right way that is

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.000 
are tilted just the right way that is
going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.510> reflect<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.260> light<00:01:55.440> back<00:01:55.470> that's

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
going to reflect the light back that's

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.000 
going to reflect the light back that's
coming<00:01:56.370> from<00:01:56.580> this<00:01:56.850> direction<00:01:56.910> and<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:58.740> think

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
coming from this direction and I think

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.560 
coming from this direction and I think
that's<00:01:59.160> really<00:01:59.340> important<00:01:59.880> because<00:01:59.970> we<00:02:00.300> are

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that's really important because we are

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.260 
that's really important because we are
obviously<00:02:00.810> coming<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:02.010> over<00:02:02.370> an<00:02:03.060> edge

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
obviously coming up in over an edge

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.720 
obviously coming up in over an edge
which<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.230> allowing<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.980> to<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.250> darker<00:02:05.610> on

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
which is allowing this to be darker on

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.259 
which is allowing this to be darker on
the<00:02:05.760> outside<00:02:06.110> now<00:02:07.399> Marjorie<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.610> particular

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
the outside now Marjorie in particular

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.199 
the outside now Marjorie in particular
asked<00:02:09.659> me<00:02:09.749> the<00:02:09.869> question<00:02:10.370> why<00:02:11.370> was<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.849> having

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
asked me the question why was I having

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.140 
asked me the question why was I having
this<00:02:13.609> encouraging<00:02:14.609> everybody<00:02:14.819> to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
this encouraging everybody to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.679 
this encouraging everybody to
have<00:02:15.269> this<00:02:15.689> so<00:02:16.760> rounded<00:02:17.760> or<00:02:17.879> undefined<00:02:18.239> in

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
have this so rounded or undefined in

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.479 
have this so rounded or undefined in
this<00:02:18.810> corner<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.980> because<00:02:20.310> there's

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
this corner and it's because there's

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.940 
this corner and it's because there's
some<00:02:20.700> very<00:02:21.060> subtle<00:02:21.599> little<00:02:21.840> nuances<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.650> here

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
some very subtle little nuances in here

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.309 
some very subtle little nuances in here
there's<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.430> lot<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.819> changes<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.540> contours<00:02:25.170> and

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
there's a lot of changes of contours and

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.619 
there's a lot of changes of contours and
curves<00:02:25.379> within<00:02:26.159> these<00:02:26.340> areas<00:02:26.549> here<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.510> I

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
curves within these areas here and I

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.350 
curves within these areas here and I
don't<00:02:27.720> want<00:02:28.079> you<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.379> just<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:28.890> assume<00:02:29.610> that

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
don't want you to just all assume that

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.020 
don't want you to just all assume that
this<00:02:30.540> comes<00:02:30.840> right<00:02:31.260> up<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.739> corner<00:02:32.129> this

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
this comes right up to the corner this

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.050 
this comes right up to the corner this
is<00:02:33.180> all<00:02:33.390> part<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.079> that<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.829> fullness<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.939> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
is all part of that that fullness of the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.630 
is all part of that that fullness of the
lip<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.480> then<00:02:36.629> it<00:02:36.720> goes<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.260> deeper<00:02:38.099> here<00:02:38.459> and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
lip and then it goes in deeper here and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.660 
lip and then it goes in deeper here and
then<00:02:39.420> obviously<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.680> tilting<00:02:41.159> back<00:02:41.400> out

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
then obviously this is tilting back out

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.280 
then obviously this is tilting back out
again<00:02:41.879> and<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:42.329> capturing<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.019> light

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
again and it's capturing that light

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.979 
again and it's capturing that light
where<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.430> part<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.939> shaded<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.720> it's

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
where this part is shaded and it's

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.140 
where this part is shaded and it's
actually<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.739> this<00:02:47.010> shaded<00:02:47.430> side<00:02:47.639> just<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
actually on this shaded side just the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.809 
actually on this shaded side just the
same<00:02:48.359> as<00:02:48.540> his<00:02:48.659> face<00:02:48.870> would<00:02:49.109> be<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.430> want

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
same as his face would be and so I want

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.220 
same as his face would be and so I want
to<00:02:50.879> pay<00:02:51.030> attention<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.510> some<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.720> those<00:02:51.930> things

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
to pay attention to some of those things

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.789 
to pay attention to some of those things
I<00:02:52.470> have<00:02:53.129> a<00:02:53.159> shadow<00:02:53.790> here<00:02:54.389> and<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:55.109> shows<00:02:55.440> that

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
I have a shadow here and that shows that

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.610 
I have a shadow here and that shows that
the<00:02:56.250> light<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:56.760> barely<00:02:57.450> glancing<00:02:58.260> off<00:02:58.440> of

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
the light is just barely glancing off of

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.589 
the light is just barely glancing off of
this<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.069> then<00:02:59.129> over<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.849> drops<00:03:00.299> over

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
this and then over here it drops over

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.530 
this and then over here it drops over
and<00:03:01.139> it's<00:03:01.439> darker<00:03:02.250> there<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:03.030> these<00:03:03.329> are

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
and it's darker there so these are

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.300 
and it's darker there so these are
places<00:03:03.689> that<00:03:04.139> I<00:03:04.200> want<00:03:04.439> to<00:03:04.620> be<00:03:04.709> able<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.069> show

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
places that I want to be able to show

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.539 
places that I want to be able to show
that<00:03:05.579> so<00:03:06.329> that<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.780> all<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:08.189> depth

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
that so that I have all the the depth

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.449 
that so that I have all the the depth
and<00:03:10.099> the<00:03:11.099> highlight<00:03:12.889> where<00:03:13.889> it's<00:03:14.040> supposed<00:03:14.159> to

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
and the highlight where it's supposed to

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.700 
and the highlight where it's supposed to
be
