00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
ask me about buying those Mach three

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.130 
ask me about buying those Mach three
refills<00:01:33.619> because<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> ad<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:36.630> does<00:01:36.900> say

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
refills because in the ad it does say

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.560 
refills because in the ad it does say
right<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.380> excludes<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.159> mach3<00:01:38.570> those

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
right here excludes the mach3 those

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.990 
right here excludes the mach3 those
refill<00:01:40.470> boxes<00:01:40.979> did<00:01:41.189> work<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.790> i<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.290> the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
refill boxes did work and i think the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.980 
refill boxes did work and i think the
the<00:01:45.619> actual<00:01:46.619> razor<00:01:47.100> handle<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.390> included

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the actual razor handle is not included

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.539 
the actual razor handle is not included
because<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.680> lot<00:01:49.799> cheaper<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.340> like

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
because it's a lot cheaper it's like

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
because it's a lot cheaper it's like
less<00:01:51.090> than<00:01:51.270> nine<00:01:51.479> bucks<00:01:51.780> around<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.590> i

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
less than nine bucks around here so i

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.590 
less than nine bucks around here so i
think<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:53.009> why<00:01:53.220> they<00:01:53.399> were<00:01:53.479> excluding<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
think that's why they were excluding it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.060 
think that's why they were excluding it
from<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.079> deal<00:01:56.450> but<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.719> those<00:01:58.140> refill<00:01:58.619> boxes

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
from the deal but the those refill boxes

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
from the deal but the those refill boxes
did<00:01:59.310> work<00:01:59.520> they<00:01:59.729> did<00:01:59.790> have<00:02:00.060> tags<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.479> them<00:02:00.659> i

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
did work they did have tags on them i

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.410 
did work they did have tags on them i
