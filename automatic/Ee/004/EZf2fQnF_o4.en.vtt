00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760

rotation I thought it was pretty cool
made<00:00:21.300> things<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.630> little<00:00:21.720> bit<00:00:21.900> trickier

sometimes a little bit easier on other
occasions<00:00:24.320> generally<00:00:25.320> made<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.910> kind<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.970> out

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
occasions generally made it kind of out

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.640 
occasions generally made it kind of out
of<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.269> comfort<00:00:27.510> zone<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:28.050> those<00:00:28.199> who<00:00:28.410> play<00:00:28.619> a

has solar damage which is really really
cool<00:01:16.740> i<00:01:16.950> guess<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> element<00:01:17.759> isn't<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
cool i guess the element isn't the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.370 
cool i guess the element isn't the
biggest<00:01:18.240> deal<00:01:18.509> considering<00:01:18.900> i'll<00:01:19.140> probably

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
biggest deal considering i'll probably

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.950 
biggest deal considering i'll probably
only<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:20.040> use<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.580> pvp<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:21.840> it's

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
only really use this in pvp but it's

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.929 
only really use this in pvp but it's
nice<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.439> either<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.820> my

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
nice to have either way and then for my

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.609 
nice to have either way and then for my
