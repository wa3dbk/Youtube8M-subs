 "More goals, more goals, more goals we will score 

00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:16.068
 Do not sell us, do not sell us, someone must finish after the bounce " 

00:00:19.143 --> 00:00:20.594
 Thank you for making our dreams a reality. 

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:23.960
 Fine! You have a talent, Villa! You have talent, Alexis! 

00:00:25.753 --> 00:00:27.099
 I'm not sure about that. 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.481
 So do I. I'm sorry, guys, you have no talent. 

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:33.242
 Get off the stage! 

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:36.615
 But the coach! I scored 6 goals in the last 7 games! 

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:39.249
 And Vicente del Bosque still calls me to the national team. 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:43.149
 I'm sorry, guys, but you do not go to the next round. 

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:47.609
 Just a minute. Is that only one. 

00:00:47.835 --> 00:00:54.212
 True? As I said, only one of you will fall into the next season. 

00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:01.433
 Enough! Following! 

00:01:09.623 --> 00:01:10.418
 Say Neymar 

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:14.799
 Say Neymar, Say Neymar, Say Neymar 

00:01:16.828 --> 00:01:17.829
 Hello 

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:23.228
 You are not serious! 

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:27.486
 Of course not serious! What are you doing there? Quickly everything is in its place! 

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:36.282
 Let's. Be professional. Incredible 

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:39.246
 Can you believe it? 

00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:43.682
 Neymar, can we take a photo together? Messi, come here! 

00:01:44.415 --> 00:01:46.306
 Come on! 

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.907
 Very good, come here. 

00:01:55.024 --> 00:02:00.894
 What are you doing? I wanted you to photograph us from a closer perspective. 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.723
 Let's start the audition! 

00:02:06.723 --> 00:02:09.720
 Yes! Let's start the audition! 

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:13.030
 excuse me 

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:16.052
 But I didn't cook anything 

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:24.601
 Of course not. What other audition? You are a superstar! What nonsense ?! 

00:02:25.927 --> 00:02:28.629
 No no no! Here everyone must pass the casting. 

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:31.594
 Of course! Everyone must go through casting. 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.215
 I'm not going to do anything 

00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:37.315
 Of course, you don't have to, you ... 

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:43.633
 It is non-improbable. Did you check out my play on words? Unimaginable ... 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:48.022
 If he is neymeryayatny, then who am I? 

00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:54.309
 And you, you ... Messiah 

00:02:56.707 --> 00:03:01.673
 But Neymeredyatny is more cool than the Messiah, right? 

00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:07.802
 Sure: Naderely is more cool than Messiah 

00:03:08.148 --> 00:03:11.760
 Or not... 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.339
 Let's find out something 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.813
 Which of us will be the main? 

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.091
 Hmmm ... 

00:03:20.091 --> 00:03:24.180
 We will find out ... 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.613
 Next season 

00:03:25.613 --> 00:03:27.126
 To be continued
