00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:22.200

 And we will strengthen the problem solving ability using ict required in the business scene 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:33.530

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:37.780
 In fact , companies can use ict tools such as personal computers to any level 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.780
 Do you need skills ? 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.110
 About this point in our association 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:50.210
 August 2012 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:57.199
 We conducted a questionnaire survey of companies 244 companies 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:59.420
 According to this, employees can use ict tools such as PCs to any level 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:06.470
 Do you seek skills 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:10.210
 If it is good to the software operation skills such as word processor and spreadsheet presentation software to that question 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.210
 6% of responding companies 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.640
 Software operation skills as well as network knowledge and computers 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:25.090
 knowledge 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:29.220
 And I want even ict knowledge that covers knowledge about security and computerization etc. 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.220
 13% of companies answered 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:41.780
 In addition to them, use ict to make work more efficient 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.930
 To new suck the reform of business processes 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:55.409
 Managing and sharing information properly 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:02:01.829
 In other words, 81% of companies answered that they wanted to solve problems using ict. 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:05.130
 Let's ask about the practical use of ict in companies 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:10.280
 When you are asked by a girl to do something hunting 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:13.710
 You should know a lot yesterday, but where and how is it 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:19.590
 Very many good or people who can not be with the string that you buy 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:22.880
 A breed of dogs that can be imagined that this feature is used in this scene 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:28.100
 We propose this in mind 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.940
 or a use force not only the video said the operation training of ict 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.840
 How is it going to protect what you utilize after that 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:42.170
 I feel that the rise of such awareness is very 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.700
 The image of the person whose p 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:51.140
 It is a figure of the person who 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:55.860
 Learning to acquire the qualification that you are doing is a waste even after you go out 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.150
 There is no such thing and I think it is something that I can really use my breath 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.569
 I want you to do my best for qualification acquisition 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.650
 As you say, I think the problem of the company 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.970
 Not a test question 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.030
 And what must not be solved Kedomo putamen not What 's 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.319
 It is why there is only king-like 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:21.280
 So if you have a solid foundation when applying it 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:24.650
 It these things suddenly This was it's come up in my head 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.160
 There is a moment when things are connected 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:32.800
 To connect with 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:40.310
 If you don't have this foundation here and this is the cause, it wo n't connect 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:42.660
 So because the application force is that I applied level of leading the circuit in the brain last of brain cells 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:48.570
 For example, in p prefecture 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:54.890
 q is 3 steps 5 steps, but it is a lot 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:57.980
 I can make up a lot of it is in the brain in the 10 or ball serving as a starting point for Cairo 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.020
 Well then that's not the point if you can just 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.560
 Doing it in line 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.560
 Is the application power in the company and problem solving 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.530
 If you have ict technology 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:15.980
 It is that he wants to say to a more now 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:20.539
 I think that I am in a time when I can express well 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.690
 I want to create such a world never before 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:31.550
 I want you to make it 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:38.320
 In this way, companies are looking for people who can solve problems using ict 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:45.569
 In addition, at university entrance exams, the most frequent exams among ict qualifications 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:50.400
 We have gotten your designated as the wind entitled to say college entrance examination from 435 University 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:58.320
 21 century, as is said to be knowledge-based society 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:05:00.500
 The fortunes of individuals and companies are greatly influenced by whether information can be used effectively as knowledge 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:07.249
 It is an age 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:11.559
