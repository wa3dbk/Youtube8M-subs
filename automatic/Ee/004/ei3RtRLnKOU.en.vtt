00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.699

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.740
 and seven cats 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.970
 these letters 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.730
 are the leisure guide we will see below 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.730
 let's recount the votes 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.540
 3 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.660
 4 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.650
 5 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.680
 6 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.690
 and seven years 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.210
 you can have the feet of leisure 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.670
 we will hold more 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.640
 two 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.660
 3 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.540
 4 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.440
 5 6 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.910
 seven days 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.970
 and the actors 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.220
 tarp that happens if we take one of the ways 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.550
 and we take it 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.550
 we would only have 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.680
 3. 4. 5 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.890
 6 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.909
 we have a problem 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.000
 because nova titos would not vote 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.410
 I care because that's what magic is for 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.080
 eta is known 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.080
 the data more with the leisure guide simply with a magical pass 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.250
 Guido that his cessation of duck number one says please data -2 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.690
 take your day and we'll take it 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.360
 take a way for him 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.990
 by jordan romero 3 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.680
 nature 3 picks a way for him 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.680
 please cat number 4 of tower 4 does the same 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.420
 one of the five 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.260
 cat number 6 and may not be here the amount of the roads 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.840
 there was not only one way for everyone, so with 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.480
 canahuati tokyo rose 102 are going 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 happy and content 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.369
 some of you apply this game 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.369
 for it the 6 a pack of letters like this 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.729
 On the one hand we have kittens 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.539
 six letters 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.979
 with the one titled 'la 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:31.389
 even from behind 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.409
 and six other letters 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.409
 the first day of the week 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.479
 when they came from behind 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.749
 besides these two decades 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.819
 but we want to be is a bit special because of the face has an area of â€‹â€‹the city 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.629
 and on the other side he wants 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.409
 a habit 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.329
 in this way when robust load we will leave it and maradiaga titos and 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.409
 and then I will explain how to tell these six Latinos as if 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.869
 were 7 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:02.339
 for now 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.139
 the initial placement is like this 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.829
 Kitty 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.829
 the face the letter goes out expensive up 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.729
 and all the elements above this habit 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.089
 and from behind 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:18.400
 we had the letter 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.459
 the hip 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.739
 already leisure a title about it 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:22.880
 all the letters 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.880
 aircraft 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.219
 let's count the kittens 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:38.569
 1 2 three four five or six and 7 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.499
 since this is the double-sided letter 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.659
 We need to recount the progresses all placed as they were on 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.509
 beginning 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.389
 we count again 1 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.339
 two 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:51.239
 4 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.239
 5 6 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.429
 the proposal 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:58.279
 from behind we have 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.410
 2. 3. 4 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.950
 5 6 and seven days the latter is the letter 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.539
 the gambling dens what work 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.539
 in reality there are no longer seven cats not only have to follow 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:15.549
 we beg 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.799
 a charter with leisure guide 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.039
 this noble 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.039
 we do not keep 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.449
 Now we can count on some 2 3 4 5 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.249
 and six letters with diaries 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:33.639
 we have a problem because 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.099
 supposedly we have six days of leisure 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.370
 and if it's free 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.819
 we really know that here there are shell acts 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.199
 let's see how we now count couples so that there seems to be 7 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:47.599
 to solve it on the 2nd of tve 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.449
 despite all this 1 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:50.889
 we separate from the heap 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.550
 and makes a magic about the pack of letters with lips 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.909
 create your shoulder ones that apart 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.699
 I made it two, please, I would conjure up for you 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.750
 the models coke mesh for him 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.300
 cat rosemary 3 repeats the operation 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.249
 data 1 4 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:10.409
 keaton 1 5 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.770
 cat number 6 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.129
 and now one more way has appeared 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.889
 what will you do for toledo 7 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.249
 but if you remember this information at the beginning 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:22.539
 and if it catches rosemary cat 1 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.180
 that is, we have told this information twice once at the beginning and another time now 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.889
 in the end 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.889
 that way hour to this act we call it 4-7 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.430
 let's read the last lives 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.789
 and it seems we have seven days and seven cats
