c-clown here at my home break at koalas
and<00:00:04.290> I'm<00:00:04.440> about<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.130> walk<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.370> through<00:00:05.549> the

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
and I'm about to walk you through the

you

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.279 

first<00:00:18.820> of<00:00:18.939> all<00:00:19.060> you<00:00:19.240> want<00:00:19.420> to<00:00:19.480> make<00:00:19.689> sure<00:00:20.080> you

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
first of all you want to make sure you

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.349 
first of all you want to make sure you
have<00:00:20.410> enough<00:00:20.619> speed<00:00:20.920> I<00:00:21.279> think<00:00:22.119> that's<00:00:22.269> the

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
have enough speed I think that's the

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.210 
have enough speed I think that's the
most<00:00:22.480> important<00:00:22.869> thing<00:00:22.930> I<00:00:23.320> like<00:00:23.710> a<00:00:23.769> little<00:00:23.980> 3

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
most important thing I like a little 3

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.890 
most important thing I like a little 3
to<00:00:24.340> 4<00:00:24.519> foot<00:00:24.730> wave<00:00:24.910> first<00:00:25.449> thing<00:00:25.630> you're<00:00:25.779> not

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
to 4 foot wave first thing you're not

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.089 
to 4 foot wave first thing you're not
trying<00:00:26.079> to<00:00:26.140> do<00:00:26.230> is<00:00:26.320> just<00:00:26.470> set<00:00:26.590> your<00:00:26.680> line

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
trying to do is just set your line

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.349 
trying to do is just set your line
so<00:00:27.340> when<00:00:27.460> coming<00:00:27.699> off<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:27.910> bottom<00:00:28.210> it'll

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
so when coming off the bottom it'll

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.269 
so when coming off the bottom it'll
generate<00:00:28.599> enough<00:00:28.960> speed<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.230> light<00:00:29.800> you<00:00:30.039> up

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
generate enough speed to light you up

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.519 
generate enough speed to light you up
out<00:00:30.939> of<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.119> water<00:00:31.300> but<00:00:32.079> that's<00:00:32.169> me<00:00:32.410> you're

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
out of the water but that's me you're

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.380 
out of the water but that's me you're
not<00:00:32.649> going<00:00:32.739> to<00:00:32.829> go<00:00:32.920> anywhere

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.329 

make<00:00:37.019> sure<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.230> got<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.469> good<00:00:37.649> solid<00:00:38.100> bottom

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
make sure you got that good solid bottom

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:39.739 
make sure you got that good solid bottom
turn<00:00:38.519> your<00:00:38.850> bottom<00:00:39.089> turn<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.420> standing<00:00:39.629> up

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
turn your bottom turn just standing up

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:41.450 
turn your bottom turn just standing up
to<00:00:39.929> where<00:00:40.409> you're<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> hit<00:00:40.859> the<00:00:40.980> lip<00:00:41.159> -

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
to where you're going to hit the lip -

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.310 
to where you're going to hit the lip -
projectile<00:00:42.059> water<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.809> looks<00:00:42.839> like<00:00:43.079> now

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
projectile water so if it looks like now

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.630 
projectile water so if it looks like now
it's<00:00:43.440> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.589> be<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> softer<00:00:44.190> section<00:00:44.550> you

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it's going to be a softer section you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.039 
it's going to be a softer section you
can<00:00:44.789> make<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> deeper<00:00:45.329> bottle<00:00:45.629> turning<00:00:45.960> this

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:46.049 
can make a deeper bottle turning this

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:47.990 
can make a deeper bottle turning this
the<00:00:46.199> way<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.500> kind<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.859> coming<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.879> you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the way it's kind of like coming at you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.279 
the way it's kind of like coming at you
a<00:00:48.059> little<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.239> more<00:00:48.449> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.570> come<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.079> mid

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
a little bit more you can come just mid

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.740 
a little bit more you can come just mid
face<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:50.850> get<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.179> real<00:00:51.329> quick<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
face just you know get it real quick the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.630 
face just you know get it real quick the
real<00:00:51.899> deep<00:00:52.109> ones<00:00:52.320> kind<00:00:52.589> of<00:00:52.680> project<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.519> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
real deep ones kind of project you a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.329 
real deep ones kind of project you a
little<00:00:53.820> bit<00:00:53.909> higher<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.949> kind<00:00:56.159> of<00:00:56.189> like

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
little bit higher out so I kind of like

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.770 
little bit higher out so I kind of like
the<00:00:56.489> deeper<00:00:57.119> bond<00:00:59.299> timing<00:01:00.299> you<00:01:00.449> want<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.689> get

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the deeper bond timing you want to get

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.289 
the deeper bond timing you want to get
the<00:01:00.869> section<00:01:01.339> at<00:01:02.339> the<00:01:02.489> right<00:01:02.670> time<00:01:02.939> so<00:01:02.969> that

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
the section at the right time so that

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.539 
the section at the right time so that
you<00:01:03.689> protect<00:01:03.869> out<00:01:04.259> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> water<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:05.220> favorite

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
you protect out of the water my favorite

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.910 
you protect out of the water my favorite
section<00:01:05.939> probably<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.689> kind<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.649> light

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
section probably be kind of that light

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.469 
section probably be kind of that light
onshore<00:01:08.189> chrome<00:01:08.700> bow<00:01:08.850> section<00:01:09.179> just<00:01:09.330> because

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
onshore chrome bow section just because

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.940 
onshore chrome bow section just because
it's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.720> lot<00:01:09.869> softer<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.560> easier<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
it's a lot softer and it's easier to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
it's a lot softer and it's easier to
kind<00:01:11.039> of<00:01:11.130> control<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.700> want<00:01:11.819> to<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.000> when

much let's try and kick that back tail

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.120 
much let's try and kick that back tail
as<00:01:28.210> hard<00:01:28.360> as<00:01:28.420> I<00:01:28.479> can<00:01:28.540> just<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.770> know<00:01:29.799> get<00:01:30.009> it

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
as hard as I can just you know get it

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.170 
as hard as I can just you know get it
out<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.400> water<00:01:30.549> I<00:01:30.670> just<00:01:30.759> want<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.090> make

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
out of the water I just want to make

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.690 
out of the water I just want to make
sure<00:01:31.330> everything's<00:01:31.950> low<00:01:32.950> center<00:01:33.280> gravity<00:01:33.430> and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
sure everything's low center gravity and

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.850 
sure everything's low center gravity and
you're<00:01:33.850> over<00:01:34.330> your<00:01:34.360> hips<00:01:34.690> pretty<00:01:34.990> much<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:35.770> you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
you're over your hips pretty much so you

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.380 
you're over your hips pretty much so you
have<00:01:35.979> that<00:01:36.070> momentum<00:01:36.340> I<00:01:36.640> kind<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:36.880> come<00:01:37.240> back

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
have that momentum I kind of come back

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.270 
have that momentum I kind of come back
down

down

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.710 
down
once<00:01:39.850> you're<00:01:39.970> in<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.150> air<00:01:40.180> you<00:01:40.390> want<00:01:40.480> to<00:01:40.600> try

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
once you're in the air you want to try

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.570 
once you're in the air you want to try
and<00:01:40.840> find<00:01:40.960> that<00:01:41.110> good<00:01:41.500> landing<00:01:41.980> spot<00:01:42.190> well

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.400 
and find that good landing spot well
first<00:01:42.850> I<00:01:43.000> usually<00:01:43.540> look<00:01:43.660> down<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:44.140> where<00:01:44.320> I'm

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
first I usually look down to where I'm

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.360 
first I usually look down to where I'm
going<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.620> land<00:01:44.800> I<00:01:45.240> try<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.330> pick<00:01:46.540> out<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:47.020> see

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
going to land I try and pick out and see

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.650 
going to land I try and pick out and see
how<00:01:48.370> my<00:01:48.550> own<00:01:48.610> answer<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:48.910> can<00:01:49.060> breathe<00:01:49.240> myself

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
how my own answer I can breathe myself

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.180 
how my own answer I can breathe myself
landing<00:01:50.110> spots<00:01:50.350> get<00:01:50.560> kind<00:01:50.770> of<00:01:50.830> hard<00:01:51.010> just

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
landing spots get kind of hard just

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.350 
landing spots get kind of hard just
because<00:01:51.250> sometimes<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:51.940> don't<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.240> have

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
because sometimes you don't you have

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.850 
because sometimes you don't you have
patrol<00:01:52.720> event<00:01:52.840> sometimes<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:53.380> know<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.680> like

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
patrol event sometimes you know I like

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.290 
patrol event sometimes you know I like
to<00:01:53.890> land<00:01:54.160> like<00:01:54.340> on<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.760> top<00:01:54.910> of<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.120> white

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
to land like on the top of the white

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.790 
to land like on the top of the white
water<00:01:55.510> kind<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.080> when<00:01:56.290> it's<00:01:56.410> kind<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.650> mushy

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
water kind of when it's kind of mushy

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.740 
water kind of when it's kind of mushy
just<00:01:57.190> so<00:01:57.280> it's<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.490> softer<00:01:58.000> landing<00:01:58.150> feel<00:01:58.570> you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
just so it's a softer landing feel you

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.260 
just so it's a softer landing feel you
land<00:01:58.930> on<00:01:59.020> like<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.200> cloud<00:01:59.530> but<00:02:00.520> sometimes<00:02:01.119> you

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
land on like a cloud but sometimes you

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.850 
land on like a cloud but sometimes you
just<00:02:01.420> end<00:02:01.570> up<00:02:01.660> in<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.050> flats<00:02:02.290> in<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.619> flats

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
just end up in the flats in the flats

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.960 
just end up in the flats in the flats
too<00:02:03.070> much<00:02:03.220> you're<00:02:03.430> just<00:02:03.460> gonna<00:02:03.670> feel<00:02:03.850> like

much<00:02:07.600> on<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.840> top<00:02:08.020> of<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.259> lip<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.619> then<00:02:08.679> you

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
much on the top of the lip and then you

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.280 
much on the top of the lip and then you
just<00:02:09.009> get<00:02:09.160> exploded<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.840> kind<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.050> want<00:02:11.230> to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
just get exploded so you kind of want to

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.260 
just get exploded so you kind of want to
just<00:02:11.470> get<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.340> where<00:02:12.489> when<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.120> white

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
just get it to where when the white

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.490 
just get it to where when the white
waters<00:02:13.540> just<00:02:13.720> kind<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.900> coming<00:02:14.170> down<00:02:14.200> and

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
waters just kind of coming down and

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.470 
waters just kind of coming down and
that's<00:02:14.650> gonna<00:02:14.950> get<00:02:15.340> there<00:02:15.520> girl<00:02:15.640> then

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
that's gonna get there girl then

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.300 
that's gonna get there girl then
for<00:02:17.080> errors<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.709> think<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:17.980> just<00:02:18.069> repetition

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
for errors I think it's just repetition

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.070 
for errors I think it's just repetition
you'll<00:02:18.819> get<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.000> feel<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:19.810> then<00:02:19.900> once

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
you'll get a feel of it and then once

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.449 
you'll get a feel of it and then once
you<00:02:20.170> do<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.319> good<00:02:20.560> one<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:20.980> know<00:02:21.099> that's<00:02:21.340> a

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
you do a good one that you know that's a

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.460 
you do a good one that you know that's a
