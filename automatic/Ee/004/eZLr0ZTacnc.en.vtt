testing the guar gum xanthan gum and

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.250 
testing the guar gum xanthan gum and
expand<00:00:16.320> X<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.820> Deanna<00:00:17.820> had<00:00:18.150> run<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.630> few<00:00:18.930> tests

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
expand X and Deanna had run a few tests

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.990 
expand X and Deanna had run a few tests
on<00:00:19.500> making<00:00:19.859> cookies<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.490> we're<00:00:20.640> also<00:00:20.730> going

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
on making cookies and we're also going

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.390 
on making cookies and we're also going
to<00:00:21.210> show<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.380> way<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.039> react

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
to show you the way that they react

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.509 
to show you the way that they react
differently<00:00:23.550> when<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.150> put<00:00:24.330> them<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.570> water<00:00:24.720> so

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
differently when we put them in water so

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.500 
differently when we put them in water so
we'll<00:00:26.519> go<00:00:26.609> ahead<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.880> test

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
we'll go ahead and test

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.380 
we'll go ahead and test
that's<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.650> guar<00:00:28.830> gum<00:00:28.980> first<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.490> first<00:00:29.880> okay

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
that's the guar gum first one first okay

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.440 
that's the guar gum first one first okay
and<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.890> water<00:00:32.610> at<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> top<00:00:33.149> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
and this is just water at the top and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.600 
and this is just water at the top and
we're<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.500> going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.710> put<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> little<00:00:35.340> bit<00:00:35.460> in

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
we're just going to put a little bit in

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 
we're just going to put a little bit in
each<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.690> show<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.260> they<00:00:37.380> react<00:00:37.739> in

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
each one to show you how they react in

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.340 
each one to show you how they react in
water<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> reason<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.600> found<00:00:40.140> that

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
water and the reason that I found that

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.860 
water and the reason that I found that
helpful<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.280> understanding<00:00:41.610> which<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.540> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
helpful in understanding which one to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.840 
helpful in understanding which one to
bake<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.530> because<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.399> see<00:00:44.610> how<00:00:44.760> it

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
bake with is because I can see how it

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.580 
bake with is because I can see how it
reacts<00:00:45.120> when<00:00:45.390> wet<00:00:45.570> ingredients<00:00:46.050> are<00:00:46.170> added<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
reacts when wet ingredients are added to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.410 
reacts when wet ingredients are added to
dry<00:00:46.770> ingredients<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:49.340> that<00:00:50.340> wins<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> exams

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
dry ingredients and that wins the exams

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.880 
dry ingredients and that wins the exams
and<00:00:51.600> gum<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.930> want<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> look<00:00:52.530> closely

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
and gum and I want you to look closely

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.779 
and gum and I want you to look closely
and<00:00:53.660> notice<00:00:54.660> how<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.890> expand<00:00:56.280> X<00:00:56.460> really<00:00:56.670> is

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and notice how the expand X really is

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.610 
and notice how the expand X really is
not<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.719> dissolving<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.410> really

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
not really dissolving it's not really

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.920 
not really dissolving it's not really
going<00:00:58.920> anywhere<00:00:59.329> and<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.510> reason<00:01:00.809> we're

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
going anywhere and the reason we're

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.680 
going anywhere and the reason we're
using<00:01:01.140> these<00:01:01.469> three<00:01:02.149> fake<00:01:03.149> gluten<00:01:03.570> free

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
using these three fake gluten free

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.280 
using these three fake gluten free
baking<00:01:03.840> ingredients<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.820> because<00:01:05.990> we're<00:01:06.990> told

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
baking ingredients is because we're told

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.020 
baking ingredients is because we're told
that<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.040> need<00:01:08.070> these<00:01:08.400> ingredients<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.939> our

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
that we need these ingredients in our

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.480 
that we need these ingredients in our
baking<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.619> we<00:01:10.619> wanted<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> understand<00:01:11.250> why

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
baking and we wanted to understand why

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.460 
baking and we wanted to understand why
do<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.820> need<00:01:12.000> them<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.750> really<00:01:13.020> need<00:01:13.260> them

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
do we need them do we really need them

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.990 
do we need them do we really need them
how<00:01:13.770> much<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.250> need<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:14.909> they

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
how much do we need and what are they

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.359 
how much do we need and what are they
actually<00:01:15.560> adding<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.590> our<00:01:16.830> gluten<00:01:17.189> free

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
actually adding to our gluten free

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.080 
actually adding to our gluten free
baking<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.259> first<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.060> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
baking so the first one the one that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.910 
baking so the first one the one that
Laura<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.420> touching<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.110> guar<00:01:22.500> gum<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
Laura is touching is guar gum and you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.810 
Laura is touching is guar gum and you
can<00:01:23.909> see<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.750> top<00:01:25.070> how<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> guar<00:01:26.640> gum

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
can see on the top how the guar gum

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.390 
can see on the top how the guar gum
almost<00:01:27.360> instantly<00:01:27.869> gels<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> gelatin

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
almost instantly gels like a gelatin

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.510 
almost instantly gels like a gelatin
surface<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.780> water<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.100> side

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
surface on the water and on the side

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240 
surface on the water and on the side
profile<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> water<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.930> very<00:01:34.380> very<00:01:34.920> very

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
profile of the water it very very very

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.240 
profile of the water it very very very
slowly<00:01:35.820> disintegrates<00:01:36.750> into<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> water<00:01:37.590> very

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
slowly disintegrates into the water very

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.929 
slowly disintegrates into the water very
slowly<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.689> tells<00:01:40.290> me<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
slowly so that tells me that it is a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.160 
slowly so that tells me that it is a
fairly<00:01:42.240> stable<00:01:42.659> gum<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.920> use<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.310> baking<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
fairly stable gum to use in baking and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.289 
fairly stable gum to use in baking and
then<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.350> look<00:01:46.470> at<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> next<00:01:46.920> one<00:01:47.070> which<00:01:47.220> is

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
then we look at the next one which is

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.649 
then we look at the next one which is
xanthan<00:01:48.299> gum<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.689> xanthan<00:01:49.649> gum<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:50.659> basically

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
xanthan gum and xanthan gum is basically

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.359 
xanthan gum and xanthan gum is basically
just<00:01:51.780> sitting<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> top<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:52.950> going

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
just sitting on the top it's not going

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.340 
just sitting on the top it's not going
anywhere<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:54.420> dissolving<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.200> not

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
anywhere it's not dissolving it's not

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.330 
anywhere it's not dissolving it's not
doing<00:01:55.649> anything<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:58.500> value<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.100> in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
doing anything and the value of that in

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.429 
doing anything and the value of that in
gluten<00:01:59.579> free<00:01:59.729> baking<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.750> right<00:02:00.930> there<00:02:01.110> tells

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
gluten free baking but right there tells

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.550 
gluten free baking but right there tells
you<00:02:01.829> why<00:02:02.100> we<00:02:02.340> use<00:02:02.520> xanthan<00:02:03.030> gum<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.560> everything

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
you why we use xanthan gum in everything

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.350 
you why we use xanthan gum in everything
we<00:02:04.649> make<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.979> gluten<00:02:05.189> free<00:02:05.369> baking<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.119> used

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
we make in gluten free baking it is used

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.540 
we make in gluten free baking it is used
to<00:02:06.509> replace<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.200> gluten<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.039> doesn't<00:02:08.310> exist

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
to replace the gluten that doesn't exist

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.530 
to replace the gluten that doesn't exist
in<00:02:08.700> gluten-free<00:02:08.970> foods<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.709> last<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.220> is

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
in gluten-free foods and the last one is

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.250 
in gluten-free foods and the last one is
expand<00:02:13.540> X<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.770> expand<00:02:15.250> X<00:02:15.520> has<00:02:15.850> almost<00:02:16.390> no

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
expand X and the expand X has almost no

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.630 
expand X and the expand X has almost no
resistance<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.070> water<00:02:18.220> at<00:02:18.400> all<00:02:18.490> it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
resistance to the water at all it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.030 
resistance to the water at all it
dissolves<00:02:18.970> very<00:02:19.000> quickly<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.680> stays

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
dissolves very quickly and it stays

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.600 
dissolves very quickly and it stays
dissolved<00:02:21.970> quite<00:02:22.270> easily<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.960> stir<00:02:23.230> it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
dissolved quite easily if you stir it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.470 
dissolved quite easily if you stir it
and<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.700> just<00:02:24.910> found<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.300> be<00:02:25.330> very

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
and I just found that to be very

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.390 
and I just found that to be very
interesting<00:02:26.320> if<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.560> want<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.830> understand<00:02:27.190> why

I'm using a product that adds
stabilization<00:02:29.680> or<00:02:30.810> reduces<00:02:31.810> my<00:02:31.960> use<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.170> gums

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
we'll move those out of the way so that

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.380 
we'll move those out of the way so that
we<00:02:55.570> can<00:02:55.780> do<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.900> close-up<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.500> some<00:02:56.740> of<00:02:56.860> these

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
we can do a close-up of some of these

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.300 
we can do a close-up of some of these
some<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.540> results<00:02:59.050> here<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.950> reason

some of the results here and the reason

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.200 
some of the results here and the reason
this<00:03:00.490> is<00:03:00.550> really<00:03:01.360> interesting<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.680> us<00:03:02.740> is<00:03:03.210> that

this is really interesting to us is that

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.300 
this is really interesting to us is that
we<00:03:04.930> want<00:03:05.320> our<00:03:05.500> foods<00:03:05.800> to<00:03:05.920> have<00:03:06.070> fabulous

simple no complex flavors the great

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.080 
simple no complex flavors the great
thing<00:03:17.709> about<00:03:17.770> that<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.520> lets<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
thing about that is that it lets the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.870 
thing about that is that it lets the
flavor<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.840> each<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:20.920> these<00:03:21.070> products<00:03:21.670> come

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
flavor of each of these products come

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.820 
flavor of each of these products come
through<00:03:22.150> if<00:03:22.390> we<00:03:22.600> needed<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.410> understand

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
through if we needed to to understand

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.680 
through if we needed to to understand
what<00:03:23.950> it's<00:03:24.070> doing<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.310> our<00:03:24.489> cooking<00:03:24.820> now<00:03:25.630> the

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
what it's doing to our cooking now the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.610 
what it's doing to our cooking now the
first<00:03:26.260> test<00:03:26.620> is<00:03:26.980> only<00:03:27.670> expand<00:03:28.360> X<00:03:28.570> so<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.470> base

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
first test is only expand X so the base

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.380 
first test is only expand X so the base
recipe<00:03:30.130> will<00:03:30.280> be<00:03:30.310> on<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.700> website<00:03:31.090> you'll<00:03:31.360> be

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
recipe will be on the website you'll be

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.420 
recipe will be on the website you'll be
able<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.780> see<00:03:31.959> what<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.170> base<00:03:32.320> recipe<00:03:32.890> is<00:03:33.010> so

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
able to see what the base recipe is so

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.370 
able to see what the base recipe is so
the<00:03:33.520> only<00:03:33.550> difference<00:03:34.150> in<00:03:34.570> each<00:03:34.780> cookie<00:03:35.170> is

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
the only difference in each cookie is

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.280 
the only difference in each cookie is
whether<00:03:35.980> or<00:03:36.130> not<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.430> has<00:03:36.580> expand<00:03:37.510> X<00:03:37.720> burgum

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
whether or not it has expand X burgum

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.860 
whether or not it has expand X burgum
guar<00:03:38.950> gum<00:03:39.160> excuse<00:03:39.610> me<00:03:39.730> or<00:03:39.940> is<00:03:40.090> anthon<00:03:40.480> gum<00:03:40.630> or

combination so here we're showing you

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.270 
combination so here we're showing you
the<00:03:43.989> differences<00:03:44.440> between<00:03:44.500> baking<00:03:45.040> with

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
the differences between baking with

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.090 
the differences between baking with
three<00:03:45.519> ingredients<00:03:46.140> this<00:03:47.140> is<00:03:47.320> expand<00:03:47.709> X<00:03:47.890> only

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
three ingredients this is expand X only

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.270 
three ingredients this is expand X only
this<00:03:48.940> is<00:03:49.180> expand<00:03:49.750> X<00:03:49.930> with<00:03:50.140> xanthan<00:03:50.410> gum<00:03:50.620> this

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
this is expand X with xanthan gum this

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.520 
this is expand X with xanthan gum this
is<00:03:51.519> expand<00:03:51.910> X<00:03:52.030> with<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.180> quorum<00:03:52.570> this<00:03:53.260> one<00:03:53.410> is

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
is expand X with a quorum this one is

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.680 
is expand X with a quorum this one is
nothing<00:03:53.860> so<00:03:54.190> this<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.459> our<00:03:54.640> control<00:03:55.269> there's

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
nothing so this is our control there's

Anthon<00:04:07.390> gum<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.720> guar<00:04:08.320> gum<00:04:10.320> so<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.590> reason

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
Anthon gum and guar gum so the reason

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.590 
Anthon gum and guar gum so the reason
this<00:04:11.950> is<00:04:12.130> so<00:04:12.220> important<00:04:12.700> is<00:04:12.880> not<00:04:13.120> just<00:04:13.180> because

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
this is so important is not just because

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
this is so important is not just because
you<00:04:13.690> want<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.870> make<00:04:13.959> sure<00:04:13.989> you<00:04:14.230> have<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.500> right

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
you want to make sure you have the right

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.340 
you want to make sure you have the right
flavor<00:04:14.980> but<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.180> want<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.510> right<00:04:16.690> end<00:04:16.930> result

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
flavor but you want the right end result

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.810 
flavor but you want the right end result
if<00:04:17.620> you're<00:04:17.890> handing<00:04:18.250> someone<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.549> vanilla

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
if you're handing someone a vanilla

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.580 
if you're handing someone a vanilla
wafer<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:19.870> don't<00:04:20.049> want<00:04:20.200> them<00:04:20.289> to<00:04:20.470> know

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
wafer and you don't want them to know

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.290 
wafer and you don't want them to know
what's<00:04:20.799> gluten<00:04:21.100> free<00:04:21.310> right<00:04:21.729> they<00:04:22.030> need<00:04:22.210> to

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
what's gluten free right they need to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.900 
what's gluten free right they need to
expect<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.690> vanilla<00:04:22.990> wafer<00:04:23.169> right<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.130> it's

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
expect a vanilla wafer right so it's

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.490 
expect a vanilla wafer right so it's
really<00:04:25.030> important<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.630> understand<00:04:26.110> why<00:04:26.440> you

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
really important to understand why you

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.260 
really important to understand why you
would<00:04:26.800> use<00:04:26.830> these<00:04:27.280> ingredients<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:27.970> when<00:04:28.120> to

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
would use these ingredients and when to

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.050 
would use these ingredients and when to
use<00:04:28.330> ingredients<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.440> after<00:04:30.010> this<00:04:30.250> test<00:04:30.580> I

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
use ingredients and after this test I

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.730 
use ingredients and after this test I
think<00:04:31.240> we<00:04:31.600> can<00:04:31.750> both<00:04:31.900> say<00:04:32.140> we<00:04:32.410> won't<00:04:32.590> use

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
think we can both say we won't use

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.800 
think we can both say we won't use
expand<00:04:33.160> X<00:04:33.370> so<00:04:34.060> this<00:04:34.150> will<00:04:34.300> probably<00:04:34.420> just<00:04:34.660> sit

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
expand X so this will probably just sit

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.900 
expand X so this will probably just sit
in<00:04:34.900> my<00:04:35.020> cupboard<00:04:35.380> forever<00:04:36.070> unless<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.760> want

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
in my cupboard forever unless you want

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.120 
in my cupboard forever unless you want
it<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.120> I'll<00:04:37.180> send<00:04:37.420> it<00:04:37.540> to<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:37.770> but<00:04:38.770> it's<00:04:39.040> just

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
it and I'll send it to you but it's just

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.280 
it and I'll send it to you but it's just
not<00:04:39.460> something<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.390> it<00:04:40.780> works<00:04:41.080> for<00:04:41.230> our

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
not something that that it works for our

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.340 
not something that that it works for our
palates<00:04:41.860> personally<00:04:42.790> now<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.120> does<00:04:43.330> say<00:04:44.320> on

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
palates personally now it does say on

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.570 
palates personally now it does say on
their<00:04:44.590> website<00:04:44.980> that<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.250> helps<00:04:45.460> enhance

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
their website that it helps enhance

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.540 
their website that it helps enhance
flavor<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:47.050> might<00:04:47.260> be<00:04:47.290> that<00:04:47.650> this<00:04:47.890> recipe

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
flavor and it might be that this recipe

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.420 
flavor and it might be that this recipe
is<00:04:48.760> just<00:04:48.820> too<00:04:49.300> simple<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:50.560> light<00:04:50.860> up<00:04:51.070> a<00:04:51.160> flavor

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
is just too simple to light up a flavor

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.670 
is just too simple to light up a flavor
for<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:52.180> not<00:04:52.360> hide<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:52.840> because<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.140> have<00:04:53.440> had

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
for it to not hide it because I have had

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.880 
for it to not hide it because I have had
it<00:04:53.830> in<00:04:53.950> other<00:04:54.780> recipes<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:56.380> other<00:04:56.470> finished

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
it in other recipes and other finished

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:57.480 
it in other recipes and other finished
products

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
products

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.970 
products
that's<00:04:57.910> like<00:04:58.630> Brad<00:04:58.930> where<00:04:59.560> I<00:04:59.590> didn't<00:04:59.950> feel

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
that's like Brad where I didn't feel

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.890 
that's like Brad where I didn't feel
like<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.370> flavor<00:05:00.580> was<00:05:00.880> as<00:05:01.090> off-putting<00:05:01.510> as<00:05:01.720> it

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
like the flavor was as off-putting as it

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.900 
like the flavor was as off-putting as it
is<00:05:01.990> in<00:05:02.110> this<00:05:02.230> recipe<00:05:02.620> so<00:05:02.980> that<00:05:03.220> could<00:05:03.550> be<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.700> big

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
is in this recipe so that could be a big

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.860 
is in this recipe so that could be a big
difference<00:05:04.060> here<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.450> we'll<00:05:04.570> have<00:05:04.600> to

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
difference here and we'll have to

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.600 
difference here and we'll have to
investigate<00:05:05.380> that<00:05:05.530> later<00:05:05.830> yeah<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:06.430> we'll

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
investigate that later yeah so we'll

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.720 
investigate that later yeah so we'll
we'll<00:05:06.940> probably<00:05:07.150> test<00:05:07.660> expand<00:05:08.440> X<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.920> some

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
we'll probably test expand X and a some

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.820 
we'll probably test expand X and a some
type<00:05:09.880> of<00:05:09.910> bread<00:05:10.300> yeah<00:05:10.810> I'm<00:05:10.960> nice<00:05:11.200> crush<00:05:11.500> do<00:05:11.680> you

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
type of bread yeah I'm nice crush do you

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.800 
type of bread yeah I'm nice crush do you
Italian<00:05:12.730> bread<00:05:12.850> would<00:05:12.970> be<00:05:13.120> great<00:05:13.360> so

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
Italian bread would be great so

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.660 
Italian bread would be great so
basically<00:05:14.410> what<00:05:14.680> it<00:05:14.770> comes<00:05:14.800> down<00:05:15.010> to<00:05:15.400> is<00:05:15.640> that

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
basically what it comes down to is that

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.010 
basically what it comes down to is that
the<00:05:15.850> combination<00:05:16.600> of<00:05:16.920> these<00:05:17.920> two<00:05:18.130> gums<00:05:19.020> gives

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
the combination of these two gums gives

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.460 
the combination of these two gums gives
the<00:05:20.170> desired<00:05:20.530> effect<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.280> flavor<00:05:21.910> and<00:05:22.470> we

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
the desired effect and flavor and we

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.950 
the desired effect and flavor and we
don't<00:05:23.650> really<00:05:23.830> need<00:05:24.040> the<00:05:24.250> expand<00:05:24.910> X<00:05:25.090> you<00:05:25.840> know

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
don't really need the expand X you know

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.690 
don't really need the expand X you know
in<00:05:26.230> the<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.950> reason<00:05:27.220> it's<00:05:27.310> important<00:05:27.640> is

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
in the the reason it's important is

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.830 
in the the reason it's important is
because<00:05:27.730> our<00:05:28.060> ingredients<00:05:28.540> are<00:05:28.630> already

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
because our ingredients are already

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.290 
because our ingredients are already
expensive<00:05:29.560> right<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.520> more<00:05:30.760> ingredients

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
expensive right so the more ingredients

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.450 
expensive right so the more ingredients
you<00:05:31.420> have<00:05:31.600> to<00:05:31.750> add<00:05:31.900> to<00:05:32.110> your<00:05:32.200> baking<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:33.160> more

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
you have to add to your baking the more

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.120 
you have to add to your baking the more
money<00:05:33.640> you're<00:05:33.790> spending<00:05:33.970> and<00:05:34.860> it's<00:05:35.860> not

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
money you're spending and it's not

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.210 
money you're spending and it's not
necessary<00:05:36.760> you<00:05:37.240> can<00:05:37.270> you<00:05:38.080> could<00:05:38.350> even<00:05:38.560> do<00:05:38.950> a

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
necessary you can you could even do a
