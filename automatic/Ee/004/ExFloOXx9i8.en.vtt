00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello today our video I 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.740
 I will show you how to do 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.719
 I already showed the bracelet to options 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.170
 follow your previous releases 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.880
 today another option for a bracelet 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.800
 I have this narrow here 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.320
 plastic bottle blank 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.230
 some white bead 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.380
 blue gamut fatin which will serve 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.810
 the basis of the bracelet is also a white ribbon 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.880
 fishing line and thread principle all to start 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.420
 you need to make a base for the bracelet 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.270
 For this I cut my kuni wide strip 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:47.940
 tulle and I will wrap it around 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:50.640
 plastic base take and just 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 simply wrapped with here and so on 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.010
 perimeter this tulle and then at the end 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.879
 fasten tightly 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.879
 thread 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.299
 that's the way we get white 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.979
 the basis for the bracelet which will be 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.680
 perfect fit for our 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.250
 white and blue beads and here 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.259
 neatly grab just strings 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.259
 this 8 did not bloom and again 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.770
 further I take the line tied at its ends 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.000
 several knots 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:49.420
 and stretch several times in different 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.689
 direction the pilot behind from tulle trying 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.090
 as tightly as possible to fix as 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.840
 although there is no big hole to do 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.210
 several such 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.069
 stitches in order very well 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.069
 fishing line was fixed 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.840
 also in this place with the help of thread and 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.840
 needles fasten the beginning of the tape 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.740
 now we need a spiral 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.740
 to wrap the whole bracelet with a white ribbon 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.510
 i leave a gap somewhere along 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.870
 a centimeter maybe even a little bit 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.670
 less then these gaps will be 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.330
 sew with the help of these from ours 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:03.330
 multicolored beads now recruit 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.230
 one or several beads 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.560
 as you already will be more like and 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.220
 stitched that is typed and 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.040
 pass through the fatin that is so 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.930
 how we hold it 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.720
 do the texture that is a little bit 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.300
 leave empty space between the beads 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.459
 and the foundation now I will show you exactly 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.050
 that is, as if forming from beads 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.050
 peculiar loop 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.060
 This is the way to create volume Chick 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.410
 and so we flash all the places where 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.410
 missing ribbon 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:50.260
 here are the tiempo techniques blue 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.420
 languages ​​I get to go from 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.420
 one hedgehog to another use 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.840
 transition threading needle under the ribbon 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.349
 Thus we sew up to the end of our 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.349
 bracelet 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.269
 finishing he worked as a bracelet but also 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.030
 firmly fasten our fishing line and hide 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.990
 its tip is somewhere between 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.990
 beads 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:39.809
 nose here you see what I did 

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:41.789
 such a cute little one 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:46.639
 quite original bracelet 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:46.639
 Like everyone before new meetings
