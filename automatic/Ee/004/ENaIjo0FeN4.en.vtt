00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.849
 in a small town away from the mountains 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.519
 of Peru for two days a year 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.080
 Sin does not exist and everything is allowed 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.070
 this is the premise of a movie 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.650
 called made in usa 'made in usa' is a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.109
 co-production of 2006 between Peru and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.760
 Spain and it's the story of the daughters of 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.699
 deeply a village 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.300
 religious that gives you a series of forts 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.410
 and colorful twists to Catholic theology 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.090
 from Good Friday to Sunday 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.500
 of resurrection god is dead 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.600
 while in much of the world 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.300
 this means living with solemnity of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.219
 mournful anniversary in this village 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.219
 means we are free 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.110
 the wind that starts to cost in the 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.110
 night 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.070
 why 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.020
 maybe it sounds like a light comedy of 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.759
 tangles maybe a little drama with one 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.350
 that another peccadillo that comes out of 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.680
 control but it's not like that 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.220
 this movie is a tragedy once 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.979
 notice them has a slow slow pace 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.380
 slow most of the shots are 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:43.899
 dedicated to contemplation already know what 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.899
 I speak not see not observe but contemplate 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.160
 sometimes it's boring but more 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.080
 often feels implacable not 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.810
 allows you to rest from the harsh reality 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.970
 of this community immersed in poverty and 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.260
 lack of expectations and hope of 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.659
 almost all the characters 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.019
 in fact the protagonist is savior 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:20.260
 a Spanish geologist soulless and almost 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.030
 catatonic that comes from Lima is its crossing 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.310
 Through the town we are surprised by the 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.310
 celebration of the high days and the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.420
 mayor or butler as they call him 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.629
 imprisoned escapes easily but the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.069
 True padlock is the beautiful in Genoa 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.350
 made in usa 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.150
 yes made in usa 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.660
 who against the wishes of his 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.930
 overprotective and overly affectionate dad 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.960
 and his envious sister wants to run away from 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.260
 people and I in savior a ticket 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.900
 exit to the capital and something more 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.439
 have you seen his eyes I have to 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.439
 be watching 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.830
 they are more sad graphics like 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:11.000
 magazines I do not tell you more about the 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.519
 story because everything is so strange to 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.950
 sometimes oblivious sometimes uncomfortably 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.239
 similar to our own hodgepodge 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.239
 religious and philosophical 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.830
 for example mother do us the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.080
 privilege 'I think of interpreting the 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.480
 Virgin Mary in what seems like 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.370
 catwalk beauty contest 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.970
 then the colorful and extravagant 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.330
 celebrations the inscrutable rites that 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.850
 strange mixture of cordiality and shyness 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.910
 covering a latent threat by 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.370
 moments is frightening you do not know 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.300
 never what will be behind until the act 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.300
 more generous 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.999
 you did not know 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.890
 let's do 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.210
 made in usa is the young and talented 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.360
 magaly soler who already has a modest 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.850
 filmography his sister liliana song and 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.130
 saviors carlos de la torre las 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.360
 performances of made in usa his sister and 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.970
 his father are practically perfect the 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.300
 subtlety of gazes 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.430
 walking small speaks frank but 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.760
 fearful not with the authentic 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.800
 Peruvian villagers but Mexicans and 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.470
 I felt it could be a documentary 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.450
 with hidden cameras the huge 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.510
 conflict between the overwhelming rules 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.380
 religious and their wishes and ambitions 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.700
 personal can be felt 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.490
 in the case of salvador 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.240
 is the least human character minus 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.270
 thinking less reaction before is what 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.790
 it is called a catalytic protagonist who 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.850
 unwillingly it causes things 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.100
 happen around him but he can not 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:10.090
 he does not know how to intervene 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.310
 the end I find it hard to interpret it 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.670
 if you see this movie which 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.910
 I recommend you ask this question that 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.580
 final matches what we know of the 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.590
 characters and their circumstances or what 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.380
 The screenwriter took out the sleeve for 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.910
 leave us speechless as if they leave us 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.970
 well this is all for today 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.970
 and yes more than illusion exists 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.410
 until times 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.930
 two saints pass in times ' it is not who 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.930
 going
