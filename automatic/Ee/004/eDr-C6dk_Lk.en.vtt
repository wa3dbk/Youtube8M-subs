00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.590
 hello and welcome to the tutorial 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.330
 cupcake addiction about design 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.520
 fondant patterns where I'm going to 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.010
 show how to achieve in your fondant this 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.950
 great and very versatile pattern similar to 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.230
 fabric to cover your cupcakes what they go 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.390
 to need in this tutorial is I have a 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.220
 little cornstarch in this little sprinkler 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.170
 of fondant today I will work with the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.160
 love theme so I have red and 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.800
 White 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.809
 I have a round cutter I chose this 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.450
 matching the size of nikko 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.610
 click they want the cutter to be the 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.489
 double the size of the top of 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.440
 your cupcake so the size will vary from 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.249
 according to the size of the cupcakes that 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.249
 have baked 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.539
 I'm going to use a red velvet cupcake if I do not 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.370
 They have a good recipe for this 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.050
 I leave the link to our recipe in the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.610
 descriptive space below 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.920
 I have cookie cutters more 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.809
 small heart-shaped I have water 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.280
 common a little bit of our frosting 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.960
 Perfect butter cream for 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.420
 sleeves whose link I also leave 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.110
 down an edible marker a roller 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.270
 for fondant a knife a brush let's go 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.250
 to start the first thing we will do is 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 fix our cupcake with the glaze 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.759
 of butter cream and I'll make you bush 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.830
 like a dome so I've made it a good 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.679
 lot of icing on top and I'm giving it 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.750
 a nice rounded shape I love 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.119
 this style of frosting because not 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.490
 matter if the cupcake leaves the oven a 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.649
 little flat or sunk the glaze what 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.619
 covers giving it a perfectly shape 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:38.450
 rounded up try that the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.450
 glaze does not soil your ability 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.620
 I use my knife to soften this cap 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.630
 and make it a nice dome effect I have a 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.310
 tutorial on my channel dedicated to how 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.320
 achieve a smooth fondant dome and 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.820
 perfect so if you need a little 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.830
 more help to get your 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.690
 cupcakes look like mine review 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.670
 this tutorial I leave the link in the 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.350
 descriptive space down well is not 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.390
 worry if this dome does not fit 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.950
 totally perfect but always take it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.900
 the time to refine the details in the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.729
 edges especially when working with 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.470
 light frosting and a hair 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.110
 of dark color now we grab the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.540
 fondant that will be the base color and what 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.360
 let's stretch we spray a little bit of 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.190
 maizena we passed the fondant for her and what 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.170
 we stretch they want to be enough 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.940
 thick to start because in a while 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.040
 we're going to stretch it again that does not 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.110
 be thin you can see that mine 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.450
 it was quite thick we put it in a 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.780
 side and now we stretch the red fondant 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.220
 we are going to stretch a little thinner 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.739
 make sure that the fondant is not 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.110
 stick to the table they're just going to cut a 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.000
 couple of hearts today I'm doing little 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.769
 amount of fondant but you can 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.989
 make a piece as big as you want 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.790
 to cover four or five cupcakes but 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.450
 they need to work fairly quickly 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.459
 as 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.500
 begins to dry quickly and can 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.690
 make a big piece and cut all the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.550
 pieces of your design once instead of 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.530
 doing it one by one cut my heart 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.440
 big here and a couple more hearts 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.900
 small ok now I use a little bit of 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.269
 water and make sure it's just one 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.730
 small drop if you put too much water 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.280
 the back of their hearts is 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.410
 they will stain and they will discolor over 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.260
 the white fondant so just a 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.610
 little bit to stick them and position them 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.959
 capriciously on its blank cover 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.700
 wonderful these hearts are left 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.950
 excel if we want the piece 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.840
 it is like a piece of cloth dew a 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.670
 little more cornstarch to make sure of 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.830
 that my fondant does not stick and we passed 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.020
 roll gently with care 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.510
 stretching a couple of times in this 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.910
 address and then a couple of times in 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.260
 this other direction the reason why 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.750
 happened to the roller in the two 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.090
 directions is to try to keep in 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.099
 possible the authenticity of the forms 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.840
 if you stretch it too much in one 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.910
 address is that they were also the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.280
 figures and you can see that the hearts 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.040
 they have become one with the white fondant 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.200
 now they grab their circular cutter and 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.299
 look for the best part of the design here 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.209
 I have a little red dot that does not make me 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.370
 100% happy I like this piece that I 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.370
 gives two complete hearts and a pair of 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.160
 bits of other hearts and I cut a 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.410
 circle do not go vote this remaining 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.840
 can join it and use it with a new 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.510
 red or orange color or any other 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.280
 with a red or pink base 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.350
 definitely do not vote and we're going to 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.040
 put this fondant disk on the 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.500
 cupcake 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.810
 smoothing it down and around 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.610
 pushing that fondant disk towards 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.530
 below and trying to make the glaze of 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.540
 butter cream does not come out 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.730
 the edges once they feel happy 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.740
 how they have left, they push a little towards 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.410
 in all sides and gives them a 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.270
 beautiful finished well still does not look like 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.070
 manufactured fabric and this is where it comes in 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.780
 our edible marker also 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.150
 can use vegetable dye and a 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.190
 very fine brush but I love these 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.890
 edible markers so if they can 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.900
 get them I recommend them I'll 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.690
 draw some lines between cuts 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.330
 within these designs in such a way 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.730
 that look like seams in my opinion here 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.010
 is where the magic happens is with this that 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.050
 the design begins to take life see what 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.150
 beautiful now you can leave it as is 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.980
 which also looks beautiful but can 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.960
 add more details I 'm going to 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.570
 draw a couple of lines here so that 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.460
 they look like balloons of hearts and 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.320
 to fill this white space 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.330
 we have here and we do the same with 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.190
 this other heart so you can see what 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.690
 versatile that is this technique the 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.000
 possibilities are truly 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.400
 unlimited here we have a design with 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.710
 some data this with some flowers and this 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.720
 with stars I hope friends who have them 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.669
 delighted this tutorial I hope that 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.250
