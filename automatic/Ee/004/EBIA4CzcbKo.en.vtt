nights<00:02:06.210> at<00:02:06.480> Freddy's<00:02:06.960> videos<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.590> I'm

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
nights at Freddy's videos that I'm

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.320 
nights at Freddy's videos that I'm
making<00:02:08.070> recently<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.550> know<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.910> lot<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.119> you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
making recently I know that a lot of you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.420 
making recently I know that a lot of you
are<00:02:09.479> saying<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.260> game<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.710> stupid<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
are saying that that game is stupid and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.310 
are saying that that game is stupid and
I<00:02:12.150> guess<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> majority<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.960> gaming

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
I guess the majority of the gaming

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.960 
I guess the majority of the gaming
community<00:02:13.350> hates<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.100> game<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.790> because

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
community hates this game just because

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.530 
community hates this game just because
you<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.260> fan<00:02:16.470> base<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
you know of the fan base and the the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.720 
you know of the fan base and the the
game<00:02:18.750> itself<00:02:19.140> because<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.950> not<00:02:20.100> really<00:02:20.490> that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
game itself because it's not really that

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.510 
game itself because it's not really that
entertaining<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.110> game<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.070> understand

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
entertaining of a game and I understand

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.220 
entertaining of a game and I understand
that<00:02:23.610> people<00:02:23.850> have<00:02:24.090> opinions<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.200> know

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
that people have opinions and you know

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780 
that people have opinions and you know
if<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.710> don't<00:02:25.860> want<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> watch<00:02:26.160> my<00:02:26.310> videos<00:02:26.610> and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
if you don't want to watch my videos and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.730 
if you don't want to watch my videos and
that's<00:02:26.910> okay<00:02:27.240> but<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.780> lot<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.530> aren't

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
that's okay but a lot of you aren't

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.140 
that's okay but a lot of you aren't
getting<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.160> regular<00:02:29.520> content<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.060> I'm

made<00:03:00.570> was<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.050> carmageddon<00:03:01.770> mod<00:03:01.800> but<00:03:02.760> that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
made was the carmageddon mod but that

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.460 
made was the carmageddon mod but that
was<00:03:02.970> pretty<00:03:03.120> similar<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.810> riot<00:03:04.020> mod<00:03:04.260> that

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
was pretty similar to the riot mod that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.090 
was pretty similar to the riot mod that
I<00:03:04.530> had<00:03:04.770> on<00:03:05.010> for<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:05.940> my<00:03:06.030> videos<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:07.100> you
