00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.700
 hey people here today's here again 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.190
 an extension video to ours 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.049
 last video as we faded in 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.389
 thought it has the sauce to the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.789
 Spaghetti a bit poor 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.100
 is diced and more sophisticated 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:29.220
 people today again a video how to 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:31.410
 a lick to need 20 times 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.290
 For this we need powdered sugar storey 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.410
 Tomato and pizza sauce from the can about 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.090
 beat salt and pepper tomato makes 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.430
 Of course you can not alcohol 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.399
 In this case, red wine is missing 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.570
 cardboard sign also very important as 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.030
 balsam ico the fashionable ewp with tomatoes 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.870
 shallots and garlic yes and then 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.250
 it already 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.940
 At first, two of them could 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.940
 sliced 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.700
 very rich to the back has proven 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.650
 since we are very meticulous we have 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:15.440
 Two dice do the same thing 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.440
 6 They always have to be valid 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 right 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:36.020
 now the garlic and then it is 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:39.460
 our three-colored green to abandon 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.460
 revision third 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.840
 Now you have a big pan with you 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.330
 Cover this flag will be easy now 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.570
 without oil with three teaspoons of that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.340
 brother to the genus filled then will 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.750
 just caramelize and then 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.000
 somehow better is now the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.210
 icing sugar should be the magic 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.210
 beautiful 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.470
 stabilized after some time 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.769
 icing sugar on the ground firmly in quite easily 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.360
 on 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.220
 important is that then someone again 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.790
 is pushed and then immediately in 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.230
 also just about shut down 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.349
 half level so localized now comes 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.500
 even our beautiful three rides 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:42.340
 Talk about the crown oil 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:42.340
 seared so it at high temperature 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.360
 to express a bit at the beginning 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:01.390
 the onions should eventually become glassy 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:03.890
 be so shut not because one 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.720
 and sometime then drives in this 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.460
 these onions then go away after the 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.040
 powdered sugar as you would from caramel 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.370
 knows the color then you have everything 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:19.670
 Great , everything will be red 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:23.680
 soon replaced or b2 depending on 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.680
 as you drove in 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.210
 So now do not think that we are now 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.880
 Anyway here, we're always drinking or drinking 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:35.480
 the word but it is easy for the 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.190
 post or alcohol he still evaporates after 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.030
 a time so it can also 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.100
 then younger then eat so then alcohol 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.590
 a lower temperature is water 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.680
 should after five minutes already large 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.960
 be vaporized by alcohol and time 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.190
 that's why we just did it 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:04:00.230
 Tomato paste to halo 2 tablespoons of 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:02.569
 had the compelling easy to do 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.800
 and then mix everything well that is 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.200
 always a bit hard to mix with 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.700
 this tomato mark but after a long time 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:21.680
 if that works then it will come 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:22.970
 the pizza can so again and the 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.710
 Temperatures down a bit 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.960
 because with tomato sauce sprit that is 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.610
 before was after three minutes can on 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:35.720
 the pieces you already times in there 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.220

 who would also like to add a lecturer? 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.400
 shot of olive oil 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.340
 this refines the sauce 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.699
 a cream bit now cup 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.600
 purely and then it is already on the 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:57.229
 spices and how to do the ski chemistry 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:02.410
 Now the chili flakes do pure and 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.410

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.849
 not so much anymore 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.610
