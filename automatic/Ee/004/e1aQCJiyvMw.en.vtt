my hair looks weird right now because
I'm<00:00:06.299> about<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.509> straighten<00:00:07.109> men<00:00:07.259> again<00:00:09.230> what

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
I'm about to straighten men again what

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.740 
I'm about to straighten men again what
I've<00:00:10.380> done<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.730> separated<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.599> into

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
I've done I have separated it into

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.720 
I've done I have separated it into
sections<00:00:14.450> so<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:16.260> curl<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.580> I

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
sections so that the curl so that if I

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.810 
sections so that the curl so that if I
dip<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:19.109> get<00:00:19.260> all<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.710> curl<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.400> it's

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
dip it I can get all the curl and it's

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.320 
dip it I can get all the curl and it's
going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.090> easier<00:00:21.480> because<00:00:21.689> I'm<00:00:21.930> doing<00:00:22.109> it

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
going to be easier because I'm doing it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.550 
going to be easier because I'm doing it
by<00:00:24.330> myself<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.779> looks<00:00:24.960> over<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.320> right<00:00:25.439> now

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
by myself I looks over here right now

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.769 
by myself I looks over here right now
I'm<00:00:25.980> doing<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> by<00:00:26.789> myself<00:00:26.820> I'm<00:00:27.420> not<00:00:27.599> really

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
I'm doing it by myself I'm not really

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.960 
I'm doing it by myself I'm not really
getting<00:00:28.050> any<00:00:28.289> help<00:00:28.529> from<00:00:28.619> any<00:00:28.949> way<00:00:29.220> or<00:00:29.519> any<00:00:29.550> of

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
getting any help from any way or any of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.580 
getting any help from any way or any of
no<00:00:30.150> one's<00:00:30.330> doing<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:30.929> me<00:00:31.050> I'm<00:00:31.170> doing<00:00:31.380> it

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
no one's doing it for me I'm doing it

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.920 
no one's doing it for me I'm doing it
alone<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.610> when<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> separate<00:00:33.809> in

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
alone so that when I separate in

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.459 
alone so that when I separate in
sections<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.980> easier<00:00:35.630> so<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.989> have

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
sections like this it's easier so I have

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.430 
sections like this it's easier so I have
my<00:00:37.950> hot<00:00:38.280> water<00:00:40.070> uses<00:00:41.070> steam<00:00:41.989> what<00:00:42.989> happened

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
my hot water uses steam what happened

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.750 
my hot water uses steam what happened
this<00:00:43.559> way<00:00:43.770> because<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.430> look<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
this way because I have to look in the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420 
this way because I have to look in the
mirror<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.780> you'll<00:00:46.170> get<00:00:46.320> an<00:00:46.440> angle<00:00:46.860> you'll

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
mirror but you'll get an angle you'll

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.799 
mirror but you'll get an angle you'll
get<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> good<00:00:47.760> angle<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.180> it

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
get a good angle for it

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.090 
get a good angle for it
so<00:00:49.789> you<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.000> want<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.780> am<00:00:52.410> using<00:00:52.620> my

that<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.800> back<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> little<00:02:51.030> harder<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.629> do

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
that the back is a little harder to do

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.449 
that the back is a little harder to do
when<00:02:51.959> you're<00:02:52.140> doing<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.650> your<00:02:52.769> own

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
when you're doing it on your own

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:01.880 
when you're doing it on your own
this<00:02:54.150> takes<00:02:54.510> several<00:02:54.959> dips<00:02:56.090> not<00:02:57.090> just

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.890 

like<00:03:02.520> just<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.120> know<00:03:04.850> if<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:06.120> would<00:03:06.360> all<00:03:06.690> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
like just you know if you would all the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.220 
like just you know if you would all the
way<00:03:07.020> down<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.600> make<00:03:09.780> sure<00:03:10.020> that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
way down and you have to make sure that

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.260 
way down and you have to make sure that
you<00:03:10.410> put<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.830> all<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.190> way<00:03:11.220> down<00:03:11.450> because<00:03:14.270> the

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
you put it all the way down because the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:23.630 
you put it all the way down because the
hot<00:03:15.600> water<00:03:15.930> can<00:03:16.200> crinkle<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:20.090> alright<00:03:22.640> and

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
hot water can crinkle it alright and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.390 
hot water can crinkle it alright and
then<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.750> do<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.020> same<00:03:25.290> thing<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:28.280> like<00:03:29.280> I

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
then you do the same thing and like I

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.920 
then you do the same thing and like I
said<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.910> back<00:03:30.150> you're<00:03:30.390> going<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.600> have<00:03:30.780> to

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:22.940 
effect to it so if you wondering that

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.660

wavy<00:07:23.420> all<00:07:23.570> you<00:07:23.690> had<00:07:23.810> to<00:07:23.840> do<00:07:23.990> was<00:07:24.230> like<00:07:24.470> right

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.670 
wavy all you had to do was like right

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.610 
wavy all you had to do was like right
do<00:07:25.910> not<00:07:26.090> use<00:07:26.510> boiling<00:07:27.320> hot<00:07:27.440> water<00:07:27.500> just<00:07:28.370> use

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:29.620 
do not use boiling hot water just use

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.230 
do not use boiling hot water just use
water<00:07:30.620> that's<00:07:30.950> been<00:07:31.130> on<00:07:31.280> the<00:07:31.370> stove<00:07:31.670> for<00:07:31.700> it

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 
water that's been on the stove for it

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.030 
water that's been on the stove for it
probably<00:07:32.780> about<00:07:33.110> because<00:07:33.530> it<00:07:33.710> takes<00:07:33.920> about

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.040 
probably about because it takes about

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.920 
probably about because it takes about
five<00:07:34.490> minutes<00:07:34.520> boil<00:07:35.060> so<00:07:35.540> probably<00:07:35.840> about

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
five minutes boil so probably about

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.700 
five minutes boil so probably about
three<00:07:36.290> minutes<00:07:36.620> two<00:07:37.160> minutes<00:07:37.190> and<00:07:37.640> then<00:07:38.210> I

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
three minutes two minutes and then I

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.400 
three minutes two minutes and then I
just<00:07:39.710> did<00:07:39.980> and<00:07:40.280> you<00:07:40.310> can<00:07:40.640> make<00:07:40.760> it<00:07:40.880> wavy<00:07:41.410> like
