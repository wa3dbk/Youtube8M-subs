i'm<00:00:53.930> pretty<00:00:54.930> hesitant<00:00:55.199> about<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.039> port<00:00:56.430> uh

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
i'm pretty hesitant about this port uh

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.150 
i'm pretty hesitant about this port uh
the<00:00:57.420> problem<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.350> platinum<00:00:58.590> games<00:00:58.920> is

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the problem is this is platinum games is

first<00:00:59.489> port<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> pc<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.510> no<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.079> really

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
first port to the pc and no one really

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.900 
first port to the pc and no one really
knows<00:01:01.469> how<00:01:01.530> they<00:01:02.160> don't<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> track<00:01:02.730> record

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.789 
knows how they don't have a track record
of<00:01:03.090> how<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.449> are<00:01:03.660> how<00:01:04.170> they<00:01:04.199> did<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.619> past

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
of how they are how they did in the past

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.039 
of how they are how they did in the past
and<00:01:05.129> these<00:01:05.850> system<00:01:06.390> required<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and these system required of

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.410 
and these system required of
requirements<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.220> ass-backwards<00:01:08.520> they

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
requirements are so ass-backwards they

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300 
requirements are so ass-backwards they
posted<00:01:09.990> them<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.290> i'm<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.890> gonna<00:01:10.979> tell<00:01:11.189> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
posted them and i'm just gonna tell you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.800 
posted them and i'm just gonna tell you
guys<00:01:11.340> these<00:01:11.549> are<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.030> weird<00:01:12.330> some<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
guys these are so weird some of the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.899 
guys these are so weird some of the
weirdest<00:01:13.290> system<00:01:13.560> requirements<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.189> like

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
weirdest system requirements like like

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.330 
weirdest system requirements like like
the<00:01:15.150> cpu<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.990> has<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> high<00:01:16.409> cpu<00:01:16.860> requirement

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the cpu it has a high cpu requirement

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580 
the cpu it has a high cpu requirement
but<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> GPU<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.470> know

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
but then the GPU you can have a you know

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
but then the GPU you can have a you know
pretty<00:01:19.799> low-end<00:01:20.070> GPU<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.700> still<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.970> fine<00:01:21.119> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
pretty low-end GPU and still be fine so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.820 
pretty low-end GPU and still be fine so
let's<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.750> right<00:01:21.869> into<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.140> minimum

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
let's get right into this minimum

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.340 
let's get right into this minimum
processor<00:01:23.460> uh<00:01:23.610> requirement<00:01:24.570> until<00:01:24.840> core<00:01:25.049> i5

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
processor uh requirement until core i5

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.649 
processor uh requirement until core i5
2400<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.580> recommended<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.240> an<00:01:27.390> intel

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
2400 and then recommended is an intel

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.640 
2400 and then recommended is an intel
core<00:01:27.689> i7<00:01:29.299> 3770<00:01:30.299> that's<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> fairly<00:01:31.500> high

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
core i7 3770 that's a fairly high

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.130 
core i7 3770 that's a fairly high
requirement<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> cpu<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.540> recommended

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
requirement for a cpu for recommended

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.380 
requirement for a cpu for recommended
even<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> recommended<00:01:35.520> cpu<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.150> usually

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
even as a recommended cpu these usually

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.080 
even as a recommended cpu these usually
don't<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:36.960> above<00:01:37.320> an<00:01:37.439> i5<00:01:37.920> i<00:01:38.220> mean<00:01:38.640> even<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.939> game

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
don't go above an i5 i mean even a game

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.080 
don't go above an i5 i mean even a game
like<00:01:39.210> Battlefield<00:01:39.780> 4<00:01:40.110> recommends<00:01:40.680> an<00:01:40.770> i5<00:01:41.280> not

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
like Battlefield 4 recommends an i5 not

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.960 
like Battlefield 4 recommends an i5 not
an<00:01:42.270> i7<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.409> odd<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.950> an<00:01:44.490> i5

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
an i7 so this is really odd and an i5

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.170 
an i7 so this is really odd and an i5
2400<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> minimum<00:01:46.290> CPU<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.100> also<00:01:47.909> pretty

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
2400 as a minimum CPU is also pretty

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.270 
2400 as a minimum CPU is also pretty
staggering<00:01:48.600> considering<00:01:49.350> most<00:01:49.500> games<00:01:49.829> you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
staggering considering most games you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.249 
staggering considering most games you
can<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.610> by<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> dual-core<00:01:51.540> CPU<00:01:52.020> no

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
can get by but the dual-core CPU no

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.160 
can get by but the dual-core CPU no
problem<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.369> I'm<00:01:53.579> kind<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.750> know<00:01:54.780> fishy

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
problem so I'm kind of you know fishy

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.870 
problem so I'm kind of you know fishy
about<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.920> don't<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.820> is

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
about this I don't think this is

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.969 
about this I don't think this is
accurate<00:01:57.509> even<00:01:57.840> though<00:01:57.960> steam<00:01:58.290> hasn't<00:01:58.799> listed

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
accurate even though steam hasn't listed

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.480 
accurate even though steam hasn't listed
it<00:01:59.430> this<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.329> really<00:02:00.689> odd<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.049> me<00:02:01.079> and

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
it this is just really odd to me and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.219 
it this is just really odd to me and
making<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.579> even<00:02:02.759> weirder<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.810> move<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.079> to

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
making it even weirder is you move on to

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.920 
making it even weirder is you move on to
the<00:02:04.320> memory<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.210> an<00:02:06.329> intel<00:02:06.600> core<00:02:06.630> i5

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the memory so you have an intel core i5

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.639 
the memory so you have an intel core i5
2400<00:02:07.770> as<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> minimum<00:02:08.599> CPU<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.560> know

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
2400 as a minimum CPU you think you know

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.340 
2400 as a minimum CPU you think you know
for<00:02:10.679> 8<00:02:11.069> gigabytes<00:02:11.520> would<00:02:11.790> be<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> middle

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
for 8 gigabytes would be the middle

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.580 
for 8 gigabytes would be the middle
Ram<00:02:12.890> no<00:02:13.160> it's<00:02:13.430> two<00:02:13.670> gigabytes<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.300> RAM<00:02:14.590> so

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
Ram no it's two gigabytes of RAM so

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.650 
Ram no it's two gigabytes of RAM so
that's<00:02:15.830> really<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.280> really<00:02:16.730> low<00:02:16.970> ram

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
that's really on a really low ram

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.300 
that's really on a really low ram
requirement<00:02:18.230> but<00:02:18.290> hey<00:02:18.470> that's<00:02:18.740> pretty<00:02:19.040> normal

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
requirement but hey that's pretty normal

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.640

these<00:02:19.670> days<00:02:19.730> Ram<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.510> really<00:02:20.810> big<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.230> gaming

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650

hesitant<00:03:46.310> about<00:03:46.490> this<00:03:46.790> port<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.240> could<00:03:47.390> go

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
hesitant about this port it could go

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.170 
hesitant about this port it could go
really<00:03:47.870> south<00:03:48.350> of<00:03:48.650> four<00:03:49.010> platinum<00:03:49.220> if<00:03:49.610> they

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
really south of four platinum if they

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.300 
really south of four platinum if they
fuck<00:03:50.390> this<00:03:50.600> up<00:03:50.780> probably<00:03:51.080> feel<00:03:51.380> more<00:03:51.410> PC<00:03:52.010> ports

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
fuck this up probably feel more PC ports

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.340 
fuck this up probably feel more PC ports
or<00:03:52.700> hey<00:03:52.940> maybe<00:03:52.970> if<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.480> does<00:03:53.660> go<00:03:53.810> really<00:03:54.020> south

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
or hey maybe if it does go really south

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.650 
or hey maybe if it does go really south
they'll<00:03:54.620> try<00:03:54.800> to<00:03:54.860> prove<00:03:55.100> themselves<00:03:55.660> next

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
they'll try to prove themselves next
