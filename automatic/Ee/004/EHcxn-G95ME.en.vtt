00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.090
 How to repair the waterproofing of your 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.100
 cover 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.200
 here we have reproduced a possible 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.360
 breakage in the waterproofing of a 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.210
 cover these breaks are very 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.070
 usual or because we use 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.770
 covers not passable to walk by 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.570
 them that we break the waterproofing 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.220
 or every time someone goes up 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.620
 make us a repair for example of 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.950
 the antenna on a roof usually drills 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.690
 the waterproofing and not repair it 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.880
 this directly is a moisture in the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.880
 roof of the house repair it 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.670
 very simple directly 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.740
 with the same material that is the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.420
 asphalt but 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.430
 self-adhesive and on tape we will cover 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.880
 damaged area to seal it 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.220
 perfectly well important to 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.010
 make it easier for our tape to adhere 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.740
 perfectly we will use as material 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.330
 intermediate paint bituminous paint 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.340
 bituminous that is just the same 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.650
 asphaltic but fluid fabric and that will 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.750
 facilitate that when the sun everything founds 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.350
 in one and in the end it is perfectly 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.350
 watertight 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.729
 and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.229
 let's perfectly take our break 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.330
 we cut a piece of tape more or less 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.009
 of the size of the break keeping the 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.009
 respect for enough lapels 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.590
 and before it dries paint 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.030
 bituminous we place it on top so that 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.040
 together with 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.040
 with the tape we facilitate your choice 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.500
 we remove the protector 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.180
 and we place the tapes 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.790
 throughout our court 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.180
 once you start to give the sun to the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.180
 cover 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.319
 our cast tape and it will mix with 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.890
 The original asphalt cloth is very 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.890
 simple truth 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.769
 up here our demonstration will 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.510
 I invite you to visit our stores and 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.250
 your demonstration classrooms where you can 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.250
 learn much more thank you
