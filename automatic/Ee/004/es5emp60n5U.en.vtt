00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 because yesterday I started with the councilmen 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.540
 impact by omission on mayors is 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.099
 say that it does not go to the candidate ssppc in 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.050
 some communes to favor the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.849
 candidates the conceptual good carlos 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.300
 the root said effectively we're going to 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.880
 to lose 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.410
 mayor color was going to lose the alliance 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.480
 because this covenant does exist 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.060
 in the communist party who wins the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.830
 municipal elections beyond as 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.250
 a specific one but who wins the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.680
 municipal elections 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.900
 what happens that looks like that many 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.739
 mayors who are very close to your 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.210
 commune that is that they are like right - wing 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.329
 to say it in some way because I 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.480
 he 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.680
 then they do not know what I read I see more more 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:48.110
 mayors working in communities most d 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.110
 most popular I see them winning from 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:56.300
 right 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:58.400
 finally he is presidential candidate the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.920
 next president of chile latife us 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:07.250
 come president or president latife me 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:12.550
 I have seen a person as next 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.550
 president but if I see it 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.840
 and you say that the first of August does not 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.570
 you say you leave the goal but as 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.130
 president if you have up to the charisma 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.200
 that's like what I did notice that the 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.940
 adif is against all odds because 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.210
 many say that if my jungle is 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.759
 the quantity the only possible one that 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.220
 can you make the truth goal is not michelle 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.920
 bachelet as latife says that according to her 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.040
 it would not be open the possibility that it be 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:56.600
 hand in hand longueira 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:59.030
 and the truth is that I see it with a 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.650
 very big race is a place 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.650
 very big bigger than it has 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.970
 before the break I unhook a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.979
 question that was related to what 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.360
 you gave the experience of January you have to 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.100
 remember that this program that you 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.440
 saw now at the end of July was recorded in 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.360
 January in his own trap trap in the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.770
 that did not fall latife soto that is with 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.530
 us and that's why we are talking 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.350
 about your ability to notice what you 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.660
 it was going to happen that it finally did not happen 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.810
 they gave some apology after this 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.459
 it was possible to demand that the chapter be 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.830
 shown because they could have 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.200
 said today that Miss Latife Soto does not 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.810
 it fell so I 'm not related but we 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.000
 it serves and we throw the sorcerers that fell 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.920
 already latife that did not fall let's forget the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.690
 esteem in which together the wigs clear 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.870
 everything is that conversation no no I 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.480
 I was begging God to show him 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.459
 because I said good to you maybe 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.319
 one minute I said well I am not going to 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.290
 serve because I did not count anything 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.900
 he did not like my participation but 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.030
 after when they went a second time and 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.730
 I saw this situation again and I went back to 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.590
 say it was the trap after that 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.349
 they already communicated with me and there is a 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.819
 mail is written and says latife no 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.099
 fell to the trap itself and we want 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.650
 interview the and against the court of 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.870
 done last night we showed in the program 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.969
 part of the interview that makes you that 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.430
 is the journalist who is behind his 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.989
 own trap where it goes to where latife and 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.310
 they talk about them they recognize they say good 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.439
 we are going to consult the same thing that 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.629
 had said in them know the nascar the 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.359
 true lies program us 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.799
 puzzled with you because you from 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.109
 a beginning it saddens that we were 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.510
 us but there is an acknowledgment of 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:42.199
 production and the day before 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.510
 before yesterday afternoon he called me he called 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:48.919

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:55.250

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.959

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:08.240
 that's what I would have liked 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:11.360
 we will support all who said latif 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.480
 salvation saves a vote to the guild 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.570
 support if I apologize no no it was 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.040
 it was as a vote of support as well as 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.110
 I laughed a lot because in fact you love 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.940
 personally gather three centuries before 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.590
 yes i would like to talk to him and 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.870
 explain why for example between 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.060
 because I am a person that I respect 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.640
 all for example yesterday I met the 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.260

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.090
 he said give me your phone I would like to like 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.889

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.810
 interesting that we see true 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:51.960
 and you present me with your ideas and I 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:54.580
 Yours and I fear we do not speak I have and 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.860
 joining and in fact he told me you should 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.249
 have been a psychologist because you are a 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.249
