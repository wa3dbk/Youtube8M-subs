00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
we need more time to get those bugs to

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.050 
we need more time to get those bugs to
do<00:05:57.030> what<00:05:57.180> you<00:05:57.300> predict<00:05:57.780> an<00:05:57.930> IV<00:05:58.410> I<00:05:59.060> programmed

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.080 

I'll<00:06:05.400> do<00:06:05.700> it

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
I'll do it
