was Ian how how can I keep from making

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.290 
was Ian how how can I keep from making
contact<00:00:30.900> too<00:00:31.140> close<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.949> my<00:00:32.070> body<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:33.120> is

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
contact too close to my body and this is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.010 
contact too close to my body and this is
a<00:00:33.329> really<00:00:33.960> really<00:00:34.559> common<00:00:34.800> mistake<00:00:35.280> among

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
a really really common mistake among

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.229 
a really really common mistake among
club<00:00:37.020> players<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.920> my<00:00:38.070> experience<00:00:38.239> really

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
club players and in my experience really

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.520 
club players and in my experience really
the<00:00:39.300> main<00:00:39.420> problem<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.200> players

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the main problem here is that players

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.560 
the main problem here is that players
fall<00:00:40.860> into<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> rut<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:41.670> fall<00:00:41.879> into<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> pattern

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
fall into a rut they fall into a pattern

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.529 
fall into a rut they fall into a pattern
or<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> habit<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.469> making<00:00:44.460> contact<00:00:45.090> too<00:00:45.270> close

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
or a habit of making contact too close

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.990 
or a habit of making contact too close
and<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.500> them<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.340> becomes<00:00:47.760> their

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and so for them this this becomes their

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.930 
and so for them this this becomes their
home<00:00:48.210> base<00:00:48.539> after<00:00:49.100> you<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> long<00:00:50.520> period

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
home base after you know a long period

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.450 
home base after you know a long period
of<00:00:50.969> time<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.510> hitting<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> wrong<00:00:52.260> spot<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
of time of hitting in the wrong spot the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.160 
of time of hitting in the wrong spot the
wrong<00:00:53.610> contact<00:00:54.180> point<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.719> too<00:00:54.930> close

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
wrong contact point they get too close

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.049 
wrong contact point they get too close
they<00:00:55.350> get<00:00:55.469> jammed<00:00:55.710> they<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.640> over<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.940> over

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
they get jammed they do it over and over

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.000 
they get jammed they do it over and over
again<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.420> becomes<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> habit<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:58.920> you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
again and it becomes a habit so what you

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.860 
again and it becomes a habit so what you
need<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.670> break<00:00:59.910> out<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.329> habit

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
need to do is break out of that habit

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.510 
need to do is break out of that habit
and<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.649> something<00:01:01.980> different<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
and do something different and

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.420 
and do something different and
experience<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.359> other<00:01:03.510> end<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> spectrum

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
experience the other end of the spectrum

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.380 
experience the other end of the spectrum
this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.850> interesting<00:01:06.360> because

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
this is going to be interesting because

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.609 
this is going to be interesting because
we're<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:06.900> quite<00:01:07.080> sure<00:01:07.140> what's<00:01:07.439> going<00:01:07.590> to

little bit closed you're going to know
that's<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.829> case<00:02:02.009> if<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.310> feel<00:02:02.490> jammed<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
I can't even hit because it was too

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190

we go clearly too far away I'm going to

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.080 
we go clearly too far away I'm going to
wait<00:02:50.450> for<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.690> next<00:02:50.810> one<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:52.400> one's<00:02:52.700> also

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
wait for the next one this one's also

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.360 
wait for the next one this one's also
going<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.269> be<00:02:53.420> too<00:02:53.780> far<00:02:53.989> away<00:02:54.260> I'm<00:02:55.190> going<00:02:55.310> to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
going to be too far away I'm going to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.390 
going to be too far away I'm going to
move<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.549> little<00:02:55.640> bit<00:02:55.790> closer<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:58.190> one's

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
move a little bit closer this one's

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.490 
move a little bit closer this one's
going<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.580> be<00:02:58.700> just<00:02:59.060> about<00:02:59.780> right<00:03:00.049> but<00:03:00.260> then<00:03:00.410> it

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
going to be just about right but then it

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.750 
going to be just about right but then it
bounced<00:03:00.799> into<00:03:01.040> me<00:03:01.160> too<00:03:01.370> close

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.009 

this<00:03:04.760> one's<00:03:04.940> also<00:03:05.209> going<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.390> be<00:03:05.540> too<00:03:05.720> close<00:03:05.989> so

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
this one's also going to be too close so

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.949 
this one's also going to be too close so
I'm<00:03:06.260> going<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.410> give<00:03:06.560> myself<00:03:06.680> more<00:03:06.980> room<00:03:09.069> and

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
I'm going to give myself more room and

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.710 
I'm going to give myself more room and
that<00:03:11.959> was<00:03:12.080> just<00:03:12.260> about<00:03:12.440> right<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:14.510> whole

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
that was just about right so the whole

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.199 
that was just about right so the whole
goal<00:03:14.989> here<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:16.040> I've<00:03:16.910> spent<00:03:17.359> a<00:03:17.630> lot<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:17.959> time

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
goal here and I've spent a lot of time

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.770 
goal here and I've spent a lot of time
with<00:03:20.209> my<00:03:20.690> students<00:03:21.260> feeding<00:03:21.799> to<00:03:21.980> them<00:03:22.780> making

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
with my students feeding to them making

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.440 
with my students feeding to them making
them<00:03:24.109> hold<00:03:24.650> their<00:03:24.950> position<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.700> then

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
them hold their position and then

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.390 
them hold their position and then
purposefully<00:03:27.109> deviate<00:03:27.620> my<00:03:27.799> feed<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.310> know

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
purposefully deviate my feed you know

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.150 
purposefully deviate my feed you know
just<00:03:28.609> a<00:03:28.700> tiny<00:03:28.730> bit<00:03:29.359> a<00:03:29.600> little<00:03:30.140> bit<00:03:30.410> one<00:03:30.650> shot<00:03:30.920> at

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
just a tiny bit a little bit one shot at

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.280 
just a tiny bit a little bit one shot at
a<00:03:31.280> time<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.299> they<00:03:32.390> get<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.569> feel<00:03:32.840> for<00:03:33.079> what

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
a time so that they get a feel for what

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.110 
a time so that they get a feel for what
it's<00:03:33.410> like<00:03:33.590> when<00:03:33.829> they're<00:03:33.950> too<00:03:34.100> jammed<00:03:34.370> what

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
it's like when they're too jammed what

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.030 
it's like when they're too jammed what
it's<00:03:35.239> like<00:03:35.390> when<00:03:35.660> it's<00:03:35.810> just<00:03:36.079> right<00:03:36.319> and<00:03:36.560> also

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
it's like when it's just right and also

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.130 
it's like when it's just right and also
what<00:03:37.340> it's<00:03:37.459> like<00:03:37.579> ok<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.540> was<00:03:38.660> too<00:03:38.840> far<00:03:39.019> away

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
what it's like ok that was too far away

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.470 
what it's like ok that was too far away
because<00:03:39.980> typically<00:03:40.579> when<00:03:40.819> players<00:03:41.030> have<00:03:41.329> this

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
because typically when players have this

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.210 
because typically when players have this
problem<00:03:41.810> with<00:03:42.049> being<00:03:42.200> jammed<00:03:42.500> again<00:03:43.010> and

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
problem with being jammed again and

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.670 
problem with being jammed again and
again<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:43.549> again<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:43.940> it's<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.120> habit<00:03:44.680> they

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
again and again and it's a habit they

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.009 
again and again and it's a habit they
never<00:03:46.040> break<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.579> pattern<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.840> ball

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
never break that pattern and the ball

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.129 
never break that pattern and the ball
could<00:03:48.230> be<00:03:48.260> 20<00:03:48.829> feet<00:03:49.010> away<00:03:49.130> they'll<00:03:50.090> run<00:03:50.329> 20<00:03:50.870> and

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
could be 20 feet away they'll run 20 and

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.819 
could be 20 feet away they'll run 20 and
a<00:03:51.410> half<00:03:51.620> feet<00:03:51.859> and<00:03:52.100> again<00:03:52.880> get<00:03:53.180> jammed<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:54.380> my

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
a half feet and again get jammed so my

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.890 
a half feet and again get jammed so my
challenge<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.549> is<00:03:55.910> break<00:03:56.299> out<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.720> that

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
challenge to you is break out of that

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.039 
challenge to you is break out of that
rut<00:03:57.250> do<00:03:58.250> so<00:03:58.489> by<00:03:58.730> purposefully<00:03:59.540> giving

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
rut do so by purposefully giving

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.479 
rut do so by purposefully giving
yourself<00:04:00.380> a<00:04:00.470> couple<00:04:00.769> of<00:04:00.859> shots<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.250> are<00:04:01.370> too

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
yourself a couple of shots that are too

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.660 
yourself a couple of shots that are too
far<00:04:01.519> away<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:02.290> then<00:04:03.290> get<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:04.040> feel<00:04:04.310> for<00:04:04.489> what
