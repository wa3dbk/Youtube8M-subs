00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.100
 yes, on the one hand, too 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.200
 Outside of place they have me well 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.939
 Of course, you also have to record one 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.760
 good feeling gives you if you are immediately 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.930
 well outside sheet that feels comfortable too 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.059
 In any case , a fundamental 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.370
 Also trust directly online 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.590
 are just great players with you 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.500
 can play well where it then makes fun 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 and fun then it usually works 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.590
 also 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.699
 yes i always leave myself over the years 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.250
 I gained far more dominant a piece 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.989
 to play in my own way 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.059
 also something related to that me 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.620
 also from the position yes always one 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.230
 small piece also hiked to the back 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.479
 But most of the time, that means that you too 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.860
 has more and more ball contacts because of 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.170
 Players simply always built up 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.270
 and that is a role that makes 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.940
 I enjoy myself here too and and 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.229
 Grandchildren there I always have my players 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.229
 a piece of forest evolved 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.500
 how are they not really different ? 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 Big real at his club real 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.940
 madrid it's always real case about 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.500
 to win things and that is 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.870
 short-term goals in the season though 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.420
 also longer term over the 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.890
 term also my contract and at the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.530
 Time where I where I am here me 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.040
 of course try the title too 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.570
 win 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.880
 with this team with these club 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.450
 and of course a good one 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.450
 play role 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.700
 our targets a primarily 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.350
 quarterfinal to come 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.270
 with what result in the end that is 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.820
 then actually two three years again 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.650
 make a good game we just want 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.240
 of course, our fans at home 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.740
 present good game and at the end 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.660
 next comes as the result then 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.660
 is that we will see 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.610
 has been 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.680
 they will be related to ours 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.209
 also do not believe your tactics 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.489
 then I think that will be great 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.799
 will indeed only chance give us 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.349
 so take part in throwing everything in it 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.900
 I'm sure I want to play against them too 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.269
 our against dortmund temptation 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.549
 determined by doing well and who 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.989
 In any case, highly motivated 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.319
 opponent of the hard to beat 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.319
 are 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:59.150
 that would be a nice extra that it is in 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.400
 Germany is also for me 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.460
 for me anyway secondary where so 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.360
 Final is the main thing is that we 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.360
 somehow get there
