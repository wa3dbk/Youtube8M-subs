00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
these apps so let's go ahead and try it

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.700 
these apps so let's go ahead and try it
out<00:01:01.420> so<00:01:01.690> if<00:01:01.809> I<00:01:01.900> press<00:01:02.080> one<00:01:02.320> of<00:01:02.350> them<00:01:02.500> you'll<00:01:02.680> see

you have a layout of various options so

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.800 
you have a layout of various options so
we<00:01:05.799> can<00:01:05.920> test<00:01:06.159> one<00:01:06.430> of<00:01:06.520> them<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:06.880> it's<00:01:07.600> very

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
we can test one of them so it's very

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.980 
we can test one of them so it's very
buggy<00:01:08.170> make<00:01:08.830> note<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.729> doesn't<00:01:10.420> work<00:01:10.600> how<00:01:10.810> it

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
surprisingly well so here's my website

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.010 
surprisingly well so here's my website
running<00:01:21.670> if<00:01:22.210> I<00:01:22.299> want<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.539> switch<00:01:22.630> over<00:01:22.929> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
running if I want to switch over the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.800 
running if I want to switch over the
settings<00:01:23.229> real<00:01:23.530> quick<00:01:23.740> go<00:01:23.859> to<00:01:23.890> about<00:01:24.159> tablet

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
settings real quick go to about tablet

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.499 
settings real quick go to about tablet
you'll<00:01:25.810> see<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.170> worked<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.619> let's<00:01:27.070> try<00:01:27.280> doing

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
you'll see it worked and let's try doing

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.029 
you'll see it worked and let's try doing
5<00:01:28.509> times<00:01:29.170> 2<00:01:29.829> equals<00:01:30.810> 10<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.079> then<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.950> have

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
5 times 2 equals 10 and then you have

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.440 
5 times 2 equals 10 and then you have
calendar<00:01:33.490> as<00:01:33.609> well<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:33.909> look<00:01:34.030> at<00:01:34.119> how<00:01:34.179> quick

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
calendar as well and look at how quick

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.209 
calendar as well and look at how quick
and<00:01:34.659> seamless<00:01:34.929> it<00:01:35.289> is<00:01:35.409> to<00:01:35.530> switch<00:01:35.770> between<00:01:36.009> all

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
and seamless it is to switch between all

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.209 
and seamless it is to switch between all
of<00:01:36.579> these<00:01:36.729> various<00:01:37.270> apps<00:01:37.679> it's<00:01:38.679> very<00:01:38.979> easy

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
of these various apps it's very easy

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.859 
of these various apps it's very easy
like<00:01:39.429> I<00:01:39.520> said<00:01:39.670> it's<00:01:39.789> super<00:01:40.090> buggy<00:01:40.329> so<00:01:40.659> there's

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
like I said it's super buggy so there's

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.169 
like I said it's super buggy so there's
no<00:01:40.960> way<00:01:41.079> to<00:01:41.140> configure<00:01:41.679> it<00:01:42.039> if<00:01:42.789> I<00:01:42.939> want<00:01:43.119> to

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
no way to configure it if I want to

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:44.789 
no way to configure it if I want to
close<00:01:43.359> out<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.539> if<00:01:43.719> I<00:01:43.810> press<00:01:44.049> back<00:01:44.350> you'll<00:01:44.619> see

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
close out of if I press back you'll see

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.039 
close out of if I press back you'll see
it<00:01:44.890> closes<00:01:45.189> out<00:01:45.280> of<00:01:45.399> this<00:01:45.549> one<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.869> then

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
it closes out of this one and then

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.139 
it closes out of this one and then
you'll<00:01:47.380> see<00:01:47.619> there<00:01:47.920> we<00:01:48.039> go<00:01:48.219> it<00:01:48.579> just<00:01:48.609> kind<00:01:49.090> of

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
you'll see there we go it just kind of

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.730 
you'll see there we go it just kind of
closed<00:01:49.359> all<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.719> them<00:01:49.810> when<00:01:49.929> I<00:01:49.960> tapped<00:01:50.289> out<00:01:50.560> of

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
closed all of them when I tapped out of

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.230 
closed all of them when I tapped out of
all<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:51.100> them<00:01:51.280> so<00:01:51.549> let's<00:01:51.819> go<00:01:51.909> ahead<00:01:51.969> and<00:01:52.060> try<00:01:52.210> a

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
all of them so let's go ahead and try a

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.389 
all of them so let's go ahead and try a
different<00:01:52.359> layout<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:53.409> going<00:01:53.679> into<00:01:53.859> the<00:01:54.100> Left

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
different layout so going into the Left

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.160 
different layout so going into the Left
layout<00:01:54.819> and<00:01:55.149> like<00:01:55.329> I<00:01:55.420> said<00:01:55.479> it<00:01:55.780> just<00:01:55.929> it's

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
layout and like I said it just it's

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.649 
layout and like I said it just it's
buggy<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:56.979> opens<00:01:57.280> up<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:57.909> other<00:01:58.149> side<00:01:58.509> of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
buggy so it opens up the other side of

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.660 
buggy so it opens up the other side of
another<00:01:58.780> app<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.439> doesn't<00:01:59.679> leave<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.130> open<00:02:00.640> for

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
another app it doesn't leave it open for

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.309 
another app it doesn't leave it open for
another<00:02:01.149> app<00:02:01.329> or<00:02:01.600> if<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.719> want<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:01.929> edit<00:02:02.079> your

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
another app or if you want to edit your

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.679 
another app or if you want to edit your
home<00:02:02.469> screen<00:02:02.829> etc<00:02:02.979> but<00:02:03.850> like<00:02:03.999> I<00:02:04.119> said<00:02:04.299> same<00:02:04.509> as

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
home screen etc but like I said same as

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.139 
home screen etc but like I said same as
before<00:02:05.159> works<00:02:06.159> really<00:02:06.399> well<00:02:06.639> swapping

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
before works really well swapping

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.090 
before works really well swapping
between<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.600> two<00:02:07.810> it's<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.590> really<00:02:08.920> nice

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
between the two it's a really nice

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.590 
between the two it's a really nice
preview<00:02:09.460> I<00:02:09.700> don't<00:02:09.819> know<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:09.940> didn't<00:02:10.210> include<00:02:10.330> it

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
preview I don't know I didn't include it

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.150 
preview I don't know I didn't include it
just<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.960> preview<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.440> mean<00:02:11.710> like<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:11.980> said

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
just to the preview I mean like I said

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.280 
just to the preview I mean like I said
super<00:02:12.520> buggy<00:02:12.880> there's<00:02:13.180> really<00:02:13.330> no<00:02:13.510> usability

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
super buggy there's really no usability

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.660 
super buggy there's really no usability
of<00:02:14.409> it<00:02:14.530> just<00:02:14.680> because<00:02:14.950> see<00:02:15.099> look<00:02:15.250> at<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.430> backed

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.369 
of it just because see look at I backed
out<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:15.879> it<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.150> there's<00:02:16.269> settings<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.290> the

out of it and there's settings in the

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.390 
out of it and there's settings in the
bottom<00:02:17.709> left-hand<00:02:18.010> corner

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
randomly no big deal though just because

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.770 
randomly no big deal though just because
hey<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.340> just<00:02:21.579> a<00:02:21.700> nice<00:02:21.849> preview<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.569> then

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
hey it's just a nice preview and then

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.449 
hey it's just a nice preview and then
you'll<00:02:22.900> notice<00:02:23.170> when<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.769> actually<00:02:24.040> press<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
you'll notice when I actually press it

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.280 
you'll notice when I actually press it
again<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.909> box<00:02:25.180> goes<00:02:25.510> away<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.900> actually<00:02:26.140> just

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290

which<00:02:43.659> is<00:02:43.689> great<00:02:44.109> for<00:02:44.349> tablets<00:02:44.859> so<00:02:45.459> I've

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
which is great for tablets so I've

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.059 
which is great for tablets so I've
enabled<00:02:45.879> it<00:02:46.180> let's<00:02:46.450> go<00:02:46.629> ahead<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.230> try<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
enabled it let's go ahead and try and

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.679 
enabled it let's go ahead and try and
you'll<00:02:48.280> see<00:02:48.489> here<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.819> is<00:02:48.849> so<00:02:49.299> here's<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
you'll see here it is so here's the

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.740 
you'll see here it is so here's the
split<00:02:50.170> layout<00:02:50.680> on<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.639> Nexus<00:02:52.000> 9<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.569> more

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
split layout on the Nexus 9 this is more

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.250 
split layout on the Nexus 9 this is more
tablet<00:02:53.349> centered<00:02:54.040> I'm<00:02:54.250> sure<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:55.720> makes<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.109> so

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
tablet centered I'm sure it makes it so

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.619 
tablet centered I'm sure it makes it so
much<00:02:56.319> easier<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.799> just<00:02:56.829> when<00:02:57.250> you're<00:02:57.370> in

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
much easier to just when you're in

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.550 
much easier to just when you're in
horizontal<00:02:58.629> as<00:02:58.690> opposed<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:58.959> vertical<00:02:59.379> this

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
horizontal as opposed to vertical this

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.960 
horizontal as opposed to vertical this
is<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:01.540> test<00:03:02.170> obviously<00:03:03.099> it's<00:03:03.220> very<00:03:03.280> hard<00:03:03.730> with

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
is a test obviously it's very hard with

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.000 
is a test obviously it's very hard with
the<00:03:04.629> camera<00:03:05.109> in<00:03:05.170> front<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.409> me<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.590> type<00:03:05.769> but

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
the camera in front of me to type but

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.649 
the camera in front of me to type but
there<00:03:06.129> you<00:03:06.220> go<00:03:06.250> so<00:03:06.609> obviously<00:03:07.000> with<00:03:07.540> it

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
there you go so obviously with it

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.690 
there you go so obviously with it
horizontal<00:03:08.139> you<00:03:08.319> can<00:03:08.530> essentially<00:03:09.069> reach<00:03:09.459> all

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
horizontal you can essentially reach all

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.789 
horizontal you can essentially reach all
of<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.150> keys<00:03:10.420> on<00:03:10.689> your<00:03:10.780> keyboard<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:11.650> that's

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
of the keys on your keyboard so that's

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.379 
of the keys on your keyboard so that's
really<00:03:11.980> about<00:03:12.159> it<00:03:12.220> just<00:03:12.909> want<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.120> show<00:03:13.299> you
