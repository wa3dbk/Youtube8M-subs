stirring<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.020> about<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.320> week<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.860> think

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
stirring that in about a week I think

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.090

that but I really think they're going to
be<00:01:48.450> live<00:01:48.720> streaming<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> week<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.590> should

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
be live streaming in a week I should

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.370 
be live streaming in a week I should
probably<00:01:50.310> double<00:01:50.670> check<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.810> know<00:01:51.930> back

interesting like is that going to be

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.180 
interesting like is that going to be
something<00:06:09.750> we<00:06:09.960> require<00:06:10.380> in<00:06:10.590> the<00:06:10.680> raid<00:06:10.830> or<00:06:11.010> what

something we require in the raid or what

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.010 
something we require in the raid or what
to<00:06:11.669> have<00:06:11.789> one<00:06:11.820> player<00:06:12.300> walking<00:06:12.570> around<00:06:12.810> with<00:06:12.990> a

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
to have one player walking around with a

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.629 
to have one player walking around with a
sword<00:06:13.320> deflecting<00:06:13.889> all<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.070> bullets<00:06:14.550> that

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
sword deflecting all the bullets that

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.040 
sword deflecting all the bullets that
are<00:06:14.700> incoming<00:06:15.030> arrows<00:06:15.270> while<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:15.840> older

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
are incoming arrows while the older

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.230 
are incoming arrows while the older
players<00:06:16.349> shootout<00:06:16.710> killing<00:06:17.070> the<00:06:17.160> enemies<00:06:17.430> it

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
players shootout killing the enemies it

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.370 
players shootout killing the enemies it
sounds<00:06:18.450> like<00:06:18.479> a<00:06:18.570> really<00:06:18.780> interesting<00:06:19.050> game

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
sounds like a really interesting game

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.930 
sounds like a really interesting game
changer<00:06:19.740> and<00:06:19.919> if<00:06:20.010> that<00:06:20.190> sword<00:06:20.430> is<00:06:20.520> done<00:06:20.729> right

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
changer and if that sword is done right

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.879 
changer and if that sword is done right
I<00:06:21.180> can't<00:06:21.570> wait<00:06:21.720> for<00:06:21.750> it<00:06:21.990> I<00:06:22.139> kind<00:06:22.560> of<00:06:22.650> hope<00:06:22.770> it

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
I can't wait for it I kind of hope it

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.469 
I can't wait for it I kind of hope it
has<00:06:22.979> an<00:06:23.070> attack<00:06:23.310> as<00:06:23.490> well<00:06:23.639> if<00:06:23.820> it<00:06:23.940> only<00:06:24.180> does

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
has an attack as well if it only does

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.440 
has an attack as well if it only does
defending<00:06:25.080> then<00:06:25.760> it's<00:06:26.760> not<00:06:26.880> really<00:06:26.940> a<00:06:27.150> sword

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
defending then it's not really a sword

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.400 
defending then it's not really a sword
is<00:06:27.570> it<00:06:27.720> they<00:06:27.780> probably<00:06:27.990> should<00:06:28.169> have<00:06:28.229> made<00:06:28.380> a

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
is it they probably should have made a

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.879 
is it they probably should have made a
shield<00:06:28.830> I<00:06:29.099> don't<00:06:29.639> know<00:06:29.900> but<00:06:30.900> yeah<00:06:31.020> I<00:06:31.289> think

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
shield I don't know but yeah I think

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.560 
shield I don't know but yeah I think
that's<00:06:32.250> pretty<00:06:32.370> much<00:06:32.520> it<00:06:32.610> from<00:06:32.849> me<00:06:33.030> for<00:06:33.330> new

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570
