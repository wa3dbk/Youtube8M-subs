00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.890
 two 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.540
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.450
 video we are going to show you how to cut 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.190
 Nail your cat in an easy and 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.170
 safe for him with a nail clipper 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.960
 traditional like the one we 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.880
 we use to cut our nails and 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.820
 good as you can see here is my 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:29.050
 kitty siam playing with the nail clippers with 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.910
 him and getting acquainted with him so he does not 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.640
 it is difficult for him to cut 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.310
 your nails and know that it's not dangerous 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.530
 for him so I leave them with gio to 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.480
 to show them how to cut their nails like this 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.460
 as the principles we are going to teach them 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.859
 how to cut our cat's nails 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.870
 an easy and simple and correct way 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.030
 which is the most important thing as you can see 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.579
 here on my ipad we have here what is 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.920
 a picture of where we have to cut already 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.539
 that in other videos maybe they have seen 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.309
 that they simply and simply made 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.109
 cat and they teach him counting his nails 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.089
 but they tell us where we have to cut 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:08.090
 well as you can see we have to cut 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.649
 is before where is the curvature of the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.719
 nail that is where we need to cut 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.060
 correctly so as not to hurt our 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.710
 kitten the first thing we have to do 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.810
 it is simply and simply disinfect what 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.960
 what to do nail clippers we're going to use here 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.270
 what is a toothpick for 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.270
 disinfect what it is to be nail clippers 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.360
 let's clean it very well 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.090
 to avoid infections to our cat and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.750
 all those things to make a cut 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.750
 cleansed 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.840
 so I 'm going to look for my cat and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.060
 we return with you and well my friends 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.369
 We already have our kitten here a little 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.369
 restless they do not like you 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.970
 manipulate what the nails and well we are going to 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.100
 teach him here what the claw is 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.370
 as you can see simple simply 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.200
 we press here what is the pad 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.750
 here below and we do a little bit of 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.320
 force the finger and as you can see they go 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.670
 coming out what are the nails and here 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.280
 where is the white is where are we going to 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.070
 make the cut as you can see the nail is 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.260
 like something pink in the end that we can not 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.030
 cut what we are going to cut what is 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.319
 practically the tip like here 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.319
 let's catch our cat 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.300
 calm with a lot of patience we are going to 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.660
 squeeze here as I told them and we're going to 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.660
 cut 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.570
 here 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.500
 with a lot of patience 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.730
 we cut 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.850
 and the one that is 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.390
 I understand here back 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.660
 let's see if they can do it and they're already 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.660
 to take out 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.549
 this is costing a little work 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.180
 by the position of the cat we are going to flip 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.180
 a little 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.580
 let's see if we can cut it 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.250
 with patience in the rings 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.500
 to this one and how can you see 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.460
 already have the nails what are cut 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.270
 As you can see the cuts are before 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.550
 where is the curvature of the nail like 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.230
 can see is very easy he stayed 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.120
 pretty still 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.280
 and what we are going to do now is simple and 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.519
 just use what is a bit of 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.519
 alcohol 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.220
 always simply to clean what 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.220
 what are the pretty ones 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.269
 if anything we happened or something more of the 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.550
 account still makes therefore always 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.090
 simply to avoid what they are 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.580
 infections 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.140
 we clean the little girls here and if 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.680
 they prefer they can also file 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.599
 the nails with a nail file so that 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.540
 more rounded and well my friends 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.910
 As you can see it is very easy and very 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.100
 simple to really do that look 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.739
 our cat is perfectly fine 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.750
 he was perfectly calm not 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.940
 annoying or nothing 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.900
