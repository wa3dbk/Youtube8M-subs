the sharks the reefs are going to suffer

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.300 
the sharks the reefs are going to suffer
they're<00:02:34.439> not<00:02:34.590> going<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.799> be<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.099> pretty

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
they're not going to be as pretty

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.130 
they're not going to be as pretty
they're<00:02:35.549> not<00:02:35.670> going<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:35.909> be<00:02:36.030> as<00:02:36.269> abundant<00:02:36.840> with

other fish life

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.810 
other fish life
and<00:02:38.280> colors<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.720> Sharks<00:02:40.110> are<00:02:41.040> something

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
and colors so the Sharks are something

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.120 
and colors so the Sharks are something
that<00:02:41.850> we<00:02:41.940> really<00:02:42.060> enjoy<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.780> sea<00:02:42.960> but<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
that we really enjoy the sea but the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.010 
that we really enjoy the sea but the
rest<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.550> reef<00:02:44.730> system<00:02:45.120> will<00:02:45.450> fall<00:02:45.750> and

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
rest of the reef system will fall and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.730 
rest of the reef system will fall and
therefore<00:02:46.890> if<00:02:47.580> shark<00:02:48.420> fishing<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:49.020> allowed<00:02:49.080> in

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
therefore if shark fishing is allowed in

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.940 
therefore if shark fishing is allowed in
the<00:02:49.830> Bahamas<00:02:50.360> well<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.140> wouldn't<00:02:52.740> want<00:02:52.890> to

to<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.740> Bahamas<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:12.200> think<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.230> sharks<00:03:13.800> of

to the Bahamas I think that sharks of
the<00:03:14.130> Bahamas<00:03:14.550> are<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.790> national<00:03:15.090> treasure<00:03:15.390> and

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
the Bahamas are a national treasure and

actually an international treasure and
the<00:03:17.960> bahamas<00:03:18.960> should<00:03:18.990> be<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.230> shark<00:03:19.530> sanctuary

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340
