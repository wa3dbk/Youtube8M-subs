guitars<00:03:41.240> my<00:03:41.840> experience<00:03:42.290> I<00:03:42.410> see<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:42.680> this

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
guitars my experience I see that this

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.790 
guitars my experience I see that this
one<00:03:43.070> works<00:03:43.280> is<00:03:43.550> very<00:03:43.880> Universal<00:03:44.240> tool<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
one works is very Universal tool so the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.590 
one works is very Universal tool so the
mid<00:03:45.950> tension<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.520> the<00:03:46.640> valve<00:03:46.850> if<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:47.330> want<00:03:47.510> to

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
mid tension of the valve if you want to

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.949 
mid tension of the valve if you want to
use<00:03:47.720> only<00:03:47.900> one<00:03:48.020> set<00:03:48.500> they<00:03:48.890> take<00:03:49.700> this<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.180> of

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
use only one set they take this and of

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.960 
use only one set they take this and of
course<00:03:50.990> is<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.620> best<00:03:51.860> option<00:03:52.280> for<00:03:52.310> basis

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
course is the best option for basis

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:17.680 
course is the best option for basis
because<00:03:53.180> it's<00:03:53.480> a

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.539 

second-string<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:18.900> very<00:04:19.169> interesting<00:04:19.799> this

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
second-string is very interesting this

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.200 
second-string is very interesting this
Aquila<00:04:21.359> one<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.380> basis<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.340> retention

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
Aquila one so the basis and retention

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.190 
Aquila one so the basis and retention
only<00:04:25.139> and<00:04:25.320> therefore<00:04:26.190> in<00:04:27.060> case<00:04:27.419> you<00:04:28.020> don't

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
only and therefore in case you don't

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.670 
only and therefore in case you don't
have<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.830> then<00:04:29.100> we<00:04:29.280> can<00:04:29.430> also<00:04:29.580> use<00:04:30.230> why<00:04:31.230> not<00:04:31.440> a

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
have that then we can also use why not a

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.080 
have that then we can also use why not a
story<00:04:32.280> set<00:04:32.639> to<00:04:33.330> practice<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.650> value<00:04:35.639> that

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
story set to practice the value that

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.860 
story set to practice the value that
area<00:04:36.950> mid<00:04:37.950> pensioners<00:04:38.610> well<00:04:38.850> for<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.450> basis

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
area mid pensioners well for the basis

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.530 
area mid pensioners well for the basis
that's<00:04:40.200> a<00:04:40.380> good<00:04:40.560> substitute<00:04:40.860> of<00:04:41.340> this<00:04:41.550> because

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
that's a good substitute of this because

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.330 
that's a good substitute of this because
this<00:04:42.720> monthly<00:04:43.080> well<00:04:43.320> this<00:04:43.470> discussed<00:04:44.070> three

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
this monthly well this discussed three

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.460 
this monthly well this discussed three
times<00:04:44.580> more<00:04:44.850> but<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.150> so<00:04:45.540> much<00:04:45.720> more<00:04:45.900> quality

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
times more but is so much more quality

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.650 
times more but is so much more quality
this<00:04:47.250> is<00:04:47.310> training<00:04:47.700> but<00:04:47.940> anyway<00:04:48.330> in<00:04:48.630> case

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
this is training but anyway in case

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.140 
this is training but anyway in case
there's<00:04:49.050> no<00:04:49.290> data<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.889> can<00:04:50.040> use<00:04:50.070> meet<00:04:50.669> pension

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
there's no data you can use meet pension

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.520 
there's no data you can use meet pension
of<00:04:51.270> autonomy<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:51.990> could<00:04:52.169> possibly

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
of autonomy and I could possibly

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.190 
of autonomy and I could possibly
description<00:04:53.070> all<00:04:53.280> those<00:04:53.520> links<00:04:53.790> so<00:04:54.150> this<00:04:55.050> is

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
description all those links so this is

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.310 
description all those links so this is

the particular feature of this may be

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.409 
the particular feature of this may be
friendly<00:04:58.919> tasks<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.550> are<00:04:59.850> designed<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.330> be
