liked the look of the shoes without the
green<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.440> thought<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.920> would<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
green I thought it would just be a

green I thought it would just be a
better<00:00:50.610> look<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:51.059> black<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.570> could<00:00:51.899> have

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the green actually another option would

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.139 
the green actually another option would
have<00:00:57.329> been<00:00:57.420> cool<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:57.899> would<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.350> been<00:00:58.440> the

second one as a follow-up very soon but
that's<00:02:01.710> pretty<00:02:01.920> much<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.189> let's<00:02:02.369> go<00:02:02.460> ahead<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that's pretty much it let's go ahead and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.420 
that's pretty much it let's go ahead and
get<00:02:02.880> into<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:04.350> customization<00:02:05.159> I'm<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.369> to

get into the customization I'm going to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.399 
get into the customization I'm going to
time-lapse<00:02:05.640> parts<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> unfortunately<00:02:07.380> I

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
time-lapse parts of it unfortunately I

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.169 
time-lapse parts of it unfortunately I
won't<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:07.829> an<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.099> foot<00:02:08.340> video<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.940> one

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
won't have an on foot video for this one

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.990 
won't have an on foot video for this one
because<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.929> ended<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.440> ripping<00:02:10.950> off<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.610> fly

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
because I ended up ripping off the fly

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.309 
because I ended up ripping off the fly
wire

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
wire

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.170 
wire
mediately<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:13.829> i<00:02:13.859> will<00:02:14.069> have<00:02:14.249> an<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.790> feet<00:02:14.999> of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
mediately but i will have an on feet of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.300 
mediately but i will have an on feet of
the<00:02:15.269> second<00:02:15.659> video<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.170> stay<00:02:16.799> tuned<00:02:17.099> for<00:02:17.280> that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the second video so stay tuned for that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.830 
the second video so stay tuned for that
but<00:02:17.579> going<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.239> ahead<00:02:18.329> and<00:02:18.510> get<00:02:18.599> into<00:02:18.749> it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
but going to go ahead and get into it

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.300 
but going to go ahead and get into it
basically<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.439> need<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.620> use<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.099> leather

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
basically you need to use the leather

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.819 
basically you need to use the leather
prepare<00:02:20.819> Andy<00:02:21.209> Glaser<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.749> a<00:02:22.409> cotton<00:02:22.709> ball

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
prepare Andy Glaser and a cotton ball

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.440 
prepare Andy Glaser and a cotton ball
and<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.069> just<00:02:23.189> rub<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.430> all<00:02:23.670> over<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.120> midsole

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
and you just rub it all over the midsole

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.520 
and you just rub it all over the midsole
area<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.959> you're<00:02:25.049> going<00:02:25.079> to<00:02:25.230> be<00:02:25.290> painting

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
area that you're going to be painting

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.649 
area that you're going to be painting
basically<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.519> is<00:02:26.700> making<00:02:26.969> it<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.480> will

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
basically this is making it so it will

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.140 
basically this is making it so it will
adhere<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.499> the<00:02:28.769> midsole<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.730> little<00:02:30.060> bit

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
adhere to the midsole a little bit

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.709 
adhere to the midsole a little bit
easier<00:02:30.480> than<00:02:31.010> without<00:02:32.010> using<00:02:32.609> this<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.540> it's

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
easier than without using this so it's

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.020 
easier than without using this so it's
definitely<00:02:34.019> important<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.379> do<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.790> can

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
definitely important to do and you can

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.670 
definitely important to do and you can
see<00:02:36.209> from<00:02:36.629> doing<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.109> actually<00:02:37.260> removes

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
see from doing that it actually removes

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.140 
see from doing that it actually removes
some<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.219> the<00:02:38.370> black<00:02:38.549> paint<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.909> was<00:02:39.000> already

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
some of the black paint that was already

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.179 
some of the black paint that was already
on<00:02:39.239> part<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:39.989> midsole<00:02:40.260> which<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:40.889> okay<00:02:41.129> you

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
on part of the midsole which is okay you

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.860 
on part of the midsole which is okay you
don't<00:02:41.370> have<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.579> remove<00:02:41.760> all<00:02:41.969> of<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.389> then

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
don't have to remove all of it and then

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.720 
don't have to remove all of it and then
you<00:02:42.989> just<00:02:43.169> basically<00:02:43.290> throw<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.069> layer<00:02:44.489> of

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
you just basically throw on a layer of

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.440 
you just basically throw on a layer of
the<00:02:45.359> black<00:02:46.019> jet<00:02:46.919> black<00:02:47.129> leather<00:02:47.400> dye<00:02:47.700> again

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
the black jet black leather dye again

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.849 
the black jet black leather dye again

basically<00:02:50.609> it's<00:02:50.849> it's<00:02:51.060> really<00:02:51.239> simple<00:02:51.569> to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
basically it's it's really simple to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.479 
basically it's it's really simple to
paint<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.319> on<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.799> like<00:02:52.980> kind<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.370> a

glossy err look you could actually

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.740 
glossy err look you could actually
finish<00:02:55.859> with<00:02:56.639> this<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.060> end<00:02:57.269> here<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.599> not

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.640 
black in just a second after I finish
both<00:03:06.389> of<00:03:06.449> them<00:03:06.629> but<00:03:06.750> here's<00:03:07.199> kind<00:03:07.409> of<00:03:07.439> a<00:03:07.530> look

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
both of them but here's kind of a look

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.129 
both of them but here's kind of a look
it's<00:03:07.829> not<00:03:07.949> dry<00:03:08.280> yet<00:03:08.519> but<00:03:08.699> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.909> see<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.989> of

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
it's not dry yet but you can see and of

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.289 
it's not dry yet but you can see and of
course<00:03:10.349> if<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.680> careful<00:03:11.129> or<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.400> are<00:03:11.639> the

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
course if the careful or you are the

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.849 
course if the careful or you are the
better<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.810> these<00:03:13.139> will<00:03:13.349> end<00:03:13.560> up<00:03:13.709> looking

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
better that these will end up looking

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.890 
better that these will end up looking
but<00:03:14.189> this<00:03:14.340> was<00:03:14.489> drying<00:03:15.389> a<00:03:15.510> little<00:03:15.689> bit<00:03:15.780> and

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
but this was drying a little bit and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.179 
but this was drying a little bit and
it's<00:03:16.019> kind<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.290> an<00:03:16.409> up-close<00:03:16.739> look<00:03:16.859> and<00:03:17.129> you

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
it's kind of an up-close look and you

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.089 
it's kind of an up-close look and you
can<00:03:17.310> see<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.579> took<00:03:17.849> pretty<00:03:18.509> well<00:03:18.689> to<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.919> thing

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
can see it took pretty well to the thing

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.979 
can see it took pretty well to the thing
I<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.459> some<00:03:20.819> of<00:03:20.909> the<00:03:20.970> areas<00:03:21.090> needed<00:03:21.659> to<00:03:21.750> dry

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
I just some of the areas needed to dry

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.920 
I just some of the areas needed to dry
and<00:03:22.259> all<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.340> all<00:03:23.489> like<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.030> pretty<00:03:24.329> easy<00:03:24.419> pretty

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
and all in all like a pretty easy pretty

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.219 
and all in all like a pretty easy pretty
simple<00:03:25.349> project<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:27.000> this<00:03:27.299> was<00:03:27.479> a<00:03:27.509> like<00:03:27.870> I

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
simple project this this was a like I

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.039 
simple project this this was a like I
got<00:03:29.040> home<00:03:29.189> from<00:03:29.220> after<00:03:29.639> after<00:03:30.359> work<00:03:30.569> and<00:03:30.840> stuff

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
got home from after after work and stuff

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.509 
got home from after after work and stuff
and<00:03:31.199> started<00:03:31.470> working<00:03:31.650> on<00:03:31.799> this<00:03:31.949> project<00:03:32.009> and

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
and started working on this project and

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.809 
and started working on this project and
knocked<00:03:33.299> this<00:03:33.449> out<00:03:33.659> in<00:03:34.290> one<00:03:34.500> night<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:35.099> pretty

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
knocked this out in one night so pretty

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.789 
knocked this out in one night so pretty
pretty<00:03:36.239> easy<00:03:36.419> to<00:03:36.540> do<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:36.989> if<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:37.169> only<00:03:37.379> do<00:03:37.590> one

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
pretty easy to do and if you only do one

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.649 
pretty easy to do and if you only do one
layer<00:03:38.009> and<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.609> like<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:38.849> like<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.299> then

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
layer and you like it like this then

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.479 
layer and you like it like this then
then<00:03:40.259> you<00:03:40.379> don't<00:03:40.560> have<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.799> do<00:03:40.889> too<00:03:41.040> too<00:03:41.340> much

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
then you don't have to do too too much

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.550 
then you don't have to do too too much
else<00:03:41.699> I<00:03:41.909> personally<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.079> flat<00:03:43.319> black

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
else I personally like the flat black

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.289 
else I personally like the flat black
look<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.009> it's<00:03:44.189> worth<00:03:44.370> doing<00:03:44.729> an<00:03:44.849> extra<00:03:45.120> layer

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
look so it's worth doing an extra layer

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.259 
look so it's worth doing an extra layer
of<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.989> flat<00:03:46.229> black<00:03:46.409> pink<00:03:46.680> for<00:03:47.009> myself<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.609> so

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
of the flat black pink for myself and so

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.219 
of the flat black pink for myself and so
that's<00:03:48.419> what<00:03:48.599> I'm<00:03:48.689> going<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.900> end<00:03:49.019> up<00:03:49.049> doing

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
that's what I'm going to end up doing

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.830 
that's what I'm going to end up doing
and<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:50.430> mean<00:03:50.790> I'm<00:03:51.030> curious<00:03:51.449> how<00:03:51.599> they<00:03:51.720> would

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
and I mean I'm curious how they would

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.899 
and I mean I'm curious how they would
have<00:03:51.959> came<00:03:52.139> or<00:03:52.979> looked<00:03:53.159> if<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.430> did<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.669> cream

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
have came or looked if I did the cream

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.399 
have came or looked if I did the cream
color<00:03:54.120> as<00:03:54.329> well<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.079> would<00:03:55.199> have<00:03:55.259> been<00:03:55.319> a

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
color as well that would have been a

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.800 
color as well that would have been a
cool<00:03:55.620> option<00:03:55.799> but<00:03:56.159> flat<00:03:56.759> black<00:03:56.939> it<00:03:57.090> was<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.599> so

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
cool option but flat black it was and so

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.469 
cool option but flat black it was and so
I<00:03:58.139> kind<00:03:58.949> of<00:03:59.009> move<00:03:59.729> there's<00:03:59.939> a<00:04:00.000> wife<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.389> the

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479 
I kind of move there's a wife in the

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:01.969 
I kind of move there's a wife in the
backdrop<00:04:00.780> as<00:04:01.079> you<00:04:01.199> see<00:04:01.379> right<00:04:01.409> there<00:04:01.560> as<00:04:01.799> you

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
backdrop as you see right there as you

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.589 
backdrop as you see right there as you
get<00:04:02.099> in<00:04:02.159> the<00:04:02.250> fridge<00:04:02.430> but<00:04:02.969> basically<00:04:03.359> I<00:04:03.389> just

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
get in the fridge but basically I just

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.420 
get in the fridge but basically I just
do<00:04:03.780> one<00:04:03.959> layer<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.859> you<00:04:04.979> could<00:04:05.129> probably<00:04:05.250> do

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
do one layer and you could probably do

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.949 
do one layer and you could probably do
two<00:04:05.609> but<00:04:05.849> one<00:04:06.000> layer<00:04:06.150> is<00:04:06.299> all<00:04:06.419> I<00:04:06.449> needed<00:04:06.719> really

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
two but one layer is all I needed really

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.159 
two but one layer is all I needed really
and<00:04:07.639> when<00:04:08.639> you<00:04:08.729> dip<00:04:08.879> the<00:04:09.000> brush<00:04:09.150> into<00:04:09.479> the

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
and when you dip the brush into the

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.080 
and when you dip the brush into the
thing<00:04:10.439> just<00:04:10.650> kind<00:04:10.829> of<00:04:10.949> DAB<00:04:11.609> it<00:04:11.639> against<00:04:11.969> the

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
thing just kind of DAB it against the

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.749 
thing just kind of DAB it against the
edges<00:04:12.449> of<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:13.289> the<00:04:13.560> bottle<00:04:13.889> and<00:04:14.039> then<00:04:14.489> you<00:04:14.609> can

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:14.759 
edges of the the bottle and then you can

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.159 
edges of the the bottle and then you can
just<00:04:14.879> kind<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.120> use<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.449> edge<00:04:15.569> of<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.810> bottle

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
just kind of use the edge of the bottle

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.259 
just kind of use the edge of the bottle
instead<00:04:16.889> of<00:04:17.009> dipping<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.519> entire<00:04:17.789> brush<00:04:18.090> in

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
instead of dipping the entire brush in

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.729 
instead of dipping the entire brush in
so<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.509> don't<00:04:18.539> get<00:04:18.780> too<00:04:18.930> much<00:04:19.079> kind<00:04:19.650> of

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
so you don't get too much kind of

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.680 
so you don't get too much kind of
controls<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.310> amount<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:21.269> you<00:04:21.389> have<00:04:21.419> in

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
controls the amount that you have in

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.149 
controls the amount that you have in
there<00:04:21.810> now<00:04:22.289> that<00:04:22.500> that<00:04:22.590> part<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:22.919> done<00:04:23.039> I'm

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
there now that that part is done I'm

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.200 
there now that that part is done I'm
going<00:04:23.219> to<00:04:23.340> go<00:04:23.430> ahead<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:23.789> show<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.000> guys<00:04:24.060> the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
going to go ahead and show you guys the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.420 
going to go ahead and show you guys the
flat<00:04:24.630> black<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.440> can<00:04:25.590> definitely<00:04:25.830> see<00:04:26.219> it's<00:04:26.370> a

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
flat black you can definitely see it's a

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.170 
flat black you can definitely see it's a
big<00:04:26.610> different

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
big different

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.030 
big different
and<00:04:27.300> definitely<00:04:27.720> preferable<00:04:28.110> in<00:04:28.500> my<00:04:28.620> opinion

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
and definitely preferable in my opinion

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.010 
and definitely preferable in my opinion
because<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.700> doesn't<00:04:30.150> have<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.300> crazy<00:04:30.660> shine

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
because it doesn't have that crazy shine

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.290 
because it doesn't have that crazy shine
look<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.190> it's<00:04:32.610> just<00:04:32.790> a<00:04:32.880> little<00:04:33.000> bit<00:04:33.150> more

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
look to it it's just a little bit more

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.110 
look to it it's just a little bit more
subtle<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.930> easygoing<00:04:34.920> on<00:04:35.280> my<00:04:35.640> eyes<00:04:35.820> at<00:04:36.000> least

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
subtle and easygoing on my eyes at least

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.200 
subtle and easygoing on my eyes at least
so<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:36.600> definitely<00:04:37.470> like<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.980> like<00:04:38.100> this<00:04:38.310> worth
