is<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:09.179> serval<00:00:09.599> extension<00:00:10.019> wire<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:11.340> want

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
is a serval extension wire and you want

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.580 
is a serval extension wire and you want
to<00:00:11.730> disconnect<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.660> middle<00:00:12.960> one<00:00:13.110> which<00:00:13.410> is

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
to disconnect the middle one which is

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.700 
to disconnect the middle one which is
the<00:00:13.799> red<00:00:13.980> one<00:00:14.509> you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.660> either<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.260> using

lip on the on the backside of this and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.490 
lip on the on the backside of this and
you<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.090> slide<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.510> out<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:25.289> somehow

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
you can slide that out but somehow

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.000 
you can slide that out but somehow
eliminate<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.760> red<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.320> okay<00:00:28.320> then<00:00:28.830> we're

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
eliminate the red one okay then we're

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.640 
eliminate the red one okay then we're
going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.189> use<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.460> battery<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:31.109> external

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
safety and then you wanna eliminate pull

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.439 
safety and then you wanna eliminate pull
out<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:55.340> throttle<00:00:56.340> or<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:57.030> ESC

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
out this is your throttle or your ESC

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.799 
out this is your throttle or your ESC
want<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.050> pull<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:59.059> okay<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:00.329> what

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
want to pull that out okay and then what

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.990 
want to pull that out okay and then what
you<00:01:00.960> want<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:01.410> next<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.489> servo<00:01:02.730> wire

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you want to do next is the servo wire

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.289 
you want to do next is the servo wire
that<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.329> put<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.769> unplug<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.700> fat

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
that we put in that we unplug the fat

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.660 
that we put in that we unplug the fat
bottom<00:01:06.900> at<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.530> bottom<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.040> right<00:01:08.070> there

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
bottom at the bottom one right there

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.190 
bottom at the bottom one right there
we're<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> plug<00:01:09.830> plug<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
we're going to plug plug this in and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.570 
we're going to plug plug this in and
then<00:01:13.200> plug<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.070> right<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.700> throttle<00:01:15.150> back<00:01:15.450> in

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
then plug it right the throttle back in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.149 
then plug it right the throttle back in
without<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:18.360> wire<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:19.020> essentially<00:01:20.009> what

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
without that wire on essentially what

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
without that wire on essentially what
this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.400> doing<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.970> illuminating<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.930> back

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
this is doing is illuminating the back

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.310 
this is doing is illuminating the back
on<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.799> speed<00:01:23.159> control<00:01:23.659> because<00:01:24.659> both<00:01:25.140> of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
on your speed control because both of

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.600 
on your speed control because both of
them<00:01:25.439> are<00:01:25.560> talking<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.130> they're<00:01:26.250> not<00:01:26.369> talking

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
them are talking and they're not talking

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.819 
them are talking and they're not talking
in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.909> same<00:01:27.060> language<00:01:27.119> basically<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.350> it's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
in the same language basically and it's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.520 
in the same language basically and it's
getting<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:29.250> messed<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.900> want<00:01:31.110> to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
getting all messed up so you want to

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.940 
getting all messed up so you want to
eliminate<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.670> back<00:01:32.880> by<00:01:33.270> using<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.950> then

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
eliminate the back by using that then

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.590 
eliminate the back by using that then
the<00:01:35.100> next<00:01:35.369> thing<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:35.729> we're<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.329> is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the next thing what we're going to do is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.789 
the next thing what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:38.000> plug<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.060> our<00:01:40.220> our<00:01:41.329> external

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
we're going to plug in our our external

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.080 
we're going to plug in our our external
BECU<00:01:43.799> back<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.310> we're<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> plug<00:01:45.060> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
BECU back and we're going to plug that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.510 
BECU back and we're going to plug that
right<00:01:45.240> into<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.689> bind<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> bind<00:01:47.189> right

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
right into the bind see the bind right

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.590 
right into the bind see the bind right
there<00:01:47.729> we're<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.180> plug<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.540> right

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
there we're going to plug that right

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.600 
there we're going to plug that right
into<00:01:48.869> there<00:01:51.890> okay<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:52.950> once<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.490> it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
into there okay so once you have it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.100 
into there okay so once you have it
plugged<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.119> you're<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.689> move<00:01:54.869> over<00:01:55.079> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
plugged in you're going to move over to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.920 
plugged in you're going to move over to
your<00:01:55.259> radio<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:57.299> want<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.719> make<00:01:57.899> sure

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
your radio and you want to make sure

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.910 
your radio and you want to make sure
that<00:01:58.350> you're<00:01:58.560> also<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.969> servo<00:02:00.479> setup<00:02:00.920> that

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
that you're also on servo setup that

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.480 
that you're also on servo setup that
your<00:02:02.159> travel<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.850> going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.390> at<00:02:04.280> 100<00:02:05.280> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
your travel is going to be at 100 and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.300 
your travel is going to be at 100 and
100<00:02:06.259> okay<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.770> once<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.069> get<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.520> 100<00:02:08.729> into<00:02:09.209> 100

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
100 okay so once you get to 100 into 100

come back and that's what it should look
like<00:04:07.049> roughly<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.769> mean<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.040> should<00:04:08.220> be

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
like roughly I mean it should be

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.330 
like roughly I mean it should be

identical I don't know why some are off
a<00:04:11.400> little<00:04:11.790> bit<00:04:12.000> than<00:04:12.329> others<00:04:12.600> but<00:04:12.920> this<00:04:13.920> is

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
a little bit than others but this is

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.590 
a little bit than others but this is
what<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.489> looks<00:04:14.700> like<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:15.180> that's<00:04:15.329> how<00:04:15.540> you

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
what it looks like and that's how you

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.340 
what it looks like and that's how you
set<00:04:16.079> up<00:04:16.109> your<00:04:16.320> end<00:04:16.530> points<00:04:16.919> on<00:04:17.130> your<00:04:17.459> calendar
