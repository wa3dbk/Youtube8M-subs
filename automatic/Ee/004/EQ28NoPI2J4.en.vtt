00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
remove this washing machine stay tuned

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.620 
remove this washing machine stay tuned
and<00:00:05.130> see<00:00:05.279> how<00:00:05.400> this<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.850> done<00:00:11.150> step<00:00:12.150> 1

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
and see how this is done step 1

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.890 
and see how this is done step 1
pull<00:00:13.349> out<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.559> washing<00:00:13.950> machine<00:00:14.480> be<00:00:15.480> careful

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
pull out the washing machine be careful

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.849 
pull out the washing machine be careful
not<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.139> pull<00:00:16.379> any<00:00:16.650> pipes<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.340> back<00:00:18.859> while

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
not to pull any pipes at the back while

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.599 
not to pull any pipes at the back while
you<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.220> access<00:00:20.670> at<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.060> back<00:00:22.070> like<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:25.609> now

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
you have access at the back like so now

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.609 
you have access at the back like so now
we<00:00:26.670> disconnect<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.230> 11<00:00:30.170> which<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.439> one

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
we disconnect the 11 which is this one

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.830 
we disconnect the 11 which is this one
here<00:00:33.500> now<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.559> go<00:00:34.890> under<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> sink<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.420> we

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
here now we go under the sink and we

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.060 
here now we go under the sink and we
find<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.620> cutoff<00:00:37.950> valve<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.239> will

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
find the cutoff valve that will

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.340 
find the cutoff valve that will
completely<00:00:41.070> shut<00:00:41.489> off<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.940> water<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
completely shut off all the water in the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.580 
completely shut off all the water in the
house<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.260> we<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
house so just do that and we have to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.389 
house so just do that and we have to
test<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.370> by<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.700> opening<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> sink<00:00:49.399> and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
test it now by just opening the sink and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.639 
test it now by just opening the sink and
leave<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> water<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.840> come<00:00:52.020> out<00:00:52.140> all

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
leave all the water to come out all

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.770 
leave all the water to come out all
right<00:00:52.920> there<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.640> no<00:00:53.820> water<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> right<00:00:56.550> now<00:00:56.780> we

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
right there is no water so right now we

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.950 
right there is no water so right now we
have<00:00:57.989> identified<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:59.579> water<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.270> into<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
have identified the water going into the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.049 
have identified the water going into the
washing<00:01:01.350> machine<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.280> other<00:01:02.399> pipe<00:01:02.760> who

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
washing machine and the other pipe who

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.020 
washing machine and the other pipe who
actually<00:01:03.300> goes<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.019> waste<00:01:04.260> pipe<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> what

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
actually goes to the waste pipe so what

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030 
actually goes to the waste pipe so what
we're<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:07.350> disconnect

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
we're going to do now just disconnect

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.440 
we're going to do now just disconnect
this<00:01:08.189> using<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.880> wrench

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450

on to the other side where our washing

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.370 
on to the other side where our washing
machine<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.570> now<00:01:45.720> we're<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> do<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
machine is so now we're going to do the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.530 
machine is so now we're going to do the
waste<00:01:46.590> pipe<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> waste<00:01:47.610> pipe<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.270> this

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
waste pipe and the waste pipe of this

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.080 
waste pipe and the waste pipe of this
washing<00:01:48.899> machine<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:50.189> very<00:01:50.369> simple<00:01:50.670> it's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
washing machine is just very simple it's

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.690 
washing machine is just very simple it's
a<00:01:51.210> push<00:01:51.450> feed<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.710> slide<00:01:53.070> onto<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
a push feed so we just slide onto the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.300 
a push feed so we just slide onto the
waste<00:01:54.000> pipe<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.530> take<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.770> out<00:01:56.009> if

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
waste pipe so we just take it out if

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.160 
waste pipe so we just take it out if
there<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.790> some<00:01:57.090> water<00:01:57.270> inside<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:57.990> we'll
