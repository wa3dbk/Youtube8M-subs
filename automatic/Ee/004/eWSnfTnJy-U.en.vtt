using google more effectively one of the
things<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.319> noticed<00:00:07.620> when<00:00:07.740> my<00:00:07.890> students<00:00:08.250> are

sort out what they're trying to find for
example<00:00:19.980> let's<00:00:20.730> say<00:00:21.300> we're<00:00:21.480> doing<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> search

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
example let's say we're doing a search

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:31.690 
example let's say we're doing a search
on<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.880> first<00:00:23.880> fleet<00:00:24.510> going<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.230> Australia

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.400 

they<00:00:32.700> might<00:00:32.910> put<00:00:33.059> first<00:00:33.329> fleet<00:00:33.660> Australia<00:00:34.260> in

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
they might put first fleet Australia in

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.020 
they might put first fleet Australia in

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
of the first fleet and so on if you want

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.119 
of the first fleet and so on if you want
to<00:00:57.719> cut<00:00:57.840> those<00:00:57.989> results<00:00:58.440> down<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> little<00:00:58.920> bit

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
to cut those results down a little bit

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.099 
to cut those results down a little bit
and<00:00:59.550> try<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.850> make<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.420> accurate<00:01:00.899> now

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and try and make it more accurate now

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.319 
and try and make it more accurate now
you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.250> see<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.640> those<00:01:02.820> results<00:01:03.030> are

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you can see some of those results are

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.230 
you can see some of those results are
quite<00:01:03.420> good<00:01:04.010> first<00:01:05.010> thing<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.790> put

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
quite good first thing we can do is put

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.270 
quite good first thing we can do is put
inverted<00:01:07.080> commas<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:07.500> speech<00:01:07.890> marks

inverted commas or speech marks
depending<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.729> how<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.970> put<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.920> around<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
depending on how you put it around the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.850 
depending on how you put it around the
word<00:01:11.430> first<00:01:11.790> fleet<00:01:12.260> because<00:01:13.260> those<00:01:13.439> two<00:01:13.650> words

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
word first fleet because those two words

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.910 
word first fleet because those two words
we<00:01:14.100> want<00:01:14.220> them<00:01:14.400> side<00:01:14.670> by<00:01:14.700> side<00:01:15.380> at<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> moment

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
we want them side by side at the moment

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.010 
we want them side by side at the moment
when<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.280> First<00:01:17.580> Fleet<00:01:17.909> separately<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
when we have First Fleet separately the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.230 
when we have First Fleet separately the
first<00:01:19.320> could<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> page<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
first could be up here on the page and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
first could be up here on the page and
the<00:01:21.780> fleet<00:01:22.020> could<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.320> down<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> page

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the fleet could be down here on the page

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
the fleet could be down here on the page
and<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.970> far<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.509> google<00:01:25.080> search<00:01:25.229> is

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
and as far as the google search is

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.190 
and as far as the google search is
concerned<00:01:25.799> that's<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.820> same<00:01:27.060> page<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.930> you're

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
concerned that's the same page so you're

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.030 
concerned that's the same page so you're
finding<00:01:28.560> first<00:01:29.280> fleet<00:01:29.759> together<00:01:30.770> by<00:01:31.770> putting

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
finding first fleet together by putting

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.950 
finding first fleet together by putting
them<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.150> inverted<00:01:33.659> commas

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
them like this with the inverted commas

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.999 
them like this with the inverted commas
around<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.950> means<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:36.270> easily

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
around them it means that you can easily

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.440 
around them it means that you can easily
isolate<00:01:38.009> those<00:01:38.250> words<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> pay<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.240> there

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
isolate those words on the pay so there

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.120 
isolate those words on the pay so there
must<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.810> beside<00:01:40.049> each<00:01:40.229> other<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:41.009> in

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
must be beside each other like here in

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.069 
must be beside each other like here in
this<00:01:41.220> heading<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.869> go<00:01:42.899> search<00:01:45.079> you'll

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
this heading so if I go search you'll

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.490 
this heading so if I go search you'll
now<00:01:46.259> knows<00:01:46.560> my<00:01:46.590> results<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.640> dropped<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
now knows my results have dropped to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.450 
now knows my results have dropped to
144,000<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.680> we've<00:01:49.829> gone<00:01:50.009> from<00:01:51.439> three<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
144,000 so we've gone from three and a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.960 
144,000 so we've gone from three and a
half<00:01:53.490> million

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
half million

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.920 
half million
down<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.430> 144,000<00:01:57.430> which<00:01:58.090> is<00:01:58.270> considerably

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
down to 144,000 which is considerably

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.350 
down to 144,000 which is considerably
more<00:01:59.170> accurate<00:01:59.830> so<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.550> can<00:02:00.850> imagine<00:02:00.940> when

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
more accurate so you can imagine when

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.400 
more accurate so you can imagine when
you're<00:02:01.510> searching<00:02:01.690> for<00:02:01.870> something<00:02:02.140> more

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
you're searching for something more

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.500 
you're searching for something more
complex<00:02:03.030> than<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.360> then<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:06.550> can<00:02:06.760> isolate<00:02:07.480> a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
complex than this then you can isolate a

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.920 
complex than this then you can isolate a
