00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.170
 hey that happens people I am a scholar and 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.180
 I bring a trick of whites all that 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.090
 consists of how to have all the weapons 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.330
 to the diamond in a custom game 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.930
 when you are playing against bots or 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:39.230
 against friends you want to laugh or laugh 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.239
 something so first thing we are on the menu 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.610
 main of the multiplayer good then to 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.520
 play online with youtube 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.160
 and here we go to community more 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.050
 popular and we're going to depart 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.540
 custom personalized games 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.900
 all the games that the 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:04.479
 people have done and that a lot of law that I eat 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.970
 the sporting line that clichÃ©s to the diamond 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.229
 well then we go to those who put 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.510
 the moon goose or something eta diamond 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.380
 so for example this same one 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.700
 let's go here we put bots or whatever you want 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.790
 will be against all you can not change 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.330
 I do not think the range this point is 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.730
 equal of the class no 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.090
 it's not going to let us go then 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.890
 edit in the games at 6 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.010
 determined that will come out 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.350
 you will have the class with the camouflage of 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.130
 Diamond 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.590
 that will come out here but yes that has it 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.450
 is the weapon does not have good for 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.420
 check it we're going to 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.140
 let's start a game I've put 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.280
 bots 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.640
 the map can also change it 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.720
 what of the map the streak of points I think 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.330
 that also 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.310
 also within that also also 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.149
 inside the class it also seems to me that 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.280
 you can change the advantages or the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.280
 accessories one that you have 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.830
 you contract 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.830
 in 94 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:33.510
 the people that I know are nothing more than a 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.560
 personalized trick here you have the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.560
 shield that the mallet 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.110
 with guys 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.750
 but they associated is nothing more 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.410
 to fire 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.600
 true 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.600
 as always my puffs 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.880

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.310

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.209

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.860

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.860

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.349

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.960

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.830

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.030

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.880
