00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
howdy folks today I'd like to

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.470 
howdy folks today I'd like to
demonstrate<00:00:12.930> how<00:00:13.680> to<00:00:13.740> play<00:00:14.039> three<00:00:14.639> G<00:00:15.240> runs

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
demonstrate how to play three G runs

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.980 
demonstrate how to play three G runs
they're<00:00:15.930> bluegrass<00:00:16.350> runs<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:18.090> use<00:00:18.390> these<00:00:18.750> G

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
they're bluegrass runs and I use these G

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.290 
they're bluegrass runs and I use these G
runs<00:00:19.199> primarily<00:00:19.740> when<00:00:20.039> I'm<00:00:20.220> resolving<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
runs primarily when I'm resolving to the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.839 
runs primarily when I'm resolving to the
G<00:00:21.509> chord<00:00:21.539> from<00:00:22.349> a<00:00:22.650> D<00:00:22.830> chord<00:00:23.039> from<00:00:24.019> the<00:00:25.019> key<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.289> G

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
G chord from a D chord from the key of G

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.819 
G chord from a D chord from the key of G
so<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.539> first<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.199> kind<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.529> classic

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
so the first one is kind of a classic

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.770 
so the first one is kind of a classic
bluegrass<00:00:29.669> run<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.449> goes

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780
