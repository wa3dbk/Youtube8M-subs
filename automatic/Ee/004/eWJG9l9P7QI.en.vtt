00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.190
 Memories of cancer plastic kit review collection 

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:10.580
 Cuts Macross 15th Anniversary Early Edition Battroid Valkyrie vf Ness 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:14.770
 I was really There are many Nee also that the end again this year 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.770
 I want to wish that next year will be a good year too 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.220
 Nah, maybe I 'm not in front of the computer I leave up my mind to up my videos up my mind 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.779
 I went into the laundry 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.670
 While Tour of the toy shop of the guy is probably unfamiliar city say the journey of looking for their own 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.010
 I 'll be back if I can't carry the plastic anymore 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:39.190
 I already bought Genghis Khan for the New Year. 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.140
 To commemorate the 15 anniversary of Macross is the revival Macross 15th Anniversary Model Car in 1997 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.649
 It is a series that Mr. Arie reprinted 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.250
 The lineup is mostly 1/100 Valkyrie and Destroid 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:52.570
 The battleships of Zentradies have also been selected by minor minors- 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.000
 Nonetheless Nakaniwa long time ago and not hardly Kawan of the main characters figure is 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.080
 Attached 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.870
 To sell to the mainstream of the time master grade and high-grade series of Bandai also said that 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:05.220
 Was nothing more than an adventure 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.310
 Moreover, the initial version is what the initial version is and you still understand the meaning 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.970
 It's a full of problems I was to figure that has been sealed 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.240
 Naturally I have to put in the Roy Fokker because it comes with the package Miralo Fokker 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.640
 It seems that the figure of the main character is random 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.840
 Of Do not try to have entered in a random Daaa 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.070
 Will the strategy of trying to increase the purchase consciousness in the more character figures 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.090
 Even if the box is opened , the contents can not be determined by the texture because the figure is pinched by the runner 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.750
 Do So 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.110
 I will imitate the foolish 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.290
 I used the psychology I wanted to know the hidden content well 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:43.340
 Recently I wonder has also been put dare people to be put 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:49.100
 This kind of humor should be greatly welcomed, as it is only a seriously serious Plamo 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.030
 My brother's flight is a positive argument, but the question is whether this part of the content can be sufficient for the modeler's centripetal force 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.409
 It is a thing 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:58.210
 By the way, what was the contents 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.960
 k even I'll show if either become home your respondents 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.960
 ni 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.050
 x was good or rare 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.530
 Surely the price is the same as the old kit in 500 yen 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:16.470
 Ne poly cap was not Kawan is a feeling of use I'm been changed from black to white Ally 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.770
 Not where we want to be careful with Mr. 1/100 Valkyrie 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.570
 The vf 1 team that was first made into a kit was terribly done 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.210
 vf 1 you some mold has been recovered from s'm also the guy to be worried about at that time 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.660
 vf 1 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:32.160
 I changed the head based on vinegar and produced it. 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.510
 Thanks vf 1 Yone s was valuables 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.590
 Wakan from Ne to see such a thing Ne I'm anime main lot like I head does not resemble 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.700
 Nea 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.620
 Please look after the anime and say 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.810
 vf 1 s It was overwhelmingly popular among plastic models of Macross . 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.910
 There are a lot of deep- minded people 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:56.620
 The joints are fragile, so it was standard to carefully decorate the desk with care . 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.690
 It would be unbelievable, but at that time there wasn't a lot to sit down on. 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.410
 It is attached to the kit which can not stand independently 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.690
 Most of the possible robot- type kits were not included 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.260
 Hey, but there are some exceptions 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.260
 Although I had also sold the pedestal for a while, there is no use for plastic models- 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.340
 The NYCO of gold is such mon had been or processed fish paste plate 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:22.130
 Well I such fondness of you guy's is Chitto you or bought quite 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:26.710
 Roy Fokker The figure of Saka Hikaru was full at this time though it was a 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.710
 Lights would be Minmay even if considered Yoee
