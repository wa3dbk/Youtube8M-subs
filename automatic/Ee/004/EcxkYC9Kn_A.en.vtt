something to do with the ghost let's go
in<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.750> closer<00:02:01.049> look<00:02:01.470> but<00:02:02.189> first<00:02:02.670> let's<00:02:03.209> see

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
in for a closer look but first let's see

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.020 
in for a closer look but first let's see
if<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.569> can<00:02:03.750> make<00:02:03.929> another<00:02:04.170> ghost<00:02:07.759> here<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.880> are
