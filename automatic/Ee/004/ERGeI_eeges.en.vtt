00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.849
 very good to everyone and things and 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.830
 distributed a new video tutorial of 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.559
 photoshop in which we will learn how 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.059
 give a 3d effect to this image for 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.570
 it seems as if the horse is 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.250
 get out of the silhouette or the photo to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.270
 what we will do is select the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.930
 rectangular frame tool 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.050
 we will select how far we want 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.900
 the horse is shown within the frame 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.960
 more or less so 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.500
 once selected we will give it to layer 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.560
 new layer 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.170
 we will give it to ok 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.410
 The next thing we will do is select 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.790
 the paint can tool 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.780
 we will follow all the white rectangle 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.780
 of the color you want 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.550
 we will give you the selection modify 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.000
 contract we will select a value between 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.650
 5 and 10 pixels and we will give you to suppress 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.530
 once done this we will press control 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.720
 master 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.210
 we will give the right button we will give 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.030
 to the right button perspective 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.700
 and we will modify this a bit 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.890
 so that the picture appears a bit more 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.920
 realistic when it's done we give it to 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.009
 intro and the next thing we will do is 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.530
 duplicate the layer and select the layer 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.540
 of the rectangle and we will begin we arrive at 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.310
 work on the silhouette of the horse 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.610
 outside the image outside the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.710
 framework 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.540
 For this we will select the tool 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.840
 that says pen tool 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.650
 we will expand the image a bit to be able 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.880
 work better more comfortably and with 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.260
 a lot of patience we will be selecting 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.290
 all exterior points of the horse 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.510
 what is the hair and other things do not 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.450
 I will extend a lot or spend a lot of time 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.000
 to this in the part that is in 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.120
 the inside of the box we will stop 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.310
 a lot since it will not matter just 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.470
 will show the outside and as you see 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.869
 here has less hair jumped as 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.450
 a lot of time is spent going little by little 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.240
 increasing of or going by removing it let's say 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.130
 all grass areas but good 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.010
 more or less to show you the reason for 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.730
 this tutorial is enough we will give 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.730
 make selection 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.860
 we will give the right button to do 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.290
 selection we give to ok once done the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.360
 selection we will select the copy of 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.780
 copy background will give to jot Control 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.890
 so that we create a layer say the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.630
 selection we have made 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.569
 then you can perfect it 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.100
 cutting out parts of here and let's say 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.930
 blurring these parts so you do not 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.709
 see what is the grass and what next 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.010
 what we will do is select layer 1 that 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.819
 is the layer of the box rectangle 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.819
 we will reduce this a little 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.050
 we will use the wand tool 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.209
 magic to quickly select everything 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.690
 what is the inside of the box the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.750
 layer 1 we will select the background copy you 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.770
 we will give the selection invest we will press 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.050
 suppress to eliminate us what is 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.390
 the whole outer part of what is the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.150
 box and now the next thing we have 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.370
 what to do is eliminate the background layer and 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.069
 you see more or less the reason for this 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.010
 work for the fund we can create a 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.950
 new layer we can paint what it is all 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.590
 the background of the color that we want we can 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.630
 apply also a gradient 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.940
 selecting say the areas where 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.920
 we want to degrade it for example this and 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.290
 we already have the image with the 3d effect 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.420
 we wanted to give you can change this 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.340
 degraded and you can put another 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.470
 Look, I hope you liked to give the 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.150
 there are favorites to share and see you in 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.260

 left here has my previous video and 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.209
 a random video which will discover 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.209
