00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.970
 greetings people 

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.520
 I want to discuss how you are a myth 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.880
 that encourages people which you 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.950
 You can clean a compact disc with 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.600
 toothpaste I want to tell you that this 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.860
 Real since 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.410
 the toothpaste is to fuse wax and 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.290
 to teach them because this is real 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.780
 since I do not have a diagram I'm going to 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:31.289
 teach them an example of the shore 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.780
 we want three books 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.050
 as you can see they are three layers so they are 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.660
 the discs 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.570
 although I am very finite, so are the discs 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.489
 on a large scale are three strands the greatest 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.790
 part of leaves occur in the first 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.030
 layer that's why you see that with a 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.850
 Disk cleaner they sell out there not 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.329
 the liquids they sell in a machine 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.640
 terminal 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.480
 you can fix this since 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.829
 works 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.380
 sanding paris anne from the top 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.040
 of the disk 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.800
 to the tests analyzing it then when 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.530
 reflects the light goes to the part of the 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.049
 attack is the second and the third layer 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.750
 you know how well you have to be careful 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.259
 the moment of sanding the disc since 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.479
 you can sand it too much and scratch the part 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.340
 that has the important data is what 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.400
 you want either music photos 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.350
 personal or whatever next 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.450
 what you are teaching how how 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.020
 correct to clean a disc with either 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.280
 pasta or with the liquid they sell 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.280
 specialized for this 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.119
 before starting to clean the disc with 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.880
 pasta or with substances to clean disks 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.479
 Well, you should show the disk so that 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.130
 it stops having dust or any 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.350
 another particle that has over the 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.470
 disc and that can affect the process of 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.080
 oil affected by cleaning it for 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.700
 to add water 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.360
 just do not do anything else let's 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.360
 do this 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.330
 do this for a moment 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.659
 they shake it and let it dry out absolutely 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.510
 do not pass any cloth to dry them since 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:22.200
 this can affect it more the disk and 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.200
 haier the most 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.980
 good people here I will teach you the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.380
 correct way to clean a civil since 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.330
 be compact or with any other 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.770
 substance that is sold to make 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.270
 this 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.550
 the cloth they should use to 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.820
 clean the citi 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.060
 if not specialized I do not buy it 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.430
 do this I recommend you are the cloth 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.060
 which is used to suit the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.140
 cases that in this or an old me 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.750
 because these two spaces because these 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.000
 two cloths have a help a material 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.760
 that at the moment you happen to be the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.830
 civil is not going to be anything not low 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.320
 no longer affects the sea 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.210
 like most people what has 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.389
 their old houses thinking alike 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.389
 [Music] 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.930
 when you go use a paste 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.099
 assured makes paste pasta I do not know 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.099
 How is it going 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.610
 I'm not going to point out pixel if you have 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.430
 only one hi is only going to stop 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.840
 the pasta in the cid and with a little ball in 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.840
 the area stops I'm going to do now 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.569
 it's not like that, it 's wrong in several 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.040
 areas so let's do this three or 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.040
 four times around the disc 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.670
 Not only did I do much I could give others 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.670
 new 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.130
 now we go the right way to 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.970
 clean the bony disc 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.970
 take away the findings 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.210
 to do this 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.610
 at the beginning you can turn the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.190
 paste so that it takes the effect of 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.190
 sand the jaya so it has over 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.460
 has not completely covered the disk 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.030
 Do not keep doing this because you will be able to 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:47.190
 is going to keep shutting it up and it can be 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.190
 I did not do this 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:55.430
 to clean the dough out 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.430
 how am I doing at our moment 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.350
 this either with pasta or with any 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.880
 another substance that is sold to clean 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.270
 the disk up to the correct way 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.270
 do what 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.169
 because out because the movement 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:28.680
 when will you read the disc 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.380
 outward 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.990
 and to avoid further findings that 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.000
 the distance that is taking the 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.000
 substance or the pasta is black 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.200
 once it is like this 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.610
 I give him a little water to finish 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.430
 that waits for it to dry and returns 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.550
 repeat the process 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.220
 put the ico 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.050
 the following music puts you listening to 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.800
 see if it works if not a function or 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.800
 for trying again 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.900
 he has his record as new 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:25.620
 the pasta helps since this is like a 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.350
 kind of wax that helps sand the part 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.840
 above the disk so that when 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.230
 heads of the laser light as it can 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:37.400
 can do well and can return the potato 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.400
 who is trying to hurt 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.720
 How many wax athletes can be 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.030
 that too does the team will 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.480
 remove the first layer and what you have to 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.480
 be careful 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.490
 I recommend them between using the 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.950
 specialized cloths to clean the 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.500
 disk or if you do not have money you will buy 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.030
 this as the cloths used to 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.470
 take them out of the herd cases because with 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.090
 these cloths catch less games the 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.220
 next year his disc 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.940
 I hope this helps us to recover 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.940
 favorite disc
