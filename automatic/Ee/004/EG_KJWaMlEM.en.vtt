00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
redstone and if you want you can get

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.550 
redstone and if you want you can get
some<00:00:20.460> glass<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:23.300> what<00:00:24.300> you're<00:00:24.480> gonna<00:00:24.630> do<00:00:25.550> is

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
some glass and what you're gonna do is

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.850 
some glass and what you're gonna do is
start<00:00:28.560> by<00:00:28.920> making<00:00:29.550> an<00:00:30.000> 11<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:31.640> this<00:00:32.640> side<00:00:33.860> 11

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
start by making an 11 on this side 11

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.979 
start by making an 11 on this side 11
you<00:00:35.160> dig<00:00:35.690> 11<00:00:36.690> blocks<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.620> take<00:00:37.829> down<00:00:37.980> one

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
you dig 11 blocks just take down one

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.650 
you dig 11 blocks just take down one
then<00:00:39.989> 10<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.640> side<00:00:42.020> and<00:00:43.430> then<00:00:44.430> 11<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.420> this

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
then 10 on this side and then 11 on this

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.080 
then 10 on this side and then 11 on this
side<00:00:46.820> that<00:00:47.820> would<00:00:48.000> equal<00:00:48.149> 32<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:52.610> what<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
side that would equal 32 so what this is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.889 
side that would equal 32 so what this is
just<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.510> make<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> stack<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.079> 64<00:00:56.539> sugar<00:00:57.539> canes

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
just to make a stack of 64 sugar canes

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.040 
just to make a stack of 64 sugar canes
you<00:00:58.410> don't<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.100> make<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.820> 64<00:01:00.449> sugar<00:01:00.840> canes

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
you don't have to make it 64 sugar canes

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.979 
you don't have to make it 64 sugar canes
you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.289> make<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> smaller<00:01:02.030> one<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.899> even

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you can make a smaller one you can even

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.740 
you can make a smaller one you can even
make<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> cross<00:01:05.299> instead<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.570> I

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
make this like a cross instead of like I

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.399 
make this like a cross instead of like I
did<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.159> sort<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.549> conserved<00:01:08.970> like

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
did this is just sort of conserved like

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.130 
did this is just sort of conserved like
like<00:01:10.409> making<00:01:10.740> out<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:10.979> long<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:14.869> then<00:01:15.869> you're

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
like making out as long so then you're

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.270 
like making out as long so then you're
gonna<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.530> pull<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> lever<00:01:17.420> or<00:01:18.420> okay<00:01:19.280> then

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
gonna just pull the lever or okay then

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.859 
gonna just pull the lever or okay then
you're<00:01:20.460> gonna<00:01:20.610> want<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.090> build<00:01:22.220> um<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:24.600> one

down but you're going to want to put

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.390 
down but you're going to want to put
redstone<00:01:52.479> repeaters<00:01:53.140> along<00:01:53.470> all<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.860> Pistons

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
redstone repeaters along all the Pistons

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.550 
redstone repeaters along all the Pistons
and<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.960> connect<00:01:56.350> redstone<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.950> them<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
and then connect redstone to them so

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.990 
and then connect redstone to them so
yeah<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:02.110> put<00:02:02.920> some<00:02:03.160> redstone<00:02:03.369> repeaters

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
yeah and I put some redstone repeaters

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.800 
yeah and I put some redstone repeaters
right<00:02:04.240> here<00:02:04.690> where<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.110> lever<00:02:05.350> starts

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
right here where the lever starts

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.080 
right here where the lever starts
because<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:08.200> may<00:02:08.380> run<00:02:08.619> out<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.800> power<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.640> what

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
because it may run out of power and what

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.750 
because it may run out of power and what
summer<00:02:10.300> Peters<00:02:10.660> like<00:02:10.929> get<00:02:11.560> power<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.920> like<00:02:12.160> 15

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
summer Peters like get power to like 15

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.120 
summer Peters like get power to like 15
blocks<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.590> think<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:16.709> yeah<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.830> then<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:17.950> put

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
blocks I think so yeah and then I put

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.740 
blocks I think so yeah and then I put
another<00:02:18.310> one<00:02:18.520> right<00:02:18.580> after<00:02:18.970> there<00:02:19.330> because

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
another one right after there because

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.370 
another one right after there because
it's<00:02:20.140> going<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.560> need<00:02:20.680> more<00:02:20.830> power<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:23.140> power

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
it's going to need more power to power

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.490 
it's going to need more power to power
this<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:24.010> one<00:02:24.160> right<00:02:24.370> there<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.610> power<00:02:25.500> like

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
this and one right there the power like

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.750 
this and one right there the power like
a<00:02:26.680> fat<00:02:26.890> aside<00:02:29.220> then<00:02:30.220> you're<00:02:30.430> gonna<00:02:30.520> want<00:02:30.700> to

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
a fat aside then you're gonna want to

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.250 
a fat aside then you're gonna want to
put<00:02:30.820> sugar<00:02:31.180> canes<00:02:31.570> all<00:02:31.930> along<00:02:32.820> where

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
put sugar canes all along where

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.060 
put sugar canes all along where
piston-like<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:36.190> long<00:02:36.459> right<00:02:37.120> here<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.980> on

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
piston-like so long right here and on

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.070 
piston-like so long right here and on
that<00:02:39.250> side<00:02:40.230> then<00:02:42.450> you're<00:02:43.450> going<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.660> want<00:02:43.930> to
