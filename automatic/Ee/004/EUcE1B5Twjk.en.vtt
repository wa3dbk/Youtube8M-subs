that way offensively and defensively to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.350 
that way offensively and defensively to
we're<00:00:52.500> still<00:00:52.800> gathering<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.640> information<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
we're still gathering the information I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.959 
we're still gathering the information I
mean<00:00:54.420> we're<00:00:55.020> still<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.280> treading<00:00:56.850> water

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
and trying to figure out what's what at

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.889 
and trying to figure out what's what at
the<00:00:58.980> same<00:00:59.250> time<00:00:59.579> give<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> specific

the same time give you a specific

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.049 
the same time give you a specific
example<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.829> took<00:01:02.100> Jarvis<00:01:02.579> West<00:01:02.820> out<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
example I took Jarvis West out of

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.280 
example I took Jarvis West out of

uniform today he SAT and watched and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.960 
uniform today he SAT and watched and
then<00:01:07.409> regenerated<00:01:07.950> himself<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.580> little<00:01:08.670> bit

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
then regenerated himself a little bit

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.880 
then regenerated himself a little bit
and<00:01:10.490> he's<00:01:11.490> given<00:01:12.150> numbers<00:01:13.049> off<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.260> chart<00:01:13.680> all

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and he's given numbers off the chart all

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.399 
and he's given numbers off the chart all
throughout<00:01:14.159> camping<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.080> week<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
throughout camping and here this week I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.100 
throughout camping and here this week I
started<00:01:16.740> noticing<00:01:16.799> him<00:01:17.479> maybe<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.570> step<00:01:18.780> slower

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
started noticing him maybe a step slower

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.740 
started noticing him maybe a step slower
and<00:01:19.820> not<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> wasn't<00:01:21.119> given<00:01:21.479> great

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and not that it wasn't given great

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.050 
and not that it wasn't given great
effort<00:01:22.049> he<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.380> needed<00:01:23.159> ready<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.670> back<00:01:23.820> off

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
effort he just needed ready to back off

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.020 
effort he just needed ready to back off
a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.390> bit<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> numbers<00:01:26.030> verified

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
a little bit then the numbers verified

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.319 
a little bit then the numbers verified
what<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:28.049> saw<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> naked<00:01:28.710> eye<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.909> think

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
what we saw with the naked eye I think

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.990 
what we saw with the naked eye I think
what<00:01:30.479> we've<00:01:30.659> seen<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.470> naked<00:01:31.500> eye

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
what we've seen with the naked eye

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.870 
what we've seen with the naked eye
overall<00:01:33.000> has<00:01:33.750> been<00:01:34.020> verified<00:01:34.490> with<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.759> our

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
overall has been verified with with our

football<00:01:36.119> team<00:01:36.680> we<00:01:37.680> had<00:01:37.829> an<00:01:37.920> idea<00:01:38.070> when

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
football team we had an idea when

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.969 
football team we had an idea when
probably<00:01:39.119> down<00:01:39.509> days<00:01:39.780> were<00:01:40.020> coming<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.530> had<00:01:40.920> an

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
probably down days were coming I had an

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.920 
probably down days were coming I had an
idea<00:01:41.100> when<00:01:41.490> Spike<00:01:41.759> days<00:01:42.060> were<00:01:42.390> coming<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
idea when Spike days were coming and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.200 
idea when Spike days were coming and
once<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.680> got<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.009> early<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.850> were<00:01:44.970> able<00:01:45.090> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
once we got that early we were able to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.749 
once we got that early we were able to
arrange<00:01:45.479> practices<00:01:46.280> accordingly<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.399> yeah

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
arrange practices accordingly so yeah

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.240 
arrange practices accordingly so yeah
it's<00:01:48.149> been<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:49.140> been<00:01:49.229> very<00:01:49.470> valuable<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> us

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
it's been it's been very valuable to us

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.179 
it's been it's been very valuable to us
Chris<00:01:50.610> Francis<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.140> walk-on<00:01:52.590> forest<00:01:53.040> from

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
Chris Francis is a walk-on forest from

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.850 
Chris Francis is a walk-on forest from
the<00:01:53.310> Duke<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.869> he's<00:01:54.869> had<00:01:55.110> some<00:01:55.290> good<00:01:55.320> balls<00:01:55.649> on

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the Duke and he's had some good balls on

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.789 
the Duke and he's had some good balls on
kickoffs<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:57.149> suspect<00:01:58.049> Cole<00:01:58.290> will<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
kickoffs so I suspect Cole will be the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.330 
kickoffs so I suspect Cole will be the
guy<00:01:58.979> still

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
guy still

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.919 
guy still
and<00:02:00.850> it's<00:02:01.000> not<00:02:01.149> always<00:02:01.299> about<00:02:01.390> putting<00:02:01.840> them

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
and it's not always about putting them

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.679 
and it's not always about putting them
all<00:02:02.109> in<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:03.159> end<00:02:03.280> zone<00:02:03.340> touchpads<00:02:04.179> it's<00:02:04.479> about

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
all in the end zone touchpads it's about
