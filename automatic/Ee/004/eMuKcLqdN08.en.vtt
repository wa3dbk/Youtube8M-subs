00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.040
 finish apple seeds 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.780
 the materials that we need 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.020
 a container a towel or cotton except 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.740
 with what to cover what I have liters 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.850
 and most importantly the seeds good 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.850
 our first step 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.910
 our seeds 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.210
 we will touch them 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:59.660
 before placing them you have to fill a 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.940
 glass and put them the ones that 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.250
 are the ones that we are going to place that 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.979
 they are fertile those that in the second one in 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.840
 which is lots, we are not going to use them 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.840
 that in this case I already did 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:20.580
 that we are going to put a little water 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.580
 it's important not in chats just deserve 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.820
 yes yes so 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.260
 It can also be in a bag to 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.430
 sandwiches we care is better and now 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.729
 we will not put it in the refrigerator 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.250
 more or less to a proximity of 8 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.200
 weeks 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.570
 why 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.550
 but because you put them in the refrigerator 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.550
 well you have to feign temperatures of 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.140
 winter so you have to put them in 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.540
 fridge 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.209
 this is recommended to do when 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.040
 when it's really a season of 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.950
 winter so that when we take it out of the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.140
 refrigerator refrigerator that will happen 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.800
 for eight weeks 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.340
 it is important what 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.700
 that I do not do not know how much change 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.830
 how good this me right now the idea of 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.650
 put refrigerator is left eight 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.190
 approximately weeks 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.730
 approximately in eight weeks 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.319
 criminals can be less or more 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.230
 There are problems 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.049
