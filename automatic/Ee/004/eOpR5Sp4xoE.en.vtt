their company damage or injury that was

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.960 
their company damage or injury that was
their<00:02:47.580> word<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:49.260> don't<00:02:50.100> see<00:02:50.220> how<00:02:50.400> since<00:02:50.820> we

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
their word and I don't see how since we

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.500 
their word and I don't see how since we
don't<00:02:51.120> even<00:02:51.930> make<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.800> same<00:02:53.010> products<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.790> I

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
don't even make the same products and I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.900 
don't even make the same products and I
didn't<00:02:54.750> even<00:02:54.780> use<00:02:55.170> exact<00:02:55.709> same<00:02:55.950> names<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.670> came

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
didn't even use exact same names we came

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.690 
didn't even use exact same names we came
up<00:02:56.940> with<00:02:57.180> our<00:02:57.209> own<00:02:57.330> but<00:02:57.870> apparently<00:02:58.830> for<00:02:59.489> them

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
up with our own but apparently for them

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.990 
up with our own but apparently for them
those<00:03:00.420> names<00:03:00.780> were<00:03:00.989> too<00:03:01.170> close<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.580> can't

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
those names were too close so I can't

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.160 
those names were too close so I can't
use<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.540> word<00:03:03.720> ice<00:03:04.080> for<00:03:05.040> anything<00:03:05.280> or<00:03:06.920> snow<00:03:07.920> or

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
use the word ice for anything or snow or

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.250 
use the word ice for anything or snow or
honey<00:03:10.170> or<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:11.430> can't<00:03:12.180> use<00:03:12.330> those<00:03:12.480> words<00:03:12.690> because

honey or I can't use those words because

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.340 
honey or I can't use those words because
apparently<00:03:13.650> they<00:03:13.890> owned<00:03:14.160> those<00:03:14.610> words<00:03:15.350> so
