00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.720
 eyebrows 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.239
 how of two fingers of pure whiskey 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:43.100

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:43.100
 zest of lemon claude nods to me 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:53.680

 perhaps 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:33.060
 no it could be painful the 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.060
 simplicity of their gesture 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.209
 the harmony of their eyes 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.870
 this fragile complicity let 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.000
 to assume that their relations were 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.000

 rené who until then had been reading 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.919
 staging directions between 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.669

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:24.979

 irresistible beauty like a beast 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.570
 wild

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.710
 flash of lucidity renounces kissing 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.990
