00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.940
 good morning we continue the program with 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.590
 Cereal sowing opened a pack on 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.680
 palm so poured out 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.789
 we have ready soils see 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.369
 as well as strawberries though it is not 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.800
 kia small seeds not finely seminal 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.009
 plant yet in sowing 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.919
 celery same surface can 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.910
 slightly flatten in the soil use 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:39.540
 be a pig soil rich and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.360
 the word for the composition of the soil is very good 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.990
 It looks like very old old humus 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.260
 see yes 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.470
 half filled with soil spill 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.230
 please tighten up all the palm up 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.550
 flat surface and now having 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.130
 seeds keep in mind that we do not dive them 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.230
 let it be not strawberries in the same way 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.649
 not only celery can be sown 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.749
 so delphiniums are required 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.990
 I do in a row, but here you can 

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.270
 sow 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.850
 one by one of course a seed but a little bit 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.520
 more tightly because planting my 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.109
 we will be as it were with the formed 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 here such as walnut logic me 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:28.950
 otherwise if it is smaller 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 Nothing that we do not grow and do not need 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.189
 think that by sowing a bed you will get 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.770
 here is such a wonderful harvest is not mine 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.149
 dear when celery 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.479
 you will pick out from the box to the garden 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.409
 that is, try to replant 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.560
 on the roots here of any plant that you 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:55.110
 pacing from 1 1 pischiki to 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.840
 rootlets had a few lumps of soil 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.979
 it is very important to flour 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.189
 plant faster 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.399
 could take if hot weather 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.110
 cover your landings 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.979
 covering material 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.410
 from overheating from the sun's rays why 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.260
 yes because the plant does not run in 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.560
 root system may just die 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.230
 we don't need this, but when you plant 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.599
 see you cast it 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.760
 shelters remove only when it came 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.880
 cool cloudy weather 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.420
 that's only then we remove the shelter goes 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.910
 the rain is wonderful just and we through 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.160
 week we are coming from the height of us 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.810
 celery and we observe here such 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.519
 peas formed like walnuts 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.609
 small celery chic 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:51.290
 how to achieve how to get here 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.280
 such a wonderful thing and we start 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.389
 shovel here it is with us 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.970
 peas yes we rake off the ground by half 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:03.359
 here this formed root 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.730
 take the scissors and here we are the roots 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.299
 scissors cut everything here with us 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.110
 eg 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.300
 soil level all cut off 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.510
 without falling asleep we remove extra leaves 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.630
 leaving 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:23.240

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.170
 I kept stored, you can eat yourself 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.830
 you can chop the chicken there and so on 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.260
