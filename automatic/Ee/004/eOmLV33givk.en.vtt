hey<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:17.940> we<00:01:18.180> define<00:01:18.540> our<00:01:18.810> competitors<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
hey how do we define our competitors and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.950 
hey how do we define our competitors and
we<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.720> fit<00:01:21.960> into<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.290> Nisshin<00:01:22.620> in<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
we we fit into a Nisshin in that in the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.410 
we we fit into a Nisshin in that in the
market<00:01:25.410> where<00:01:26.160> there<00:01:26.760> are<00:01:26.940> a<00:01:26.970> number<00:01:27.150> of

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
market where there are a number of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.020 
market where there are a number of
production<00:01:28.020> boats<00:01:28.550> which<00:01:29.550> you<00:01:29.729> use<00:01:30.000> for

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
production boats which you use for

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.090 
production boats which you use for
racing<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.410> are<00:01:31.440> boats<00:01:31.800> which

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
racing and then there are boats which

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.910 
racing and then there are boats which
are<00:01:32.250> designed<00:01:32.460> for<00:01:32.970> use<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.150> racing<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.960> we

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
are designed for use for racing and we

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.570 
are designed for use for racing and we
kind<00:01:35.190> of<00:01:35.280> fell<00:01:35.490> into<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:37.160> parameter<00:01:38.160> of<00:01:38.190> boats

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
kind of fell into the parameter of boats

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.550 
kind of fell into the parameter of boats
that<00:01:38.910> are<00:01:39.440> primarily<00:01:41.000> competitive<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.560> we

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
that are primarily competitive and we

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.960 
that are primarily competitive and we
try<00:01:43.800> and<00:01:43.860> make<00:01:44.070> them<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.340> comfortable<00:01:44.550> as

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
try and make them as comfortable as

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.390 
try and make them as comfortable as
possible<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.570> well<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.650> if<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.100> look<00:01:47.310> at

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
possible as well so in if you look at

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.990 
possible as well so in if you look at
the<00:01:47.490> entry<00:01:47.820> level<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> 376<00:01:49.170> CR<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.000> that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the entry level on the 376 CR and that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.920 
the entry level on the 376 CR and that
is<00:01:52.520> comes<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.910> competitive<00:01:54.300> weight<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
is comes in at a competitive weight of

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.440 
is comes in at a competitive weight of
under<00:01:55.800> 6<00:01:56.040> tons<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.970> pretty<00:02:00.270> well

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
under 6 tons and is is pretty well

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.690 
under 6 tons and is is pretty well
priced<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:01.080> believe<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:01.800> we<00:02:01.830> would<00:02:02.340> compete

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
priced we believe and we would compete

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.719 
priced we believe and we would compete
there<00:02:03.000> against<00:02:03.270> something<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> first<00:02:04.200> 40

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
there against something like a first 40

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.969 
there against something like a first 40
we're<00:02:05.729> lighter<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.660> greater<00:02:07.380> sail<00:02:07.710> area

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
we're lighter we have greater sail area

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.600 
we're lighter we have greater sail area
and<00:02:08.940> we're<00:02:09.360> using<00:02:09.750> our<00:02:11.630> wells<00:02:13.190> we<00:02:14.190> hope<00:02:14.400> will

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and we're using our wells we hope will

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.720 
and we're using our wells we hope will
give<00:02:14.790> us<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.530> competitive<00:02:16.530> edge<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.520> think

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
give us a competitive edge and I think

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.160 
give us a competitive edge and I think
it's<00:02:17.850> going<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.060> be<00:02:18.150> very<00:02:18.180> interesting<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.020> see

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
it's going to be very interesting to see

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.380 
it's going to be very interesting to see
the<00:02:19.290> boats<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.709> water<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.220> see<00:02:20.430> how<00:02:20.640> they

the boats on the water and see how they

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.840 
the boats on the water and see how they

that's sort of our our philosophy for
this<00:06:04.719> design<00:06:05.080> but<00:06:05.830> then<00:06:05.949> at<00:06:06.099> the<00:06:06.129> same<00:06:06.219> time

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
this design but then at the same time

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.420 
this design but then at the same time
Europe<00:06:07.449> always<00:06:07.870> asked<00:06:08.349> for<00:06:08.649> more<00:06:08.949> than<00:06:09.129> only

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
Europe always asked for more than only

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.719

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.320 
sailing you also need a decent interior
so<00:06:13.649> in<00:06:14.649> this<00:06:14.800> designer<00:06:15.250> the<00:06:15.520> early<00:06:15.789> design<00:06:16.120> was

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
so in this designer the early design was

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.230 
so in this designer the early design was
was<00:06:16.839> very<00:06:17.080> sparse<00:06:17.620> on<00:06:18.009> its<00:06:18.460> interior<00:06:18.819> very

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
was very sparse on its interior very

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.779 
was very sparse on its interior very
basic<00:06:19.839> and<00:06:20.020> we've<00:06:20.800> been<00:06:20.979> working<00:06:21.219> with<00:06:21.610> the

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
basic and we've been working with the

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.059 
basic and we've been working with the
yard<00:06:22.000> the<00:06:22.210> last<00:06:22.419> year<00:06:22.659> to<00:06:22.870> get<00:06:23.259> more<00:06:23.770> of<00:06:23.979> a

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
yard the last year to get more of a

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:26.550 
yard the last year to get more of a
contemporary<00:06:24.279> interior<00:06:25.240> in<00:06:25.479> it<00:06:25.629> without

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
contemporary interior in it without

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.379 
contemporary interior in it without
killing<00:06:26.979> the<00:06:27.219> performance<00:06:27.759> of<00:06:27.849> the<00:06:28.000> board<00:06:28.210> we

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
killing the performance of the board we

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.089 
killing the performance of the board we
really<00:06:28.659> spent<00:06:28.899> a<00:06:28.960> lot<00:06:28.990> of<00:06:29.110> time<00:06:29.199> on<00:06:29.589> trying<00:06:29.919> to

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
really spent a lot of time on trying to

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.670 
really spent a lot of time on trying to
make<00:06:30.279> a<00:06:30.580> good-looking<00:06:31.240> interior<00:06:32.080> but<00:06:32.379> still

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
make a good-looking interior but still

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.700 
make a good-looking interior but still
lightweight<00:06:33.279> and<00:06:33.870> that's<00:06:34.870> this<00:06:35.409> particular

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
lightweight and that's this particular

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.649 
lightweight and that's this particular
model<00:06:36.099> at<00:06:36.339> the<00:06:36.460> show<00:06:36.639> is<00:06:36.789> the<00:06:36.939> first<00:06:37.180> one<00:06:37.419> with

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
model at the show is the first one with
