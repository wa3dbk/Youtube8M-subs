00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
some it comes down to timing the release

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
some it comes down to timing the release
is<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.680> before<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.250> second<00:00:38.670> light<00:00:38.820> comes<00:00:39.120> on

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
hits 3,500 rpms and after that all

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.680 
hits 3,500 rpms and after that all
shifts<00:00:44.579> will<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.820> as<00:00:44.940> far<00:00:45.210> into<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> red

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
shifts will be as far into the red

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.600 
shifts will be as far into the red
without<00:00:45.899> hitting<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> limiter<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.430> hear
