00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.160 

in<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:02.610> video<00:00:02.850> I<00:00:03.090> just<00:00:03.449> wanted<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.929> show<00:00:04.140> that

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
in this video I just wanted to show that

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.490 
in this video I just wanted to show that
this<00:00:04.650> coil<00:00:04.980> will<00:00:05.430> run<00:00:05.970> on<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.569> lower<00:00:06.870> voltages

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
this coil will run on the lower voltages

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.669 
this coil will run on the lower voltages
a<00:00:09.260> couple<00:00:10.260> water<00:00:11.160> batteries<00:00:12.469> little<00:00:13.469> pieces

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
a couple water batteries little pieces

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.039 
a couple water batteries little pieces
ink<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.460> little<00:00:14.730> piece<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.450> copper<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.839> each

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
ink and a little piece of copper in each

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.720 
ink and a little piece of copper in each
one<00:00:16.699> both<00:00:17.699> connected<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.390> series<00:00:19.730> they're

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
one both connected in series they're

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.170 
one both connected in series they're
both<00:00:20.910> running<00:00:21.180> into<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> small<00:00:22.650> capacitor<00:00:23.310> 120

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
both running into a small capacitor 120

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.089 
both running into a small capacitor 120
micro<00:00:24.510> farad<00:00:24.810> capacitor<00:00:27.769> believe<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> or<00:00:28.980> not

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
micro farad capacitor believe it or not

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.500 
micro farad capacitor believe it or not
this<00:00:29.340> coil<00:00:29.640> takes<00:00:30.000> less<00:00:30.330> power<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.900> run<00:00:32.510> then

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
this coil takes less power to run then

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.780 
this coil takes less power to run then
this<00:00:33.690> other<00:00:33.840> smaller<00:00:34.320> coil<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.890> had<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.579> my

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
this other smaller coil I had in my

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.010 
this other smaller coil I had in my
first<00:00:36.270> videos<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> puts<00:00:39.239> out<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:39.750> more

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
first videos and it puts out a lot more

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.889 
first videos and it puts out a lot more
power<00:00:44.149> hopefully<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.329> see<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.719> on

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
power hopefully you can see this on

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.750 
power hopefully you can see this on
video<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.649> won't<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:46.980> quite<00:00:47.250> enough<00:00:47.280> power

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
video it won't have quite enough power

00:00:47.760 --> 00:01:02.290 
video it won't have quite enough power
to<00:00:47.910> sustain<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.020> LED<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.399> should<00:00:50.640> blink

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:22.300 

try<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.360> on<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.539> 9-volt<00:01:04.080> battery<00:01:04.470> now

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.609 

this<00:01:22.909> 9-volt<00:01:23.420> battery<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:23.869> have<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.170> piece<00:01:24.590> of

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
this 9-volt battery I have a piece of

00:01:24.619 --> 00:02:02.810 
this 9-volt battery I have a piece of
aluminum<00:01:25.250> tape<00:01:25.430> wrapped<00:01:25.759> around<00:01:25.909> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.060 

believe<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.930> or<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.440> will<00:02:04.530> even<00:02:04.740> let<00:02:05.010> us

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
believe it or not it will even let us

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.190 
believe it or not it will even let us
see<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> file<00:02:05.909> off<00:02:06.120> the<00:02:06.150> tape<00:02:06.780> around<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
see a file off the tape around the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:24.550 
see a file off the tape around the
battery<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:13.260> 20<00:02:14.100> watt<00:02:14.280> cfl

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.010 

and<00:02:25.130> made<00:02:25.310> another<00:02:25.700> call<00:02:26.030> call<00:02:26.569> you<00:02:26.630> yesterday

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
and made another call call you yesterday

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.130 
and made another call call you yesterday
a<00:02:27.590> little<00:02:28.430> bit<00:02:28.580> bigger<00:02:28.870> performance<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:29.959> about

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
a little bit bigger performance is about

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.460 
a little bit bigger performance is about
the<00:02:30.380> same<00:02:30.590> as<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:31.040> one<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:32.780> one's<00:02:33.080> four<00:02:33.349> and

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
the same as this one this one's four and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.410 
the same as this one this one's four and
a<00:02:33.500> half<00:02:33.530> by<00:02:33.980> 16<00:02:34.730> or<00:02:35.330> 4<00:02:35.660> x<00:02:35.870> 16
