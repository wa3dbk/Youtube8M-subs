monitor here in our combine basically
this<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:04.830> done<00:00:05.009> with<00:00:05.190> this<00:00:05.310> original<00:00:05.879> screen

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
this is done with this original screen

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.259 
this is done with this original screen
and<00:00:07.049> either<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.440> 50<00:00:07.890> or<00:00:08.010> 60<00:00:08.429> series<00:00:08.639> combine

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
and either a 50 or 60 series combine

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.390 
and either a 50 or 60 series combine
right<00:00:10.260> here<00:00:10.469> we're<00:00:10.650> showing<00:00:10.889> our<00:00:11.130> field

right here we're showing our field
averages<00:00:12.170> basically<00:00:13.170> where<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.280> would<00:00:14.429> be

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
averages basically where this would be

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.310 
averages basically where this would be
what<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:14.940> show<00:00:15.210> if<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.480> turn<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.080> end

six rows you're actually not cutting as
wide<00:00:50.670> we're<00:00:51.629> gonna<00:00:51.780> bump<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.170> back<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
wide we're gonna bump that back up to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.000 
wide we're gonna bump that back up to
eight<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.250> we're<00:00:53.399> doing<00:00:53.520> eight<00:00:53.760> rows<00:00:54.059> here

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
eight so we're doing eight rows here

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.789 
here
so<00:01:54.189> now<00:01:54.310> I'm<00:01:54.429> set<00:01:54.700> up<00:01:54.729> farm<00:01:55.299> one<00:01:55.539> field<00:01:56.049> 120

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
so now I'm set up farm one field 120

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.639 
so now I'm set up farm one field 120
crop<00:01:57.490> corn<00:01:57.850> I've<00:01:58.630> got<00:01:58.840> my<00:01:58.990> header<00:01:59.170> type<00:01:59.409> on

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
crop corn I've got my header type on

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.130 
crop corn I've got my header type on
corn<00:01:59.979> head<00:02:00.189> which<00:02:00.399> is<00:02:00.549> fine

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
corn head which is fine

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.959 
corn head which is fine
and<00:02:02.140> then<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.009> next<00:02:03.250> thing<00:02:03.369> I'd<00:02:03.520> want<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.789> do

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
and then the next thing I'd want to do

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.469 
and then the next thing I'd want to do
here<00:02:04.420> is<00:02:04.539> to<00:02:05.079> do<00:02:05.229> my<00:02:05.380> record<00:02:05.799> stop<00:02:06.130> height

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
here is to do my record stop height

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.910 
here is to do my record stop height
basically<00:02:07.479> what<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.659> need<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.960> do<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.410> just<00:02:08.619> set

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
basically what I need to do is just set

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.789 
basically what I need to do is just set
my<00:02:09.099> set<00:02:09.729> my<00:02:09.879> corn<00:02:10.149> head<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.140> position<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.709> a

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
my set my corn head to a position that a

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.619 
my set my corn head to a position that a
point<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.459> I'm<00:02:12.519> always<00:02:12.730> going<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.060> pass<00:02:13.299> on

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
point that I'm always going to pass on

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.220 
point that I'm always going to pass on
the<00:02:13.750> end

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
the end

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.190 
the end
whenever<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:14.920> raise<00:02:15.220> on<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.640> end<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:16.569> turn<00:02:16.840> and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
whenever I raise on the end to turn and

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.289 
whenever I raise on the end to turn and
then<00:02:17.650> go<00:02:17.680> past<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.220> point<00:02:18.430> again<00:02:18.819> whenever<00:02:19.060> I

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
then go past that point again whenever I

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.479 
then go past that point again whenever I
drop<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.780> head<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.260> start<00:02:20.530> shelling<00:02:20.769> again<00:02:21.250> I

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
drop the head to start shelling again I

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.580 
drop the head to start shelling again I
just<00:02:21.940> want<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.420> manually<00:02:22.840> low<00:02:23.140> I'm<00:02:23.319> just<00:02:23.470> going

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
just want to manually low I'm just going

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.250 
just want to manually low I'm just going
to<00:02:23.650> manually<00:02:24.129> lower<00:02:24.310> my<00:02:24.549> head<00:02:24.700> some<00:02:25.060> now<00:02:25.299> to<00:02:26.230> a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
to manually lower my head some now to a

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.930 
to manually lower my head some now to a
point<00:02:26.560> where<00:02:26.739> I<00:02:26.769> know<00:02:26.890> I'm<00:02:27.220> always<00:02:27.459> gonna<00:02:27.640> pass

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
point where I know I'm always gonna pass

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.470 
point where I know I'm always gonna pass
on<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.329> end<00:02:28.540> I'm<00:02:29.260> gonna<00:02:29.470> hit<00:02:29.680> save<00:02:30.329> here's<00:02:31.329> my

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
on the end I'm gonna hit save here's my

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.390 
on the end I'm gonna hit save here's my
new<00:02:31.599> record<00:02:31.780> stop<00:02:32.290> height<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:33.069> basically

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
new record stop height so basically

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.890 
new record stop height so basically
every<00:02:33.640> time<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.819> turn<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.390> end<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.750> raise

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
every time I turn on the end and raise

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.500 
every time I turn on the end and raise
my<00:02:35.140> header<00:02:35.380> my<00:02:36.250> display<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:36.640> gonna<00:02:36.940> beat<00:02:37.209> my

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
my header my display is gonna beat my

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.479 
my header my display is gonna beat my
recording<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.349> going<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.560> go<00:02:38.650> off<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.340> then

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
recording is going to go off and then

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.699 
recording is going to go off and then
after<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:39.879> turn<00:02:40.150> I'm<00:02:40.900> gonna<00:02:41.049> drop<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.530> header

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
after I turn I'm gonna drop the header

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.890 
after I turn I'm gonna drop the header
again<00:02:42.069> this<00:02:42.489> play<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.760> gonna<00:02:42.970> beat<00:02:43.269> my

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
again this play is gonna beat my

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.220 
again this play is gonna beat my
recordings<00:02:44.440> going<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.650> be<00:02:44.769> turned<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:46.230> going

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
recordings going to be turned on going

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.680 
recordings going to be turned on going
into<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:47.530> two<00:02:47.920> calibrations<00:02:48.790> here<00:02:49.090> all

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
into the two calibrations here all

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.750 
into the two calibrations here all
you've<00:02:49.930> really<00:02:50.110> got<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.680> yield<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:51.250> moisture

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
you've really got is yield and moisture

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.080 
you've really got is yield and moisture
for<00:02:52.629> your<00:02:52.690> moisture<00:02:53.170> calibration<00:02:54.010> what<00:02:54.970> we

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
for your moisture calibration what we

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.319 
for your moisture calibration what we
always<00:02:55.329> do<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.989> just<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:57.010> moisture<00:02:57.700> correction

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
always do is just a moisture correction

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.410 
always do is just a moisture correction
which<00:02:58.989> would<00:02:59.109> be<00:02:59.260> right<00:02:59.500> here

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
which would be right here

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.539 
which would be right here
the<00:03:01.420> an<00:03:01.660> example<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.260> this<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:02.950> just<00:03:03.340> you're

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
the an example of this is just you're

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.819 
the an example of this is just you're
either<00:03:03.700> adding<00:03:04.299> or<00:03:04.329> taking<00:03:04.810> away<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.350> point<00:03:05.709> of

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
either adding or taking away a point of

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.620 
either adding or taking away a point of
moisture<00:03:06.280> or<00:03:06.519> two<00:03:06.700> points<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.150> moisture<00:03:07.510> or

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
moisture or two points of moisture or

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.809 
moisture or two points of moisture or
whatever<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.560> combines<00:03:09.190> showing<00:03:09.519> you<00:03:09.670> that

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
whatever the combines showing you that

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.080 
whatever the combines showing you that
is<00:03:09.970> incorrect<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:11.560> this<00:03:11.739> combine<00:03:12.280> we've<00:03:12.880> got

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
is incorrect in this combine we've got

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.379 
is incorrect in this combine we've got
point<00:03:13.389> five<00:03:14.130> basically<00:03:15.130> in<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.970> you're

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
point five basically in that you're

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.629 
point five basically in that you're
adding<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:17.230> half<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.680> point<00:03:17.859> of<00:03:18.040> moisture<00:03:18.400> to

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
adding a half a point of moisture to

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.640 
adding a half a point of moisture to
what<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.970> combines<00:03:19.420> showing<00:03:19.810> me<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.500> if<00:03:20.560> the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
what the combines showing me so if the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.250 
what the combines showing me so if the
combines<00:03:21.099> been<00:03:21.340> showing<00:03:21.670> me<00:03:21.819> 15<00:03:22.389> and<00:03:22.750> the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
combines been showing me 15 and the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.839 
combines been showing me 15 and the
elevator<00:03:23.709> has<00:03:23.950> told<00:03:24.220> me<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.549> I'm<00:03:24.639> actually

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
elevator has told me that I'm actually

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.010 
here to this moisture correction and I
just<00:03:40.540> put<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.950> point<00:03:42.220> five<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.750> just

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
just put the point five and I just

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.560 
just put the point five and I just
deduct<00:03:44.350> right<00:03:45.310> here<00:03:45.520> with<00:03:45.640> letter<00:03:45.850> G<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.420> I'm

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
deduct right here with letter G so I'm

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.310 
deduct right here with letter G so I'm
subtract<00:03:47.140> on<00:03:47.350> a<00:03:47.410> half<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.740> point<00:03:47.980> of<00:03:48.070> moisture

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
subtract on a half a point of moisture

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.660 
subtract on a half a point of moisture
that's<00:03:50.320> basically<00:03:50.800> how<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.070> how<00:03:51.520> you're

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
that's basically how you how you're

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.570 
that's basically how you how you're
gonna<00:03:51.880> calibrate<00:03:52.570> your<00:03:52.690> moisture<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.620> then

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
gonna calibrate your moisture and then

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.860 
gonna calibrate your moisture and then
you're<00:03:54.760> gonna<00:03:54.910> also<00:03:55.150> do<00:03:55.450> your<00:03:55.600> yield

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
you're gonna also do your yield

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.650 
you're gonna also do your yield
calibration<00:03:56.650> what<00:03:57.640> you're<00:03:57.790> gonna<00:03:57.940> do<00:03:58.180> here<00:03:58.480> is

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
calibration what you're gonna do here is

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.600 
calibration what you're gonna do here is
just<00:03:58.690> come<00:03:59.050> in<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.230> yield<00:03:59.620> calibration<00:04:00.370> letter

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
just come in to yield calibration letter

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.960 
just come in to yield calibration letter
D<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.620> you're<00:04:02.770> gonna<00:04:02.950> do<00:04:03.190> right<00:04:03.610> here<00:04:03.850> which

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
D and you're gonna do right here which

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.970 
D and you're gonna do right here which
says<00:04:04.180> yield<00:04:04.420> calibration<00:04:05.170> is<00:04:05.350> stopped

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
says yield calibration is stopped

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.210 
says yield calibration is stopped
you're<00:04:06.580> gonna<00:04:06.700> hit<00:04:06.940> start<00:04:07.950> once<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.070> hit

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
you're gonna hit start once you hit

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.780 
you're gonna hit start once you hit
start

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
start

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.520 
start
you're<00:04:10.030> gonna<00:04:10.120> start<00:04:10.540> counting<00:04:10.720> up<00:04:11.020> pounds

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
you're gonna start counting up pounds

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.960 
you're gonna start counting up pounds
right<00:04:11.709> here<00:04:11.740> as<00:04:12.070> your<00:04:12.250> as<00:04:12.370> your<00:04:12.580> showing

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
right here as your as your showing

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.060 
right here as your as your showing
through<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.209> field<00:04:13.570> and<00:04:14.080> it's<00:04:14.650> gonna<00:04:14.800> say

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
through the field and it's gonna say

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.009 
through the field and it's gonna say
once<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:15.459> get<00:04:15.640> set<00:04:15.880> your<00:04:16.030> grain<00:04:16.239> tank<00:04:16.510> loaded

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
once you get set your grain tank loaded

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.490 
once you get set your grain tank loaded
it's<00:04:17.530> gonna<00:04:17.650> say<00:04:18.390> 18,000<00:04:19.390> pounds<00:04:19.900> you're

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
it's gonna say 18,000 pounds you're

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.440 
it's gonna say 18,000 pounds you're
gonna<00:04:20.590> dump<00:04:20.890> that<00:04:20.980> onto<00:04:21.459> an<00:04:21.549> empty<00:04:21.910> truck<00:04:22.210> or

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
gonna dump that onto an empty truck or

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.380 
gonna dump that onto an empty truck or
weight<00:04:22.660> wagon<00:04:23.110> way<00:04:23.710> that<00:04:24.040> and<00:04:24.910> whatever<00:04:25.090> they

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
weight wagon way that and whatever they

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.260 
weight wagon way that and whatever they
say<00:04:25.690> say<00:04:25.990> it's<00:04:26.220> 19,000<00:04:27.220> pounds<00:04:27.370> you're<00:04:28.120> gonna

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
say say it's 19,000 pounds you're gonna

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.950 
say say it's 19,000 pounds you're gonna
select<00:04:28.600> letter<00:04:28.930> E<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.620> you're<00:04:30.160> gonna<00:04:30.280> type<00:04:30.550> in

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
select letter E and you're gonna type in

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.300 
select letter E and you're gonna type in
19,000<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.530> what<00:04:32.620> that's<00:04:32.800> going<00:04:32.919> to<00:04:32.980> do<00:04:33.130> is

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
19,000 and what that's going to do is

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.140 
19,000 and what that's going to do is
that's<00:04:33.490> going<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.640> give<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:33.910> a<00:04:33.940> new

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
that's going to give you a new

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.260 
that's going to give you a new
calibration<00:04:34.630> factor<00:04:35.350> right<00:04:35.530> here<00:04:36.270> basically

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
calibration factor right here basically

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.480 
calibration factor right here basically
that's<00:04:37.720> setting<00:04:38.140> up<00:04:38.260> your<00:04:38.410> yield<00:04:38.680> calibration

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
that's setting up your yield calibration

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.190 
that's setting up your yield calibration
and<00:04:39.790> that's<00:04:40.330> really<00:04:40.630> all<00:04:40.750> you're<00:04:40.870> gonna<00:04:40.990> have

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
and that's really all you're gonna have

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.409 
and that's really all you're gonna have
to<00:04:41.350> do<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.590> get<00:04:41.710> yourself<00:04:41.830> into<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.730> end<00:04:43.090> you

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
to do to get yourself into the end you

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.310 
to do to get yourself into the end you
get<00:04:43.960> your<00:04:44.080> harvesting<00:04:44.560> monitor<00:04:44.890> set<00:04:45.130> up
