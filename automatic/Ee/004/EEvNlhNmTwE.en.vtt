00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello to all these weezy for video 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.510
 test.com so today I'm going to you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.490
 talk about the old jack 3d so the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.110
 jack 3d what is it a complement 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.469
 which is classified in the boosters of the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.179
 strength 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.130
 so it serves to improve the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.160
 concentration and congestion 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.180
 muscular as well as to increase the strength 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.890
 among others 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.529
 so the box you know her 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.990
 maybe all but here I am going to you 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.219
 do a little trick on the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.670
 composition I will come back to it 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:39.149
 after that there are the explanations that are 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:47.969
 in English and so the inside of the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:48.980
 box so a small view inside 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.520
 of the box 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.250
 this is me it's acid lemon the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.190
 pod inside that is provided I 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.190
 find it not bad because it allows to 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.000
 do not use a crisis a spoon 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.430
 a teaspoon 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.909
 I found it nice for the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.049
 prices can at the same time on this so 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.049
 the composition 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.460
 I'll put it to you like that so the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:26.790
 arginine creatine betanine composition 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:30.030
 caffeine and the dtm to ar so the dma to 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.890
 what is it so it's all 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.420
 first not an extract of geraniums 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.829
 as we explain the author of 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.900
 strength nutrition 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.420
 and according to the booty site 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.720
 electronics.com it would be a 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.799
 organic compound develop in 1940 44 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.869
 to serve as a nasal decongestant 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.420
 so according to this same site a 2011 study 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:57.240
 would demonstrate that the use of dm aa 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:00.149
 50 to 75 mg would increase the pressure 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.880
 arterial blood pressure from to the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.060
 dose is coupled with caffeine it was 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.789
 worse so knowing that the dose of debate 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.390
 not to be exceeded is 20 to 30 mg 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.060
 before 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.230
 I'll leave you 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.360
 to make your opinion on the question 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.200
 so concerning the undesirable effects 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.810
 so that would be all basic of the ills of 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.209
 head of the nervousness of the excitement of 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.620
 tremors and in addition it could 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.380
 go to palpitations 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.220
 heart and cardiac arrest 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.290
 so it can be dangerous so the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.330
 effects noted by users so 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.150
 it's a strength to make one 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.910
 exceptional congestion collection a 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:52.130
 foolproof concentration 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:55.080
 finally good than personally 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.019
 so the wade taste is not bad it's 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.459
 fun the acid side and nice 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:05.840
 eligibility she's good the facts 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.840
 I had nothing but the concentration 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.040
 knowing that at the base I was 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.780
 first goal users does in 2007 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.140
 about and after a month a month and 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.430
 half two taken at two doses 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.350
 I started having vertigo 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.209
 heart palpitations of pain 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.180
 thoracic and so it's so I 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.959
 stopped and I had even consulted a 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.680
 cardiologist 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.750
 because that's a bit disturbing 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.549
 so fortunately he had me 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.130
 just said that in fact it was not necessary 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.630
 that jean mabuse either and so is 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.180
 here everything is back in order 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.920
 now I would not say it's a 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.940
 dietary supplement that is 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.870
 indispensable since we can very well 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:52.140
 to train without so compared to all 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.700
 the virtues that are vaunted on on these 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.110
 dietary supplements there I think that 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.049
 here I think we can all at all 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.870
 as well to train without now 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:04.680
 so here it is on these 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.959
 if there are people who want to do 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.380
 videos to explain their 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.240
 felt yesterday 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.740
 and give their opinion to them there is 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.880
 Do not hesitate to post comments 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.880
 so that's always interesting 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.660
 and then if you have more information 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.970
 go ahead and seal them and we'll look 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.110
 so that's it so I tell you see you soon 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.110
 for a new video
