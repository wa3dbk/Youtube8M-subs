Joe<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.750> think<00:03:24.170> my<00:03:24.830> only<00:03:25.130> real<00:03:25.460> gripe<00:03:25.670> with<00:03:25.910> the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
Joe I think my only real gripe with the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.300 
Joe I think my only real gripe with the
game<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:27.140> it's<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.440> bit<00:03:27.620> awkward<00:03:27.800> with<00:03:28.160> the

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
game is that it's a bit awkward with the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.340 
game is that it's a bit awkward with the
Dreamcast<00:03:28.910> controller<00:03:29.270> not<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.930> best

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
Dreamcast controller not the best

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.770 
Dreamcast controller not the best
controller<00:03:31.010> for<00:03:31.340> this<00:03:31.460> kind<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.790> game<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.660> can
