so we've loaded up the autumn theme for
this<00:00:21.240> demonstration<00:00:21.480> we're<00:00:22.439> gonna<00:00:22.529> go<00:00:22.769> soon

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
this demonstration we're gonna go soon

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.730 
this demonstration we're gonna go soon
right<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.490> nice<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.119> close<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> water<00:00:27.740> so

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
right in nice and close to the water so

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.840 
right in nice and close to the water so
each<00:00:28.890> theme<00:00:29.310> has<00:00:30.119> slightly<00:00:30.480> different<00:00:31.850> types

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
each theme has slightly different types

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.430 
each theme has slightly different types
of<00:00:33.000> water<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.600> them<00:00:33.870> you'll<00:00:34.020> see<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.260> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
of water in them you'll see that a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
card in I've seen this once before on an

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.050 
card in I've seen this once before on an
actual<00:01:22.630> course<00:01:23.550> not<00:01:24.550> allowed<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:24.820> tell<00:01:24.940> that

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
actual course not allowed to tell that

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:33.840 
actual course not allowed to tell that
story<00:01:25.210> though

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.430 

you<00:01:34.850> can<00:01:34.940> also<00:01:35.060> see<00:01:35.450> as<00:01:35.690> you<00:01:35.840> get<00:01:35.960> deeper<00:01:36.320> out

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
you can also see as you get deeper out

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.560 
you can also see as you get deeper out
into<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.950> water<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.400> lot<00:01:37.940> less<00:01:38.180> light<00:01:38.420> is

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
into the water a lot less light is

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.260 
into the water a lot less light is
passing<00:01:38.810> through<00:01:39.230> and<00:01:39.790> this<00:01:40.790> is<00:01:40.910> tweaked

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
passing through and this is tweaked

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.460 
passing through and this is tweaked
slightly<00:01:41.650> from<00:01:42.650> theme<00:01:42.980> to<00:01:43.280> theme<00:01:43.310> as<00:01:43.730> well

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
slightly from theme to theme as well

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.210 
slightly from theme to theme as well
yeah<00:01:45.470> let's<00:01:45.680> let<00:01:45.860> these<00:01:47.920> crocodiles<00:01:48.920> loose

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
yeah let's let these crocodiles loose

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.870 
yeah let's let these crocodiles loose
maybe<00:01:51.280> place<00:01:52.280> one<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.550> these<00:01:52.700> guys<00:01:53.030> here

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.290 

excellent<00:01:59.470> it's<00:02:00.470> got<00:02:00.620> a<00:02:00.650> few<00:02:00.950> Reed's<00:02:01.340> poking

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
excellent it's got a few Reed's poking

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.340 
excellent it's got a few Reed's poking
through<00:02:02.480> his<00:02:02.630> tail<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:05.080> but<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.200> definitely

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
through his tail but but you definitely

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.339 
through his tail but but you definitely
get<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.620> idea

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.979 

so<00:02:14.920> let's<00:02:15.069> go<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.640> switch<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.209> theme<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:16.870> we're

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
so let's go and switch a theme so we're

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.300 
so let's go and switch a theme so we're
going<00:02:17.140> from<00:02:17.290> autumn<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:19.090> Alpine<00:02:19.780> theme

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
going from autumn to the Alpine theme

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.970 
going from autumn to the Alpine theme
and<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:22.450> water<00:02:22.659> is<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.870> lot<00:02:23.079> clearer<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.799> lot

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
and this water is a lot clearer a lot

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.709 
and this water is a lot clearer a lot
cleaner<00:02:24.730> than<00:02:25.829> the<00:02:26.829> previous<00:02:27.189> theme<00:02:27.540> we<00:02:28.540> don't

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
cleaner than the previous theme we don't

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.479 
cleaner than the previous theme we don't
have<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> lot<00:02:29.019> of<00:02:29.139> light<00:02:29.349> shining<00:02:29.769> on<00:02:30.099> us<00:02:30.129> right

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
have a lot of light shining on us right

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:30.720 
have a lot of light shining on us right
now

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
now

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.030 
now
I<00:02:30.909> think<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.959> mountains<00:02:32.379> are<00:02:32.530> blocking<00:02:32.769> out

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
I think the mountains are blocking out

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.910 
I think the mountains are blocking out
the<00:02:33.159> Sun<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.430> little<00:02:33.700> bit<00:02:37.439> you<00:02:38.439> can<00:02:38.560> see<00:02:38.590> it's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
the Sun a little bit you can see it's

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.860 
the Sun a little bit you can see it's
quite<00:02:39.069> a<00:02:39.159> bit<00:02:39.370> quite<00:02:40.269> a<00:02:40.299> bit<00:02:40.450> different<00:02:40.780> from

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
quite a bit quite a bit different from

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.409 
quite a bit quite a bit different from
theme<00:02:41.109> to<00:02:41.230> theme<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.129> also<00:02:45.280> show<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.239> by

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:46.419 
theme to theme you can also show you by

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.059 
theme to theme you can also show you by
changing<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.169> time<00:02:47.439> of<00:02:47.620> day<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:47.889> you're

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
changing the time of day and you're

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.500 
changing the time of day and you're
gonna<00:02:48.129> see<00:02:48.459> there<00:02:48.730> we<00:02:48.849> go<00:02:48.969> there's<00:02:49.239> some<00:02:49.389> more

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
gonna see there we go there's some more

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.780 
gonna see there we go there's some more
sunlight<00:02:50.819> getting<00:02:51.819> into<00:02:51.969> the<00:02:52.060> water<00:02:52.269> here<00:02:53.790> so

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
sunlight getting into the water here so

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.479 
sunlight getting into the water here so
while<00:02:54.909> those<00:02:55.030> shadows<00:02:55.569> are<00:02:55.750> going<00:02:55.989> through
