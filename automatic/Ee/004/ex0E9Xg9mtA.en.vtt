like I said let's go over all the specs
so<00:00:29.420> first<00:00:29.660> off<00:00:29.840> I'm<00:00:30.470> going<00:00:30.920> to<00:00:31.010> be<00:00:31.100> comparing

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
so first off I'm going to be comparing

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.700 
so first off I'm going to be comparing
this<00:00:31.670> to<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:31.880> galaxy<00:00:32.150> note<00:00:32.269> 10.1<00:00:32.540> quite<00:00:33.500> a<00:00:33.530> bit

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
this to the galaxy note 10.1 quite a bit

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.960 
this to the galaxy note 10.1 quite a bit
in<00:00:33.739> this<00:00:33.920> video<00:00:34.100> cuz<00:00:34.309> that's<00:00:34.519> kind<00:00:34.730> of<00:00:34.790> like

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
in this video cuz that's kind of like

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.360 
in this video cuz that's kind of like
the<00:00:35.150> cousin<00:00:35.629> of<00:00:35.809> this<00:00:36.290> tableau<00:00:37.100> of<00:00:37.129> course

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
the cousin of this tableau of course

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.950 
the cousin of this tableau of course
it's<00:00:37.550> a<00:00:37.610> different<00:00:37.969> branding<00:00:38.360> it's<00:00:38.570> called

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
it's a different branding it's called

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.260 
it's a different branding it's called
the<00:00:39.110> a<00:00:39.140> tip<00:00:39.500> tablet<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.190> it's<00:00:40.309> it's<00:00:40.880> a<00:00:40.969> Windows

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
the a tip tablet and it's it's a Windows

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.150 
the a tip tablet and it's it's a Windows
8<00:00:41.450> tablet<00:00:41.480> it's<00:00:42.170> actually<00:00:42.350> a<00:00:42.559> Windows<00:00:42.920> RT

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
8 tablet it's actually a Windows RT

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.889 
8 tablet it's actually a Windows RT
tablet<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:43.969> there's<00:00:44.149> a<00:00:44.239> bit<00:00:44.360> of<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.570> difference

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
tablet so there's a bit of a difference

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.450 
tablet so there's a bit of a difference
there<00:00:44.960> I'm<00:00:45.350> sure<00:00:45.620> you<00:00:45.739> can<00:00:45.890> find<00:00:45.920> that<00:00:46.250> out<00:00:46.430> on

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
there I'm sure you can find that out on

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.010 
there I'm sure you can find that out on
your<00:00:46.760> own<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.210> if<00:00:47.360> you<00:00:47.510> don't<00:00:47.719> if<00:00:47.840> you<00:00:47.899> have

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
going to be a 10.1 inch tablet of course

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.950 
going to be a 10.1 inch tablet of course
it's<00:00:56.149> it's<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.829> 1366<00:00:57.829> x<00:00:58.280> 768<00:00:58.940> display<00:00:59.149> so<00:00:59.600> it<00:00:59.840> is

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
it's it's a 1366 x 768 display so it is

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.200 
it's it's a 1366 x 768 display so it is
a<00:00:59.989> bit<00:01:00.110> less<00:01:00.440> than<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.680> galaxy<00:01:01.070> note<00:01:01.100> 10.1<00:01:01.550> and

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
a bit less than the galaxy note 10.1 and

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.270 
a bit less than the galaxy note 10.1 and
the<00:01:02.600> processor<00:01:03.079> is<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.260> bit<00:01:03.440> lower<00:01:03.620> as<00:01:03.829> well<00:01:04.039> as

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
the processor is a bit lower as well as

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.969 
the processor is a bit lower as well as

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
you must keep in mind that windows 8

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.480 
you must keep in mind that windows 8
doesn't<00:01:13.970> really<00:01:14.240> need<00:01:14.659> much<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.439> be<00:01:15.590> powerful

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
doesn't really need much to be powerful

really nice quad-core processor or at

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.480 
really nice quad-core processor or at

buttery<00:01:25.189> feel<00:01:25.520> too<00:01:25.729> of<00:01:25.850> course<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:26.119> also<00:01:26.270> need

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
buttery feel too of course you also need

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.690 
buttery feel too of course you also need
jelly<00:01:26.780> bean<00:01:27.020> but<00:01:27.229> for<00:01:27.710> windows<00:01:28.009> 8<00:01:28.159> for<00:01:28.460> Windows

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
jelly bean but for windows 8 for Windows

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.280 
jelly bean but for windows 8 for Windows
RT<00:01:28.850> it's<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.210> whole<00:01:29.360> different<00:01:29.479> story<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.259> the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
RT it's a whole different story so the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.410 
RT it's a whole different story so the
dual<00:01:30.650> core<00:01:30.950> processor<00:01:30.979> should<00:01:31.970> be<00:01:32.150> more<00:01:32.360> than

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
dual core processor should be more than

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.539 
dual core processor should be more than
enough<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.350> resolution<00:01:34.040> is<00:01:34.130> fine<00:01:34.369> as

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
enough and the resolution is fine as

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.399 
enough and the resolution is fine as
well<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:34.970> in<00:01:35.390> terms<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:35.810> ports<00:01:36.140> it's<00:01:36.290> gonna

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
well and in terms of ports it's gonna

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.950 
well and in terms of ports it's gonna
have<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.619> micro<00:01:36.950> HDMI<00:01:37.549> as<00:01:37.729> well<00:01:38.030> as<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.210> USB<00:01:38.689> port
