scrapped up here and W in touch at it
you'll<00:01:28.270> probably<00:01:28.509> notice<00:01:28.960> but<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.759> parent

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
you'll probably notice but the parent

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.289 
you'll probably notice but the parent
parent<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.630> script<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.560> player<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
parent of the script is the player and a

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.620 
parent of the script is the player and a
simple<00:01:34.899> doge<00:01:35.110> at<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.909> connection<00:01:37.240> line

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
simple doge at it this connection line

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.219 
simple doge at it this connection line
so<00:01:37.990> if<00:01:38.170> you'd<00:01:38.950> stag<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.670> script<00:01:40.299> of<00:01:40.420> NW<00:01:40.960> tennis

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
so if you'd stag the script of NW tennis

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.010 
so if you'd stag the script of NW tennis
player<00:01:41.500> up<00:01:41.740> m<00:01:41.979> above<00:01:42.580> it<00:01:43.509> would<00:01:43.630> be<00:01:43.750> clear

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
player up m above it would be clear

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
player up m above it would be clear
though<00:01:44.289> chatted<00:01:44.709> connects<00:01:45.220> function<00:01:45.640> name

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.610 

what<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.260> could<00:01:57.440> do<00:01:57.680> is<00:01:57.920> make<00:01:58.160> a<00:01:58.190> table<00:01:58.550> and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
what you could do is make a table and

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.590 
what you could do is make a table and
fill<00:02:00.620> player<00:02:01.040> names<00:02:01.370> and<00:02:01.640> inserts<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.240> table

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
but there in case you haven't done

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.870 
but there in case you haven't done
tables<00:02:05.300> yet<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:06.230> go<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:06.980> off-topic<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.820> I'll

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
tables yet I go to off-topic so I'll

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.910 
tables yet I go to off-topic so I'll
just<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.179> simple<00:02:08.479> if<00:02:08.690> statement<00:02:08.720> for<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.380> and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
just a simple if statement for that and

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.110 
just a simple if statement for that and
which<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.060> actually<00:02:11.810> about<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.740> same

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
which is actually about the same

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.410 
which is actually about the same
difficulty<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.440> elaborating<00:02:15.440> sir<00:02:15.650> and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
difficulty and elaborating sir and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.790 
difficulty and elaborating sir and
tables<00:02:17.420> just<00:02:17.480> fittings<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.350> this<00:02:18.500> what<00:02:18.710> I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
tables just fittings and this what I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:37.780 
tables just fittings and this what I
