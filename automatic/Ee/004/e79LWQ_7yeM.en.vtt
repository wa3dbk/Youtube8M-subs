scalps pH balance leaving you with
healthy<00:02:23.970> hair<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.810> first<00:02:25.080> thing<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.440> do<00:02:25.500> is

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
healthy hair so the first thing I do is

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.100 
healthy hair so the first thing I do is
the<00:02:25.830> shampoo<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.670> since<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.360> only<00:02:27.390> wash<00:02:27.810> me<00:02:27.990> or

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
the shampoo and since I only wash me or

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.470 
the shampoo and since I only wash me or
twice<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.380> week<00:02:28.560> each<00:02:28.950> time<00:02:29.430> after<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:29.880> shampoo<00:02:30.090> I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
twice a week each time after I shampoo I

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.800 
twice a week each time after I shampoo I
use<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:31.050> mask<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.460> conditioning<00:02:33.120> mask<00:02:33.300> which<00:02:33.780> is

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
use a mask a conditioning mask which is

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.640 
use a mask a conditioning mask which is
the<00:02:34.380> living<00:02:35.100> proof<00:02:35.280> restore<00:02:35.990> mask<00:02:36.990> treatment

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
the living proof restore mask treatment

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.930 
the living proof restore mask treatment
for<00:02:37.860> drying<00:02:38.070> damaged<00:02:38.520> hair

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
for drying damaged hair

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.500 
for drying damaged hair
so<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.330> restore<00:02:39.750> line<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:41.180> exactly<00:02:42.180> what<00:02:42.390> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
so the restore line is exactly what it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.260 
so the restore line is exactly what it
says<00:02:42.690> it's<00:02:42.990> restoring<00:02:43.860> your<00:02:44.160> hairs<00:02:44.430> integrity

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
says it's restoring your hairs integrity

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.600 
says it's restoring your hairs integrity
its<00:02:45.630> strength<00:02:46.170> it's<00:02:46.530> making<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.950> stronger<00:02:47.370> so

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
its strength it's making it stronger so

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.990 
its strength it's making it stronger so
it<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.209> withstand<00:02:48.500> more<00:02:49.500> heat<00:02:49.830> styling<00:02:50.610> if

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
it can withstand more heat styling if

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.330 
it can withstand more heat styling if
that's<00:02:51.209> what<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.480> do<00:02:51.660> I'm<00:02:52.190> making<00:02:53.190> it

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
stronger from the cortex out so that's

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.380 
stronger from the cortex out so that's
really<00:02:55.709> cool<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.340> says<00:02:56.850> it's<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.150> deep

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
hair greasy doesn't weight down does it

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.550 
hair greasy doesn't weight down does it
make<00:06:26.150> it<00:06:26.270> crusty<00:06:26.750> it<00:06:26.870> doesn't<00:06:27.229> put<00:06:27.379> white

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
make it crusty it doesn't put white

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.180 
make it crusty it doesn't put white
flakes<00:06:27.919> in<00:06:28.190> it<00:06:28.370> and<00:06:28.610> the<00:06:29.270> way<00:06:29.389> it<00:06:29.889> thickens<00:06:30.889> is

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
flakes in it and the way it thickens is

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.680 
flakes in it and the way it thickens is
isn't<00:06:31.879> by<00:06:32.289> creating<00:06:33.520> film<00:06:34.520> on<00:06:34.909> the<00:06:35.150> strands<00:06:35.569> of

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
isn't by creating film on the strands of

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.170 
isn't by creating film on the strands of
the<00:06:35.779> hair<00:06:36.020> it<00:06:36.289> creates<00:06:36.770> these<00:06:36.919> little<00:06:37.250> balls

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
the hair it creates these little balls

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.899 
the hair it creates these little balls
these<00:06:38.659> microscopic<00:06:39.259> balls<00:06:39.770> of<00:06:40.219> volume<00:06:40.729> that

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909 
these microscopic balls of volume that

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:41.500 
these microscopic balls of volume that
can't

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
can't

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.630 
can't
see<00:06:41.630> but<00:06:42.200> so<00:06:42.380> the<00:06:42.500> hair<00:06:42.710> just<00:06:42.980> keeps<00:06:43.280> getting

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:43.640 
see but so the hair just keeps getting

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.150 
see but so the hair just keeps getting
more<00:06:43.850> spaced<00:06:44.300> out<00:06:44.570> and<00:06:44.960> they<00:06:45.350> get<00:06:45.530> layered<00:06:45.800> on

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 
more spaced out and they get layered on

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.520 
more spaced out and they get layered on
top<00:06:46.190> of<00:06:46.460> each<00:06:46.730> other<00:06:47.000> those<00:06:47.240> balls<00:06:47.600> so<00:06:48.320> it

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
top of each other those balls so it

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.370 
top of each other those balls so it
creates<00:06:48.860> more<00:06:48.950> and<00:06:49.160> more<00:06:49.310> volume<00:06:49.960> and<00:06:50.960> then

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
creates more and more volume and then

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.710 
creates more and more volume and then
for<00:06:51.860> the<00:06:51.950> last<00:06:52.130> thing<00:06:52.490> if<00:06:52.700> I<00:06:52.820> want<00:06:53.060> to<00:06:53.240> have

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
for the last thing if I want to have

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.020 
for the last thing if I want to have
texturized<00:06:54.590> hair<00:06:54.860> like<00:06:55.070> beachy<00:06:55.490> wave<00:06:55.700> hair

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
texturized hair like beachy wave hair

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.810 
texturized hair like beachy wave hair
and<00:06:56.360> then<00:06:57.110> I<00:06:57.140> would<00:06:57.590> put<00:06:57.830> in<00:06:58.040> my<00:06:58.070> living<00:06:58.580> proof

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
and then I would put in my living proof

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.590 
and then I would put in my living proof
amp<00:06:59.360> squared<00:07:00.580> instant<00:07:01.580> texture<00:07:02.000> volume<00:07:02.450> what

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
amp squared instant texture volume what

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.870 
amp squared instant texture volume what
you<00:07:02.720> put<00:07:02.900> in<00:07:03.020> dry<00:07:03.320> hair<00:07:03.650> it<00:07:04.520> gives<00:07:04.640> you

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
you put in dry hair it gives you

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.500 
you put in dry hair it gives you
workable<00:07:05.360> volume<00:07:05.960> and<00:07:06.490> texture<00:07:07.490> for<00:07:07.820> up<00:07:07.910> to<00:07:08.060> 42

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
workable volume and texture for up to 42

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.570 
workable volume and texture for up to 42
hours<00:07:08.960> which<00:07:09.230> is<00:07:09.410> really<00:07:09.740> cool<00:07:10.010> without

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
hours which is really cool without

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.140 
hours which is really cool without
making<00:07:11.330> your<00:07:11.420> hair<00:07:11.630> feel<00:07:12.310> dirty<00:07:13.310> that's
