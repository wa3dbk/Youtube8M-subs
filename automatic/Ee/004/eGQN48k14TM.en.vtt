00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:25.270
 my name is ralph I am evil that follows 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.470
 fear almost 3 meters weight 290 thousand kilos a 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.470
 sometimes I get the bad temper 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.930
 and I guess my passion one afternoon to flower 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.020
 Skin I'm not going to lie 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.300
 whatever else 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.580
 I'm a flight crusher things 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.160
 professionally 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.880
 the truth is I'm very good in local maybe 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.080
 the best I know the problem is that 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.610
 repair is the name of the game 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.420
 literally repair Felix and one 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.829
 [Music] 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.350
 clear obvious that the subject called Felix 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.690
 the repairman is the good one is nice 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.320
 like all the good ones without a doubt prepare 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.720
 very good things but 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.659
 when you receive a magic hammer from your 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.729
 father who is so difficult because if it were 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.100
 a normal contractor only a carpenter 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.030
 I guarantee you that you would not be able to 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.159
 repair so fast the damage that I do 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.800
 is when I affirm the work receives a 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.630
 medal 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.580
 there are medals for a good 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.580
 demolition to that 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.180
 and there are not 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.320
 I took 30 years of doing this I've seen him go 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.990
 and we will come many sad posts 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.230
 think of the signs of asteroids 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.820
 7 who knows what can be used in a 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.980
 stable work in the article is 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.700
 anything, I'm very lucky 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.500
 it's just that the truth is not easy to love 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.370
 your work when it seems that nobody 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.370
 like what you do 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.270
 two
