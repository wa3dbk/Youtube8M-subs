00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
the runway pretty much what I did is I

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.210 
the runway pretty much what I did is I
just<00:01:17.480> kind<00:01:17.990> of<00:01:18.050> dusted<00:01:18.350> some<00:01:18.530> pinks<00:01:18.860> all<00:01:19.040> over

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
just kind of dusted some pinks all over

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.710 
just kind of dusted some pinks all over
the<00:01:19.310> lid<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:19.520> then<00:01:19.760> I<00:01:19.820> accented<00:01:20.360> them<00:01:20.510> with

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
the lid and then I accented them with

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.899 
the lid and then I accented them with
some<00:01:20.900> deeper<00:01:21.260> Browns<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:22.159> also<00:01:22.340> paired<00:01:22.790> it

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
some deeper Browns and I also paired it

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.490 
some deeper Browns and I also paired it
with<00:01:22.940> a<00:01:23.270> lacquer<00:01:23.630> lip<00:01:23.990> now<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:24.260> can

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
with a lacquer lip now you can

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.649

incorporate a pop of color anything you
want<00:01:26.930> but<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.140> decided<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.770> kind<00:01:27.950> of<00:01:28.040> accent<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
want but I decided to kind of accent the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.370 
want but I decided to kind of accent the
lips<00:01:29.090> with<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.510> eyes<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.659> little<00:01:30.110> bit<00:01:30.230> so

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
lips with the eyes a little bit so

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.990 
lips with the eyes a little bit so
that's<00:01:30.560> why<00:01:30.710> I<00:01:30.740> chose<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.310> little<00:01:31.550> bit<00:01:31.640> more<00:01:31.820> of

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
that's why I chose a little bit more of

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.719 
that's why I chose a little bit more of
a<00:01:32.150> pinky<00:01:32.630> nude<00:01:32.870> shade<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.560> I<00:01:33.830> really<00:01:34.370> do<00:01:34.520> hope
