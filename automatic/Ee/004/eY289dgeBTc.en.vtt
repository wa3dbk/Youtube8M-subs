00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
that I've thought about so much I would

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.310 
that I've thought about so much I would
always<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.890> when<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.430> was<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.899> old<00:00:55.079> house

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
always think when I was in my old house

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.189 
always think when I was in my old house
that<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.860> used<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.219> filming<00:00:56.610> alone<00:00:57.480> editing

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that I used to filming alone editing

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.110 
that I used to filming alone editing
going<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> store<00:00:59.100> filming<00:00:59.640> these<00:00:59.699> videos

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
going to the store filming these videos

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.150 
going to the store filming these videos
I<00:01:00.329> would<00:01:00.390> always<00:01:00.690> say<00:01:01.020> it'll<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.649> worth<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
I would always say it'll be worth it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.429 
I would always say it'll be worth it
once<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.510> cookbook<00:01:03.840> sound<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.170> would<00:01:04.229> always

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.640 
what I wanted to do was share my videos
with<00:03:04.140> other<00:03:04.530> people<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.010> started<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.580> purely

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
with other people I started it purely

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.310 
with other people I started it purely
100%<00:03:07.650> out<00:03:07.860> of<00:03:08.400> passion<00:03:08.670> because<00:03:09.030> going<00:03:10.020> from

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
100% out of passion because going from

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.479 
100% out of passion because going from
high<00:03:10.440> school<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.709> college<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.130> kind<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.370> that

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
high school to college is kind of that

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.940 
high school to college is kind of that
awkward<00:03:11.940> transition<00:03:12.209> here<00:03:12.720> where<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.799> don't

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
awkward transition here where you don't

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.380 
awkward transition here where you don't
really<00:03:14.040> hang<00:03:14.700> out<00:03:14.760> with<00:03:14.880> your<00:03:15.000> high<00:03:15.150> school

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
really hang out with your high school

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.490 
really hang out with your high school
friends<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:15.930> don't<00:03:16.049> really<00:03:16.200> have<00:03:16.380> any

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
friends you don't really have any

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.380 
friends you don't really have any
friends<00:03:16.620> from<00:03:16.890> college<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:17.820> really<00:03:18.239> didn't

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
friends from college so I really didn't

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.150 
friends from college so I really didn't
know<00:03:18.480> what<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.660> do<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:18.959> made<00:03:19.230> my<00:03:19.410> channel<00:03:19.830> out

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
know what to do so I made my channel out

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.699 
know what to do so I made my channel out
of<00:03:20.640> pure<00:03:20.940> boredom<00:03:20.970> but<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:21.810> just<00:03:22.200> knew<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.470> I

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
of pure boredom but I just knew that I

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.949 
of pure boredom but I just knew that I
wanted<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.220> tell<00:03:23.459> others<00:03:23.940> things<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.870> I

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
wanted to tell others things that I

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.229 
wanted to tell others things that I
learned<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.590> made<00:03:25.860> probably<00:03:26.340> 15<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.000> 20

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
learned so I made probably 15 to 20

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.910 
learned so I made probably 15 to 20
videos<00:03:27.540> over<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.959> summer<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.290> had<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.530> good<00:03:28.739> time

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
videos over the summer I had a good time

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.890 
videos over the summer I had a good time
making<00:03:29.100> them<00:03:29.370> sharing<00:03:30.030> my<00:03:30.180> passion<00:03:30.360> built<00:03:30.810> up

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
making them sharing my passion built up

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.060 
making them sharing my passion built up
a<00:03:30.959> little<00:03:31.049> fan<00:03:31.350> base<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.739> didn't<00:03:31.890> really

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
a little fan base but I didn't really

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.140 
a little fan base but I didn't really
think<00:03:32.190> anything<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.820> thought<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.060> was

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
think anything of it I thought it was

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.940 
think anything of it I thought it was
just<00:03:33.239> something<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.840> know<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.500> just<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.739> phase

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
just something you know in just a phase

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.470 
just something you know in just a phase
I'm<00:03:35.160> just<00:03:35.280> gonna<00:03:35.430> make<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.610> couple<00:03:35.850> videos<00:03:36.030> and

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640
