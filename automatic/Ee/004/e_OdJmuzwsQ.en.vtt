ring this probe particularly well so we

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.660 
ring this probe particularly well so we
just<00:01:04.809> need<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:05.019> small<00:01:05.470> tool<00:01:05.799> here<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.430> check

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
just need a small tool here to check

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.340 
just need a small tool here to check

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
as you can see fits in nice and easily

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.830 
as you can see fits in nice and easily
that<00:01:32.710> means<00:01:32.920> it's<00:01:33.039> beyond<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.750> beyond<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
that means it's beyond the beyond the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.069 
that means it's beyond the beyond the
time<00:01:35.020> which<00:01:35.200> we<00:01:35.289> should<00:01:35.439> change<00:01:35.619> it<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.960> was

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
time which we should change it if it was

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.709 
time which we should change it if it was
just<00:01:38.320> about<00:01:38.439> right<00:01:38.859> the<00:01:39.579> point<00:01:39.820> 7<00:01:40.149> follow<00:01:40.359> side

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
just about right the point 7 follow side

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.679 
just about right the point 7 follow side
would<00:01:41.320> sit<00:01:41.590> just<00:01:42.159> flush<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.789> wouldn't<00:01:43.479> sink

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
would sit just flush and wouldn't sink

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.529 
would sit just flush and wouldn't sink
into<00:01:43.869> one<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.890> female<00:01:45.189> ends<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:46.390> this

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
into one of the female ends so this

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.560 
into one of the female ends so this
change<00:01:46.810> needs<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:47.499> go<00:01:48.119> if<00:01:49.119> you<00:01:49.270> catch<00:01:49.420> the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
change needs to go if you catch the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:57.690 
change needs to go if you catch the
chain<00:01:49.780> early<00:01:50.079> enough<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.780> one<00:01:53.460> city<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
chain early enough on the one city it

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.330 
chain early enough on the one city it
won't<00:01:57.909> fit<00:01:57.999> in<00:01:58.149> nicely

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
won't fit in nicely

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.590 
won't fit in nicely
that<00:02:00.340> means<00:02:00.550> I<00:02:00.610> won't<00:02:00.730> necessarily<00:02:00.970> have<00:02:01.570> to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
that means I won't necessarily have to

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.390 
that means I won't necessarily have to
change<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.930> cassette<00:02:02.230> as<00:02:02.320> well<00:02:02.530> but<00:02:03.220> by<00:02:03.340> the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
change the cassette as well but by the

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
first off we just need to remove this

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.170

locking nut with a specific tool the
slots<00:03:42.510> in<00:03:44.210> and<00:03:45.210> then<00:03:45.300> we're<00:03:45.390> gonna<00:03:45.480> need<00:03:45.630> to

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
slots in and then we're gonna need to

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.470 
slots in and then we're gonna need to
use<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:46.110> chain<00:03:46.680> with<00:03:46.910> obviously<00:03:47.910> one<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.240> that

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
use a chain with obviously one do that

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.320 
use a chain with obviously one do that
the<00:03:49.380> direction<00:03:49.740> i'm<00:03:49.950> turning<00:03:50.280> than<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.550> is

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
the direction i'm turning than that is

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.170 
the direction i'm turning than that is
the<00:03:51.450> same<00:03:51.600> direction<00:03:51.810> as<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.170> hub<00:03:52.890> turns<00:03:53.190> I'm

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
the same direction as the hub turns I'm

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.570 
the same direction as the hub turns I'm
tightening<00:03:54.600> up<00:03:54.780> it's<00:03:54.990> not<00:03:55.080> such<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.290> problem<00:03:55.580> so

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
tightening up it's not such a problem so

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.790 
tightening up it's not such a problem so
what<00:03:56.730> we're<00:03:56.820> going<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.000> need<00:03:57.470> here's<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.590> chain

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
what we're going to need here's a chain

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.270 
what we're going to need here's a chain
with<00:03:59.120> this<00:04:00.120> will<00:04:00.330> allow<00:04:00.510> us<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:02.959> hold<00:04:04.280> the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
with this will allow us to hold the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.260 
with this will allow us to hold the
cassette<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:05.730> place<00:04:05.990> while<00:04:06.990> i'm<00:04:07.230> doin<00:04:07.530> up<00:04:08.270> yeah

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
cassette in place while i'm doin up yeah

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:17.740 
cassette in place while i'm doin up yeah
