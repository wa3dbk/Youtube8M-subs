different styles and ways of doing it

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.529 
different styles and ways of doing it
but<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> way<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> like<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.260> do<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.529> and

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
but this is the way I like to do it and

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.150 
but this is the way I like to do it and
basically<00:00:21.539> I've<00:00:22.170> opened<00:00:22.560> dozens<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:23.039> these

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
basically I've opened dozens of these

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.099 
basically I've opened dozens of these
things<00:00:23.490> I've<00:00:23.820> cut<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.090> finger<00:00:24.449> open<00:00:24.600> dozens

things I've cut the finger open dozens
of<00:00:25.260> these<00:00:25.380> things<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:26.960> this<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> way<00:00:28.289> that

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
of these things so this is the way that

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.460 
of these things so this is the way that
I<00:00:28.560> found<00:00:28.859> works<00:00:29.220> best<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.609> me<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.470> doesn't

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470

hurt<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> process<00:00:32.450> so<00:00:34.340> basically<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:36.059> I

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
hurt in the process so basically what I

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.510 
hurt in the process so basically what I
used<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.559> would<00:00:37.680> take<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> knife<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
used to do was I would take a knife and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.220 
used to do was I would take a knife and
I<00:00:38.640> would<00:00:38.760> go<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.059> around<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.510> outside<00:00:39.989> edges

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
I would go all around the outside edges

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
I would go all around the outside edges
of<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> packaging<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.910> problem<00:00:42.210> with

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
of the packaging but the problem with

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
of the packaging but the problem with
that<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.739> knife<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.129> pierced<00:00:44.399> this

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that was one that knife can pierced this

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.520 
that was one that knife can pierced this
plastic<00:00:44.969> very<00:00:45.120> easily<00:00:45.480> come<00:00:46.110> through<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
plastic very easily come through on the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.340 
plastic very easily come through on the
other<00:00:46.649> side<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.160> cut<00:00:47.280> my<00:00:47.399> finger<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:48.170> it<00:00:49.170> would

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
other side and cut my finger or it would

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.549 
other side and cut my finger or it would
leave<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.710> big<00:00:50.129> flap<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.629> also<00:00:52.410> was

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
leave this big flap here that also was

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.020 
leave this big flap here that also was
very<00:00:52.620> sharp<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.340> could<00:00:53.489> cut<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:53.789> finger

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030

fingernail clippers get them a target

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.539 
fingernail clippers get them a target
for<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.459> dollar<00:02:44.670> or<00:02:44.790> something<00:02:45.209> go<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.140> there

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
for a dollar or something go in there

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.880 
for a dollar or something go in there
see<00:02:47.549> little<00:02:47.910> cable<00:02:48.780> there<00:02:48.930> get<00:02:49.560> right<00:02:49.769> up

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
see little cable there get right up

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.309 
see little cable there get right up
underneath<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:52.069> snip<00:02:54.019> grab<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.170> knot

pull<00:02:56.130> straight<00:02:56.400> through<00:02:56.670> there's<00:02:57.269> your<00:02:57.390> wire

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
pull straight through there's your wire

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.910 
pull straight through there's your wire
now<00:02:58.650> your<00:02:58.860> figure<00:02:59.220> should<00:02:59.760> be<00:03:00.030> oh<00:03:00.920> that's

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
now your figure should be oh that's

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.350 
now your figure should be oh that's
another<00:03:02.099> thing<00:03:02.310> whenever<00:03:02.640> there's<00:03:02.970> bubbles

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
another thing whenever there's bubbles

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.660 
another thing whenever there's bubbles
that<00:03:03.480> stick<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:03.959> around<00:03:04.319> areas<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.950> bend<00:03:05.519> those

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
that stick in around areas I bend those

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.850 
that stick in around areas I bend those
out<00:03:05.970> I've<00:03:06.959> been<00:03:07.110> though<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.590> they<00:03:07.709> don't

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
out I've been though so that they don't

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.559 
out I've been though so that they don't
have<00:03:08.519> anything<00:03:08.790> else<00:03:09.090> that's<00:03:09.299> giving<00:03:09.540> me

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
have anything else that's giving me

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.170 
have anything else that's giving me
extra<00:03:09.780> resistance<00:03:10.109> on<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.500> figure<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:12.000> it'll

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
extra resistance on the figure so it'll

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.460 
extra resistance on the figure so it'll
come<00:03:12.329> out<00:03:12.420> much<00:03:12.540> smoother<00:03:12.870> something<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.350> had

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
come out much smoother something I had

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.800 
come out much smoother something I had
to<00:03:13.500> learn<00:03:13.709> when<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:13.980> was<00:03:14.100> opening<00:03:14.810> halos

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
to learn when I was opening halos

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.870 
to learn when I was opening halos

you<00:03:24.930> have<00:03:25.079> your<00:03:25.200> action<00:03:25.530> figure<00:03:27.079> maintains

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
you have your action figure maintains

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.890 
you have your action figure maintains
the<00:03:28.380> bubble<00:03:29.010> or<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.480> insert<00:03:30.480> if<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.720> need

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900
