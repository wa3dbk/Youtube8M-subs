00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.320 

but<00:00:06.069> here<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.980> get<00:00:09.129> these<00:00:09.280> bindings<00:00:09.940> like<00:00:10.180> I

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
but here to get these bindings like I

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.270 
but here to get these bindings like I
said<00:00:10.570> you<00:00:10.750> need<00:00:10.930> this<00:00:11.110> 45<00:00:11.650> degree<00:00:11.920> angle<00:00:12.250> and

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
said you need this 45 degree angle and

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.240 
said you need this 45 degree angle and
again<00:00:12.639> I<00:00:12.670> lucked<00:00:13.059> out<00:00:13.949> because<00:00:14.949> I<00:00:15.070> have

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
again I lucked out because I have

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.640 
again I lucked out because I have
squares<00:00:15.609> on<00:00:15.850> here<00:00:16.180> I<00:00:16.330> was<00:00:16.750> just<00:00:16.960> able<00:00:17.140> to<00:00:17.320> cut

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
squares on here I was just able to cut

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.250 
squares on here I was just able to cut
roughly<00:00:18.310> a<00:00:18.580> 45<00:00:18.789> degree<00:00:19.240> angle<00:00:19.420> by<00:00:19.869> following

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
roughly a 45 degree angle by following

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.390 
roughly a 45 degree angle by following
corner<00:00:20.740> to<00:00:20.830> corner<00:00:21.070> of<00:00:21.400> the<00:00:21.430> pattern<00:00:23.369> okay<00:00:24.369> I

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
corner to corner of the pattern okay I

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.910 
corner to corner of the pattern okay I
did<00:00:24.580> a<00:00:24.610> little<00:00:24.820> measuring<00:00:25.240> I<00:00:25.650> think<00:00:26.650> I<00:00:26.770> have

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
did a little measuring I think I have

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:37.720 
did a little measuring I think I have
enough<00:00:27.190> to<00:00:27.369> cut<00:00:27.670> these<00:00:27.880> two<00:00:28.210> inches<00:00:28.720> so

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.740 

you

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:59.200 

so<00:00:43.750> there's<00:00:44.140> my<00:00:44.410> bindings

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.029 

yeah

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.609 

so<00:01:04.000> now<00:01:04.150> what<00:01:04.299> you<00:01:04.420> do<00:01:04.600> is<00:01:04.780> you<00:01:04.930> decide<00:01:05.110> which

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
so now what you do is you decide which

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.560 
so now what you do is you decide which
it<00:01:05.830> would<00:01:05.979> be<00:01:06.009> your<00:01:06.280> inside<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:06.850> outside<00:01:07.030> and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
it would be your inside and outside and

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.020 
it would be your inside and outside and
online<00:01:07.900> of<00:01:08.080> course<00:01:08.640> doesn't<00:01:09.640> really<00:01:09.759> make

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
online of course doesn't really make

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.850 
online of course doesn't really make
much<00:01:10.299> difference<00:01:10.330> also<00:01:11.110> we'll<00:01:11.409> work<00:01:11.560> on<00:01:11.770> the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
much difference also we'll work on the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.120 
much difference also we'll work on the
inside<00:01:12.369> here<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.740> take<00:01:14.740> your<00:01:14.770> little

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
inside here and you take your little

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.550 
inside here and you take your little
binding<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:16.060> let's<00:01:16.990> not<00:01:17.200> start<00:01:17.590> with<00:01:17.710> it

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
binding and let's not start with it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.800 
binding and let's not start with it
another<00:01:20.560> one<00:01:20.830> so<00:01:21.759> you<00:01:22.149> make<00:01:22.930> sure<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.170> have

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
another one so you make sure you have

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:34.100 
another one so you make sure you have
four<00:01:25.810> seven<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.259> a<00:01:26.350> half<00:01:26.380> inches<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:33.070> pin

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
four seven and a half inches and you pin

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.219 
four seven and a half inches and you pin
this<00:01:35.110> along<00:01:35.500> this<00:01:35.740> edge<00:01:36.009> here<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.119> have<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
this along this edge here so I have the

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.109 
this along this edge here so I have the
right<00:01:38.259> sides<00:01:38.740> are<00:01:38.950> together<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:39.729> this<00:01:39.940> is

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
right sides are together so this is

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.020 
right sides are together so this is
going<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:40.450> be<00:01:40.569> my<00:01:40.750> binding<00:01:41.490> you're<00:01:42.490> looking<00:01:42.850> at

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
going to be my binding you're looking at

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.109 
going to be my binding you're looking at
this<00:01:43.659> seam<00:01:44.380> right<00:01:44.649> here<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:45.429> would<00:01:45.610> be<00:01:45.670> the

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
this seam right here that would be the

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.570 
this seam right here that would be the
seam<00:01:46.690> that<00:01:46.720> would<00:01:47.050> be<00:01:47.170> right<00:01:47.350> in<00:01:47.560> here<00:01:47.590> so

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
seam that would be right in here so

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.980 
seam that would be right in here so
we're<00:01:48.729> gonna<00:01:48.819> sew<00:01:49.119> here<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.690> then<00:01:49.810> when<00:01:49.899> you

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
we're gonna sew here and then when you

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.200 
we're gonna sew here and then when you
open<00:01:50.020> that<00:01:50.440> up<00:01:50.500> that<00:01:51.159> will<00:01:51.310> be<00:01:51.429> that<00:01:51.580> seam<00:01:51.970> so

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
open that up that will be that seam so

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.660 
open that up that will be that seam so
you<00:01:52.270> put<00:01:52.450> your<00:01:52.600> right<00:01:52.720> sides<00:01:52.990> together<00:01:53.259> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
you put your right sides together and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.389 
you put your right sides together and
because<00:01:54.670> this<00:01:54.880> is<00:01:55.090> cut<00:01:55.330> on<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.569> bias<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:56.440> will

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.800 

stretch<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.429> little<00:02:00.729> bit<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:01.299> you'll<00:02:01.539> be<00:02:01.690> able

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
stretch a little bit and you'll be able

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.660 
stretch a little bit and you'll be able
to<00:02:02.080> get<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.530> around<00:02:03.959> this<00:02:04.959> curve<00:02:05.709> here<00:02:06.190> we're

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
to get that around this curve here we're

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.880 
to get that around this curve here we're
only<00:02:06.700> doing<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.300> quarter<00:02:07.629> inch<00:02:07.899> seam<00:02:08.020> so<00:02:08.709> I'm

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
only doing a quarter inch seam so I'm

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.650 
only doing a quarter inch seam so I'm
only<00:02:09.069> going<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.429> need<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.090> know<00:02:10.509> right

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
only going to need to so you know right

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.500 
only going to need to so you know right
close<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.410> edge<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:12.340> if<00:02:12.550> it's<00:02:12.760> bundled<00:02:13.209> up

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
close to that edge so if it's bundled up

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.630 
close to that edge so if it's bundled up
over<00:02:13.870> here<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.500> doesn't<00:02:14.890> really<00:02:15.010> matter<00:02:15.310> if

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
over here it doesn't really matter if

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.290 
over here it doesn't really matter if
you<00:02:16.239> foil<00:02:16.450> your<00:02:16.540> edges<00:02:16.900> together<00:02:18.300> this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
you foil your edges together this

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.070 
you foil your edges together this
machine<00:02:20.519> Souls<00:02:21.519> over<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.150> pins<00:02:22.450> really<00:02:22.870> nice

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
machine Souls over the pins really nice

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.809 
machine Souls over the pins really nice
I<00:02:23.440> my<00:02:23.980> machine<00:02:24.340> at<00:02:24.489> home<00:02:25.980> doesn't<00:02:26.980> as<00:02:27.129> much<00:02:27.459> so

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
I my machine at home doesn't as much so

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.729 
I my machine at home doesn't as much so
I<00:02:27.849> tend<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.480> pull<00:02:28.690> them<00:02:28.870> out<00:02:28.959> but<00:02:29.319> this<00:02:29.500> one

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
I tend to pull them out but this one

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.009 
I tend to pull them out but this one
I've<00:02:29.920> been<00:02:30.099> sewing<00:02:30.370> right<00:02:30.640> over<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.090> pins<00:02:31.420> as

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
I've been sewing right over the pins as

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.619 
I've been sewing right over the pins as
long<00:02:32.290> as<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.530> keep<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:33.550> heads<00:02:33.849> of<00:02:34.150> your<00:02:34.180> pins

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
long as you keep the heads of your pins

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.009 
long as you keep the heads of your pins
you<00:02:35.590> know<00:02:36.120> far<00:02:37.120> enough<00:02:37.330> out<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.870> where<00:02:37.989> the

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
you know far enough out to where the

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.220 
you know far enough out to where the
foot<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.769> sewing<00:02:38.980> machine<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.900> can<00:02:41.080> get

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
foot of the sewing machine you can get

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.699 
foot of the sewing machine you can get
through<00:02:41.470> there<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:43.629> works<00:02:43.750> pretty<00:02:44.050> well<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:44.349> it

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
through there it works pretty well so it

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.000 
through there it works pretty well so it
holds<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.069> in<00:02:45.190> place<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.989> more<00:02:47.170> pins<00:02:47.560> pin

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
holds it in place and the more pins pin

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.070 
holds it in place and the more pins pin
pin<00:02:48.220> pin<00:02:48.250> especially<00:02:49.000> on<00:02:49.090> these<00:02:49.239> curves<00:02:49.629> and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
pin pin especially on these curves and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.750 
pin pin especially on these curves and
then<00:02:50.920> you'll<00:02:51.159> end<00:02:51.340> up<00:02:51.580> with<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:51.879> nice<00:02:52.440> seam<00:02:53.760> this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
then you'll end up with a nice seam this

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.160 
then you'll end up with a nice seam this
is<00:02:54.909> a<00:02:54.940> nice<00:02:55.209> pattern<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.810> goes<00:02:55.959> together

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
is a nice pattern it goes together

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.300 
is a nice pattern it goes together
really<00:02:56.440> easily<00:02:57.129> I'm<00:02:57.400> not<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.670> big<00:02:59.310> curved

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
really easily I'm not a big curved

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.369 
really easily I'm not a big curved
binding<00:03:01.090> sword<00:03:01.569> but<00:03:01.750> I'll<00:03:01.870> tell<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.200> what

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
binding sword but I'll tell you what

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.000 
binding sword but I'll tell you what
this<00:03:02.590> has<00:03:02.769> actually<00:03:02.950> been<00:03:04.560> pretty<00:03:05.560> easy<00:03:05.650> I

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
this has actually been pretty easy I

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.690 
this has actually been pretty easy I
wouldn't<00:03:06.430> say<00:03:06.670> for<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:07.060> beginner<00:03:07.659> sore<00:03:08.610> but<00:03:09.610> if

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
wouldn't say for a beginner sore but if

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.300 
wouldn't say for a beginner sore but if
you've<00:03:09.879> ever<00:03:10.060> sewn<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.450> blouse<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.349> put<00:03:12.280> a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
you've ever sewn a blouse and put a

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.420 
you've ever sewn a blouse and put a
shoulder<00:03:12.730> into<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.450> blouse<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:14.709> is<00:03:14.950> way

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
shoulder into a blouse this is way

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.400 
shoulder into a blouse this is way
easier

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
easier

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.410 
easier
way<00:03:18.040> easier<00:03:18.070> because<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.880> course<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.240> blouse

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
way easier because of course the blouse

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.300 
way easier because of course the blouse
isn't<00:03:19.900> really<00:03:20.110> cut<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:20.890> much<00:03:21.040> on<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.460> bias<00:03:23.310> so

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
isn't really cut so much on that bias so

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.430 
isn't really cut so much on that bias so
you<00:03:24.370> really<00:03:24.790> have<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.000> work<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:26.020> in<00:03:26.230> there

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
you really have to work that in there

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.000 
you really have to work that in there
sometimes<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.900> this<00:03:29.080> is<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.290> lot<00:03:29.440> easier<00:03:29.470> than

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
sometimes so this is a lot easier than

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.300 
sometimes so this is a lot easier than
that<00:03:30.070> okay<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.570> got<00:03:31.930> am<00:03:32.830> I<00:03:32.950> gonna<00:03:33.100> have

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
got to the edge here so I'm a little

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.930 
got to the edge here so I'm a little
short<00:03:50.440> over<00:03:50.830> here<00:03:51.070> but<00:03:51.280> it'll<00:03:51.460> be<00:03:51.610> okay

we'll put the other piece on the other
side<00:04:12.460> I<00:04:12.850> would<00:04:13.150> pin<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.660> but<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:13.870> don't<00:04:13.990> have

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
side I would pin it but I don't have

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.099 
side I would pin it but I don't have
enough<00:04:14.500> pins<00:04:14.820> so<00:04:15.820> I<00:04:15.850> have<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.390> sew<00:04:16.630> one<00:04:16.870> and

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
then come back and pin it so I have this

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.750 
then come back and pin it so I have this
set<00:04:21.340> on<00:04:21.549> about<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.030> medium<00:04:22.660> this<00:04:23.110> this<00:04:23.760> machine

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
set on about a medium this this machine

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.120 
set on about a medium this this machine
goes<00:04:25.030> from<00:04:25.480> 0<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.930> 8<00:04:26.169> as<00:04:26.440> far<00:04:26.740> as<00:04:26.830> stitch
