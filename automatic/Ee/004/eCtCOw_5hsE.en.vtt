for the future matches and you'll just

for the future matches and you'll just
do<00:00:38.969> worse<00:00:39.180> Moore's<00:00:39.450> making<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.780> get<00:00:39.899> more<00:00:40.079> and

to you in as little as a month a year or
maybe<00:00:50.100> even<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.430> week<00:00:50.460> unless<00:00:51.270> you're<00:00:51.449> really

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
maybe even a week unless you're really

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.970 
maybe even a week unless you're really
fighting<00:00:51.870> something<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.379> matters<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> lot

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
fighting something that matters a lot

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.490

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
like zero at evil world champions then

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.840 
like zero at evil world champions then
you<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:55.829> don't<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.129> way<00:00:56.370> too<00:00:56.430> much<00:00:56.640> to

really<00:01:06.960> means<00:01:07.170> nothing<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.680> right<00:01:07.860> now

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
really means nothing to you right now

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.890 
really means nothing to you right now
after<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> month<00:01:08.790> why<00:01:09.150> should<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.420> trouble<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900

right<00:01:10.080> now<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.710> should<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.220> kind<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
right now you should really just kind of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.219 
right now you should really just kind of
try<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.030> remember<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.049> won't

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
try to remember that it really won't

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.480

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
to realize that really those matches

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.140 
to realize that really those matches
weren't<00:01:35.040> cheap<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.460> weren't<00:01:35.700> broken<00:01:35.880> they

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
you're trying to win you'll just get

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.009
