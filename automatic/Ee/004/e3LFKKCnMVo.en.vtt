00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:13.899
 web found in the kitchen of saffron yellow I am history 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:18.219
 today we will prepare together an all-Christmas cake with almond brittle 

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:21.220
 let's see the necessary ingredients together 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.659
 250 grams of sugar 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:25.730
 a teaspoon of lemon juice 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.830
 2 tablespoons of water and 300 grams of almonds 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.089
 let's see the preparation together 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.060
 the first thing to do to prepare myself crunchy and peel the almonds then 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.050
 prepare a casserole with water, let it boil, throw it in 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.050
 almonds and after a minute drain them 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.410
 almonds and then they will be scattered then on a plate that still 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.260
 hot peel them 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.700
 a with this movement will live very easy because precisely the almond 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
 having been abolished for very soft skin 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.939
 after you have peeled all the almonds put the apps. in a daughter 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.200
 with parchment paper and toast them in a warm oven at 180 degrees for some 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.649
 minute the almonds must not absolutely dark you must only 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.649
 you statistics dry up 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.610
 after toasting the almonds we pour in a rather large container with 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.610
 all rock the two tablespoons of water 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.950
 the lemon 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.640
 therefore we await 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.240
 let it all melt over low heat in the meantime 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.020
 we can take half of the almonds 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.009
 and chop coarsely 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.659
 take into account that you can use almonds to make almond brittle 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.170
 in thiene 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.370
 coarsely chopped or half pen as we will do in this 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.369
 recipe 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.330
 the almonds have been cut while the sugar melts you lined by 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.189
 small baking tray with parchment paper 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.630
 that you will need. to pour the crunchy inside 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.990
 then dally it with a spatula. of oil or with a fading lemon 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.839
 black all its aroma too 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:26.199
 stamp now that the sugar has turned blond we are in hell with almonds 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.819
 mix 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.439
 and we mix udine 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:34.699
 sugar 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.699
 with dried fruit 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.290
 now we can pour our crunchy into the critique 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.459
 be very careful because the crunchy course 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.799
 it has very high temperatures 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.799
 self 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:09.159
 now we free everything well 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.809
 the fact that it has the same 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:14.899
 the same thickness we say after which we will wait for it to cool 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.269
 when the brittle is still not completely cold 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.499
 you can cut it with a knife the shape is generally that of alosa 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:29.590
 let's go are are 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.529
 table 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:36.049
