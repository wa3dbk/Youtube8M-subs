 Hi everyone, guys, welcome to this 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.040
 new technews episode today 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.650
 we will talk about the wireless piracy or 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.270
 absent non hexus of the s4 and many 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.890
 nice little developers 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.570
 tyco game players did a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.830
 somewhat interesting experiment in 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.240
 practice the same day as 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.189
 official publication of their title 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.470
 have spread through a well-known portal of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.210
 torrent and the cracked version of the game 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.710
 the result is unbelievable indeed 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.570
 on the launch day of the title more than 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.719
 three thousand people used the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.879
 pirated version is only 214 have 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.770
 purchased an original copy of the game 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.239
 which is a simulative type of one 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.329
 small software house that needs to grow 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.100
 creating videogames use stratagem for 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.690
 make people understand the severity of pirating a 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.360
 title and how much this can affect 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.559
 on developers indeed in the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.480
 once created version of the game 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.070
 created our software house is 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
 started turning out titles too 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.730
 appreciated by critics and very valid 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.920
 we will begin to have a drastic drop 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.899
 in our profits due precisely 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.970
 of piracy that will lead to ours 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.860
 company to ironic failure 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.200
 green art games experiment 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.760
 which however reveals as sadly as the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.030
 world of pc games if hand to 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.030
 piracy 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.900
 after the nexus 4 maybe it will be the same 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.670
 elects to churn out the nexus 5 it is 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.890
 of rumors of the site corea tyne 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.600
 daly page the managing director of 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.990
 google is indeed visited in Korea 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.000
 south 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.110
 meeting with the vertices is of 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.210
 samsung and lg 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.220
 rumors report that they have 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.840
 talked about future industry trends 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.730
 and how to collaborate in the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.010
 realization of futuristic projects 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.590
 however, there was apparently space 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.880
 also to talk about the next nexus 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.430
 expand the industry partnership 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.840
 of TVs with solutions all and even though 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.820
 google plus 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.250
 lg became the third force in the market 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.250
 smartphone in the first quarter of 2013 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.900
 according to the data published by idc cultivates 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.180
 bigger dreams and wants to take advantage of the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.740
 positive moment and we hope this 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.869
 time the nexus will also arrive in Italy 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.940
 at an acceptable price is that stocks 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.660
 are not as poor as the launch of 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.660
 nexus 4 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.790
 the samsung galaxy s 4 in the version from 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.170
 16 gigabytes 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.710
 actually available to users 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.630
 only 8.8 gigabytes is not unusual 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.340
 available space is less than 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.680
 the one declared on the package is 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.150
 on smartphones that tablet in this case 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.160
 storage space equal to 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.900
 half of the declared unlike 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.940
 other smartphone models that offer 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.470
 12 gigabytes out of 16 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.660
 certainly much of the space comes 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.850
 occupied by the touch wiz suite and others 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.770
 programs preinstalled by the manufacturer e 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.360
 for many users 8 gigabytes of space e 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.890
 they could also be enough 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.410
 however a worsening situation 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.000
 especially in the android scene too 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.700
 if we must not forget that microsoft 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.590
 surface pro over 40 gigabytes has 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.270
 declared but in this case the system 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.430
 a full desktop system and allows us 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.630
 to store and install anywhere 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.340
 which is not possible in systems 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.750
 smartphone where the space of 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.220
 internal storage is much more 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.360
 important of what we end up with 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.190
 microsd 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.020
 the criticism therefore does not only go to samsung 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.850
 but gift diffuse radar room does not 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.830
 a little more transparency would be enough in the 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.120
 advertise and market 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.980
 products if I end user a 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.510
 available 8 gigabytes with the version 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.700
 of the phone to the version with that 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.230
 memory cut and there will also be 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.230
 hardware level but not usable 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.849
 the seventh version ds could have 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.920
 a minimalist imprint resemble the 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.110
 metro you lie is adopted by windows 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.849
 the mac site indeed reports that 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.010
 the interface looks very, very much 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.840
 flat and that every sign of schio moore 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.209
 phismo that is the idea of ​​design that yes 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.920
 based on the digital transposition of 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.170
 objects of real life has been 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.180
 completely set aside despite the 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.890
 drastic design the new version of 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.600
 ios will no longer be difficult to use 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.709
 compared to the past 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.989
 apparently the apple is working 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.060
 also to a restyling of the app 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.000
 notifications so you have information 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.500
 always accessible throughout the system 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.480
 therefore, the imprint of Gianni Hype is made 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.860
 feel with great importance in this 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.299
 different version 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.370
 all that remains is to wait for the worldwide 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.590
 this year's developer conference on 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.220
 which logo also had restyling in 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.220
 minimalist key 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.530
 eros creation of a wireless network 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.849
 24 access points are completed 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.159
 must be registered in the register 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.680
 installers that is enshrined in the decree 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.209
 legislative number 198 of 26 October 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.039
 2010 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.870
 under penalty of a pecuniary penalty 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.070
 that victory did you come across his 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.990
 despite the manager of a supermarket 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.759
 in sicily than for breaking 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.000
 the aforementioned decree received a fine 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.320
 of 30 thousand euros to be paid in 60 days 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.180
 after which the sanction will rise 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.340
 to the figure of 150 thousand euros 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.870
 the decree was widely criticized 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.250
 in recent years both by small operators 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.080
 than from the various associations of 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.210
 consumers also dino bortolotto 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.560
 president of assoprovider is bringing 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.720
 a battle for repeal goes on 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.310
 of this rule for which it existed 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.900
 already a bill but that was 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.240
 frozen due to the fall of the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.889
 government mounts to the poor manager al 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.900
 current status remains only to pay 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.710
 hopefully in the future things can 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.710
 change for the better 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.190
 i pm filmed the first atomic film 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.539
 of history where the protagonists 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.910
 the main actors are i 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.320
 microscopic atoms enlarged up to 100 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.250
 million times 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.889
 it is a short animation 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.990
 made frame by frame by moving the 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.000
 atoms with a sort of nanometer needle 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.710
 a precise technique is entirely new to 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.139
 move position with precision 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.389
 atoms that just gave birth to this 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.550
 video research behind these 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.870
 results with time will bring 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.729
 great progress in the 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.740
 Let's enjoy digital storage for now
