00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hi everyone, I'm Stefano these 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.509
 technicians n 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:12.530
 today I will talk about an important innovation 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:15.210
 of del polar m400 ie notifications 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.890
 voltage notifications have arrived on 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.730
 this sport smartwatch became a little 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 all therefore from the last update 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.980
 firmware you can receive notifications 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 on this watch notifications but in 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.140
 this time they are enabled only for 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.040
 as far as iphone and android are concerned 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.040
 still a bit to wait 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.309
 let's see what it is immediately 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.610
 how it works then once 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:01.219
 updated the polar in the i 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:03.559
 settings we will notice a difference that 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.960
 it's this one 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.680
 in the general settings we can 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.630
 go to manage notifications 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.299
 so we can activate the sounds here 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.830
 there is even a notice of non 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:24.020
 disturb then you can set one 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:27.289
 time slot for which the clock 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.759
 then do not emit at any sound or not 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.259
 will notify any notification in one 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.530
 time slot 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.530
 therefore we can activate or deactivate 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:51.920
 notifications can be managed or not 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.700
 preview with a preview then a 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.800
 once the notification is set as active 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:07.539
 all we have to do is go to the 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.539
 our iphone go on settings 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:18.410
 and on bluetooth select the polar m400 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.620
 little foresight that polar indicates to us 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:26.810
 to do is to go to the app 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.890
 polar flow exit our account e 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.440
 re-enter 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.930
 this probably because you are 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.819
 noticed that he evidently gave some 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.310
 I honestly didn't have a problem 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.569
 big problems however this is what 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:46.430
 ask to do after the update e 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:49.790
 let's see how this works now 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:55.430
 I sent an email should 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.540
 getting to test is not much to be able 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.040
 do then 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.040
 I can only view the text 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:09.400
 for 30 seconds then we need to 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.780
 understand what is happening 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.570
 so reading is very limited though 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.120
 it is very much I found it very much 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.420
 useful because when the phone in your pocket 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.140
 if I feel vibrate maybe I'm at work 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.870
 I feel the iPhone vibrate 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.840
 just look at our screen 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.060
 smartphone to understand what kind of 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.720
 notification arrived then notifications 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.720
 they are all whatsapp instagram for life 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.950
 twitter any application then 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.900
 any notification we do not receive from 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.370
 phone is enabled on the polar m400 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.730
 now I'll show you how 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.730
 calls work because they come 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.180
 also display received calls 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.290
 so I'm normally doing mine 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.660
 activity 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.660
 and at some point I know if it feels 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.129
 here is the sound of the clock 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.530
 rings and clearly together with 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.690
 phone I can answer then if 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.850
 I have an associated bluetooth headset 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.050
 I can directly reply from here 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.380
 put in silent mode 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.539
 the clock and serious I press again 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.090
 I can even refuse the call 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.190
 then hang up the phone 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:40.210
 hang up see you also give me the 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.210
 notification of missed call if me 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:50.180
 I'm going to press, even to me 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.699
 the phone call starts 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:58.580
 so i'm actually calling 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:05:04.099
 home on the phone has already left the 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:09.199
 call home so very very much 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:12.680
 really really useful I have it 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:17.300
 found again very comfortable convenient 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:21.500
 also as in the future 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.840
 it would seem that there will also be up 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.400
 android so the view is really 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:33.050
 really wide and thank you for having 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.530
 written about comments on the channel because of me 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:42.560
 They make much pleasure is important 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:47.449
 the interaction between you and you and you 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:52.570
 I wanted to answer directly to whom and to 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:58.639
 who asked me about the strap then 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:06:00.680
 gtd that just asks me soul dei 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.020
 problems with the strap is ruined 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:07.820
 easily by equipping him to become 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:13.039
 smooth but I have been using it for six months 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:17.050
 I hope you see it though I can't from here 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:26.360
 maybe to show it well 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:29.120
 the strap is quite let's say 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.819
 I didn't find it ruined here, maybe yes 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:38.470
 a little smoother a little smoother 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:41.870
 certainly but I don't think so 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:47.360
 very much ruined aesthetically 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:51.949
 however it remains acceptable let's say not 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.710
 I found a problem so here I hope 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:56.710
 to have been useful on with this with 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.199
 this video 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:02.750
 if you liked it put a like one 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.889
 if you want to comment on it if you have any 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.789
 question 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:08.840
 let him not know I'm stefano these 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:13.300
