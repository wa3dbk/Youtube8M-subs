00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.529
 very good to all people that such as 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.420
 we are here dan play commenting finally 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.680
 back here on the andrÃ©s platform 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.230
 how can they visualize 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.210
 this time I bring you this 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.850
 application that you can see here in the 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.700
 desk which is rec 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.010
 this application serves to record the 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.080
 Android screen and if I remember correctly 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.460
 it only serves for the version of 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:43.940
 android 4.4 onwards doing so a 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.100
 very good application since at least in 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.090
 my case most of the others 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.030
 applications failed me enough 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.570
 recorded on the cut screen and not 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.540
 they recorded and recorded many colors themselves 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.090
 but good in the description I'm going to 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.489
 leave the application here to download 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.740
 and as you can see is the premium version 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.290
 so to speak but leave it apk in the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.050
 description what difference does the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.570
 premium with which it is offered in the 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.850
 Play Station 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.250
 the difference is that there is no limit in the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.000
 duration more than an hour if badly 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.890
 I remember in the free that is offered in 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.729
 prehistory allows you to record only 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.880
 5 minutes and here it lets you record maximum 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.560
 a premium time you can record audio 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.630
 you can change the name before 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.659
 start recording the duration 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.090
 the speed you want it to be 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.490
 recorded the video be the fps is by way of 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.220
 say it while more beats there are more 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.070
 faster more fluid will be the recording and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.469
 here is the size to above as 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.040
 exceed the configuration to the menu that 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.050
 they have nothing carbon 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.830
 so nothing here I leave this 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.760
 application the reik application for 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.520
 see if it served them and nothing left them not without 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.520
 before giving a short explanation of 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.700
 new device with which I count the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.590
 They are wanting to listen and hereinafter 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.660
 can leave the video and those who do not 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.980
 thanks for watching the video for the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.459
 download and see you for the next 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.849
 ok the explanation of what happened to the 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.180
 channel how could they see an absence 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.290
 tremendously big 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.830
 in which 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.380
 could not 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.770
 record since I did not have a 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.470
 Android device more than a samsung 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:46.250
 galaxy 6 that as connoisseurs will know 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.530
 of the brands is a very low cell 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.110
 range without internal memory ram memory 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.670
 barely android 2.3 is practically 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.590
 impossible since I did not have space to 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.080
 applications and others could be 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.360
 partition of sd and others to enlarge the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.760
 internal memory to bring the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.490
 external memory be treated as the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.920
 internal and so on but it was not the same 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.750
 I think the recordings were to be from 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.000
 the same quality as it can be in this 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.690
 device with this new device 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.690
 with the count 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.330
 I was uploading videos of 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.160
 computer programs and others but 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.900
 well I do not have much importance 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.030
 because if it was not it was not what it was 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.190
 focused this channel so to see in 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.040
 forward people are going to have videos by 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.020
 end returned from what would be the 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.970
 Android device and its applications 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.150
 in a completely free way for 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.160
 you so you already know in the 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.470
 comments 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.470
 leave your opinion of this application if 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.080
 it works or not and what applications 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.570
 they want because I've stayed a little 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.380
 absent in the world of the sectors of 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.810
 modern applications 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.580
 so it would also be helpful for 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.960
 you and for me I will get you the 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.660
 application that you want while 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.120
 I go knowing the new what is 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.960
 need because there are people then here 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.060
 I'll stop the recording see you 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.550
 the next video that is the safest 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.860
 It is very very early and before 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.170
 end with the video and tell them that 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.480
 I have the device that zte blade 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.730
 l 2 that the truth in opinion is very 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.530
 good talking about equal price-quality 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.660
 If you want me to speak after this 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.120
 specific device in some other 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.760
 video can comment on it and I'll talk about it 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.580
 without trying it without any problem 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.560
 so again I thank you for 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.930
