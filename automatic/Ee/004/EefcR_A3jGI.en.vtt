gonna be a really great color color for
summer<00:01:54.930> again<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.920> orange<00:01:56.219> e

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
summer again because it's that orange e

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.999 
summer again because it's that orange e
very<00:01:57.210> bright<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.840> summery<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.380> let's<00:01:58.680> just

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
very bright and summery so let's just

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.789 
very bright and summery so let's just
get<00:01:59.250> cracking<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.990> think<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:01.680> we'll

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
get cracking I think I think what we'll

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.510 
get cracking I think I think what we'll
do<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.280> start<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.479> ready<00:02:04.020> end<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.070> use

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
do is start with the ready end and use

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.819 
do is start with the ready end and use
that<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.909> kind<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.270> base<00:02:06.479> slush<00:02:07.049> out<00:02:07.439> or

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
that as kind of a base slush out or

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.490 
that as kind of a base slush out or
whatever<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.360> think<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.780> appeal<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.170> these

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
whatever and I think the appeal of these

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.729 
whatever and I think the appeal of these
that<00:02:10.860> they<00:02:11.069> are<00:02:11.220> they're<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:11.760> only

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
that they are they're not only

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.470 
that they are they're not only
kind<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.430> there<00:02:13.609> to<00:02:13.640> give<00:02:13.849> you<00:02:13.939> that<00:02:14.090> gradient

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
kind of there to give you that gradient

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.729 
kind of there to give you that gradient
effect<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.840> there<00:02:14.959> are<00:02:15.049> two<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.409> one<00:02:15.560> as

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
effect that there are two and one as

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.440 
effect that there are two and one as
well<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.430> have<00:02:16.489> just<00:02:16.969> an<00:02:17.090> orange<00:02:17.329> e

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
well so you can have just an orange e

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.229 
well so you can have just an orange e
red<00:02:17.629> lip<00:02:17.810> or<00:02:17.989> just<00:02:18.349> a<00:02:18.530> gold<00:02:18.829> kind<00:02:19.549> of<00:02:19.760> lip<00:02:19.969> so

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
red lip or just a gold kind of lip so

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.880 
red lip or just a gold kind of lip so
we'll<00:02:20.870> see<00:02:21.109> how<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.379> goes

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
we'll see how this goes

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.770 
we'll see how this goes
so<00:02:22.129> here<00:02:22.370> we<00:02:22.459> go<00:02:27.069> that<00:02:28.069> glitter<00:02:28.629> if<00:02:29.629> there's

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
so here we go that glitter if there's

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.550 
so here we go that glitter if there's
glitter<00:02:30.109> like<00:02:30.379> full-on<00:02:31.010> glitter<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:34.269> Hey

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
glitter like full-on glitter in this Hey

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.760 
glitter like full-on glitter in this Hey
so<00:02:37.370> it's<00:02:37.550> it's<00:02:37.819> smooth<00:02:38.180> when<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:39.470> know<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.650> has

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
so it's it's smooth when you know it has

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.809 
so it's it's smooth when you know it has
some<00:02:39.980> slip<00:02:40.250> when<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.490> rub<00:02:40.610> your<00:02:40.640> lips

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
some slip when you rub your lips

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.370 
some slip when you rub your lips
together<00:02:41.030> but<00:02:41.390> it's<00:02:41.510> definitely<00:02:41.630> not<00:02:41.959> smooth

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
together but it's definitely not smooth

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.070 
together but it's definitely not smooth
going<00:02:42.830> on<00:02:43.040> there's<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:44.000> little<00:02:44.270> bit<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.540> pull<00:02:44.780> it

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
going on there's a little bit of pull it

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.960 
going on there's a little bit of pull it
doesn't<00:02:45.440> look<00:02:45.709> super<00:02:45.950> hydrating<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.850> know

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.979 
it's not super flattering to those
although<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.000> doesn't<00:02:53.180> make<00:02:53.360> them<00:02:53.450> look<00:02:53.660> super

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
although it doesn't make them look super

although it doesn't make them look super
dry<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.290> cakey<00:02:54.410> there<00:02:54.980> are<00:02:55.100> some<00:02:55.280> definite

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
dry and cakey there are some definite

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
glittery nests all up in here so that's

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.410 
glittery nests all up in here so that's
something<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.220> be<00:03:01.340> aware<00:03:01.430> which<00:03:01.819> means<00:03:02.090> that

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
something to be aware which means that

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.840 
something to be aware which means that
you<00:03:02.900> have<00:03:03.110> what<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.069> thought<00:03:04.340> was<00:03:04.489> kind<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.730> a

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
you have what I thought was kind of a

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.750 
you have what I thought was kind of a
cream<00:03:05.780> or<00:03:05.810> matte<00:03:06.170> thing<00:03:06.770> on<00:03:06.980> this<00:03:07.160> side<00:03:07.400> but

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
cream or matte thing on this side but

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.740 
cream or matte thing on this side but
you<00:03:07.819> actually<00:03:08.000> have<00:03:08.209> two<00:03:08.330> sides<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:08.630> are

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
you actually have two sides that are

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.630 
you actually have two sides that are
shimmer<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:09.260> if<00:03:09.320> you<00:03:09.440> don't<00:03:09.650> like<00:03:10.100> shimmer<00:03:10.400> you

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
shimmer so if you don't like shimmer you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.550 
shimmer so if you don't like shimmer you
might<00:03:10.790> not<00:03:10.940> like<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.150> see<00:03:12.019> hopefully<00:03:12.260> this

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
might not like that see hopefully this

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.320 
might not like that see hopefully this
is<00:03:12.680> pigmented<00:03:13.130> enough<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.459> kind<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.760> show<00:03:14.150> up

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
is pigmented enough to kind of show up

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:25.330 
is pigmented enough to kind of show up
and<00:03:14.540> show<00:03:15.110> a<00:03:15.140> difference<00:03:23.950> first<00:03:24.950> of<00:03:25.100> all<00:03:25.190> it's

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
and show a difference first of all it's

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.670 
and show a difference first of all it's
a<00:03:25.430> lot<00:03:25.640> smoother<00:03:26.030> than<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.450> red<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.230> it's<00:03:27.440> not

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
a lot smoother than the red and it's not

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.520 
a lot smoother than the red and it's not
nearly<00:03:27.980> as<00:03:28.100> grainy<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:29.660> also<00:03:30.110> wouldn't<00:03:30.380> say

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
nearly as grainy I also wouldn't say

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.140 
nearly as grainy I also wouldn't say
it's<00:03:30.650> as<00:03:30.739> pigmented<00:03:31.190> but<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.430> does<00:03:31.640> give<00:03:31.940> like

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
it's as pigmented but it does give like

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.750 
it's as pigmented but it does give like
a<00:03:32.180> really<00:03:32.720> is<00:03:33.350> definitely<00:03:33.890> gold<00:03:34.069> I<00:03:34.340> mean<00:03:34.580> an

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
a really is definitely gold I mean an

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.059 
a really is definitely gold I mean an
and<00:03:35.060> despite<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:36.019> thought<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.560> would<00:03:36.739> be<00:03:36.800> far

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
and despite I thought this would be far

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.830 
and despite I thought this would be far
more<00:03:37.100> shimmery<00:03:37.640> but<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.120> think<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.450> comes<00:03:38.660> off

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
more shimmery but I think it comes off

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.460 
more shimmery but I think it comes off
as<00:03:39.019> more<00:03:39.230> of<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.530> metallic<00:03:40.150> sort<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.470> finish

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
as more of a metallic sort of finish

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.680 
as more of a metallic sort of finish
very<00:03:43.070> interesting<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.150> not<00:03:44.299> because<00:03:44.540> they<00:03:44.630> do

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
very interesting so not because they do

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.060 
very interesting so not because they do

puts a lot of wear on your lipstick and
I<00:04:12.560> have<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.829> say<00:04:13.010> I'm<00:04:13.269> pretty<00:04:14.269> I'm<00:04:14.450> kind<00:04:14.720> of

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
I have to say I'm pretty I'm kind of

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.360 
I have to say I'm pretty I'm kind of
impressed<00:04:14.930> with<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.739> amount<00:04:16.190> that<00:04:16.220> has

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
impressed with the amount that has

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.830 
impressed with the amount that has
stayed<00:04:16.609> on<00:04:16.760> especially<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.359> gold<00:04:17.570> color

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
stayed on especially the gold color

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.810 
stayed on especially the gold color
because<00:04:18.140> it<00:04:18.260> was<00:04:18.380> so<00:04:18.500> sheer<00:04:18.859> I<00:04:19.100> expected<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:19.789> to

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
because it was so sheer I expected it to

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.340 
because it was so sheer I expected it to
be<00:04:19.970> virtually<00:04:20.269> non-existent<00:04:20.479> especially

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
be virtually non-existent especially

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.409 
be virtually non-existent especially
since<00:04:21.560> that's<00:04:21.739> right<00:04:21.979> where<00:04:22.160> your<00:04:22.310> drinks<00:04:23.240> or

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
since that's right where your drinks or

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.750 
since that's right where your drinks or
whatever<00:04:23.660> kind<00:04:24.380> of<00:04:24.500> go<00:04:24.710> has<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:24.979> lot<00:04:25.190> of<00:04:25.220> traffic

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
whatever kind of go has a lot of traffic

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.580 
whatever kind of go has a lot of traffic
right<00:04:26.000> in<00:04:26.240> that<00:04:26.330> area<00:04:26.630> of<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.870> lips<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.229> it's

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
right in that area of the lips and it's

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.380 
right in that area of the lips and it's
still<00:04:27.830> it's<00:04:28.310> still<00:04:28.490> pretty<00:04:28.820> much<00:04:29.030> there<00:04:29.240> for

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
lip colors in one product but in terms

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.469 
lip colors in one product but in terms
of<00:05:31.710> quality

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
of quality

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.330 
of quality
they<00:05:33.750> stayed<00:05:34.050> obviously<00:05:34.919> I<00:05:34.949> guess<00:05:35.190> it<00:05:35.310> just

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
they stayed obviously I guess it just

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.700 
they stayed obviously I guess it just
comes<00:05:35.639> down<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:36.120> if<00:05:36.539> you're<00:05:37.080> a<00:05:37.139> big<00:05:37.349> texture

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
comes down to if you're a big texture

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.879 
comes down to if you're a big texture
person<00:05:37.889> and<00:05:38.419> whether<00:05:39.419> or<00:05:39.630> not<00:05:39.750> you<00:05:39.990> care<00:05:40.530> so

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
person and whether or not you care so

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.570 
person and whether or not you care so
much<00:05:40.949> for<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.750> shimmer<00:05:42.830> glitter<00:05:43.830> stuff

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
much for the shimmer glitter stuff

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.309 
much for the shimmer glitter stuff
that's<00:05:44.940> in<00:05:45.120> this<00:05:45.300> so<00:05:45.539> the<00:05:45.990> other<00:05:46.110> thing<00:05:46.289> you

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
that's in this so the other thing you

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:47.689 
that's in this so the other thing you
have<00:05:46.470> to<00:05:46.530> think<00:05:46.710> about<00:05:46.800> is<00:05:47.159> whether<00:05:47.490> you're

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
have to think about is whether you're

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.390 
have to think about is whether you're
going<00:05:47.970> to<00:05:48.120> wear<00:05:48.470> kind<00:05:49.470> of<00:05:49.620> the<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:50.039> shimmery

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
going to wear kind of the the shimmery

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.120 
going to wear kind of the the shimmery
or<00:05:50.550> off<00:05:50.669> shade<00:05:51.000> by<00:05:51.180> itself<00:05:51.569> because<00:05:51.840> then<00:05:52.590> you

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
or off shade by itself because then you

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.379 
or off shade by itself because then you
really<00:05:53.310> are<00:05:53.430> just<00:05:53.759> buying<00:05:54.000> it<00:05:54.180> for<00:05:54.330> the

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
really are just buying it for the

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.270 
really are just buying it for the
ability<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:54.810> layer<00:05:55.289> both<00:05:55.530> at<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:55.740> same<00:05:55.979> time

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
ability to layer both at the same time

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.219 
ability to layer both at the same time
as<00:05:56.550> opposed<00:05:57.120> to<00:05:57.240> having<00:05:57.389> this<00:05:57.599> three-in-one

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
as opposed to having this three-in-one

00:05:58.229 --> 00:05:59.960 
as opposed to having this three-in-one
kind<00:05:58.470> of<00:05:58.560> thing<00:05:58.770> where<00:05:58.979> you<00:05:59.009> can<00:05:59.190> wear<00:05:59.370> one

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
kind of thing where you can wear one

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.820 
kind of thing where you can wear one
color<00:06:00.270> individually<00:06:00.990> or<00:06:01.199> blend<00:06:01.560> them<00:06:01.620> both

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
color individually or blend them both

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.790 
color individually or blend them both
together<00:06:02.039> in<00:06:02.400> a<00:06:02.490> unique<00:06:02.820> combination<00:06:03.180> because

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
together in a unique combination because

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.930 
together in a unique combination because
truthfully<00:06:04.800> I<00:06:04.830> would<00:06:05.159> never<00:06:05.340> wear<00:06:05.520> this<00:06:05.580> gold

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
truthfully I would never wear this gold

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.029 
truthfully I would never wear this gold
shade<00:06:06.120> by<00:06:06.300> itself<00:06:06.659> more<00:06:07.469> often<00:06:07.740> than<00:06:07.889> not<00:06:07.919> I

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
shade by itself more often than not I

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.760 
shade by itself more often than not I
would<00:06:08.190> wear<00:06:08.460> this<00:06:08.669> red<00:06:08.940> shade<00:06:09.270> so<00:06:09.680> you<00:06:10.680> know

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
would wear this red shade so you know

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.860 
would wear this red shade so you know
you<00:06:10.860> pay<00:06:11.280> what<00:06:11.430> you<00:06:11.460> pay<00:06:11.580> but<00:06:11.820> then<00:06:12.270> if<00:06:12.659> you

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
you pay what you pay but then if you

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.629 
you pay what you pay but then if you
don't<00:06:13.110> use<00:06:13.380> all<00:06:13.770> of<00:06:13.919> one<00:06:14.039> color<00:06:14.070> then<00:06:14.550> you're

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
don't use all of one color then you're

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.709 
don't use all of one color then you're
not<00:06:14.729> getting<00:06:15.000> all<00:06:15.180> of<00:06:15.330> your<00:06:15.449> money's<00:06:15.659> worth

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
not getting all of your money's worth

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.450 
not getting all of your money's worth
and<00:06:16.080> so<00:06:16.259> you<00:06:16.680> just<00:06:16.800> kind<00:06:16.979> of<00:06:17.070> have<00:06:17.219> to<00:06:17.340> weigh

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
and so you just kind of have to weigh

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.219 
and so you just kind of have to weigh
that<00:06:17.490> whether<00:06:17.909> it's<00:06:18.060> more<00:06:18.210> beneficial<00:06:18.599> to<00:06:18.719> you
