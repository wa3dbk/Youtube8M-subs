00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
information one of the first mistakes I

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.940 
information one of the first mistakes I
always<00:02:17.090> deal<00:02:17.300> with<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.170> bale<00:02:18.320> flips<00:02:18.680> are

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
always deal with is the bale flips are

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.850 
always deal with is the bale flips are
are<00:02:19.280> almost<00:02:19.670> always<00:02:19.910> like<00:02:20.150> this<00:02:20.680> because<00:02:21.680> they

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
are almost always like this because they

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.460 
are almost always like this because they
do<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.760> way<00:02:22.940> when<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.450> dance<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.990> the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
do it that way when you dance and the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.110 
do it that way when you dance and the
problem<00:02:24.740> with<00:02:24.830> photography<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.730> digital

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
problem with photography is digital

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.630 
problem with photography is digital
camera<00:02:26.480> can<00:02:26.510> see<00:02:26.750> every<00:02:26.990> little<00:02:27.200> nose<00:02:27.350> here<00:02:27.640> so

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
camera can see every little nose here so

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.060 
camera can see every little nose here so
so<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.240> tend<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.540> not<00:02:29.690> want<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:30.050> do<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.350> you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
so you tend to not want to do that you

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.890 
so you tend to not want to do that you
intend<00:02:31.430> instead<00:02:31.910> want<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.240> have<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> powerful

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
intend instead want to have a powerful

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.170 
intend instead want to have a powerful
woman<00:02:33.050> view<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:34.010> know<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.130> face<00:02:34.490> that<00:02:34.760> says<00:02:35.000> I

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
woman view you know a face that says I

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.480 
woman view you know a face that says I
am<00:02:35.270> in<00:02:35.540> charge<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.740> so<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:36.980> actually<00:02:37.130> look

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
am in charge and so you actually look

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.970 
am in charge and so you actually look
down<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:38.060> little<00:02:38.300> bit<00:02:38.450> with<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.500> veil<00:02:39.650> flipped

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
down a little bit with the veil flipped

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.949 
down a little bit with the veil flipped
up<00:02:40.130> or<00:02:40.640> at<00:02:40.760> least<00:02:40.790> not<00:02:41.060> as<00:02:41.180> far<00:02:41.209> back<00:02:41.570> as<00:02:41.630> that

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
up or at least not as far back as that

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.990 
up or at least not as far back as that
and<00:02:42.740> so<00:02:42.830> that's<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.130> very<00:02:43.160> common<00:02:43.640> first

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
and so that's a very common first

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.960 
and so that's a very common first
mistake<00:02:44.390> but<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.440> lot<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.830> a<00:02:46.160> lot<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.730> other

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
mistake but a lot of a lot of other

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.310 
mistake but a lot of a lot of other
things<00:02:47.270> that<00:02:47.360> are<00:02:47.480> like<00:02:47.570> that<00:02:47.930> are<00:02:48.020> mostly

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
things that are like that are mostly

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.230 
things that are like that are mostly
about<00:02:48.500> posture<00:02:49.160> they're<00:02:49.760> mostly<00:02:50.000> about

about posture they're mostly about

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.000 
about posture they're mostly about
