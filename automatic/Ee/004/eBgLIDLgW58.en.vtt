00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
supermarket the key with this is working

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.670 
supermarket the key with this is working
with<00:00:52.159> it<00:00:52.309> fast<00:00:52.610> because<00:00:53.449> it<00:00:53.750> will<00:00:53.899> dry<00:00:54.199> out<00:00:54.229> and

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
with it fast because it will dry out and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.459 
with it fast because it will dry out and
all<00:00:55.399> you<00:00:55.519> need<00:00:55.670> is<00:00:55.699> three<00:00:56.120> sheets<00:00:56.510> use<00:00:57.440> a

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
all you need is three sheets use a

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.250 
all you need is three sheets use a
little<00:00:57.769> Pam<00:00:58.219> coating<00:00:58.670> just<00:00:58.909> to<00:00:59.449> coat<00:00:59.809> each<00:01:00.079> of

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
little Pam coating just to coat each of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.959 
little Pam coating just to coat each of
the<00:01:00.379> sheets<00:01:00.620> keeps<00:01:01.309> them<00:01:01.519> from<00:01:01.670> sticking

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
the sheets keeps them from sticking

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.610 
the sheets keeps them from sticking
together<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.510> also<00:01:02.659> makes<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.110> nice<00:01:03.289> flaky

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
together and also makes a nice flaky

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.100 
together and also makes a nice flaky
layer<00:01:03.979> on<00:01:04.699> each<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.210> sheets<00:01:05.479> I'm<00:01:05.840> going<00:01:06.049> to

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
layer on each of the sheets I'm going to

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.160 
layer on each of the sheets I'm going to
spread<00:01:06.289> a<00:01:06.350> little<00:01:06.590> bit<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:06.799> cinnamon<00:01:07.039> sugar<00:01:08.170> so

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
spread a little bit of cinnamon sugar so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.749 
spread a little bit of cinnamon sugar so
once<00:01:09.380> I<00:01:09.470> had<00:01:09.649> the<00:01:09.830> three<00:01:10.250> sheets<00:01:10.490> layered

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
once I had the three sheets layered

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.410 
once I had the three sheets layered
together<00:01:11.110> I'm<00:01:12.110> going<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.320> cut<00:01:12.500> this<00:01:12.679> into<00:01:13.420> six

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
together I'm going to cut this into six

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.109 
together I'm going to cut this into six
equal<00:01:14.710> squares<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:18.550> then<00:01:19.550> this<00:01:19.700> is<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:19.880> great

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
equal squares and then this is a great

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.809 
equal squares and then this is a great
technique<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:22.369> use<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.569> muffin<00:01:23.569> tin<00:01:23.780> and

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
technique is to use a muffin tin and

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:27.460 
technique is to use a muffin tin and
actually<00:01:25.819> using<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.149> reverse<00:01:26.899> side<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.229> it

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
actually using the reverse side of it

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.340 
actually using the reverse side of it
the<00:01:27.590> back<00:01:27.770> side<00:01:28.509> actually<00:01:29.509> works<00:01:29.990> very<00:01:30.259> well

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
the back side actually works very well

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.840 
the back side actually works very well
in<00:01:30.860> making<00:01:31.069> these<00:01:31.960> phyllo<00:01:32.960> cups<00:01:33.640> because<00:01:34.640> they

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
in making these phyllo cups because they

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.800 
in making these phyllo cups because they
mold<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:35.720> form<00:01:36.970> right<00:01:37.970> on<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.360> bottom<00:01:38.690> of

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
mold and form right on to the bottom of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.609 
mold and form right on to the bottom of
this<00:01:38.899> muffin<00:01:39.379> tin<00:01:39.849> so<00:01:40.849> that<00:01:41.030> when<00:01:41.149> they<00:01:41.300> bake

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
this muffin tin so that when they bake

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.740 
this muffin tin so that when they bake
they'll<00:01:42.619> come<00:01:42.800> out<00:01:42.830> as<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.250> little<00:01:44.030> pastry<00:01:44.509> cup

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
they'll come out as a little pastry cup

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.529 
they'll come out as a little pastry cup
this<00:01:45.590> will<00:01:45.770> go<00:01:45.860> into<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.099> 350<00:01:46.789> degree<00:01:46.819> oven<00:01:47.119> for

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
this will go into a 350 degree oven for

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.150 
this will go into a 350 degree oven for
about<00:01:47.989> 10<00:01:48.259> minutes<00:01:48.289> to<00:01:49.099> their<00:01:49.220> light<00:01:49.399> brown

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
about 10 minutes to their light brown

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.350 
about 10 minutes to their light brown
and<00:01:52.479> after<00:01:53.479> about<00:01:53.690> 15<00:01:54.319> minutes<00:01:54.349> of<00:01:54.679> cooking

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
and after about 15 minutes of cooking

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.630 
and after about 15 minutes of cooking
these<00:01:56.360> phyllo<00:01:56.840> cups<00:01:57.080> come<00:01:58.009> right<00:01:58.280> off<00:01:58.429> to<00:01:58.580> the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
these phyllo cups come right off to the
