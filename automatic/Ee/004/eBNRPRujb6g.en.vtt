00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.240
 hi girls, how are you? 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.740
 super good the truth that I'm super 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.990
 happy because today I'm going to record a 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.090
 video and how not to be happy when 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.430
 recorded videos and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.010
 to make the braid of 4 ends that is what 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.660
 the world's easiest the truth that seems 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.449
 so elaborate that when I saw it I 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.039
 I scared but then I saw and practiced and in 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.079
 I do not really take much practice 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.509
 because it 's very easy I can assure you that you 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.640
 you can do it by watching the video you can 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.570
 do it if you want and you only need 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.790
 a comb and you need a league and that's 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.530
 everything like that is easy so if you want 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.180
 learn to do keep watching this video 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.980
 I'm going to do it for the side 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.890
 left when having all the hair at 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.360
 side that you want to do or you can 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.770
 pull it back but behind it is more 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.890
 difficult so if it's just 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.780
 starting better to do it for a side 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.480
 and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.850
 divide it into four equal parts to 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.520
 have the same parts 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.940
 let's call this part of number one 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.440
 number two number 3 and number 4 what 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.330
 you should do if it is just 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.940
 starting is to put yourself as league and 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.810
 you are in the four parts so that you do not 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.240
 come together and what we are going to do is 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.740
 take part number 1 and cross it 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.229
 above part number 2 and now 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.900
 let's cross part number 1 by 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.900
 below part number 3 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.960
 and now we are going to cross part number 1 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.540
 above in part number 4 then 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.730
 it's practically like a fabric that 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.390
 we are doing with hair but it is 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.820
 very simple and that is all the truth not 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.610
 it is no other step that we have to give 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.400
 just repeat it now let's call 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.780
 again this part number 1 we're going to 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.300
 cross it over part number 2 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.790
 under Part No. 3 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.790
 and above part number 4 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.660
 now 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 let's keep doing that then 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.640
 let's call back part number 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.569
 1 we cross over the part 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.520
 number 2 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:30.069
 below part number 3 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.829
 and above part number 4 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.709
 let's go pulling so we do not get 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.709
 disarm and now we go back 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.060
 above 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.060
 under 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.470
 and above 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.810
 let's keep doing that until we get 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.810
 until the end 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.330
 two 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
 Y 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.140
 above 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.860
 below and above 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.870
 and I know I 'm running out of hair 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.600
 over 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.620
 under 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.620
 and above 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.660
 the last one I think because there it was it looks 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.270
 very beautiful and it's super easy and now 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.670
 let's use our league and only the 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.280
 we tie there so that it is noticed that it is 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.110
 a different braid than normal 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.380
 only what I do is grab and pull 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.459
 in the corners and there goes more out the 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.459
 braid shape
