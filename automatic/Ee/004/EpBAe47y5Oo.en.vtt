00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi to all the guys and here we are 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.150
 finally in this brand new video 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.890
 we are here i don't even remember anymore a 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.440
 which part we arrived to recover 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.960
 these cursed 50 pieces of the spaceship 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.049
 then today you will even see it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.750
 events in a single video so you have to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.980
 see as many as twenty pieces today we will see well 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.800
 20 lines of the spaceship then the first one 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.859
 you find that you have to go into this 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.260
 place in this building climb over 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.770
 this moretto climb the stairs and above 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.760
 let's say at the top terrace in a 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.070
 corner find the 26th piece for the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.070
 twenty-seventh you have to break through with 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.829
 Malice on the wall of this villa of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.660
 this home parks of yours 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.960
 vehicle if you came with a vehicle 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.440
 sit walking in this garage pass 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.350
 here then on the left is the piece that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.660
 interested in the spaceship is nearby 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.949
 to this telescope 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.770
 then the twenty-eighth the twenty-eighth 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.640
 you have to go here in this bay 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.080
 take a marine vehicle like a motorcycle 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.310
 water a boat because you have to enter 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.670
 in this cave go down to dive 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.040
 dive in and recover the other one 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.049
 piece 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.430
 then instead the twenty-ninth the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.820
 twenty-ninth is exactly where 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.810
 here in the midst of all these rocks will be 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.479
 thrown in the middle here 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.090
 near this rock here so much though 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.009
 follow the exact position there 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.280
 I show on the map you find them with 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.110
 the maximum ease the next one instead 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.909
 should be should be the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.740
 Thirtieth is found here near that 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.720
 ladies and a half to these olive trees 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.200
 they should be olive trees in the olive field 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.420
 novoli v what you know about lula should 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.909
 being okay we do n't care what they are 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.679
 with trees the next is yes 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.990
 located here near the highway there is 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.600
 that path that leads to this 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.729
 stream you dive is found 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.670
 yet another piece I don't even see anymore 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.739
 what number we got this other one 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.860
 here next to this house that the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.190
 American flag on the back of the house 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.319
 exceeded there will be people sitting 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.700
 who are admiring this other verse 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.480
 which is the 32nd should be let's go 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.790
 still ahead 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.019
 head to this house 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.060
 abandoned you will find the 33rd piece 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.420
 should be let's check 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.540
 together 33rd and even fail to law 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.910
 it should be the 33rd then 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.430
 we must go to the desert we must 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.380
 always head here in these 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.989
 housing near these homes 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.079
 under this boat there will be the 34th 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.590
 the thirty-fifth piece instead 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:03.310
 we have to go precisely near here 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.799
 to these parables these antennas must 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.489
 get on the first one exactly the first one 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:12.250
 in order the first step of the 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.100
 Do not climb stairs on this side mandate 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.180
 on the right and you will find them there 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.680
 leaning on the ground 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.079
 so I recommend not to climb up into 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.100
 top you always have to stay say on 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:28.150
 foreground the 36th instead we have to 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.980
 go precisely here and is 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.410
 very simple they would take towards those 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.380
 before this wooden gallery below 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.829
 try this gallery there is ours 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.800
 dear collector's item 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:45.060
 mammamia thirty-seventh 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.530
 yes thirty-seventh here by the river 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.880
 this is also very simple 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.010
 middle of the rocks 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.120
 so I recommend you always follow the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.190
 location of the map the next the 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.340
 Thirty-eighth we must go here in 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.560
 half in the middle of the desert this too 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.150
 very simple on this rock that 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.110
 sees net by force and a rock the 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.020
 big climbs and retrieve it on 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.790
 next here is this here 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.530
 it's a little more difficult you need 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.340
 a helicopter to identify the 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.430
 location where you need to see that area 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.780
 where there are three rises for what reason 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.030
 because you had to land 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.550
 the helicopter here and then get off at 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.170
 Next Level 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.700
 here it is also done this let's say 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.710
 perhaps a little difficult to find the 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.470
 exact location but is as simple as 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.270
 you saw the next one in the video 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.070
 find this one here instead 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.640
 all colored mountain painted all over 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.800
 really nice climb and up to the top e 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.950
 where are these guys apa gymnastics and 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.100
 takes of the fortieth piece instead for 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.800
 the forty-first had to go to this one 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.800
 sort of small port to go precisely 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:05.110
 in the center and dive to recover 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:08.110
 yet another piece of spaceship the 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.690
 next neighbor is located below 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.150
 to this bridge where one is made 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.240
 main mission should be done if it is 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.880
 will remember the place you have to go near 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.410
 to dive into that trunk and go 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.400
 on the other side of the shore to 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:27.580
 recover this piece next 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.640
 it is still here on the other side 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.890
 them all to the right of the map in 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.410
 this area that if not a marina 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.960
 under this real wood shack 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.630
 this boat is the umpteenth 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.730
 the 43rd piece to be exact 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.290
 44th most difficult 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.000
 according to me the most difficult you need 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.700
 of the helicopter and must make a maneuver 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.430
 crazy to enter here in the middle that is 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.930
 park there in the middle to recover 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.470
 the piece you find 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.080
 coli on the bridge's pylon and the last one 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.250
 Today's 45th piece is found here in 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.479
 middle of the farm 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.490
 so I remember that there was a nice me 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.169
 like a comment and I'll see you at 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.360
 next video to see the latest 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.820
 five pieces and the special object there 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.060
 they will then deliver to the next video 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.060
 Hello
