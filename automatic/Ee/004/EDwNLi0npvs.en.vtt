00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:08.060
 hi guys today we see a game that 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.500
 I am taken in America honestly not 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.330
 I saw there are here in Italy but when 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.360
 I saw it, I really fell in love with it 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.010
 is the stop rocket or one 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.410
 pair of missiles you can play together 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.300
 that work just under pressure 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.279
 so we go hedone shots here it is 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.769
 pawn sheet crushed over here 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.289
 and the missiles start up high arrive 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.029
 up to 200 feet tell them 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.980
 we absolutely do the text of the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.380
 try how you see the system is a lot 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.420
 simple we have the two missions are 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.310
 very very light plastic missiles 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.750
 light sponge over here 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.240
 we have the bed made on purpose because 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.490
 It is the lever at the top and then re cana it 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.430
 we have four of two yellow and missiles 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:50.420
 two blue from here obviously comes out 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.460
 the air area to be stamped here 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.410
 crushing here soprano for which I do 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.290
 a very very fast test as you see 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.100
 if I do what the missile goes on who in 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.250
 high 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.670
 ok now let's proceed to do the real test e 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.500
 his own will make them both jump 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.780
 jumping with both feet with a 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.060
 incredible agility over the 2 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 the two push missile let's call it 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.710
 two kitchenettes this qua purple and let's see 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.710
 how far they are ready 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.420
 ok as you saw guys 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.859
 perfect operation and I must say that 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.229
 you want yes you can play on any 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.429
 surface here like on soft grass mi 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.740
 I always recommend doing it outside 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:54.310
 maybe in a meadow where they are not there 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.140
 trees where there are no poles of 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.130
 light where there are no houses and the like 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.869
 because I obviously recommend a lot 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.349
 careful missiles are very light 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.179
 so maybe it's better when we have a 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.160
 little wind maybe avoid flying 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.560
 because it could then if you make a race 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.610
 1 against 1 missile going a little further 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.049
 high the other point that takes one 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.489
 direction due to the wind being i 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.709
 light missiles 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.739
 otherwise really nice fun 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.200
 and playing together is a fantastic thing to say 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.200
 then the base is very solid though 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.489
 light plastic so I leave again 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.920
 perfectly leveled and balanced 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.890
 so the race is definitely perfect 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.680
 well i greet you from nai experiment e 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.489
 missile stop rocket test 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.900
 succeeded 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.230
