today I'm going to show you how to do a

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.500 
today I'm going to show you how to do a
fix<00:00:05.160> for<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.819> Skyrim<00:00:06.450> green<00:00:06.870> water<00:00:07.140> book<00:00:08.510> and

fix for the Skyrim green water book and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.740 
fix for the Skyrim green water book and
essentially<00:00:10.080> what<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.440> bug<00:00:10.790> does<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:12.300> it

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
essentially what this bug does is it

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.379 
essentially what this bug does is it
turns<00:00:12.900> your<00:00:13.110> entire<00:00:13.469> screen<00:00:13.889> either<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.820> dark

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
turns your entire screen either a dark

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.930 
turns your entire screen either a dark
green<00:00:15.660> color<00:00:15.719> or<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.289> gray<00:00:16.680> color<00:00:16.949> when<00:00:17.820> you're

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
green color or a gray color when you're

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.179 
green color or a gray color when you're
underwater<00:00:18.180> which<00:00:19.080> makes<00:00:19.410> certain<00:00:19.980> quests

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
underwater which makes certain quests

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.090 
underwater which makes certain quests
difficult<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.449> first<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.560> all<00:00:22.650> okay

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
difficult to do so first of all okay

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.720 
difficult to do so first of all okay
example<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:25.080> what<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> bug<00:00:25.740> does<00:00:26.010> hit

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
example this is what the bug does hit

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.279 
example this is what the bug does hit
your<00:00:26.849> little<00:00:26.970> squiggly<00:00:27.449> button<00:00:27.720> which<00:00:28.050> is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
your little squiggly button which is

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.140 
your little squiggly button which is
usually<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> upper<00:00:29.130> left<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.760> your<00:00:29.970> keyboard

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
usually the upper left of your keyboard

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.849 
usually the upper left of your keyboard
I'm<00:00:30.570> sure<00:00:30.900> there's<00:00:31.140> an<00:00:31.289> official<00:00:31.679> name<00:00:31.830> for

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
I'm sure there's an official name for

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.470 
I'm sure there's an official name for
that<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.520> don't<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.090> is

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
that but I don't know what it is

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.410 
that but I don't know what it is
squiggly<00:00:34.050> button<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:35.309> open<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:35.790> your<00:00:35.969> console

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
command then you type in te o FIS enter

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.479 
command then you type in te o FIS enter
and<00:00:41.370> your<00:00:42.300> water<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.719> clear<00:00:43.050> hit<00:00:43.829> squiggly<00:00:44.280> to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and your water is clear hit squiggly to

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.630 
and your water is clear hit squiggly to
get<00:00:44.610> out<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.440> that's<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.129> solves<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
get out and that's it that solves the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.979 
get out and that's it that solves the
problem<00:00:48.000> now<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.270> does<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.629> away<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
problem now it does take away the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.369 
problem now it does take away the
blurriness<00:00:50.510> you<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> kind<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.020> effect

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
blurriness you know the kind of effect

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.869 
blurriness you know the kind of effect
of<00:00:52.530> being<00:00:52.739> underwater<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.460> does<00:00:53.610> clear

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
of being underwater but does clear

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.360 
of being underwater but does clear
things<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.270> without<00:00:54.690> having<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.260> use<00:00:55.500> any<00:00:55.920> mods

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
things up without having to use any mods

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
things up without having to use any mods
or<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.600> tws<00:00:58.289> command<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.129> tws<00:00:59.760> command<00:01:00.180> just

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
or the tws command and tws command just

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.479 
or the tws command and tws command just
gets<00:01:00.660> rid<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.930> water<00:01:01.230> period<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.100> looks

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
gets rid of water period and it looks

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.969 
gets rid of water period and it looks
really<00:01:03.210> funky<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.049> fact<00:01:04.320> i'll<00:01:04.559> show<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.830> what

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
really funky in fact i'll show you what

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.440 
really funky in fact i'll show you what
it<00:01:05.070> looks<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:06.320> yeah<00:01:07.909> that's<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:10.380> weird

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
it looks like yeah that's so weird

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.390 
it looks like yeah that's so weird
anyway<00:01:12.530> turn<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.619> back<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.920> because<00:01:14.130> that's

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
anyway turn it back on because that's

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.390 
anyway turn it back on because that's
just<00:01:14.820> unsettling<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.070> something<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> keep<00:01:17.220> in

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
just unsettling and something to keep in

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.999 
just unsettling and something to keep in
mind<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.080> you<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.860> this

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
mind is that you do have to do this

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830 
mind is that you do have to do this
every<00:01:20.340> time<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.610> log<00:01:20.820> into<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> game<00:01:21.210> I'm<00:01:21.600> not

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
every time you log into the game I'm not

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.120 
every time you log into the game I'm not
sure<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.350> every<00:01:22.619> time<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.920> log

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
sure if it's every time you log

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.950 
sure if it's every time you log
characters<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:24.119> every<00:01:24.360> time<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.780> load

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
characters or every time you just load

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
characters or every time you just load
the<00:01:25.080> game<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.460> will<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the game but you will have to do it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.420 
the game but you will have to do it
frequently

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
frequently

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.300 
frequently
and<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.990> reason<00:01:30.320> I<00:01:30.440> use<00:01:30.620> it<00:01:30.830> instead<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.130> using

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
and the reason I use it instead of using

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.310 
and the reason I use it instead of using
a<00:01:31.490> mod<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:31.940> because<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:32.330> kind<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.600> have<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.780> run

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
a mod is because I kind of have to run

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.380 
a mod is because I kind of have to run
the<00:01:33.470> low-resolution<00:01:33.850> game<00:01:34.850> I'm<00:01:35.090> sure<00:01:35.270> there

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
the low-resolution game I'm sure there

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.670 
the low-resolution game I'm sure there
are<00:01:35.450> other<00:01:35.540> people<00:01:35.810> out<00:01:35.870> there<00:01:36.110> who<00:01:36.200> do<00:01:36.380> I

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
are other people out there who do I

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.250 
are other people out there who do I
can't<00:01:37.370> really<00:01:37.520> do<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.210> water<00:01:38.480> retexture<00:01:39.170> in

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
can't really do the water retexture in

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.280 
can't really do the water retexture in
mods<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:39.830> this<00:01:39.980> is<00:01:40.160> a<00:01:40.190> good<00:01:40.400> solution<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.290> in

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
mods so this is a good solution and in

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.540 
mods so this is a good solution and in
case<00:01:42.440> you're<00:01:42.530> wondering<00:01:42.650> about<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.100> mods<00:01:43.310> I

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
case you're wondering about the mods I
