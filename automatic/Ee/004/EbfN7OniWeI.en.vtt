00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:49.999 
this off thanks very much and even then

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.569 
this off thanks very much and even then
it's<00:00:50.960> spread<00:00:51.199> out<00:00:51.499> over<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.769> very<00:00:51.979> long<00:00:52.280> time

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
it's spread out over a very long time

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:53.979 
it's spread out over a very long time
but<00:00:52.789> there<00:00:52.940> is<00:00:53.030> one<00:00:53.269> key<00:00:53.539> difference<00:00:53.929> between

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
but there is one key difference between

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.299 
but there is one key difference between
the<00:00:54.319> u.s.<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:54.649> Canada

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
the u.s. and Canada

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.819 
the u.s. and Canada
and<00:00:55.549> that's<00:00:55.760> that<00:00:56.059> cities<00:00:56.539> down<00:00:56.780> here<00:00:57.229> can

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
and that's that cities down here can

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.750 
and that's that cities down here can
borrow<00:00:58.269> for<00:00:59.269> big<00:00:59.539> projects<00:01:00.199> like<00:01:00.229> this

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.640 

good<00:01:04.150> being<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.449> highways<00:01:04.900> took<00:01:05.170> an<00:01:05.290> awful

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
good being the highways took an awful

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.250 
good being the highways took an awful
long<00:01:05.800> time<00:01:06.190> it<00:01:06.520> began<00:01:06.880> in<00:01:07.120> 1990<00:01:07.870> one<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.170> the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
long time it began in 1990 one of the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.020 
long time it began in 1990 one of the
thinking<00:01:08.560> was<00:01:08.620> had<00:01:09.040> be<00:01:09.159> done<00:01:09.370> in<00:01:09.580> seven<00:01:10.000> years

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
thinking was had be done in seven years

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.790 
thinking was had be done in seven years
course<00:01:10.960> it<00:01:11.170> wasn't<00:01:11.440> it<00:01:11.800> took<00:01:12.040> until<00:01:13.290> 2007<00:01:14.290> it

course it wasn't it took until 2007 it

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.530 
course it wasn't it took until 2007 it
wasn't<00:01:15.130> so<00:01:15.250> much<00:01:15.310> time<00:01:15.790> it<00:01:16.030> was<00:01:16.180> money

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
wasn't so much time it was money
