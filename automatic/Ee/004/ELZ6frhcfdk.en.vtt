32nd<00:03:31.959> notes<00:03:32.109> in<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.319> 64th<00:03:32.950> notes<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.489> hope

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
32nd notes in the 64th notes so hope

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.740 
32nd notes in the 64th notes so hope
that<00:03:34.239> helps

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
that helps

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.479 
that helps
it<00:03:35.200> takes<00:03:35.409> a<00:03:35.470> lot<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.620> practice<00:03:36.099> but<00:03:36.280> it's

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
it takes a lot of practice but it's

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.520 
it takes a lot of practice but it's
certainly<00:03:36.790> worth<00:03:37.030> achieving<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.409> it's

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
certainly worth achieving that and it's

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.349 
certainly worth achieving that and it's
so<00:03:38.680> simple<00:03:38.950> because<00:03:39.250> all<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.700> need<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:40.120> do<00:03:40.299> is

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
so simple because all you need to do is

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.860 
so simple because all you need to do is
you<00:03:41.230> can<00:03:41.379> just<00:03:41.560> master<00:03:42.489> ohms<00:03:42.609> you<00:03:43.389> know<00:03:43.480> one<00:03:43.689> by

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
you can just master ohms you know one by

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.110 
you can just master ohms you know one by
one<00:03:44.170> first<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.099> take<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.609> fast

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
one first you take it that fast

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.599 
one first you take it that fast
and<00:03:46.480> then<00:03:47.139> the<00:03:47.500> next<00:03:47.799> speed<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.159> them<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.430> dig

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
and then the next speed of them to dig

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.149 
and then the next speed of them to dig
speed<00:03:48.909> and<00:03:49.060> then<00:03:49.180> finally<00:03:49.599> get<00:03:50.290> up<00:03:50.409> to<00:03:50.530> 64th

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
speed and then finally get up to 64th

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.670 
speed and then finally get up to 64th
nut<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.670> hope<00:03:52.329> that<00:03:52.359> helps<00:03:52.900> see<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.319> tomorrow

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680
