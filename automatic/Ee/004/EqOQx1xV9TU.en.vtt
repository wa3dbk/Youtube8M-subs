 in Khakassia, the scientists went to the city 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.230
 to catch a snow leopard 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.630
 environmentalists want to know where 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.000
 the most mysterious cats in the world come 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.309
 South Siberia make their way safe 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.900
 it turns out predators are able to nibble 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.900
 deer do not even know how to growl 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.680
 Victor is black thickly ask 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.680
 all in the wake of the snow leopard 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.100
 established fact of modern Russia 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.020
 more people had time to fly into space than 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.440
 see a snow leopard on the beast sergey

 one of these select box which 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.090
 easily able to kill 200 kilogram 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.090
 maral 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.760
 he speaks with genuine tenderness here 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.160
 he can not yugai smell the cat 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.960
 with this brand it does not know how 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.930
 growl like a lion tiger 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.370
 let's say she made within the meal one 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.290
 of the best specialists in russia 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.120
 snow leopard leads us over the rocks you need Siberia 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.520
 it is here at a height of several thousand 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.850
 meters and live the most unexplored cats 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.590
 of the world 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.510
 traces of leopards barely guessed in 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.340
 surrounding vegetation here wars 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.860
 celebrated snow leopard celebrate here 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.950
 see claw marks you need to sit down and 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.020
 . bti i mean he shows that he is here 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 only once the leopard hit the lenses 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.619
 TV cameras these few seconds video 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.229
 the only wildcat in Russia 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.910
 or without extremely careful and most importantly these 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.740
 there are very few animals on 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.330
 the territory of the Sayan-Shushensky reserve 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.580
 and this is four thousand square 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.580
 kilometers live less than 10 individuals 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.560
 in fact we know almost nothing 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.780
 about the snow leopard ah in the world and just a few 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.120
 people who have seen snow leopards 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.490
 vivo and loves the animal 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.260
 very secretive and and therefore his habits 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.410
 scientists will learn mainly through 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.240
 install hidden cameras each of 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.330
 which is equipped with an infrared sensor 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.530
 tracking when the animal hits 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.020
 controlled space 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.430
 automatically take a picture that way 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.430
 four years ago was photographed 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.350
 mongol is the most famous irbis of russian 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.330
 federation first mongolo just 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.670
 photographed and then got down to business in 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.010
 2011 you were caught on this rock 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.810
 near the waterfall at the snow leopard they took tests 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.000
 like a leopard put on a collar is alive and with 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.620
 transmitter and released in this scientific 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.510
 experiment personally participated vladimir 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.830
 Putin thanks to the support of which 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.560
 Russia has launched a special program 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.110
 wild cats of southern Siberia is our task 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.530
 that this project was monitored on 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.240
 over the years 1 to understand 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.540
 life activity about feline pretty 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.360
 secretive species in order to understand them 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.989
 way of life in order to understand how to 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.080
 farther 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.330
 save all the same I must pay tribute 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.220
 that it is very vulnerable other species but 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.410
 rescue of leopards and other rare cats in 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.120
 year spends about 20 million rubles 100 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.690
 sorske and money goes to the purchase of scientific 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.550
 equipment 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.260
 expedition financing and assistance 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.209
 reserve administration which 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.100
 sorely lacking allocated 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.410
 budget technical progress 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.410
 walks very fast and we all stay 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.300
 still at some previous levels we are not 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.180
 enough watercraft enough good 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.459
 quality engines for outboard motors 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.530
 I'm not talking about the helicopter 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.950
 snow leopards have no natural nature 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.450
 of enemies 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.630
 depicted on the arms of cities and 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.630
 republics 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.990
 snow leopard got into the red book because 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.990
 human 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.920
 in the mountains of siberia poachers puts hundreds 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.920
 traps hunting for kabarda 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.530
 the iron of this little deer of hers 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.270
 called jet appreciate in eastern 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.190
 medicine sometimes in traps 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.360
 Leopard hits and then waits 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.580
 painful death 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.390
 when musk deer goes she gets in the loop 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.000
 and automatically communes by inertia 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.830
 trying to escape escapes and loop 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.660
 delays and 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.340
 pasvik stifles this massive project 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.110
 conservation leopards is designed for five years 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.730
 next year's main task to catch 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.070
 for research some more animals 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.900
 putting on which collars built 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.030
 navigation scientists will try to understand 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.250
 where do irbis come from siberian city 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.750
 By setting the Basque migration route, you can 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.060
 will protect more effectively 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.980
 population of snow leopards which all of Russia 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.660
 no more than 50 meters left 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.160
 viktor seen a goose andrey perfiliev and 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.060
 led her to channel 5 channel 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.060
 Sayano-Shushensky Reserve
