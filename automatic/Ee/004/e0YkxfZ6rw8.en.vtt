 hello dear friends how are you 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.130

 scandalous animated series earlier on it 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.260
 several games have already been released but 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.260
 the authors of the cartoon itself did not have to them 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.350

 got up it seems i got too big 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.470
 An important question is whether the creators have 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.379
 cartoon series trey parker and matt stone 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.360
 attitude to making this game like 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.640
 it turned out yes they wrote the script 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.220
 actively participated in dubbing the game and 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.320
 watched her creation agree 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.780
 this is a reason to buy this 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.450
