players playing together to achieve
success<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.180> basically<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.750> six<00:01:37.020> teams<00:01:37.290> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
success so basically it's six teams of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.469 
success so basically it's six teams of
two<00:01:37.650> player<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.400> around<00:01:38.670> maps<00:01:38.939> trying<00:01:39.270> to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479

you can be the lone wolf if you want but

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.940 
you can be the lone wolf if you want but
chances<00:01:46.020> are<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.229> you're<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.650> going<00:01:46.829> to

war zone actually war zone was in the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.630 
war zone actually war zone was in the
1st<00:02:01.079> army<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.710> two<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:01.920> multiplayer<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.460> was

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
1st army of two in multiplayer it was

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.600 
1st army of two in multiplayer it was
the<00:02:03.030> mode<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.299> army<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.200> two<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.829> what<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:05.430> did

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the mode of army of two so what we did

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.940 
the mode of army of two so what we did
was<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:06.090> update<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.630> with<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.229> new<00:02:07.409> co-op<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
was just update it with the new co-op a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.859 
was just update it with the new co-op a
project<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.579> have<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.060> time<00:02:09.299> around<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
project we have for this time around and

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.449 
project we have for this time around and
then<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.350> fourth<00:02:10.619> mode<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.190> called

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
then the fourth mode it's called

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.060 
then the fourth mode it's called
extraction<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.299> a<00:02:12.420> bonus<00:02:12.690> mode<00:02:13.049> this<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
extraction it's a bonus mode this is the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.710 
extraction it's a bonus mode this is the
mode<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.519> get<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:14.940> pre-order<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.600> game

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
mode you get if you pre-order the game

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.050 
mode you get if you pre-order the game
so<00:02:16.049> it's<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.440> co-op<00:02:16.709> at<00:02:16.860> four<00:02:17.160> where<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.459> try<00:02:17.730> to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
so it's a co-op at four where you try to

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.210 
so it's a co-op at four where you try to
fight<00:02:18.329> against<00:02:18.810> wave<00:02:19.049> after<00:02:19.230> wave<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.620> enemy

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
fight against wave after wave of enemy

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.699 
fight against wave after wave of enemy
and<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:21.150> plays<00:02:21.390> out<00:02:21.540> through<00:02:21.840> four<00:02:22.110> maps<00:02:22.350> and

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
and this plays out through four maps and

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.800 
and this plays out through four maps and
what<00:02:23.130> we<00:02:23.310> do<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.579> we<00:02:23.880> change<00:02:24.180> location

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
what we do is that we change location

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.960 
what we do is that we change location
where<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.290> play<00:02:25.560> from<00:02:26.130> round<00:02:26.459> two<00:02:26.640> runs<00:02:26.820> we

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
where you play from round two runs we

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.000 
where you play from round two runs we
have<00:02:27.090> 16<00:02:27.510> runs<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.079> go<00:02:28.260> through<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.709> it's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
have 16 runs to go through and it's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.220 
have 16 runs to go through and it's
getting<00:02:29.239> amazingly<00:02:30.239> difficult<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.049> go

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
along so surviving up to the sick

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.089 
along so surviving up to the sick
round<00:02:34.120> will<00:02:34.780> be<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.959> challenge<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:35.890> quite

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
round will be a challenge and it's quite

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.920
