00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.409 
what not to do in base design the walls
are<00:00:13.620> too<00:00:13.860> far<00:00:14.040> apart<00:00:14.160> you've<00:00:14.580> got<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.910> spot

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:15.419 
are too far apart you've got that spot

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.600 
are too far apart you've got that spot
rate<00:00:15.749> right<00:00:16.320> beside<00:00:16.620> the<00:00:16.740> mortar<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
rate right beside the mortar and the

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.189 
rate right beside the mortar and the
archer<00:00:18.030> tower<00:00:18.240> where<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.720> bring<00:00:18.960> in

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
archer tower where you can bring in

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.170 
archer tower where you can bring in
units<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.740> all<00:00:19.800> I'm<00:00:19.890> going<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.460> spam<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
units and all I'm going to do is spam a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.750 
units and all I'm going to do is spam a
few<00:00:21.539> barbarians<00:00:22.199> now<00:00:22.679> I<00:00:22.740> am<00:00:23.010> going<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.580> use<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
few barbarians now I am going to use a

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.630 
few barbarians now I am going to use a
wall<00:00:24.090> breaker<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.560> my<00:00:25.890> barbarians<00:00:26.460> can

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
wall breaker just so my barbarians can

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.480 
wall breaker just so my barbarians can
get<00:00:26.789> into<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.929> Archer<00:00:28.439> tower<00:00:28.679> and<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.070> two

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
get into that Archer tower and the two

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.669 
get into that Archer tower and the two
cannons<00:00:29.970> very<00:00:30.240> very<00:00:30.449> quickly<00:00:30.750> alright<00:00:31.439> so

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
cannons very very quickly alright so

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.550 
cannons very very quickly alright so
that<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.040> cost<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.669> what<00:00:33.060> 3,000<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.020> think

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
that was a cost of what 3,000 I think

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.830 
that was a cost of what 3,000 I think
for<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.070> wall<00:00:35.670> breaker<00:00:35.970> just<00:00:36.330> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.660> be

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
for that wall breaker just going to be

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.630 
for that wall breaker just going to be
that<00:00:37.440> much<00:00:37.590> more<00:00:37.650> effective<00:00:38.160> because<00:00:38.280> if<00:00:38.520> they

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
that much more effective because if they

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.520 
that much more effective because if they
if<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.970> barbarians<00:00:39.540> came<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.230> around

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
if the barbarians came in and around

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.620 
if the barbarians came in and around
they<00:00:41.220> would<00:00:41.490> go<00:00:41.640> after<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.090> air<00:00:42.210> defense

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
they would go after the air defense

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.830 
they would go after the air defense
first<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.320> then<00:00:43.910> possibly<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.480> after<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
first and then possibly go after the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.680 
first and then possibly go after the
cannons<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.410> not<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.130> the<00:00:47.520> Town<00:00:47.760> Hall<00:00:47.790> all

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
cannons if not the the Town Hall all

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.440 
cannons if not the the Town Hall all
right<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.560> you<00:00:49.740> saw<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.430> took<00:00:50.580> took

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
right and then you saw that I took took

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.870 
right and then you saw that I took took
that<00:00:51.660> other<00:00:51.870> mortar<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> same<00:00:53.580> time

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
that other mortar out at the same time

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.110 
that other mortar out at the same time
with<00:00:54.750> some<00:00:55.290> archers<00:00:55.740> so<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.820> don't<00:00:56.940> need

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
with some archers so now we don't need

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.390 
with some archers so now we don't need
to<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.330> anything<00:00:57.540> else<00:00:57.810> we<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.050> hopefully<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
to do anything else we can hopefully the

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.850 
to do anything else we can hopefully the
barbarians<00:01:00.300> will<00:01:00.600> finish<00:01:00.930> off<00:01:01.200> these<00:01:01.560> two

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
barbarians will finish off these two

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.039 
barbarians will finish off these two
remaining<00:01:02.250> cannons<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.240> in<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.540> main<00:01:03.750> area

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
remaining cannons here in the main area

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.299 
remaining cannons here in the main area
of<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> base<00:01:04.500> I'm<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> bring<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> few

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
of the base I'm going to bring in a few

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.219 
of the base I'm going to bring in a few
more<00:01:05.369> barbarians<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:07.079> are

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
more barbarians just because we are

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.959 
more barbarians just because we are
getting<00:01:07.439> kind<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.799> low<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.219> probably<00:01:08.729> should

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
getting kind of low I probably should

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.359 
getting kind of low I probably should
have<00:01:09.179> brought<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.469> little<00:01:10.500> bit<00:01:10.890> sooner

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
have brought some in a little bit sooner

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.910 
have brought some in a little bit sooner
and<00:01:11.659> they<00:01:12.659> didn't<00:01:13.020> necessarily<00:01:13.109> go<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.890> I

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and they didn't necessarily go where I

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.679 
and they didn't necessarily go where I
wanted<00:01:14.250> them<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.700> they're<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.179> after<00:01:15.420> those

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
wanted them to they're going after those

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.870 
wanted them to they're going after those
buildings<00:01:16.140> at<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> back<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.799> opposed<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
buildings at the back as opposed to the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.999 
buildings at the back as opposed to the
cannon<00:01:18.240> unfortunately<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.289> they<00:01:19.499> just

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
cannon unfortunately you know they just

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.349 
cannon unfortunately you know they just
go<00:01:20.219> after<00:01:20.340> buildings<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:20.999> don't<00:01:21.179> go<00:01:21.240> after

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
go after buildings they don't go after

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.840 
go after buildings they don't go after
defenses<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.079> particular<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> think<00:01:23.460> we're

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
defenses in particular so I think we're

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.919 
defenses in particular so I think we're
going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.119> able<00:01:24.179> to<00:01:24.329> finish<00:01:24.479> off<00:01:24.749> the

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
going to be able to finish off the

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.359 
going to be able to finish off the
cannon<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.560> only<00:01:25.649> end<00:01:25.859> up<00:01:25.979> with<00:01:26.130> one

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
cannon but we only end up with one

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.149 
cannon but we only end up with one
barbarian<00:01:26.820> left<00:01:27.359> and<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.740> only<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
barbarian left and we only have the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.980 
barbarian left and we only have the
storages<00:01:29.609> at<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> back<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.329> he<00:01:30.810> gets

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
storages at the back and he gets

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.830 
storages at the back and he gets
bombarded<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.679> the<00:01:31.859> bombs<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.119> he<00:01:33.329> gets

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
bombarded with the bombs here so he gets

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230 
bombarded with the bombs here so he gets
taken<00:01:34.289> out<00:01:34.590> unfortunately<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.999> have<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
taken out unfortunately and I have to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.700 
taken out unfortunately and I have to
bring<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.630> what<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> end<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.079> doing<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.469> bringing

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
bring in what I end up doing is bringing
