00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
one that you can undo by pulling one of

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.389 
one that you can undo by pulling one of
the<00:02:06.290> ends<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:08.259> just<00:02:09.259> do<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.500> they<00:02:10.100> will<00:02:10.280> just

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
the ends so just do that they will just

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.720 
the ends so just do that they will just
fall<00:02:10.640> apart<00:02:11.470> then<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.710> got<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.190> do<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.700> other

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
fall apart then you got to do the other

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.580 
fall apart then you got to do the other
side<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.300> hammock<00:02:14.540> which<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:15.200> strangely

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
side of the hammock which is strangely

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.400 
side of the hammock which is strangely
enough<00:02:15.830> exactly<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.790> same

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.180

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:34.890 

just<00:02:26.880> as<00:02:27.030> ifrit<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.660> laces<00:02:29.330> that

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.910 

that's<00:02:39.099> all<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.310> ever<00:02:39.430> use<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:44.260> first<00:02:44.500> time<00:02:44.800> you

sit<00:02:45.069> in<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.310> hammock<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.790> might<00:02:46.270> want<00:02:46.450> to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
sit in the hammock you might want to

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.720 
sit in the hammock you might want to
bounce<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.989> bit<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:48.069> in<00:02:48.220> case<00:02:48.370> your<00:02:48.550> knots

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
bounce a bit just in case your knots

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.339 
bounce a bit just in case your knots
aren't<00:02:49.030> good<00:02:49.239> enough<00:02:49.450> watch<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.959> knots<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
aren't good enough watch the knots to

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.860 
aren't good enough watch the knots to
see<00:02:50.530> if<00:02:50.620> they're<00:02:50.770> slipping<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:52.510> can<00:02:52.660> end<00:02:52.780> up

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
see if they're slipping you can end up

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.270 
see if they're slipping you can end up
on<00:02:52.989> your<00:02:53.170> ass<00:02:55.380> another<00:02:56.380> thing<00:02:56.620> people<00:02:56.739> ask<00:02:57.069> is

this<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:14.170> definitely<00:03:14.950> not<00:03:15.519> how<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.120> do<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:17.160> and

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
this is definitely not how to do it and

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.229 
this is definitely not how to do it and
this<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:18.880> also<00:03:19.230> pretty<00:03:20.230> bad

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
this is also pretty bad

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.440 
this is also pretty bad
