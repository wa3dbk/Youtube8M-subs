thought<00:02:10.869> his<00:02:10.929> best<00:02:11.290> bet<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:11.740> do<00:02:11.950> exactly

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
thought his best bet is to do exactly

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.760 
thought his best bet is to do exactly
what<00:02:12.580> he's<00:02:12.790> doing<00:02:12.820> be<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.600> aggressor<00:02:14.170> get

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
what he's doing be the aggressor get

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.010 
what he's doing be the aggressor get
inside<00:02:15.280> he<00:02:15.700> does<00:02:15.880> not<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> background<00:02:16.660> in
