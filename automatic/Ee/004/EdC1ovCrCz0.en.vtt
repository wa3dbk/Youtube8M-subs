we're gonna have to go back down and get
some<00:04:26.360> more<00:04:35.320> like<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.500> said<00:04:36.740> we<00:04:36.919> are<00:04:37.010> really

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.550 

since<00:04:57.069> the<00:04:57.250> heat<00:04:57.460> gets<00:04:57.729> rid<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.030> the

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
since the heat gets rid of the

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.379 
since the heat gets rid of the
stickiness<00:04:59.560> of<00:04:59.710> it<00:04:59.889> and<00:05:00.580> as<00:05:00.669> I<00:05:00.789> think<00:05:00.969> all<00:05:01.270> the

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
stickiness of it and as I think all the

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.250 
breads and stuff like that because as
far<00:07:18.860> as<00:07:18.980> the<00:07:19.070> nutrients<00:07:19.490> goes<00:07:19.820> this<00:07:20.780> thing<00:07:21.050> has

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 
far as the nutrients goes this thing has

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.410 
far as the nutrients goes this thing has
like<00:07:21.560> I<00:07:21.710> said<00:07:21.890> more<00:07:22.100> protein<00:07:22.580> than<00:07:22.610> almost<00:07:23.120> any

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:23.420 
like I said more protein than almost any

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.780 
like I said more protein than almost any
other<00:07:23.570> plant<00:07:24.080> that<00:07:24.320> there<00:07:24.470> is<00:07:24.620> out<00:07:24.950> there<00:07:24.980> so

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:25.790 
other plant that there is out there so

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.820 
other plant that there is out there so
that's<00:07:26.510> important<00:07:27.080> to<00:07:27.200> me<00:07:27.320> because<00:07:27.500> you

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830 
that's important to me because you

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.820 
that's important to me because you
really<00:07:28.040> do<00:07:28.160> need<00:07:28.310> protein<00:07:28.820> to<00:07:29.530> you<00:07:30.530> kind<00:07:30.770> of

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.830 
really do need protein to you kind of

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.770 
really do need protein to you kind of
keep<00:07:31.250> yourself<00:07:31.430> sustained<00:07:32.120> as<00:07:32.300> far<00:07:32.480> as<00:07:32.570> energy

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:32.780 
keep yourself sustained as far as energy

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.960 
keep yourself sustained as far as energy
goes<00:07:32.990> through<00:07:33.470> the<00:07:33.590> day<00:07:33.740> and<00:07:34.580> then<00:07:34.730> you<00:07:34.880> know

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:34.970 
goes through the day and then you know

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.840 
goes through the day and then you know
it's<00:07:35.120> got<00:07:35.240> all<00:07:35.390> the<00:07:35.510> vitamin<00:07:35.840> A<00:07:36.020> B's<00:07:36.710> lots<00:07:37.490> of<00:07:37.670> C

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:37.850 
it's got all the vitamin A B's lots of C

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.460 
it's got all the vitamin A B's lots of C
and<00:07:38.030> D<00:07:38.060> in<00:07:38.300> there<00:07:38.540> and<00:07:38.780> there's<00:07:39.170> a<00:07:39.230> lot<00:07:39.380> of

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.470 
and D in there and there's a lot of

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.380 
and D in there and there's a lot of
minerals<00:07:39.770> like<00:07:39.920> calcium<00:07:40.340> and<00:07:40.850> iron<00:07:41.000> and

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:41.390 
minerals like calcium and iron and

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.700 
minerals like calcium and iron and
there's<00:07:41.660> phosphorus<00:07:42.320> and<00:07:42.530> magnesium

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:42.710 
there's phosphorus and magnesium

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.770 
there's phosphorus and magnesium
potassium<00:07:43.400> I<00:07:44.060> mean<00:07:44.210> the<00:07:44.300> thing<00:07:44.450> is<00:07:44.480> just

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:44.780 
potassium I mean the thing is just

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.720 
potassium I mean the thing is just
loaded<00:07:45.110> if<00:07:45.230> you<00:07:45.320> look<00:07:45.470> it<00:07:45.590> up<00:07:45.710> and<00:07:46.190> like<00:07:46.430> I<00:07:46.580> did

that on on the wild edibles John the

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.230 
that on on the wild edibles John the
channel<00:07:54.530> page<00:07:54.710> go<00:07:55.250> to<00:07:55.310> that<00:07:55.490> playlist<00:07:55.790> but

00:07:59.320 --> 00:07:59.330 
anyway there we have it dried and I mean

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.880 
anyway there we have it dried and I mean
we<00:07:59.570> can<00:07:59.720> store<00:07:59.930> a<00:07:59.960> lot<00:08:00.050> of<00:08:00.200> it<00:08:00.380> in<00:08:00.500> a<00:08:00.590> small

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:00.890 
we can store a lot of it in a small

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.320 
we can store a lot of it in a small
amount<00:08:01.130> of<00:08:01.160> space<00:08:01.280> so<00:08:01.700> I'm<00:08:01.910> gonna<00:08:02.060> go<00:08:02.180> out<00:08:02.300> I'm

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:02.330 
amount of space so I'm gonna go out I'm

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.910 
amount of space so I'm gonna go out I'm
gonna<00:08:02.540> do<00:08:02.720> about<00:08:02.840> another<00:08:03.410> batch<00:08:03.650> of<00:08:03.830> these

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:03.920 
gonna do about another batch of these

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:05.600 
and you'd have something during the

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.680 
and you'd have something during the
winter<00:08:05.780> time<00:08:05.960> when<00:08:06.170> plants<00:08:06.680> aren't<00:08:06.830> available
