00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 the fantastic sport begins with 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.470
 story of a young man who dribbled 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.900
 crime with the ball at the feet 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.950

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.190
 and violence and lost the father in a hit 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.340

 fruits of a life marked by 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.340
 obstacles 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:39.040
 At 20, Patrick made his debut on the palm trees. 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.770
 And he conquered the Copa do Brasil. 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.480

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.340
 relegation of the club in the championship 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.950

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.150
 many obstacles and never gave up 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.659

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.440

 on this side of criminality 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.930
 my mother my personal grandmother neighbor 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.940
 always sought to advise the people of 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.640
 best way to always be 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.120

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.720
 of my mother she had already lost the 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.940

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.569
 very difficult, she told him that 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.139

 a real one stays dead in the pool to 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.000

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.200
 earned the first salary at age 13 in the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.350
 Botafogo 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.989
 It was not easy, though. 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.569
 My grandmother took me to and then started 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.550

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.120

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.500
 But the mother's longing for Dona Simone is 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.080
 difficult to control 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.210
