00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.910 
i predicted it for the 9.8 patch as i
said<00:02:46.110> i<00:02:46.680> make<00:02:47.670> predictions<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.840> not<00:02:49.110> final

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
all right I cannot predict the future I

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.120 
all right I cannot predict the future I
can<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.310> give<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:09.150> rough<00:03:09.660> estimate<00:03:09.920> all<00:03:10.920> right

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
can just give a rough estimate all right

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.300 
can just give a rough estimate all right
but<00:03:11.490> for<00:03:11.610> now<00:03:11.730> yep<00:03:12.720> these<00:03:13.380> are<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.650> changes<00:03:13.890> to

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
but for now yep these are the changes to

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.610 
but for now yep these are the changes to
the<00:03:14.340> test<00:03:14.670> server<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.240> I'm<00:03:15.720> super<00:03:16.140> bummed<00:03:16.320> out

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
the test server and I'm super bummed out

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.210 
the test server and I'm super bummed out
because<00:03:17.100> they<00:03:17.700> disabled<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.800> domination<00:03:19.800> /

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
because they disabled the domination /

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.330 
because they disabled the domination /
captured<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.210> flag<00:03:21.360> mode<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:22.830> can<00:03:23.040> i<00:03:23.130> play

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
captured the flag mode so can i play

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.410 
captured the flag mode so can i play
with<00:03:23.490> it<00:03:23.520> but<00:03:24.150> other<00:03:24.420> than<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:25.170> get<00:03:25.350> the
