here a burly the cross country is always

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.390 
here a burly the cross country is always
big<00:00:22.330> it's<00:00:22.720> four<00:00:22.900> stars<00:00:23.200> championship<00:00:23.920> I<00:00:24.100> try

big it's four stars championship I try
and<00:00:24.490> make<00:00:24.610> it<00:00:24.640> fair

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.130 

discovery<00:00:28.090> valley<00:00:28.300> is<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.600> first<00:00:28.840> real

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
discovery valley is the first real

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.570 
discovery valley is the first real
question<00:00:29.560> on<00:00:29.770> the<00:00:29.860> course<00:00:30.100> they<00:00:30.340> come<00:00:30.550> through

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
question on the course they come through

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.519 
question on the course they come through
the<00:00:30.790> valley<00:00:31.060> and<00:00:31.330> up<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.750> bank<00:00:31.960> and<00:00:32.169> out<00:00:32.470> over

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
the valley and up the bank and out over

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.710 
the valley and up the bank and out over
the<00:00:32.920> bondage<00:00:33.340> of<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.550> discovery<00:00:34.000> at<00:00:34.180> an<00:00:34.360> angle

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
the bondage of the discovery at an angle

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.570 
the bondage of the discovery at an angle
which<00:00:35.020> is<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.290> first<00:00:35.500> of<00:00:35.620> accuracy<00:00:35.950> fits<00:00:36.280> then

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
which is the first of accuracy fits then

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.100 
which is the first of accuracy fits then
they<00:00:36.670> got<00:00:36.790> five<00:00:37.060> strides<00:00:37.450> to<00:00:37.630> a<00:00:37.690> big<00:00:37.840> triple

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
they got five strides to a big triple

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.200 
they got five strides to a big triple
rush<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.560> is<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:39.220> first<00:00:39.430> big<00:00:39.700> question<00:00:40.120> on

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
rush and is the first big question on

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:48.390 
rush and is the first big question on
the<00:00:40.360> course

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.950 

at<00:00:48.880> least<00:00:49.030> bit<00:00:49.210> this<00:00:49.300> year<00:00:49.360> has<00:00:49.600> completely

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
at least bit this year has completely

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.750 
at least bit this year has completely
different<00:00:50.380> and<00:00:50.890> so<00:00:51.040> we've<00:00:51.190> got<00:00:51.220> the<00:00:51.400> planets

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
different and so we've got the planets

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.060 
different and so we've got the planets
that<00:00:51.880> 56<00:00:52.300> tries<00:00:52.540> to<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.870> moon<00:00:53.080> then<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:53.830> steep

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
that 56 tries to the moon then the steep

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.800 
that 56 tries to the moon then the steep
descent<00:00:54.460> down<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:55.000> then<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.180> Sun<00:00:55.390> coming<00:00:55.630> out

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
descent down and then the Sun coming out

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.270 
descent down and then the Sun coming out
I<00:00:56.080> don't<00:00:56.320> actually<00:00:56.440> think<00:00:56.590> it's<00:00:56.890> technically

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
I don't actually think it's technically

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.880 
I don't actually think it's technically
that<00:00:57.490> difficult<00:00:57.970> but<00:00:58.450> optically<00:00:58.870> for<00:00:59.380> the

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
that difficult but optically for the

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.380 
that difficult but optically for the
riders<00:01:00.520> and<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.700> spectators<00:01:00.910> at<00:01:01.300> the

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
riders and the spectators at the

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.820 
riders and the spectators at the
fantastic

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.920 

yeah<00:01:09.370> the<00:01:09.490> transaction<00:01:09.790> again<00:01:10.120> is<00:01:10.270> completely

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
yeah the transaction again is completely

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.140 
yeah the transaction again is completely
new<00:01:11.140> have<00:01:11.560> a<00:01:11.590> steep<00:01:11.920> descent<00:01:12.100> down<00:01:12.490> into<00:01:12.970> the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
new have a steep descent down into the

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.730 
new have a steep descent down into the
bottom<00:01:13.270> part<00:01:13.570> of<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.750> top<00:01:14.110> three<00:01:14.260> we've

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
bottom part of the top three we've

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.840 
bottom part of the top three we've
actually<00:01:14.920> I<00:01:15.070> think<00:01:15.100> once<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.550> horses<00:01:15.820> are

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
actually I think once the horses are

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.400 
actually I think once the horses are
done<00:01:16.090> in<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.360> water<00:01:16.540> they'll<00:01:16.810> read<00:01:17.020> it<00:01:17.140> quite

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
done in the water they'll read it quite

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.050 
done in the water they'll read it quite
well<00:01:17.590> but<00:01:18.070> then<00:01:18.160> riders<00:01:18.490> can't<00:01:18.670> relax<00:01:18.910> because

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
well but then riders can't relax because

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
well but then riders can't relax because
things<00:01:19.330> are<00:01:19.420> going<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.600> have<00:01:19.690> real<00:01:19.900> quick

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
things are going to have real quick

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.930 
things are going to have real quick
after<00:01:20.350> that<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:21.190> second<00:01:21.520> part<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:21.820> really

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
after that that second part is really

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.320 
after that that second part is really
difficult<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.750> only<00:01:23.140> for<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.350> best

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.270 

yeah<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.230> maltings<00:01:27.590> there's<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:27.980> big<00:01:28.100> white

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
yeah the maltings there's the big white

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.590 
yeah the maltings there's the big white
oxen<00:01:28.580> which<00:01:28.730> has<00:01:28.820> actually<00:01:29.090> been<00:01:29.180> there<00:01:29.360> for<00:01:29.570> a

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
oxen which has actually been there for a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.820 
oxen which has actually been there for a
while<00:01:29.750> but<00:01:30.050> this<00:01:30.140> year<00:01:30.320> they<00:01:30.440> jump<00:01:30.620> off<00:01:30.710> the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
while but this year they jump off the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.470 
while but this year they jump off the
straight<00:01:31.040> away<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.910> then<00:01:32.030> they've<00:01:32.150> got<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.300> bun

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
straight away and then they've got a bun

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.420 
straight away and then they've got a bun
so<00:01:32.630> hedges<00:01:32.960> going<00:01:33.350> uphill<00:01:33.500> then<00:01:34.340> the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
so hedges going uphill then the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.680 
so hedges going uphill then the
difficult<00:01:34.790> part<00:01:34.970> because<00:01:35.300> they<00:01:35.390> can<00:01:35.540> off<00:01:35.660> the

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
difficult part because they can off the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.500 
difficult part because they can off the
little<00:01:35.930> man<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.830> it<00:01:36.980> was<00:01:37.190> a<00:01:37.220> very<00:01:37.520> big<00:01:37.910> right

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
little man to it was a very big right

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.120 
little man to it was a very big right
angled<00:01:38.900> corner<00:01:39.080> right<00:01:39.650> as<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.860> got<00:01:39.950> pretty

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
angled corner right as it got pretty

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.830 
angled corner right as it got pretty
good<00:01:40.250> at<00:01:40.400> that<00:01:40.520> type<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:40.910> question<00:01:41.450> these<00:01:41.570> days

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
good at that type of question these days

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.510 
good at that type of question these days
but<00:01:42.380> it's<00:01:42.500> really<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.890> four-star<00:01:43.340> question

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.609 

romex<00:01:49.240> is<00:01:49.450> always<00:01:49.810> offense<00:01:50.079> it<00:01:50.200> has<00:01:50.289> riders

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
romex is always offense it has riders

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:51.929 
romex is always offense it has riders
attention<00:01:51.009> I<00:01:51.039> don't<00:01:51.399> think<00:01:51.549> this<00:01:51.640> year<00:01:51.850> has

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
attention I don't think this year has

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.490 
attention I don't think this year has
any<00:01:52.179> different<00:01:52.539> now<00:01:52.600> there<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:52.899> only<00:01:53.020> one<00:01:53.289> line

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
any different now there is only one line

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.749 
any different now there is only one line
and<00:01:53.710> you<00:01:53.770> have<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.009> be<00:01:54.159> on<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.369> right<00:01:54.549> line

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
and you have to be on the right line

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.270 
and you have to be on the right line
because<00:01:55.570> if<00:01:55.780> you're<00:01:55.899> not<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:56.740> ditch<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:56.950> there

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
because if you're not the ditch is there

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.859 
because if you're not the ditch is there
to<00:01:57.490> trip<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.789> up<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.329> then<00:01:58.509> you've<00:01:58.659> got<00:01:58.780> to

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
to trip you up and then you've got to

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.319 
to trip you up and then you've got to
turn<00:01:59.110> in<00:01:59.530> two<00:01:59.740> strides<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.429> jump<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.909> brush

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
turn in two strides and jump the brush

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.940 
turn in two strides and jump the brush
head<00:02:01.689> you<00:02:01.929> had<00:02:02.079> a<00:02:02.110> head<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.380> their<00:02:02.530> last<00:02:02.770> year

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
head you had a head to their last year

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.499
