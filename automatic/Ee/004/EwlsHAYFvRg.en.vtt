00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello kids here panda commenting and 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.210
 I bring you a gameplay of moguer 3 is a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.730
 team challenge 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.590
 solano scope we can only shoot everything 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.600
 the team does not escape so hernÃ¡ndez 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.000
 fun was fun to do and 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.350
 obviously outdated like it but that 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.760
 started to be very important because what 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.220
 important is going to be today's comment 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.750
 that's going to be a little bit talking about the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.460
 black ops 2 and the multiplayer and 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.230
 important things in all have a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.900
 channel and what I'm going to be going up from 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 that and first of all because you already know that a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.579
 me the multiplayer of black ops 2 do not 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.190
 He liked it a lot and more than anything 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.810
 problems that there are in play 3 that are then 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.329
 the detection of bullets and servers 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.160
 the connection all that roll was going to 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.600
 explain a little first why 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.630
 this because surely many do not know 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.010
 making good take off above and other 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.050
 news that so important also good 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.510
 enough news that have a little 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.860
 short but we have them 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.110
 first say that the black ops 2 me 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.480
 it looks like a game in wanda gameplay good 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.730
 has advanced a lot in the products 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.890
 bought but three has taken streak of 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.930
 death has improved things to the nests 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.519
 of the the rifles that are a little 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.170
 treated but apart from that it's a good 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.020
 game the maps are good the system of 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.819
 points of the point networks is good and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.409
 in general it is a good game but in play 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.020
 3 As you know, there are the problems that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.329
 there is and this is more than anything because 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.389
 colts the products develop it for 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.310
 the xbox then everything that is to test 

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:25.259
 and all it is to verify that it is going well 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.869
 the game of that is done in xbox during 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.060
 the great brand the vast majority of the base 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.729
 of development and only at the end or test 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.920
 on play 3 and on pc where you are going 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.740
 of backup 2 exactly the same as 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.930
 happened with the backup one that are problems 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.270
 of treyarch which is in terms of mode 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.700
 cinema that is the matchmaking connection 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.320
 etc and also the problem of detection 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.750
 of bullets because always if you do not know 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.090
 the bullet version is when you 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.649
 shoot when you go to a player if 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.020
 you are in the body they detect you from the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.009
 bullet and records it as a hit marker and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.840
 as a possible damage 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.210
 these are small square squares 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.580
 that are all around the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.799
 player and that the infinity ward is of 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.750
 he has always done he has also been much 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.459
 better in another infinity ward game already 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.080
 It really unsettles me in this game 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.110
 because he is very bad in play 3 as a team 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.230
 I do not know how it will be but mayer is very bad 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.720
 So what happens is that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.120
 they will add it if they are arranging it as 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.459
 white is one game after 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.140
 February to March January will be a game a 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.239
 I play but right now for me 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.400
 personally without playable and that's why 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.319
 I'm playing a lot of multiplayer and what 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.209
 that I 'm playing is less serious 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.640
 of playing then doing bullshit and a 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.430
 little because not to gain all proportion 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.319
 very high not at all of that then what 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.390
 I'm thinking about buying the xbox 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.250
 for the online game just simply the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.170
 online game the rest first 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.750
 product and others will play plate 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.549
 I will continue playing play 3 then it is 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.590
 possible that happens to me the Christmases to the 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.120
 xbox to play online but before that 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.790
 I want I want to play with you those who 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.500
 I am play 3 at black ops 2, as it is 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.959
 to play less they scream I wanted to 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.500
 you then tomorrow on twitter what 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.519
 good my twitter this description will put 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.810

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.269
 three that the new account has made new 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.950
 with a very interesting man 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.200
 you will see it to be able to because you 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.819
 to then any kind of game mode does not 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.560

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.180

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.690

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.430
 so it's something I'm liking and how 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.920
