they were playing it on a pc it's made
with<00:03:38.940> directx<00:03:39.600> 11<00:03:39.990> so<00:03:40.680> then<00:03:40.800> maybe<00:03:40.920> it'll<00:03:41.340> come

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
with directx 11 so then maybe it'll come

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.620 
with directx 11 so then maybe it'll come
out<00:03:41.610> but<00:03:41.730> they're<00:03:41.850> not<00:03:41.940> talking<00:03:42.270> about<00:03:42.330> it<00:03:42.510> yet

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
hopefully never know like gameplay wise

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.430 
hopefully never know like gameplay wise
what<00:03:45.270> makes<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:45.540> different<00:03:45.630> from<00:03:45.870> us<00:03:46.080> like<00:03:46.410> a

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
what makes it different from us like a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.140 
what makes it different from us like a
final<00:03:46.710> fantasy<00:03:46.980> tactics<00:03:47.160> or<00:03:47.490> that<00:03:47.970> type<00:03:48.120> of

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
final fantasy tactics or that type of

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.760 
final fantasy tactics or that type of
game<00:03:48.330> well<00:03:48.660> tactics<00:03:49.050> obviously<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
game well tactics obviously is like the

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.960 
game well tactics obviously is like the
strategy<00:03:50.130> final<00:03:50.250> fantasy<00:03:50.670> where<00:03:50.760> you're<00:03:50.880> on<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
strategy final fantasy where you're on a

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.760 
strategy final fantasy where you're on a
grid<00:03:51.240> taking<00:03:51.630> turns<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:52.110> mean<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.320> this<00:03:52.530> is

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
grid taking turns I mean this this is

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.320 
grid taking turns I mean this this is
not<00:03:52.890> turn<00:03:53.130> base<00:03:53.370> like<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.820> or<00:03:54.030> any<00:03:54.210> other

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
not turn base like that or any other

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.050 
not turn base like that or any other
final<00:03:54.600> fantasy<00:03:54.990> it's<00:03:55.110> all<00:03:55.350> real<00:03:55.650> time<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.580> it's

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
final fantasy it's all real time so it's

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.700 
final fantasy it's all real time so it's
actually<00:03:57.330> kind<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.510> like<00:03:57.660> maybe<00:03:57.870> closer<00:03:58.620> to

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710
