have canticle figures or you know

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.990 
have canticle figures or you know
there's<00:02:04.770> also<00:02:04.950> hammock<00:02:05.520> problems<00:02:05.850> wind

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000

and particularly the engines another to

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.550 
and particularly the engines another to
750<00:03:01.060> Norton<00:03:01.329> engines<00:03:01.599> which<00:03:01.810> are<00:03:01.989> made<00:03:02.379> over

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
750 Norton engines which are made over

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.140 
750 Norton engines which are made over
here<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.799> Britain<00:03:03.099> and<00:03:03.700> they're<00:03:03.879> running

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
here in Britain and they're running

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.750 
here in Britain and they're running
about<00:03:04.239> 150<00:03:04.840> horse<00:03:05.019> apiece<00:03:05.349> was<00:03:05.650> probably<00:03:06.340> 300

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
about 150 horse apiece was probably 300

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.089 
about 150 horse apiece was probably 300
horse<00:03:06.879> between<00:03:07.239> them<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.650> chassis<00:03:08.920> is

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
horse between them and the chassis is

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.129 
horse between them and the chassis is
approximately<00:03:09.579> nine<00:03:09.760> foot<00:03:10.060> long<00:03:10.269> two<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.049> a

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
approximately nine foot long two and a

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:12.990 
approximately nine foot long two and a
half<00:03:11.260> foot<00:03:11.439> high<00:03:11.620> using<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.609> two-speed

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
half foot high using a two-speed

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.599 
half foot high using a two-speed
automatic<00:03:13.030> type<00:03:13.569> transmission<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.319> it<00:03:14.609> the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
automatic type transmission in it the

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.039 
automatic type transmission in it the
idea<00:03:15.909> with<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.120> length<00:03:16.329> is<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:16.659> got<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:16.930> much

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
idea with the length is it's got so much

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.990 
idea with the length is it's got so much
horsepower<00:03:17.469> in<00:03:17.590> traction<00:03:17.889> it<00:03:18.159> if<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.459> was<00:03:18.849> any

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
horsepower in traction it if it was any

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.699 
horsepower in traction it if it was any
short<00:03:19.329> at<00:03:19.420> all<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:19.780> has<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.959> tendency<00:03:20.379> to<00:03:20.500> do

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
short at all just has a tendency to do

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.220 
short at all just has a tendency to do
wheel<00:03:20.920> stands<00:03:21.250> instead<00:03:21.670> of<00:03:21.730> accelerate<00:03:22.230> so

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
wheel stands instead of accelerate so

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.119 
wheel stands instead of accelerate so
that's<00:03:23.379> why<00:03:23.500> we<00:03:23.650> made<00:03:23.829> this<00:03:23.919> machine

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
that's why we made this machine

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:25.710 
that's why we made this machine
exceptionally<00:03:24.790> long<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.359> probably<00:03:25.629> the

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
exceptionally long it's probably the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.839 
exceptionally long it's probably the
longest<00:03:25.870> one's<00:03:26.139> ever<00:03:26.290> built<00:03:26.560> mm-hmm<00:03:27.189> it's<00:03:27.669> bit

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
longest one's ever built mm-hmm it's bit

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.580 
longest one's ever built mm-hmm it's bit

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
the thing is I like to travel I like to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500 
the thing is I like to travel I like to
race<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:50.859> I<00:03:51.040> got<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.340> do<00:03:51.400> what<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.579> got<00:03:51.609> to<00:03:51.760> do<00:03:51.939> you

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
know some people play golf less exciting

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.170 
know some people play golf less exciting
I<00:03:56.530> think<00:03:56.560> but<00:03:56.979> something<00:03:57.579> I<00:03:57.609> like<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.879> do<00:03:58.000> is<00:03:58.150> a

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
I think but something I like to do is a

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.909 
I think but something I like to do is a
race<00:03:58.599> and<00:03:58.810> go<00:03:58.870> fast<00:03:59.169> no<00:03:59.379> we're<00:03:59.560> doing<00:03:59.739> it<00:03:59.829> out

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
race and go fast no we're doing it out

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.050 
race and go fast no we're doing it out
there<00:03:59.949> local<00:04:00.579> tracks

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
there local tracks

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.090 
there local tracks
fancy<00:04:02.750> flying<00:04:02.930> over<00:04:03.200> Canyon<00:04:03.530> sometime<00:04:03.920> I

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
fancy flying over Canyon sometime I

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.490 
fancy flying over Canyon sometime I
don't<00:04:04.790> think<00:04:04.850> so<00:04:05.120> we<00:04:05.930> say<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.140> for<00:04:06.380> the

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
don't think so we say that for the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.920 
don't think so we say that for the
people
