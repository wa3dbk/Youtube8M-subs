00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.169
 Hello 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.780
 I want to show you with this video 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.540
 as you with a printed t shirts 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.550
 for example with a yellow t-shirt 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.279
 a jacket beautify cologne or too 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.349
 a sweater if you want 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.400
 the nice thing is that it 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.140
 printed t shirts and ribbon t shirts 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.730
 pretty much there and that on me like that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.349
 are expensive jackets or pullovers 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.480
 of course a little bit more and that's why 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.370
 Of course it is very nice that I do that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.530
 can do it yourself and then you have 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.240
 Of course, something we do not update 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 the idea is not quite in front of me 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.540
 New I once made the jacket 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.550
 when I was 1516 I would rather not ask 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.140
 was different and that's why I'm in 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.390
 Just explain this video to you like it 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.160
 but also goes step by step and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.930
 hope that first gets there anyway 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.240
 of course you can in the comments 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.939
 I ask you questions then 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.090
 to help if you have somewhere 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:14.429
 Show you jacket even more 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:19.310
 photos that is a denim jacket and me 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:23.180
 ' ve sewn a good part shirt and 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.840
 yes as I said I am too 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.630
 yes, you can see a lot at the moment 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.630
 very bad colo was next to the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.020
 square picture printed on it is me 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.310
 But I also find it already charging and 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.650
 maybe even with the thread of it too 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.360
 a different color than the company and 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.940
 the t-shirt that was super nice 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:50.390
 look like that so now I just me 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:02:01.100
 need indeed given me so be it 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:02:08.020
 as I said only works so me 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:11.660
 I have a t-shirt here with an imprint 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:16.520
 if you have a year and 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.489
 faster wedges or you can yes 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.950
 Do not help or if you 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.900
 says you have a good judgment there 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.440
 i could just marl out of that i would 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.720
 now has such a gap of 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.700
 let about three inches to the pressure 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.209
 and then here with the tailor parts 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.209
 go long and do it all around 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.239
 cut out 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.870
 next, I think that's easy now 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.870
 too much 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.260
 optimal but I think you can 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.260
 to imagine that anyway 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:16.109
 inside on the right side you see 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:23.280
 Of course , we'll see each other like that later 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:29.669
 lie around now I'm with me 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:34.919
 Pin the t-shirt and that 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:38.060
 on around yes here everywhere 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:41.370
 pin takes as many as you can 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.060
 the denim jacket is solid and the t-shirt 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:49.760
 It is easier for you 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.590
 and then you need one 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.540
 Extra name earning is very hard on 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.620
 we are just taking revenge on the needle without it 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.959
 discovered that 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.780
 worried by a bit of a pity 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:06.409
 thank you the jeans needle thank you all 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.909
 normal straight outfit just once 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.739
 around 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:14.099
 do not forget to seal the ducks 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:18.660
 So to take back and forth and only 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:21.030
 then I would turn and you will see 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.690
 yes on the back the square what you 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.400
 have chosen and I would 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.620
 just cutting it out would be like that 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.900
 a centimeter and let's understand 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.520
 next to the market if you know about it 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.380
 just in the end also have to go out 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.090
 I did not want to catch that 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.810
 So solves centimeter but had 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.810
 really rich 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.350
 Yes and 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.510

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.430
