him<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.740> he<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:20.040> get<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.310> work<00:02:20.460> on<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> shot

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
him so he can get to work on the shot

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
when he dips the leg and turns that's

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.000 
when he dips the leg and turns that's
where<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.780> force<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.200> power<00:02:25.440> comes<00:02:25.830> in

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
where the force of the power comes in

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.600 
where the force of the power comes in
and<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.970> see<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.210> guy<00:02:27.450> back<00:02:27.750> off<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.290> them<00:02:28.410> and

and you see a guy back off of them and

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.160 
and you see a guy back off of them and
this<00:02:29.610> would<00:02:29.850> break<00:02:30.090> his<00:02:30.270> opponent<00:02:30.780> down<00:02:32.030> now

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
this would break his opponent down now

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.600 
this would break his opponent down now
