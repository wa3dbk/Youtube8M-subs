that will be scooped out towards the
bottom<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.159> go<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.549> much<00:01:38.939> later

long<00:02:13.849> shank<00:02:14.239> nothing<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.440> table<00:02:15.620> or<00:02:16.069> it

long shank nothing on the table or it

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.369 
long shank nothing on the table or it
could<00:02:16.700> be<00:02:16.819> because<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.209> was<00:02:17.330> reef<00:02:17.540> aced<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.110> as

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
could be because it was reef aced and as

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.070 
could be because it was reef aced and as
they<00:02:18.650> pull<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.610> along<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:20.000> sandpaper<00:02:20.420> you

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
they pull it along the sandpaper you

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.039 
they pull it along the sandpaper you
know<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:22.549> soloist<00:02:23.209> stamp<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:23.659> sometimes

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
know that soloist stamp can sometimes

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.690 
know that soloist stamp can sometimes
come<00:02:24.290> away<00:02:24.500> if<00:02:24.680> they<00:02:24.830> really<00:02:25.069> reef<00:02:25.310> aced<00:02:25.549> it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
come away if they really reef aced it

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.089 
come away if they really reef aced it
hard<00:02:25.909> but<00:02:26.840> usually<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.290> should<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.860> able<00:02:27.950> to

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
hard but usually you should be able to

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.979 
hard but usually you should be able to
see<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.599> more<00:02:29.780> recent

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
see that so this is a more recent

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.320 
see that so this is a more recent
version<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.769> as<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.489> can<00:02:31.580> see<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.970> chamber

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
version and as you can see the chamber

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.390 
version and as you can see the chamber
is<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.420> little<00:02:32.629> bit<00:02:32.720> different<00:02:33.080> or<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:34.190> throw

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
is a little bit different or the throw

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.800 
is a little bit different or the throw
it's<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.580> little<00:02:34.760> bit<00:02:34.879> different<00:02:35.060> there's<00:02:35.599> much

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
it's a little bit different there's much

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.539 
it's a little bit different there's much
more<00:02:35.989> material<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.890> bottom<00:02:37.010> there<00:02:37.370> and

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
more material on the bottom there and

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.600 
more material on the bottom there and
that's<00:02:38.060> actually<00:02:38.330> how<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:38.930> mold<00:02:39.500> was<00:02:40.040> made

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
that's actually how the mold was made

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.759 
that's actually how the mold was made
it's<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.959> they<00:02:42.140> spent<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.530> little<00:02:42.620> bit

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
it's just that they spent a little bit

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.770 
it's just that they spent a little bit
less<00:02:43.040> time<00:02:43.280> hand<00:02:43.640> finishing<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.299> later<00:02:44.510> ones

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
less time hand finishing the later ones

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.619 
less time hand finishing the later ones
and<00:02:45.379> they<00:02:45.470> didn't<00:02:45.709> scoop<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.129> out<00:02:46.629> whereas

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
and they didn't scoop that out whereas

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.099 
and they didn't scoop that out whereas
on<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.110> earlier<00:02:48.470> ones<00:02:49.629> you<00:02:50.629> can<00:02:50.780> see<00:02:50.930> that

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
on the earlier ones you can see that

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.360 
on the earlier ones you can see that
that's<00:02:51.260> much<00:02:51.500> more<00:02:51.739> scooped<00:02:52.099> out<00:02:54.280> there's<00:02:55.280> a

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
that's much more scooped out there's a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.039 
that's much more scooped out there's a
different<00:02:55.670> one<00:02:55.760> again<00:02:56.030> this<00:02:56.569> one's<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.840> little

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
different one again this one's a little

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.259 
different one again this one's a little
bit<00:02:57.170> less<00:02:57.349> scooped<00:02:57.650> out<00:02:57.829> this<00:02:58.819> is<00:02:59.000> still<00:02:59.239> a

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
bit less scooped out this is still a

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.110 
bit less scooped out this is still a
short<00:02:59.810> shank<00:03:00.079> so<00:03:00.410> lovest<00:03:00.680> but<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.849> can<00:03:01.970> see

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
short shank so lovest but you can see

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.630 
short shank so lovest but you can see
this<00:03:02.239> one's<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.540> little<00:03:02.660> bit<00:03:02.870> less<00:03:03.079> scooped<00:03:03.410> out

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
this one's a little bit less scooped out

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.170 
this one's a little bit less scooped out
than<00:03:04.640> this<00:03:05.359> one<00:03:06.190> now<00:03:07.190> probably<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:07.730> was<00:03:07.879> just

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
than this one now probably that was just

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.880 
than this one now probably that was just
because<00:03:08.510> whoever<00:03:09.140> was<00:03:09.290> working<00:03:09.410> on<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:09.859> that

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
because whoever was working on it that

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.199 
because whoever was working on it that
it's<00:03:10.190> slightly<00:03:10.400> different<00:03:10.730> because<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.120> was

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
it's slightly different because it was

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.170 
it's slightly different because it was
done<00:03:11.359> by<00:03:11.510> hand<00:03:12.220> here<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.400> long<00:03:13.790> shank

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
done by hand here is a long shank

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
say soloist on it and you can see that

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.940 
say soloist on it and you can see that
one<00:03:20.389> is<00:03:20.480> also<00:03:20.780> not<00:03:20.959> scooped<00:03:21.319> out<00:03:21.440> towards<00:03:21.829> the

would probably be this act just a
