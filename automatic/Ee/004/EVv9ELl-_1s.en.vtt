00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
you're not going to put up call to the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.290 
you're not going to put up call to the
types<00:02:22.629> force<00:02:22.900> which<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.260> dealt<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:23.890> game

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
but the actions pretty quick paced

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.160

you're gonna like this game or not

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.120 
you're gonna like this game or not
because<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.140> be<00:02:48.260> honest<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.740> didn't<00:02:49.070> really

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
because to be honest I didn't really

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.010 
because to be honest I didn't really
like<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.460> at<00:02:49.670> first<00:02:49.700> it's<00:02:50.240> definitely<00:02:50.930> an

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
like it at first it's definitely an

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.500 
like it at first it's definitely an
adjustment<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:52.730> would<00:02:52.880> say<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.300> best

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
adjustment and I would say that the best

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.570 
adjustment and I would say that the best
thing<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:53.900> did<00:02:53.990> was<00:02:54.230> get<00:02:54.800> everything<00:02:55.310> call

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
thing that I did was get everything call

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.200 
thing that I did was get everything call
of<00:02:55.730> duty<00:02:56.030> out<00:02:56.330> of<00:02:56.840> my<00:02:57.050> head<00:02:57.820> this<00:02:58.820> game<00:02:59.030> really

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
of duty out of my head this game really

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.880 
of duty out of my head this game really
doesn't<00:02:59.630> play<00:02:59.750> that<00:02:59.960> much<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:00.290> call<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.590> duty

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
doesn't play that much like call of duty

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.230 
doesn't play that much like call of duty
I<00:03:01.300> mean<00:03:02.300> it's<00:03:02.600> different<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.620> lot<00:03:03.890> of

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
secondary pistol the small rocket

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.620 
secondary pistol the small rocket
launcher<00:03:50.120> which<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:50.720> just<00:03:51.380> as<00:03:51.530> good<00:03:51.680> see<00:03:51.920> RPG

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
launcher which is just as good see RPG

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.170 
launcher which is just as good see RPG
and<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:54.290> think<00:03:54.530> mine<00:03:54.710> it's<00:03:55.460> like<00:03:55.610> a<00:03:55.640> proficiency

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
and I think mine it's like a proficiency

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.360 
and I think mine it's like a proficiency
I<00:03:56.300> guess<00:03:56.600> is<00:03:56.810> sprint<00:03:57.260> allows<00:03:57.800> me<00:03:57.950> just<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.190> run

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
I guess is sprint allows me just to run

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.150 
I guess is sprint allows me just to run
a<00:03:58.400> little<00:03:58.550> bit<00:03:58.730> quicker

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.070 

and<00:04:01.370> this<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:01.910> pretty<00:04:02.060> much<00:04:02.150> my<00:04:02.270> primary<00:04:02.870> go<00:04:03.020> to

and this is pretty much my primary go to

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.840 
and this is pretty much my primary go to
set<00:04:03.410> up<00:04:03.500> for<00:04:03.650> now<00:04:03.770> I've<00:04:04.070> been<00:04:04.280> told<00:04:04.460> that<00:04:04.700> a<00:04:04.760> lot

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850
