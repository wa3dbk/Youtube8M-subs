Micro Four Thirds lens I have I don't

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.670 
Micro Four Thirds lens I have I don't
know<00:00:18.390> five<00:00:18.660> or<00:00:18.840> six<00:00:19.080> Micro<00:00:19.470> Four<00:00:19.650> Thirds

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
know five or six Micro Four Thirds

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.340 
know five or six Micro Four Thirds
lenses<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:21.480> all<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.810> them<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
lenses and of all of them this is the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.340 
lenses and of all of them this is the
one<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.830> use<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.519> most<00:00:24.109> part<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.199> that's

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
one that I use the most part of that's

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.320 
one that I use the most part of that's
just<00:00:25.470> because<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.099> focal<00:00:26.460> length<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.849> 45

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
just because the focal length at 45

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.230 
just because the focal length at 45
millimeters<00:00:27.930> suits<00:00:28.680> me<00:00:28.859> quite<00:00:28.890> well<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.670> as

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
millimeters suits me quite well but as

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
this is what I bought and it's kind of

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.809 
this is what I bought and it's kind of
spoiled<00:02:16.110> me<00:02:16.230> because<00:02:16.500> now<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.769> expect<00:02:17.220> every

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
spoiled me because now I expect every

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.880 
spoiled me because now I expect every
lens<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.390> autofocus<00:02:18.870> as<00:02:19.260> quickly<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:19.709> this

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
lens to autofocus as quickly as this

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.309 
lens to autofocus as quickly as this
does<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.310> they<00:02:20.760> don't<00:02:20.940> all<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.209> mean<00:02:21.510> most

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
does and they don't all I mean most

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.530 
does and they don't all I mean most
lenses<00:02:22.709> on<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.860> system<00:02:23.220> focus<00:02:23.610> quick<00:02:24.299> enough

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
lenses on the system focus quick enough

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.410 
lenses on the system focus quick enough
right<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.379> this<00:02:25.560> thing<00:02:25.799> is<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.430> incredibly

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
right but this thing is just incredibly

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.949 
right but this thing is just incredibly
fast

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
fast

now<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> snappy<00:02:28.709> autofocus<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.519> really

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
now the snappy autofocus is really

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.240 
now the snappy autofocus is really
useful<00:02:30.360> when<00:02:30.569> you're<00:02:31.440> trying<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.830> photograph

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
fast autofocus and this lens is just

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.309 
fast autofocus and this lens is just
ridiculous<00:02:44.610> another<00:02:45.390> great<00:02:45.569> characteristic

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
ridiculous another great characteristic

ridiculous another great characteristic
of<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.590> lens<00:02:46.829> is<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.549> doesn't<00:02:48.030> flare

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
of this lens is that it doesn't flare

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.110 
of this lens is that it doesn't flare
really<00:02:49.260> at<00:02:49.379> all<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:50.069> can<00:02:50.250> kind<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.459> point<00:02:50.970> it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
really at all you can kind of point it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.080 
really at all you can kind of point it
directly<00:02:51.269> at<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.870> Sun<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:53.190> where<00:02:53.640> some<00:02:53.940> other

directly at the Sun and where some other

lenses are going to give you a little
flare<00:02:55.650> right<00:02:55.920> maybe<00:02:56.220> it's<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:57.510> spot<00:02:58.140> of

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
flare right maybe it's just a spot of

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.170 
flare right maybe it's just a spot of
green<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.829> corner<00:02:59.190> or<00:02:59.310> something<00:02:59.760> this

don't<00:03:02.040> know<00:03:02.700> exactly<00:03:02.879> how<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.480> does<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.870> but

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
don't know exactly how it does it but

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.740 
don't know exactly how it does it but
you<00:03:04.859> can<00:03:05.010> point<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:05.430> lens<00:03:05.700> directly<00:03:06.569> at<00:03:06.660> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620

for<00:03:58.769> me<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.069> tend<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.519> shoot<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.970> little

for me I tend to shoot a little
telephoto<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.379> feel<00:04:01.980> like<00:04:02.099> most<00:04:02.250> people<00:04:02.400> are

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
telephoto I feel like most people are

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.430 
telephoto I feel like most people are
used<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.090> shooting<00:04:03.389> wide-angle<00:04:04.139> right<00:04:04.319> if

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
used to shooting wide-angle right if

focal length of roughly 17 millimeters

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
versus this 45 millimeters right so you

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.650
