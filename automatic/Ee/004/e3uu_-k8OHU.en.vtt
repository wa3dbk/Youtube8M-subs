00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000

greenlit so I went back to my
screenwriting<00:03:21.540> technique<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.500> kind<00:03:22.739> of

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
screenwriting technique and I kind of

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.190 
screenwriting technique and I kind of
realized<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.790> needed<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.690> have<00:03:24.840> more<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:25.140> a

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
realized that I needed to have more of a

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.650 
realized that I needed to have more of a
story<00:03:25.500> screenwriting<00:03:26.459> wasn't<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.420> bad

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
story screenwriting wasn't that bad

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.630 
story screenwriting wasn't that bad
basically<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.290> had<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.560> keep<00:03:28.709> writing<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.519> and

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
basically I had to keep writing it and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.280 
basically I had to keep writing it and
then<00:03:29.760> rewriting<00:03:30.120> writing<00:03:30.690> rewriting<00:03:30.870> it's

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
then rewriting writing rewriting it's

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.660 
then rewriting writing rewriting it's
really<00:03:31.560> really<00:03:31.769> helpful<00:03:32.010> because<00:03:32.160> when<00:03:32.549> we
