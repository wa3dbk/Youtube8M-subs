00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello to all we are still on 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.290
 the vincennes racecourse Saturday for the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.480
 quinté 5.5 this will be the oscar prize at 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.490
 dollar a test that brought together 17 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.000
 departing on the 2100 meters from the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.890
 great track 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.109
 and in this event I advise you 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.910
 as a favorite the number 8 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.439
 minor rocchi of a Scandinavian trotter 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.630
 who has just won 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.789
 precisely on this same 2100 course 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.769
 meters from the big track it was in 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.630
 the boissy holy light price that will be 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.059
 the reference race then as you 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.579
 can see it in the picture 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.200
 currently the horse he was leading 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.570
 had also quickly taken 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.520
 orders of the test and had shown himself 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.600
 brave to resist all 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.710
 attacks you have to know that he had 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.750
 still against and some attacks 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.000
 in the course and resist to finish at 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.160
 a prince and urgent who will run this 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.140
 quinté we are so happy that one hour 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.469
 who are needed for his debut in France 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.789
 the horse is esteemed by his entourage 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.809
 his entourage who also 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.579
 double the amount 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.799
 note that I'm doing there number 8 may 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.240
 it was already the case last so 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.970
 to pray all fires are green 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.189
 I oppose him the number 11 ultimate of 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.930
 rib who just won with a certain 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.750
 brio and on a course of holding 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.890
 then the disadvantage to ultimately be the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.600
 rib is that the horse is not 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.520
 confirmed on short distances 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.530
 he has no reference on 2100 meters 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.220
 who will leave on the second line with the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.890
 number 11 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.610
 but considering the way this horse 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.650
 has just won 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.710
 he seems able to continue on his 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.970
 launched the number 6 e ur kid I you in 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.680
 spoke earlier this is a 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.150
 resident of jean michel bazire who 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.869
 ranked third in the event 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.840
 reference 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.490
 it will be better on 2100 meters because it 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.930
 just disappointed in the small yard 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.820
 to put rhythm but it is necessary to take again 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.310
 especially as the horse has benefited from 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.700
 good number the number 6 in the fourth 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.259
 position I placed alas who will be safe 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.390
 and there is a stable companion 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.700
 urgently she just got ready 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.829
 in and referred this time the mare 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.719
 going to be straightened from the four feet to himself 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.310
 also fold on this course of 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.990
 speed it's a good chance so much 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.020
 that with that it will be able to benefit from a 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.129
 good run inside then the number 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.450
 14 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.290
 conway to the strong one is a horse 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.969
 driven to the Netherlands 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.680
 a lot of awards because it counts 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.019
 many victories and there especially 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.640
 to cross iron with wbo lync a choice 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.680
 that knows well that while in France 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.200
 fortune core has also run already in 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.840
 france he had finished 3rd of a 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.519
 great price battery to remove him it was 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.049
 in the month of September the horse was not 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.459
 been very happy in the course this 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.090
 day there but it is well done at the 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.540
 third place 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.159
 so despite his number 14 in second I 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.260
 trust him as number 15 e 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.000
 red raid raid just signed a beautiful 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.540
 the second place behind vagabond of 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.489
 mag body entrusted to Eric raffin in one 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.530
 finally place the number of cu dean a 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.970
 resident of jean pierre dubois who has 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.780
 certainly disappointed in the price of 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.340
 boissy-saint-light 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.349
 but that day from jos verbeeck who him 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.030
 was associated will not give the 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.799
 best of course this time with the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.480
 number 2 we can count on jean biart 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.609
 wood to give it a good path 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.750
 inside and why why not 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.540
 take a place at the end of the combination 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.819
 as for number 13 had the trad and 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.680
 sweet that just imposed on the 2100 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.079
 meters so certainly the lot was a little 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.970
 lower than Saturday but as 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.590
 the horse is in great shape he can 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.819
 no doubt still take a place to 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.409
 provided, however, that they can 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.169
 to benefit from a good hidden route is 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.150
 an imperative with him then I you 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.760
 advise to take in two out of four 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.530
 the 8th and the eleven who are put basic and 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.430
 if you want to be tempted by 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.349
 a multi with the 8 on the 11 the 6 and finally 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.250
 her associates but hot behind 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.250
 here we were playing at all
