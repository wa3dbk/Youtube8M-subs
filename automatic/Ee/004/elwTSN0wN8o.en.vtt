00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
the way that I'm wrapping everything I'm

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.820 
the way that I'm wrapping everything I'm
stacking<00:05:23.330> everything<00:05:23.419> toward<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.020> center<00:05:24.380> so

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
stacking everything toward the center so

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.120 
stacking everything toward the center so
that<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:25.039> edges<00:05:25.520> are<00:05:25.639> easier<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.120> curl<00:05:26.539> around

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
that the edges are easier to curl around

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.560 
that the edges are easier to curl around
all<00:05:28.130> right<00:05:28.370> so<00:05:28.520> maybe<00:05:28.669> I<00:05:28.850> should<00:05:28.940> change<00:05:29.360> the

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
all right so maybe I should change the

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.390 
all right so maybe I should change the
name<00:05:29.600> with<00:05:29.900> this<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.199> the<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.590> monster

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400
