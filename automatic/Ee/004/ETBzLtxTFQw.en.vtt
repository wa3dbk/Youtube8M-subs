00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:06.129
 hi we cook eggs today, what you need 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.460
 know first of all 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:12.160
 when you brought eggs from their store 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.980
 rinse thoroughly with a brush or 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 sponge include warm water and sponge 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.560
 neatly my freeing the eggs from 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.390
 all kinds of dirt and what's on them 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.340
 stuck 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.460
 keep eggs in the fridge separately 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.960
 all products in a special compartment 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.600
 to boil eggs we have to put 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.819
 their cold water so that water 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.159
 completely covered them now turn on 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:37.960
 bring the stove to a boil and remove 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.609
 temperature on the middle so the eggs don't 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.679
 jumped not broken during cooking 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.809
 continue to cook them on moderate heat 3 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:46.089
 minutes to a state 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.850
 five minutes to a hard-boiled but 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.339
 the yolk will be slightly soft and 10 minutes 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.229
 to cool when the yolk 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.479
 completely hardens with quail eggs 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.549
 all the same, just because they are 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.799
 small cook until cooked them all 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:02.379
 only 3 minutes eggs cool under 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:05.289
 about 4 cold running water 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.869
 minutes so that we can easily move away 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.280
 husk digested 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.920
 I cleaned the eggs now look 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.750
 consistency that is but kinda like on 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.350
 touch it is clear that this is softer 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.799
 she is 3 muddy in this and a little tougher 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.640
 I think it's five minutes, but 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.990
 it's straight the hardest ten-minute 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.469
 lepillin to her eggs and the same time 3 minutes 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.869
 as I said cut look see 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.119
 the yolk curled that is quail 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.329
 the eggs are ready 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.240
 3 minutes we cut the yolk with us 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.909
 turned out liquid though here in that place 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.340
 where it fits its shell a little bit 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.909
 I was fed well, nothing scary next 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.429
 five-minute yolk cooked all but he 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.040
 gentle not hard see it a little bit 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.650
 rolls up and 10 minutes to 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.030
 cut here completely fallen down 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.120
 the yolk that is now clearly shows that 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.910
 here we smyatku three minutes here 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.840
 we have a hard boiled five minutes and here we have to 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.380
 full readiness 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.450
 and we do not see the rim that is, if 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.580
 face overcooked rim u creepy 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.220
 turns blue you met this 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.210
 probably more than once and I almost forgot 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.800
 quail eggs 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.220
 if you want to use quail 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.000
 with the old I will show how to clean it 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.790
 neatly 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.240
 thumbnail remove the tip 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.370
 make a hole and pour out the testicle all very 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.030
 just hope my advice comes in handy 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.110
 your kitchen 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.110
