00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.809
 Hello with you android android today 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.240
 wanted to talk about hardcore wounds 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.889
 Ricotta is called that armor is already in the game 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.199
 There are two modes is a classic 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.240
 mode and rushen mode let's start by 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.300
 order order of order from 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.710
 classic mode and press and 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.680
 let's build it different from that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.140
 mode when run 2 same 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.529
 In this mode, what is the difference? I already 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.750
 played here as soon as we crash into 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.079
 any pillars start from the very beginning 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.920
 this 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.840
 finding a hardcore mode is nothing more than the one in the game 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.450
 will come so interesting enough 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.940
 Music I like such men even 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 e run it say it one by one 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.969
 planes and trying to survive i'm a lot 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.160
 runners played it quite complicated 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.820
 because you can screw up almost 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.309
 at the very beginning here I have finally 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.430
 It turns out well to accelerate 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.339
 and here in this mode just run 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.040
 tanks can be further on the second mode 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.680
 it is easier and more interesting to have the type of medication 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.869
 us from above is going time ago 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.119
 during this time we have to run to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.040
 certain points drag but when 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.869
 colliding with these figures here we are 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.720
 do not undress you just slow down 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.180
 so you need very few times 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.549
 slow down to bump so we 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.780
 were able to reach the desired point I 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.960
 ran to the first point 8 stop so 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.759
 so so so it turns out this 6543 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.369
 but I could not escape and I 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.409
 starts very cool 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.290
 Interesting earlier, let's about the pros 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.259
 minus well i ka such unusual graphics 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.860
 yes all engine moves 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.729
 myself though I carry the genre myself 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.890
 And this is at the runner, he is normal to cool 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.840
 music convenient control and here 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.060
 complexity is of course hardcore with especially 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.340
 in the previous mode which I tell you 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.250
 showed octopus get where 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.450
 to run 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.570
 to the desired point, I will show you so 3 2 1 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.790
 Here and in fact I ran and changed the world's 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.830
 these figure don't get blue 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.050
 we will not find colors for a change 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.940
 do so developers and I will put 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.590
 currently a four with a plus because 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.750
 what i like a graphic 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.150
 the design of this game is enough 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.459
 everything just implemented with you was 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.950
 android android 4 only the best 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.310
 games that I advise you to everyone until 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.310
 see you soon
