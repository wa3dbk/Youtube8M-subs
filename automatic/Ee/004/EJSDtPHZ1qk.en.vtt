00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.400
 Naval Academy 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.130
 Hello, Captains! 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.930
 We have already seen how to control aircraft carriers in World of Warships. 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.360
 Today we will talk about different types of aircraft and their effective use in battle. 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.850
 The game includes four types of aircraft. 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.240
 Reconnaissance aircraft are on board battleships and cruisers. 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.970
 Fighter aircraft are designed to fight enemy airplanes, 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.830
 while torpedo and dive bombers are offensive types of aircraft 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.250
 designed to attack enemy ships. 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.510
 Reconnaissance aircraft are the eyes of battleships and cruisers, 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.300
 increase their surveillance. 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.130
 Press the T key to launch the reconnaissance aircraft. 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.420
 The reconnaissance aircraft will take off and circulate above your ship. 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.590
 It is very useful for uncovering ships 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.180
 with a high level of camouflage or approaching torpedoes. 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.760
 After the reconnaissance aircraft consumes all fuel, 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.590
 he will return automatically to the ship for refilling. 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.920
 Once refueled, it can take off again. 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.060
 Like other aircraft in the game 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.160
 Even a reconnaissance aircraft can be destroyed by enemy fighter aircraft or gunfire. 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.060
 The main task of fighter aircraft is to protect allied ships 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.790
 and destroying enemy attack torpedo and dive bombers. 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.970
 If an attacking squadron fights with fighters, it loses speed and accuracy. 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.120
 This means that even if you fail to destroy the entire squadron, 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 your attack will increase the dispersion of dropped bombs and torpedoes 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.690
 which will help the allied ship avoid attack or suffer minor damage. 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.920
 Another important task of fighter aircraft 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.270
 is defending your own offensive squadrons against enemy fighters. 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.080
 Remember that in the duel of two fighter squadrons, the one that is on the higher level always wins. 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080
 think about it 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.720
 and try to launch enemy aircraft in effective range 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.430
 allied anti-aircraft guns. 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.760
 Fighter aircraft are also usable as reconnaissance aircraft. 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.180
 Torpedo bombers are the main attack force of aircraft carriers. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.080
 Their sight looks like a circle with a green section of torpedo scattering. 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.680
 The best way to maximize the effectiveness of torpedo attacks is to attack enemy ships. 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.760
 However, your opponent will try to make a bow or stern in your volley. 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.680
 Therefore, a focus correction should be made. 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.810
 This is done by moving the attack direction indicator. 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.640
 Another thing to watch out for is landscape, 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.480
 respectively the islands that can hinder your torpedoes. 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.240
 A successful torpedo attack will not only damage the ship, but will also cause the ship to float - 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.300
 the enemy ship will lose, for a period of time from intervention, points of endurance. 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.740
 Remember, small and fast ships will easily torpedo your torpedoes. 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.890
 Priority targets for torpedo bombers are aircraft and battleships. 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.220
 Attacking a ship that is "eating" anti-aircraft guns will only result in huge losses on aircraft. 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.200
 It is quite a good idea to send several assault squadrons at once against such ships. 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.280
 Seasoned players prefer a "regional attack". 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.570
 Press and hold the ALT key to switch to the sight mode. 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.980
 Now you can throw away torpedoes anywhere on the map. 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.600
 This mode gives you the advantage of less variance 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.020
 and the ability to attack from a smaller distance 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.930
 which causes the enemy to avoid dodging. 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.180
 On the other hand, you have to guess hanging yourself. 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.080
 If you drop the torpedoes over the island, they just fall to the ground. 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.450
 When the distance from the drop point to the enemy is too short, 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.420
 the detonator fails to activate and the torpedoes do not explode when in contact with the target. 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.840
 Another effective trick is to get the enemy as if it were between two millstones. 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.680
 Increase your chance to hit the enemy by 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.150
 that you will also attack two squadrons of torpedo bombers flying to each other at an angle of 90 degrees. 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.900
 Once the enemy tries to dodge one volley, 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.950
 goes to the other. 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.220
 The sighting bombers look different. 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.960
 It has a similar ring as a sight for torpedo planes, 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.240
 but the bomb impact area is marked by a light green oval. 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.130
 This type of aircraft has the advantage of attacking from the front or rear, 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.690
 when the chances of hitting the enemy increase. 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.590
 Be careful while you measure your attack 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.030
 your opponent can dodge your bombs. 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.060
 The bombs damage the target with an explosion and can even light the opponent. 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.340
 You can improve the effectiveness of your ship's attacks and 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.400
 to install additional equipment available in the Port. 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.870
 So look forward to the next chapter to learn more.
