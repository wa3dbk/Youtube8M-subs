 Let's start by doing a training 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.289
 the price of gps 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:10.779
 power cables 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.749
 you save some important information you need to know 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.430
 weak passing of sellers 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.730
 said that customers 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.739
 increasingly angry 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.289
 let time pass details 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.749
 which are key when it comes to effecting 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.259
 first thing 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.919
 if you get a GPS 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.019
 you press an unsecured top button for a few seconds 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.280
 I think she'll be concentrating on winning the game on Tuesday 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.560
 I stopped believing that we have to leave with digital tv we exceeded the goal 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.680
 is to stop justifying the use of technology 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.030
 in this interval the main partner of the match 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.400
 navigation 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.260
 d in the last language or coupled with videos other than digital tv 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.820
 from the justice in the case and the defense settings 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.810
 from the game the e-book kindle cables and why digital book that people 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.310
 manages books on the gps itself 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.770

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.580
 our main focus of training today 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.530
 in housing 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.590
 I will explain navigation 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.130
 initializing current situation of our GPS 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.369
 personnel stands out is the one that initially 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.810
 silver using gps 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.149
 we'll click here on the locate button 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.820
 what we are looking for a route to address or is now you will see 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.340
 seek what he seeks from them 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.110
 I'll look for the address 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.230
 super known to everyone 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.600
 I'm going to search any São Paulo avenue. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 I'm only going to come back here just so you can check 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.189
 I'll fight and come back here. 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.189
 here you can check the kilo 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.390
 the city 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.630
 and the street 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.630
 in the case of the street I'll put 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.849
 avenida paulista 1 to 1 in the game 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.129
 avenue 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.939
 I'm going to make space on the team. 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.939
 I'm going to put Paulist 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.039
 the comedian 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.359
 Lula concludes it 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.359
 it goes to pressure the list dilutes blood 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.989
 because avenida paulista he already knew which name 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.099
 let's use the name a 2 3 4 5 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.889
 in this case bpn showing that 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.499
 along this street 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:51.489
 What I directed Friday however should be creamy even for me 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.620
 the gas stations here are coming here too 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.679
 the fortnight of the right part 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.599
 He told me I really want to 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.599
 stay on this route I put here define as 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.979
 automatically it will calculate the route 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:13.599
 of the group that we are until the little that we determined education 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.119
 the Paulista avenue 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.679
 I played him and he'll start doing 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.879
 this route for us 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.489
 But just as we are doing a year training, we are on the street. 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.440
 we need 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.529
 headlines 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:27.839
 for you to check how it works 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:31.619
 in the case that we do the positioning that he was in the street of the small floodplain 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.099
 news 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.929
 here you can see it already shows the direction how many meters in the 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:39.609
 speed case 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.869
 how is it a gps signal and how does the battery charge 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.909
 here I can have a vision 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.909
 I mentioned bugres see how productivity 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.049
 here is a 3d vision 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.729
 I can see 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.499
 I got it 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:56.160
 the peugeot frames speck 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.980
 all kinds of gasoline will fall 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.279
 pulling the check for me 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:03.209
 here in the case of 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.529
 the government 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.639
 3d is idiot 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.369
 stephane peterhansel tax shows us 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.219
 the plunge of latin america 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:12.329
 that's why it matters 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.930
 we need to stimulate the route 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.709
 the process begins to learn a lot from the client 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.959
 in a simple and easy way 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.080
 Let's go on the menu in case of St. John of the Road 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.309
 after four games 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:30.300
 our education the simulated dared to air in the case of the simulated 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.420
 What are we going to have? 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.650
 that voice command with that recording inside it 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.009
 check 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.389
 simulated 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.389
 Mrs 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.879
 now you will be holding a net 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:50.129
 from the street of the várzea on the forehead avenida paulista 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.129
 he is going to show us the best way and detail he will have a vaccine 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.340
 not 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:02.990
 he is approaching the information 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.400
 before the world of arriving from chile 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.379
 I'll have to turn 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.870
 on the right it goes 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.129
 I was passing on this information so 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.950
 It's super important, I tell 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.229
 return to the streets 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.919
 think that one can perceive the concept and the streets the points 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.960
 he was denounced for two months from mills 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.060
 any speed I'm like we're circling it was not 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.590
 using the real speed any inversion with the situation 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.099
 in the case the goalkeeper of the avenue agamenon magalhães 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.969

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.080
 of the streets that will have the intersections 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.839
 and detail on top 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:53.259
 which has a gas station that also 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.809
 Relieved are super hyper important 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:57.339
 the defense of rahmati 

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:00.339
 against the current 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.259
 I'm going to stop with 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:08.599
 Carr what we need 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.449
 pass to the end after having represented the supervisor 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.009
 I'll use 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.550

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.589
 he still shows he has solo because we are not standing there game 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:35.990
