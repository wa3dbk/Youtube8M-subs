 more ok I did not have to pick up points 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.570
 in wounds and that's why I now have this 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.120
 scar on my face when I had eight 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.730
 years my younger brother was born then 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.289
 we were three and I the middle one the truth 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.570
 I remember having a very childhood 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.730
 happy when with my friends the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.250
 hideout and of course soccer 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.140
 it was really very good and life that of 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.730
 child was always the smallest in all 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.070
 they told me the flea 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.479
 at school in the neighborhood in the countryside 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.920
 of soccer and even in the church always 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.900
 they made me bullying for being the most 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.490
 Little boy told me that I could not be 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.080
 at the level of others that always 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.420
 needed help or that they should 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.430
 take care of me but I think that thanks to that and 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.040
 those people develop inside of me 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.810
 an attitude of always going surpassing 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.119
 always be the best and not leave me 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.940
 crush for others my adolescence 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.040
 it was half traumatic because after 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.940
 have a baby face all my childhood I 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.920
 he started to change his face and I did not have 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.430
 pimples on the face but he had a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.170
 little face between so many pimples 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.869
 guácala but when jíbaro appeared 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.729
 I was 14 years old and started with this from the 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.979
 woman the messenger at the moment of 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.590
 create mini I had no idea how 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.509
 put me then I decided to copy me of the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.460
 nickname of a Christian rapper manny 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.820
 mounts after all it was never going to be 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.140
 known only the people of my school already 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.600
 then little by little more people started me 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.729
 to call like that was still a kid 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.890
 but funny so I liked him 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.720
 worldwide I am currently a few 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.220
 months of graduating with a bachelor's degree 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.840
 publicity and marketing 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.610
 in college and I work as 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.380
 graphic designer in one of the best 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.880
 panama advertising agencies but 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.650
 I learned this about design 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.900
 tutorials of photoshop on youtube 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.730
 after being depressed for several 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.710
 months since a girl had left me 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.200
 three times 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.870
 at 17 still in school I had 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.910
 which girlfriend but she loved 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.760
 He was not Christian and that's how he always looked 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.190
 although not 100% as it should be 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.830
 then there comes a time where this 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.230
 child who was very happy and innocent that 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.960
 he had never done anything bad he had 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.660
 become a heartbreaker for a 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.970
 day said enough I can not continue like this and 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.620
 ends with my girlfriend and I went to ask 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.120
 sorry to god for everything there was 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.240
 done asking him to make me a 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.660
 new person and guess what he did 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.360
 God is very good after that I was 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.460
 desperate to serve God every day 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.410
 I fell more in love with him I started reading 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.020
 dozens the book and the bible by 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.850
 course my life improved a lot even though 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.280
 he was still the same crazy and funny 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.710
 always between that passion for wanting 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.720
 speak to others about Jesus and what 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.880
 had done in me I decided to do 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.650
 videoblogs since I had heard one 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.560
 conference on how to use technology 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.450
 to speak to the people of Jesus in that 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.180
 time I did not know or to germania 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.950
 werevertumorro or nobody alone 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.140
 it seemed like a little thing that grabbed a bed 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.420
 and I recorded for two minutes up the 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.120
 video to youtube and named it you're going 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.280
 to the church and this has changed my life 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.709
 completely because the truth did not think 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.239
 that the things that had happened to me that 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.040
 I had learned from my failures and 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.110
 victories could help so many 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.200
 people thanks to this I have been able 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.560
