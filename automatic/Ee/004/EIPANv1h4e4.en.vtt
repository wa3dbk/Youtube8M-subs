00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello guys how are we greet you and 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.480
 support and we are here with the patch 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.990
 miracle that fortunately all those 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.650
 prayers and prayers that were given to san 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.550
 buto del grande serge worked already 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.070
 dais possibly possibly there 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.350
 definitively fixed what is the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.050
 doctor problem thank you thank you 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.440
 finally to the whole community of the cto 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 of the community test environment that 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.059
 participated fully in this follows 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.789
 having many doubts about it but 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.829
 has worked well is the question that 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.449
 we must do to you when they are 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.170
 entering a game as you see the 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.969
 games as they feel the justice of that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.760
 you keep them in your meetings 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.429
 close that you are starting 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.129
 everyone who with the partner with the 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.409
 enemy is in front of you and they win you 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.210
 your death and they delivered your death is already 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.370
 just that you are killing yourself with the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.929
 another enemy we believe that if 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.989
 we believe that we have found 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.720
 a brutal abysmal difference in 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.060
 comparison with 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.680
 last version of the net code that we have already 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.700
 amply explained that it is the damn 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.430
 net code 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.830
 but first of all to enjoy 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.260
 all the delicious honeys of this 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.360
 new glorious patch we have to enter 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.770
 to our menu and activate the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.780
 high connection update 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.740
 often I think of a real 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.600
 whale relationship that you have to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.730
 modify it because here basically 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.580
 when you have a megane connection 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.400
 you should not stop using high and if 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.710
 we take into account the thickness by means of 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.560
 the population because there are times that exceed 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.950
 the mega connection so there's no 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.350
 need to have it in the middle or 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.750
 in low we are going to leave it high and if 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.060
 you any of you get to have 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.119
 a good minor connection they will have 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.320
 that adjust the according to what is 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.600
 this saturates a bit the network does not 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.550
 worry a lot but you already know above 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.530
 mega leave it high and they will have all 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.619
 the glorious experience of this 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.899
 condemned patch this part that was my 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.300
 opinion took a long time to arrive given that 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.610
 I was already active with the ct 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.590
 and in my opinion if it really took 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.720
 very much but good and I would be 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.490
 fighting afterwards with it and for a 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.290
 list of all the other things that 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.210
 they updated because an update a 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.980
 little big indeed if it's enough 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.560
 massive because all the platforms are 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.180
 you will be involved in this we leave you 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.010
 the link in the description so that 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.620
 you verify everything there 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.380
 unfortunately in consoles 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.930
 old women there are no longer and they have not 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.220
 arranged many of those things guys 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.050
 you get stuck are the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.230
 games that have to restart their their 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.480
 apparatuses and sadly no they have not 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.220
 arranged we do not know why or what 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.710
 better what we want to deny the situation 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.380
 but the age the age at which he talks a lot 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.150
 about it but not yet so let's hope 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.470
 I do resolution later 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.570
 although news has arrived 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.780
 interesting that when they're playing 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.940
 the dlcs are locked or hangs 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.440
 unless the console is the thing that 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.460
 you guys here in the comments 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.560
 they clarify us that denies us that 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.810
 playing los vÃ©lez is less 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.970
 problematic for you but 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.860
 talking about the experience that you 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.200
 they feel what it feels like in the field of 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.319
 battle really is I am still 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.090
 I just think that I can not give 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.510
 good blows with the enemy and I say ah 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.900
 I have a superiority in strategy 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.380
 I'm not sure I'm locking it in a 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.569
 place and the dull thing came and killed them already 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.269
 I feel more just really already I already believe 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.310
 that reacted better but the contrariety 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.680
 is that the enemy also reacts 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.170
 better and we have seen that the players 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.420
 good have become even more good, 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.090
 those who have average performance then 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.610
 we continue to have an average performance 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.930
 true but fortunately I think that 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.940
 this is the patch that must have 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.470
 been from the beginning this this and me 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.560
 it's incredible to me that they were 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.880
 overlooked something like being 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.680
 refreshing the information of the 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.080
 servers and the client and it could be more 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.959
 complex obviously because this world of 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.489
 the networks is immense but to me it 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.590
 It makes me incredible that a company of 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.019
 So much experience has passed them by 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.850
 high but good I do not know I do not know if nothing else 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.430
 they are giving us current with their finger 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.160
 so that we are still 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.320
 but if you feel gloriously 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.720
 incredible this patch I tell you that already 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.050
 I feel that when I have the advantage of 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.830
 strategy and those things really I think 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.870
 that I have better hits to say it 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.259
 so I tell them that the enemy also 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.940
 it has become more powerful because 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.160
 just when we are playing with 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.130
 something that is terrible something very bad something 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.570
 horrible to 4 is something spooky no longer 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.030
 I can add more adjectives because I 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.460
 I have run out of net code resources 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.500
 passed to a nice shield well more or 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.330
 less polished but everything can be 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.949
 improve a few things but really 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.960
 for the scale of players that there is me 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.920
 I think that there will be no more improvement 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.100
 put it like that 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:10.310
 I think we got used to being so 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.800
 wrong that we tried to master something that was 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.710
 bad and now that they give us something good then 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.270
 simply the level went up and you 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.310
 they will account in each and every one of 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.470
 the games that are being 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.660
 disputing online you are going to see 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.240
 that your enemies are curiously already going to 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.950
 have more level but you also go 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.350
 to feel higher when they are 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.870
 attacking is something quite curious already month 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.660
 shot already connect pretty well in the 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.520
 already basically already shots already rich 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.220
 it is easier to guess how we are going to 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.980
 I've seen fewer deaths behind the 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.170
 walls as it should be of inclusive 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.350
 before enemies that have a pretty 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:52.010
 high 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:53.870
 but I have seen that if you have 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.830
 has greatly improved the situations I 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.260
 I hope you guys who had 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.570
 forgotten left his powdery copy 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.790
 forgotten in a corner we invite you to 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.050
 that they come back to you see all 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.640
 the improvements that have obviously made 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.500
 we are starting, they are not going to have any 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.460
 more copy is there was for you 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.120
 he will imagine it 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.460
 condemned but you will see and we invite you 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.520
 to return to prove that 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.590
 try to send something extra from 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.789
 game the games are going to get more 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.560
 intense more bloodthirsty and we wait 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.389
 that you are enjoying this though 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.819
 curiously I came across an error of 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.310
 that an enemy already on a couple of occasions 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:37.039
 I was completely invisible and I did not see 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.569
 his body just saw the weapon and half with 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.639
 everything here I am leaving him because 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.080
 fortunately we could record it but 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:45.470
 this happened to me a couple of times 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.720
 what kinds of mistakes have you 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.820
 attracted this new patch you as 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.099
 you feel you are the ones who have the 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.919
 final word guys what do you think of the 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:58.070
 new patch what do you think of all that dais 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.599
 please already fixed the net code us 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.880
 as we say we believe that yes but 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:03.740
 what matters is what you think 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.030
 you share your opinion we have 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.979
 our facebook social networks and 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.860

 this patch because we flat out what 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.389
 we are doing we are 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.500
