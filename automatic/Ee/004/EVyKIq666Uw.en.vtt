points in between the first step in the
matzo<00:00:21.240> baking<00:00:21.570> process<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.439> mix<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
matzo baking process is to mix the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.009 
matzo baking process is to mix the
hand-ground<00:00:23.340> flour<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:24.180> water<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
hand-ground flour with water and of

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.240 
hand-ground flour with water and of
course<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.680> will<00:00:25.859> all<00:00:26.070> be<00:00:26.279> done<00:00:26.460> by<00:00:26.820> hand<00:00:28.250> but

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
course this will all be done by hand but

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.279 
course this will all be done by hand but
before<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.119> done<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.109> needed

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
before this can be done one is needed

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.110 
before this can be done one is needed
first<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:32.070> measure<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.520> right<00:00:32.669> amount<00:00:33.000> of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
first to measure the right amount of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.000 
first to measure the right amount of
water<00:00:33.329> which<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.110> done<00:00:34.290> separate<00:00:34.770> from<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
water which is done separate from the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.280 
water which is done separate from the
flour<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> flour<00:00:36.630> becomes<00:00:37.020> wet

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
flour because if the flour becomes wet

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.810 
flour because if the flour becomes wet
before<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> process<00:00:38.280> begins

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
before the process begins

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.760 
before the process begins
it<00:00:38.969> becomes<00:00:39.300> pusle<00:00:39.809> or<00:00:39.930> invalid<00:00:40.649> and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it becomes pusle or invalid and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.130 
it becomes pusle or invalid and
therefore<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.790> water<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.300> poured<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
therefore the water is poured and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.510 
therefore the water is poured and
measured<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.649> its<00:00:43.890> own<00:00:44.129> room<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:47.010> same<00:00:47.280> goes

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
measured in its own room the same goes

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.490 
measured in its own room the same goes
for<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.820> flour<00:00:48.059> which<00:00:48.480> must<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.840> sifted<00:00:49.379> and

carefully checked for bugs ever found

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
carefully checked for bugs ever found
they<00:00:52.020> must<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.410> removed<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
they must be removed and if not all the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
they must be removed and if not all the

together<00:01:29.850> by<00:01:30.119> hand<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.689> order<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.680> create<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
together by hand in order to create a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.270 
together by hand in order to create a
crumbly<00:01:33.060> type<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.479> dough<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.680> dough<00:01:35.009> will

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
crumbly type of dough this dough will

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.429 
crumbly type of dough this dough will
need<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.670> further<00:01:35.970> needed<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.659> order<00:01:37.229> that

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
need to be further needed in order that

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.590 
need to be further needed in order that
it's<00:01:37.770> still<00:01:37.950> shopping<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.880> become<00:01:39.329> one

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
it's still shopping up and become one

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.140 
it's still shopping up and become one
substance<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.700> rolled<00:01:41.939> into

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
substance so that it will be rolled into

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.260 
substance so that it will be rolled into
round<00:01:42.600> slots<00:01:42.990> put<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> oven<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> baked

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
round slots put into the oven and baked

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.039 
round slots put into the oven and baked
in<00:01:45.600> matzah<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.000> see<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:48.540> how<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.780> dough

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
in matzah you can see here how the dough

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.780 
in matzah you can see here how the dough
looks<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.619> straight<00:01:49.979> from<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.220> mixer<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
looks like straight from the mixer and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.520 
looks like straight from the mixer and
at<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> beginning<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> kneading<00:01:52.110> period

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
at the beginning of the kneading period

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.260
