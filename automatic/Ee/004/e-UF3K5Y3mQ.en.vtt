00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.780
 rice own sacks kick from cillessen 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.080
 has a hard time in the first 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.080
 quarter 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.640
 to reach and actually both 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.560
 angling towards the ball may have it 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.279
 ball falls and the rescue of cillessen 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.279
 couple rijswijk 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.910
 Schöne needs some space too 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.220
 reaches lasse schöne nicely done purple 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.720
 is just not quite optimal so choose 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.420
 after doing this work it works quite well 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.560
 nice and almost to it 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.050
 from l see best attack from ajax with 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.730
 schöne that takes along very nicely everywhere 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.610
 Here underfoot confuse 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.650
 friend seen then choose the easy 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.470
 along comes you think the heart lives 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.210
 another chance to hear l see how i am 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.460
 the bother 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.360
 Sink digging beautiful movement again 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.340
 from him 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.040
 now the actual man is over 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.570
 choose his first shot now 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.729
 the force it and the goal 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.790
 because it's not offside, see 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.630
 scores that used straight to it 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.860
 public fingers on the lips and then know 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.729
 you already what you mean 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.729
 Ajax leads that is edge offside though 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.090
 goal 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.050
 I see a leading role too high for that 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.399
 clean 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.399
 via the base state of the goal 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.270
 about mars course today 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.130
 employed at ajax but started and ended 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.290
 they player career and deventer was here 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.909
 also chief technical issues there 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.909
 very close bond with it 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.619
 sloppy of lk then see the coil here 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.640
 cross is god there is the coldest courage 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.200
 be a goal from rijswijk 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.269
 because this is the best chance that co it 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.160
 has had it starts with his 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.910
 ball loss 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.010
 purple short back but not pure 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.110
 Enough to Bazaar was a very good one 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.030
 except across the corner and therefore a whole 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.910
 good chance for rijsdijk when in the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.000
 With the free kick that is good the header 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.459
 that is just the rally of cillessen 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.920
 that's how it comes to get closer 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.810
 chance of rijsdijk now a good head chance 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.970
 for crush 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.410
 There is a tree that makes more income Mario 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.440
 extension can always be difficult 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.239
 for a goalkeeper mass schöne 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.660
 over the wall and the rally of the heart 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.910
 with all effort he screen himself one 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.859
 body the short corner away from the heart 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.359
 and so searches 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.269
 schöne the further crossing in the field 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.730
 that movie or but finds it heard about 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.579
 crush 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.260
 camp-let and extend yes then both 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.090
 buy here 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.629
 we smoke looking spacious barely still pays 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.629
 hit a ball 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.760
 and yet the idea that he is more with this 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.760
 can do 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.450
 that way crushes like a good cross 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.700
 almost 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.480
 Viergever takes away nice shot afterwards 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.170
 and the top passed over 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.060
 decision to shoot three times and how 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.690
 phenomenal outside everywhere 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.319
 sjoerd did not overdo the pass either 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.660
 so bad 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.750
 who always give away and this is it 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.310
 weak sink digging does not touch him well yes 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.080
 And then you don't hit well and well 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.820
 hit well 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.370
 cillessen sit nora with his hands 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.290
 but that ball is so good that hard 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:02.610
 they won't have it 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:05.400
 and so it is a shorter version 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.590
 Schöne is once tried almost 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.040
 goal at the first post 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.040
 singraven 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.079
 well the tactic of the farmer you heard it 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.079
 one or all of the risks as me 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.060
 could be fine that it goes almost and 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.940
 he seems to be typing 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.060
 but that is not what it actually is 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.420
 it is not the ball but l see it and the 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.420
 goal is 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:50.040
 oh is it always scores your ajax 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:55.260
 hired mercenary with a heart 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:58.280
 from ajax still wrong and it is a two 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.660
 the ball back nothing wrong and a 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.720
 polletje 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.490
 the field because that ball jumps up just like 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.600
 you want me to rap it is officially one 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.600
 own goal of comparison 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.090
 he must have suggested so much 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:23.570
 of this day against ajax 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:26.780
 his ajax and that's how ajax grabs 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.640
 three points in deventer 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.350
 But the way that will be the farmer 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.350
 certainly not yet satisfied voice
