00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.330 

the<00:01:30.780> frontside<00:01:31.229> version<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:31.950> much<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the frontside version is very much the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.550 
the frontside version is very much the
same<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.720> kick<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> board<00:01:34.260> in<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
same but you kick the board in the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.730 
same but you kick the board in the
opposite<00:01:34.920> direction<00:01:36.200> maybe<00:01:37.200> you'll<00:01:37.409> find<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
opposite direction maybe you'll find the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.440 
opposite direction maybe you'll find the
leg<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.130> body<00:01:38.340> movements<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.940> little<00:01:39.270> less

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
leg and body movements a little less

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
leg and body movements a little less
natural<00:01:39.690> but<00:01:40.409> basically<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.009> follows<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
natural but basically it follows the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:51.950 
natural but basically it follows the
same<00:01:41.640> principle<00:01:49.670> mine<00:01:50.670> was<00:01:50.850> much<00:01:51.030> bad<00:01:51.299> next

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
same principle mine was much bad next

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.930 
same principle mine was much bad next
