00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.350
 In general, I just want to say briefly that 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.450
 all sorts of beautiful words like mortgage 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.030
 credit is all nonsense the main word 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.730
 which is behind this man debt 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.980
 becomes debtor and if it 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.770
 associated with real estate is 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.640
 the debtor is a slave for many years to come and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.359
 the man himself consciously goes this slavery 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:30.060
 realizing that slave lamp steve from this 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.620
 moment slave of this bank and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.120
 still need to pay attention that 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.700
 the property you are buying supposedly 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.450
 on mortgages at least as in France 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.030
 here most likely it belongs to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.980
 jar she conditionally written to you then 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.710
 you are conditional owner 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.440
 this property on paper she's kind 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.590
 would be yours but if you are for only 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.469
 three months you do not pay the loan then 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.320
 automatically 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.889
 There is a situation when you have a bank 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.689
 blocks your property and he has 

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:09.060
 the right at that moment to sell it on 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.819
 special auction and these special 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.279
 options where sell similar 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:17.340
 real estate they are clearly organized so 

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:19.649
 way that people buy you to us 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.109
 agency at very low prices 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.389
 because the purpose of the bank in this case 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.849
 it does not sell an apartment as expensive as possible 

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:28.459
 change their mind 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:30.479
 only to return the loan balance 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:34.259
 accordingly, the price can be very 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.869
 the host is greatly underestimated in this case 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.029
 apartments he loses everything loses all those 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.849
 money that he has already invested in an apartment like 

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:43.950
 as if he, too, does not return to heaven no 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:46.889
 will return the money if they sell the apartment 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.779
 if you sell it more expensive the bank will take 

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:52.529
 its part of the loan balance 

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:54.899
 that will give you more expensive but the bank is in it 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:57.239
 not interested and all these trades they 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.389
 special there everyone is not interested 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:01.619
 high prices there all their people 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:04.349
 so there is a price rather everything will be 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.869
 approximate cost of loans well plus 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:09.569
 minus because it will deal with it 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.710
 no longer will you deal with the bank but if 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.960
 there is a couple to and we also know 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.600
 such a system works lent all its 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.210
 their knives and the agency they are for 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.370
 among themselves will pay the bank some more 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.990
 percentile so that the price for an apartment was 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.170
 a few things that no longer you decide this 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.980
 price is conditional master you are not master 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.620
 apartments and the owner is long in the first 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.960
 the queue is therefore of course better and generally 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.390
 if there is any possibility not 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.040
 get into banking all these loans are not 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.590
 lie mortgages better not to do 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.230
 better to save for many years afterwards once 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.450
 buy well or at least and to 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.930
 this percentage was some minimum not 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.020
 for the whole amount something very hard thing 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.020
 I felt it all on myself 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.530
 because my husband and I bought an apartment here 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.870
 so mortgage on the full amount 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.760
 loan for 25 years and only in a year and 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.730
 she felt for herself how much 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.830
 hard and how slavery and learned 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.540
 all the details that if we suddenly do not pay 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.260
 what will be how it happens 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.900
 new read the contract in the contract there 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.150
 first many many many many pages 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.310
 small print there such things are not particularly 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.600
 underlined aspects are fully tied 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.210
 to the place you do not have the opportunity 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.030
 change jobs move to too 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.100
 three months pause when you change jobs 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.120
 then maybe no longer can 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:38.140
 you will find work why three months without 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.850
 work with one quit moved another 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.680
 knows if you found everything in advance 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.480
 well on there anyway would rather 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.580
 only three months probation 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.040
 if they will not pass on to you not look 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.320
 you will remain without a new employee recession 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.870
 wear is usually up in some rare 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.560
 cases of two months if you are very each 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.290
 worker 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.060
 but in principle they have the right after three 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.370
 of the month to say I'm sorry you are not 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.400
 come up with no matter how problems and 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.260
 no benefit after that will give well 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.110
 you just did not fit it in the contract 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.570
 Described as a giant car 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.360
 there is a loan there let's say there are thousands 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.730
 euro is there 1200 euro every month take out 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.920
 yes put it wants at least do not eat and do not drink 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.680
 nothing on credit should such a number 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.300
 lie on the bill they take you 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.250
 understand you fall into this gigantic 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.270
 the car is not free at all 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.250
 no shadow twitched 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.020
 no not vacation already there everything starts already 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.250
 Shift rst all around to pay 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.229
 this loan 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.080
 I think here, too, on period with this 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.449
 already faced just loans here to me 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.479
 so long and not so maybe 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:43.240
 to be big her why in Moscow 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:47.409
 orthopedist to roll back even track 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.009
 paris probably let's say someone can 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:54.810
 earned us very well 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.810
 hard together
