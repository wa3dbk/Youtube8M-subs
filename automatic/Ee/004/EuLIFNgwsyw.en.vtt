00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.920 

this<00:03:02.370> point<00:03:02.670> looks<00:03:02.880> pretty<00:03:03.180> much<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.600> same<00:03:03.780> as

is located farther away from the cushion

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.130 
is located farther away from the cushion
which<00:03:08.430> requires<00:03:08.819> a<00:03:08.910> much<00:03:09.120> larger<00:03:09.660> movement

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
which requires a much larger movement

which requires a much larger movement
you<00:03:10.830> have<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.130> play<00:03:11.280> very<00:03:11.520> full<00:03:11.880> slightly<00:03:12.630> to

you have to play very full slightly to
the<00:03:12.810> left<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.830> can<00:03:13.980> play<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.340> shot

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.949 
successfully with a bit of left English
but<00:03:16.950> personally<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.790> recommend<00:03:18.209> playing<00:03:18.750> it

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
but personally I recommend playing it

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.770
