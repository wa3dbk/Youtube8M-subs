00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.610
 yo everyone is papy knit so 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.290
 there we find ourselves on the cara followed for 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.540
 the match fc lorient controls it so 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.800
 I made video montages and there it 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.140
 starts well so benzaki shot 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.580
 completely next but sport I think 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.920
 that I will do that for all videos 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.170
 because the gemmi so two games in 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.480
 on the video so it's better for me 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.220
 so the real that pulls completely to 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.470
 side i think i'm going to do how 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.370
 commentators so I'm going to comment 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.879
 as if I was really watching a match 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.199
 water fire dribbling past attention 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.479
 this for bennwihr benzaki shot 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.930
 completely next still bendir is 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:55.390
 not in a big day 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.530
 the bombs that will center for 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.680
 bennwihr alejandro of ofac iras you will 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.610
 retrieve on their funny andrew who 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.440
 what strikes 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.960
 here is the magnificent magnificent man what 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.110
 but there's nothing to say it's a goal 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.900
 beautiful with a nice curled shot 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.960
 the goalkeeper can not do anything for us 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.060
 our classes and half time it's gone 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.830
 so 1 0 at half time and so 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.950
 commitment and for the focused lorient 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.200
 be careful, make them stand alone 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.920
 so in the 49th minute 48th minute a year 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.460
 and basically who scores his goal so 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.420
 doubled leandro frankly this player 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.450
 is huge 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.470
 an indian then ofac is launched in 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.200
 depth and there we can see the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.250
 speed kg so there the referee reported a 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.300
 free kick there I will choose my shooter 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.730
 normally it's benzema that's going to be 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.290
 hot but I will watch anyway 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.720
 the others and so that's benzaki going 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:02:00.460
 finish with the shot and so benzaki matter 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.430
 and pay attention to them and boli who is 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.460
 at the right place to mark the goal the 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.069
 third goal of the fc lorient 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.150
 leandro again who makes talk about that his 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.290
 real potential the curling hit 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.810
 superb 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.400
 I believe that the coiled strikes are 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.140
 the top at the top 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.969
 gold and that's the only med games that it 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:28.120
 practically do I already have 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.889
 excused for the delay so there is the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.109
 goaltender I do not know it's 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:35.799
 I think that was the place that 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:38.139
 makes a great stop again and the bndes 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.480
 who comes to crucify the keeper of Lille 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.769
 on a superb wound wound so the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.840
 match ended on a 5-0 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.540
 so here we end up so for 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.389
 fc lorient do Valenciennes fc lorient 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.980
 pardon benzia that from the 17th minute goes 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.840
 to talk about him but leandro who 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.760
 completely smash her 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.560
 completely beside 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.299
 traoré who is going to center for ayité 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.459
 and watch me this magnificent parade 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.489
 of the guardian and he will eventually pick up the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.569
 ball so here it goes for the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.609
 second half with 0 0 so 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.280
 Valenciennes ask me a lot of 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.569
 problems at that time compared to 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.430
 lille who had not done a lot of 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.359
 things whose quality that tried to 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.560
 to strike but he got caught 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.069
 ball and it's cleared in a corner 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.719
 and watch the corner is gaffe 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.000
 to Alain traoré who has a good potato and 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.230
 why and that's why and that's it 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.609
 beautiful returning pole of alain 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.709
 traoré in the 52nd minute superb fight 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:36.150
 so find there for the 67th minute 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.290
 so this is a frank opportunity to 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.000
 Valenciennes this is the only occasion 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.560
 frank on the two matches that I have 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.540
 seen from the opponent I think I'm going 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.489
 increase the difficulty because that's it 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.099
 do not go too much to the fire that goes 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.609
 center for bentiu gorgeous head in 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.290
 full in the mile 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:58.799
 nothing to say 2 0 for the fc lorient 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:00.780
 it is superb there so there is so 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.010
 benzia sorry I knew more my words 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.810
 who is going to make a coiled strike 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.219
 beautiful on the transverse but 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.069
 unfortunately but landreau is there 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:09.689
 to crucify the guardian again and 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.299
 so 3 0 for the fc lorient 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.720
 it's superb I do not know how much 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.259
 we are I would do that to you in the 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.359
 next episode 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.759
 leandro québec which is launched by itself 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.159
 in-depth attention who may be 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:25.979
 is there man widely above 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:31.110
 it's really not bad at all 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:33.389
 bad we end up after hi all 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.270

 you liked it so I commented live 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.790
 I hope I commented well 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.770
 so these words at the very first as we 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.790
 comments age have so this is the 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.990
 first time I do that so I 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.580
 do not really know how to do it 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.540
 I think I will improve after 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.100
 I hope that kind of videos you 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.760

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.740
 frank opportunities and so do it for me 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.340
 know in comment I think so 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.190
 this episode you were all waiting for it because 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.690
 that many do not claim it and I'm going 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.390
 apologize for the delay it's not my 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.850
 fault I lost time because of 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.040
 course at all and so I'm going to you 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.930
 leave on that I think the episodes

 will 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.430

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.120
