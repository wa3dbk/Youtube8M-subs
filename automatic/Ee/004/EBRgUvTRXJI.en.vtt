00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:16.139
 I bought a single-lens lens lumix g 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:18.450
 20mm f 1.72 bright single focus lens price try taking around 31,000 yen 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.080
 Place to place 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.050
 During ~ 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.050
 Hey said Nde not have a memory card Once you take me mosquito Sha 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:36.910
 Yes I want to retake the day and take a photo 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.480
 Let's take a mac but this time in labor to put the picture you took in that 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.640
 Not 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.640
 Well I think leisure Mac and want to arm the Te j 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.640
 me 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.650
 2 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.170
 It has changed the I whoo 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.910
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.910
 Bitchies 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.900
 Yup 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.670
 Well then this situation is a bit 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.670
 Good 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.670
 Hmm 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.730
 Te N' 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.730
 Hmm 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.970
 House car this box ne yes 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.090
 2 minutes 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.090
 7 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.770
 so 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:34.020
 Well take a try, and until now, until now 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:37.020
 Combed or compared with Hey lens I'd floated to say that I feel a little 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.880
 Do you go from the good point first 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:47.780
 Even if it says good places, it's open f 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:52.380
 Well this is-I understand that only the lens is f 2.8 lens 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.010
 And become Toka f 1.7 to said, still dealing with the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.700
 The scene to see today 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:07.210
 I it I'm Yappa background blur say before walking one point seven songs will courted Well wow 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:09.940
 Is the second a good place but is 20cm This lens birth shooting diarrhea 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.750
 I'm intoxicated 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:20.850
 And certain famous sigma 30mm f 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.850
 f It is bright forty , but the shooting distance of the site is 40 centimeters 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.939
 After all this attends the Zetas 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:34.670
 Do not say a great deal Yoku' to the vehicle body 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:40.890
 Felt that I hope beneath the 's such pattern can take the I mean How do I I Nikki is every day 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.450
 Also in the lens I think that any good points of Tteyuu go by I hand Buregu directly below 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.550
 Yes and 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:55.870
 It is a good prefecture and it is the third one 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:59.830
 This is a damn nice good time This time I made this to take for this mirrorless one eye 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:08.540
 We bought for saying that we usually want to carry around 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:16.189
 I have one bottle of this most surprisingly single lens reflex pentax but it is worthy 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:24.049
 Always I still have to back sleeping usually but it is gold to say that is in the best f small 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:27.769
 Is not another c care what something usually also with the other absolute the flight A'ano sky that carry 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.530
 When you thought that Toka good Aaa Na beautiful 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.470
 with iphone 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.460
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:39.100
 I thought I was going to imitate a soul when I became 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:47.110
 Shot in the still Hey mirror less than Nejitaun 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:54.160
 It is a high performance is proportional can not be something just completely by I felt about that recent Kondeji 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:59.090
 But after all it is the movie which can change the lens It is the most different I just after all 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:02.050
 Even if it is small and the bag is Japanese-style, it would be difficult if there 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.140
 After all compared with single-lens reflex camera 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:10.040
 I chose the way this time 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:13.099
 Yes The next song is a good sense of no good 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.820
 For example, this autofocus is Jean book 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:20.600
 Isn't there a technology called ultra-sonic of a new car ? 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:25.280
 Feelings auto focus until there is not 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:31.479
 Since there is no Toka hesitation or rather about a little slow if what 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.479
 Movie oriented store Sassa Well number 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:47.990
 I feel like I'm determined It sucks like a thin thread but I still 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:50.340
 It is a bit useless as it is good to aim for things that stop from the torso that is not detonation speed 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.520
 The second point is 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.770
 If you say that it is a regular interchangeable lens 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.310
 By'm Professor 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.600
 Does it come with food 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:08.460
 It's like this one . This lens has a hood. 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:14.550
 It did not come in 7 sound order Maa when it is necessary to buy wind tunnel is necessary for this lens 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.330
 Because I care about before the Tteyuu thin Well emergency pancake lens or rather the concept 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.960
 Nedon lens in voice 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:25.990
 I feel like I 'm someone with a hood 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:30.550
 Don't squeeze closed the lens as the photographer 's freedom 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:36.320
 It is my feeling that I wanted it to be set 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:41.360
 I mentioned two things that are not good, but they are nonsense 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:46.930
 But if you think about it, this lens is pretty good 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:49.480
 To be honest, I didn't think so much until now that I had a good lens 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:55.120
 Really nice 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.529
 Well, this time , I hope to receive a sample of the video and the next video 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.789
 I will 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:00.729
 For now, how much do you want to do this time again 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.740
 Hmm 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.710
 Hmm 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.520
 Hmm 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.520
 me 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.009
 Ah ah ah 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.129
 Hmm 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.129
 Yup 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.120
 9 minutes
