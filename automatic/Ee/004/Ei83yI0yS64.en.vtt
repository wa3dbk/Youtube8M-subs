another do-it-yourself makeup tutorial

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.260 
another do-it-yourself makeup tutorial
on<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.840> homemade<00:00:04.650> face<00:00:05.040> primer<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.790> it's<00:00:06.120> what

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
on a homemade face primer and it's what

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.789 
on a homemade face primer and it's what
it<00:00:06.359> looks<00:00:06.390> like<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.839> only<00:00:07.140> made<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> little<00:00:07.589> bit

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
it looks like I only made a little bit

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:08.930 
it looks like I only made a little bit
because<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:08.040> didn't<00:00:08.250> know<00:00:08.309> how<00:00:08.519> it's<00:00:08.730> going<00:00:08.849> to

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
because I didn't know how it's going to

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.640 
because I didn't know how it's going to
work<00:00:09.090> but<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.570> actually<00:00:09.870> works<00:00:10.050> really<00:00:10.200> well

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
work but it actually works really well

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.009 
work but it actually works really well
and<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.940> what<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.450> looks<00:00:12.630> like<00:00:12.750> with

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
and so this is what it looks like with

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.270 
and so this is what it looks like with
the<00:00:13.139> primer<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.830> what<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.099> looks

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the primer and this is what it looks

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.860 
the primer and this is what it looks
like<00:00:14.400> just<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.880> moisturizer<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.690> can

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
like just a moisturizer so you can

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.810 
like just a moisturizer so you can
definitely<00:00:16.260> tell<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.619> shows<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.430> lot<00:00:17.609> more

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
definitely tell it shows up a lot more

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.910 
definitely tell it shows up a lot more
bright<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:19.050> shimmer<00:00:19.260> stays<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.800> it

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
bright and the shimmer stays on it

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.040 
bright and the shimmer stays on it
sticks<00:00:20.220> better<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.789> I've<00:00:20.970> already<00:00:21.300> filmed

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
sticks better and I've already filmed

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.019 
sticks better and I've already filmed
this<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.289> few<00:00:22.470> times<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.830> intro<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.880> it's

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
this a few times to intro and so it's

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.310 
this a few times to intro and so it's
already<00:00:24.359> been<00:00:24.480> fading<00:00:24.960> away<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
already been fading away on the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.740 
already been fading away on the
moisturizer<00:00:25.680> side<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.250> definitely<00:00:27.150> think

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
moisturizer side so definitely think
