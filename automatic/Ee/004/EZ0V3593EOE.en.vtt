tackle from florida I think would be a
nice<00:00:42.300> fit<00:00:42.329> he<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.200> rush<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> passer<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.950> little

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
nice fit he can rush the passer a little

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160

end<00:01:28.020> from<00:01:28.140> Texas<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.880> he's<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> best

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
end from Texas is here he's the best

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
defensive end available and I think he's

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.300 
defensive end available and I think he's
a<00:01:32.460> nice<00:01:32.700> scheme<00:01:33.119> fit<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> Bengals<00:01:34.590> jug<00:01:35.159> I

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
a nice scheme fit for the Bengals jug I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.069 
a nice scheme fit for the Bengals jug I
have<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> feeling<00:01:35.790> maybe<00:01:36.420> they'd<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> look<00:01:36.960> at

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
have a feeling maybe they'd a look at

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.710 
have a feeling maybe they'd a look at
Margus<00:01:37.500> hunt<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.979> an<00:01:38.400> every-down<00:01:38.790> player<00:01:39.180> when

interior of the line and I think they

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.600

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
the new orlean saints and look I had the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.740 
the new orlean saints and look I had the
Saints<00:02:35.430> upgrading<00:02:35.970> an<00:02:36.060> inside<00:02:36.450> linebacker

outside<00:02:41.880> linebacker<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.380> someone

left tackles in the first round but

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.199 
left tackles in the first round but
they're<00:03:47.220> going<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.519> need<00:03:47.730> developing

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
they're going to have a need developing

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
here a cornerback that secondary was a

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.860

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.730 
receiver from Vanderbilt I think is a
good<00:05:11.210> fit<00:05:11.420> for<00:05:11.450> the<00:05:11.660> Broncos<00:05:12.110> because<00:05:12.560> he's<00:05:12.710> a

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740
