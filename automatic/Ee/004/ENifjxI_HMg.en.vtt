00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi my android gamers i hope they are 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.899
 having a great time and tell me who 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.880
 miss the legendary nintendo 64 with its 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.590
 controls for people with three hands 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.240
 incredible games that marked the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.219
 childhood of many kids that like me 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.109
 surely more than once they had 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.350
 have to take out the cassette so that the game 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.369
 work as if by magic 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.900
 mysteriously this was the only 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.070
 solution so that the game could 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.410
 function 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.210
 we are in 2013 and this console is 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.279
 disappearing little by little with the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.080
 breakthrough technology today very 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.329
 few among us have a console 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.070
 functional in their homes but this does not 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.690
 will prevent us from receiving those old 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.059
 moments that made us the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.010
 gamers that we are today since they 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.260
 I will show how to convert your device 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.260
 Android on the legendary Nintendo 64 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.100
 in order to achieve such a feat we 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.210
 we will download an application that will emulate 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.460
 to the nintendo 64 call open 64 this 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.170
 application is completely free more 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.760
 however , we can buy the version 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.470
 of pay to support the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.750
 developers that continue with this 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.030
 project since unfortunately the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.390
 emulator is not completely finished 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.610
 so if they can where please 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.770
 when we have downloaded it we can 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.630
 enter and see how it works has a 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.030
 ton of options that we can try 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.759
 but I will explain to you the most important thing 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.619
 is how to play first of all let me 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.720
 tell them which games or in this case 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.509
 the roms are not included with the 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.789
 emulator this rom we can download them 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.440
 apart in specialized pages 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.840
 directions of games of all kinds 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.009
 consoles when we already have downloaded 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.470
 the rumbia the game of our 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.600
 preference we will export it to the 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.399
 memory of our device we're going 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.229
 to the sd card of our android and 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.720
 we create a new folder with the name 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.100
 of game 64 to be able to recognize it 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.470
 easily 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.990
 we open and paste the room of our 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.299
 game when we are finished we can 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.420
 test if it works we enter the emulator 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.729
 and we press where it says game we search 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.320
 the folder where we put the game and you 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.320
 we start emulation 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.350
 as we can see the Goths run with 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.420
 total fluency although this will depend 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.090
 of your processing power 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.160
 device something that I liked quite 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.080
 are the controls that adapt very 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.150
 well at hand we will not have any 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.440
 problem to be able to reach all the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.900
 buttons without difficulty 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.420
 further emulate we have any title of 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.130
 nintendo 64 like for example the epic 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.990
 super smash bros with all the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.080
 legendary characters of the franchise 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.150
 Nintendo or the Mario Kart 64 using 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.640
 turtle shells like projectiles 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.340
 remote control and who reminds us 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.960
 agent 007 in goldeneye one of the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.870
 best multiplayer games of the 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.030
 epoch and one of the masters also my 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.920
 favorite among so many titles the legend 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.230
 of zelda and the ocarina of time where 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.510
 We will accompany the good link and try 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.460
 save the kingdom of hyrule from the clutches 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.470
 of the evil ganondorf traveling in the 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.810
 time and space becoming the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.970
 hero of the story all these titles 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.770
 They will run smoothly although we will see 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.110
 occasionally minor bugs in the 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.080
 graphics and sound although they will not affect 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.060
 absolutely nothing your gameplay in addition 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.210
 we can make use of fast storage in 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.310
 the 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.080
 will allow us to save our game in 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.880
 any time we are playing 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.890
 and load it if a monster 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.530
 I kill and we want to do a little bit of 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.300
 trap the most impressive of the emulator 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.860
 is that we have the possibility of 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.050
 connect a special command to 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.330
 Android devices assigning you a 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.790
 special command to each button and use your 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.440
 device like a screen and this does not 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.810
 get there we can play with 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.610
 four controls simultaneously and power 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.280
 play in multiplayer mode with your 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.170
 friends without a doubt a great emulator that we 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.820
 will make you remember incredible moments of 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.070
 our childhood and show them to the 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.760
 future generations so great that 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.650
 they were the video games of our childhood 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.239
