00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
yesterday mojang updated to Minecraft

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.600 
yesterday mojang updated to Minecraft
1.8<00:00:05.069> point<00:00:05.430> 6<00:00:05.730> which<00:00:06.540> caused<00:00:07.049> quite<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.859> lot<00:00:08.460> of

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
1.8 point 6 which caused quite a lot of

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.910 
1.8 point 6 which caused quite a lot of
maps<00:00:08.910> pretty<00:00:09.210> much<00:00:09.300> all<00:00:09.480> maps<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.380> break<00:00:10.650> now

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
maps pretty much all maps to break now

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.110 
maps pretty much all maps to break now
I've<00:00:11.219> been<00:00:11.429> speaking<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.730> quite<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> few

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
I've been speaking to quite a few

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.089 
I've been speaking to quite a few
mapmakers<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:13.139> doubt<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.830> they<00:00:13.950> will

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
mapmakers and I doubt that they will

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.210 
mapmakers and I doubt that they will
actually<00:00:14.460> be<00:00:14.580> updating<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.299> if<00:00:15.750> like<00:00:16.260> me<00:00:16.440> they

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
actually be updating it if like me they

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.550 
actually be updating it if like me they
used<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.880> very<00:00:18.600> crucial<00:00:18.960> things<00:00:19.199> it's

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
used in and very crucial things it's

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.950 
used in and very crucial things it's
pretty<00:00:19.949> much<00:00:20.070> impossible<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:21.119> update<00:00:21.600> unless

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
pretty much impossible to update unless

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.230 
pretty much impossible to update unless
you<00:00:22.109> recreate<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> whole<00:00:22.890> thing<00:00:23.070> okay<00:00:23.699> so

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
you recreate the whole thing okay so

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.220 
you recreate the whole thing okay so

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.800 
three and higher this will successfully
teleported<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.620> if<00:03:26.830> you<00:03:27.430> are<00:03:27.580> not<00:03:27.820> there's<00:03:28.570> a

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
teleported a if you are not there's a

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.890 
teleported a if you are not there's a
three<00:03:29.380> tik<00:03:29.680> delay<00:03:30.220> okay<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.299> mean<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:31.840> just

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
three tik delay okay I mean this just

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.870 
three tik delay okay I mean this just
clears<00:03:32.350> that<00:03:32.590> block<00:03:32.830> over<00:03:33.100> there<00:03:33.280> okay<00:03:33.820> so

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
clears that block over there okay so

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.090 
clears that block over there okay so
this<00:03:34.120> this<00:03:34.810> will<00:03:34.989> just<00:03:35.170> clear<00:03:35.350> that<00:03:35.530> block<00:03:35.739> and

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
this this will just clear that block and

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.050 
this this will just clear that block and
let<00:03:37.090> me<00:03:37.150> just<00:03:37.299> show<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:38.220> but<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.340> also<00:03:39.519> acts<00:03:39.850> as

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
let me just show you but it also acts as

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.830 
let me just show you but it also acts as
a<00:03:40.200> as<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.260> corner<00:03:41.680> okay<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.730> then<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.660> will

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
a as a corner okay and then it will

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.050 
a as a corner okay and then it will
teleport<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.440> anybody<00:03:45.430> who's<00:03:45.579> in<00:03:45.700> six<00:03:45.910> block

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
teleport you anybody who's in six block

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.819 
teleport you anybody who's in six block
radius<00:03:46.090> it'll<00:03:46.720> teleport<00:03:47.200> them<00:03:47.320> into<00:03:47.680> this

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
radius it'll teleport them into this

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.830 
radius it'll teleport them into this
block<00:03:48.130> box<00:03:48.640> over<00:03:48.970> here<00:03:49.000> which<00:03:49.360> then<00:03:49.600> just

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
block box over here which then just

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.620 
block box over here which then just
tells<00:03:50.230> them<00:03:50.410> they<00:03:50.590> can't<00:03:50.829> do<00:03:50.920> anything<00:03:51.630> what

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
tells them they can't do anything what

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.000 
tells them they can't do anything what
this<00:03:52.870> button<00:03:53.079> over<00:03:53.380> here<00:03:53.410> does<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.829> just

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
this button over here does it just

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.380 
this button over here does it just
teleport<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.549> to<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:54.790> spawn<00:03:55.060> which<00:03:55.269> will

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
teleport you to the spawn which will

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.819 
teleport you to the spawn which will
automatically<00:03:55.870> teleport<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.680> black

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
automatically teleport it to the black

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.340 
automatically teleport it to the black
box<00:03:57.100> which<00:03:57.340> will<00:03:57.519> then<00:03:57.610> check<00:03:58.110> whether<00:03:59.110> you

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
box which will then check whether you

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.180 
box which will then check whether you
are<00:03:59.530> in<00:03:59.560> 1.8<00:04:00.090> 1.3<00:04:01.090> because<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.920> will<00:04:03.040> either

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
are in 1.8 1.3 because of it will either

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.960 
are in 1.8 1.3 because of it will either
work<00:04:03.459> or<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.760> won't<00:04:04.680> yeah<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:05.860> then<00:04:06.010> away<00:04:06.579> you

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
work or it won't yeah and then away you

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.660 
work or it won't yeah and then away you
go<00:04:07.320> that's<00:04:08.320> a<00:04:08.380> very<00:04:08.620> very<00:04:09.070> very<00:04:09.220> simple

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
go that's a very very very simple

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.030 
go that's a very very very simple
mechanic<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:10.590> because<00:04:11.590> this<00:04:11.739> is<00:04:11.860> not

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
mechanic so because this is not

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.800 
mechanic so because this is not
dispensing<00:04:12.519> it<00:04:12.640> it's<00:04:12.820> not<00:04:13.060> teleporting<00:04:13.720> you

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
dispensing it it's not teleporting you

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.680 
dispensing it it's not teleporting you
to<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.110> black<00:04:14.350> box<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.790> then<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.269> delays<00:04:16.660> a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
to that black box and then it delays a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.270 
to that black box and then it delays a
bit<00:04:17.019> of<00:04:17.109> time<00:04:17.290> and<00:04:17.530> then<00:04:17.680> teleports<00:04:18.220> you

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
bit of time and then teleports you

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.490 
bit of time and then teleports you
update<00:04:18.760> if<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:19.209> does<00:04:19.479> work<00:04:19.780> it<00:04:20.019> immediately

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
update if it does work it immediately

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.230 
update if it does work it immediately
teleports<00:04:21.130> you

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
teleports you

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.730 
teleports you
after<00:04:23.240> three<00:04:23.450> tix<00:04:23.690> there<00:04:23.990> is<00:04:24.080> no<00:04:24.350> longer

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
after three tix there is no longer

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.480 
after three tix there is no longer
anybody<00:04:25.280> in<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.580> three-block<00:04:25.820> radius<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.510> this

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
anybody in a three-block radius of this

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.480 
anybody in a three-block radius of this
so<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.850> won't<00:04:29.810> teleport<00:04:30.380> you<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:31.340> white

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
so it won't teleport you to the white

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.540 
so it won't teleport you to the white
box<00:04:31.840> that's<00:04:32.840> really<00:04:33.230> it's<00:04:33.590> an<00:04:33.740> incredible

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
box that's really it's an incredible

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.610 
box that's really it's an incredible
incredibly<00:04:35.060> simple<00:04:35.480> yet<00:04:35.960> very<00:04:36.260> very

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
incredibly simple yet very very

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.320 
incredibly simple yet very very
effective<00:04:37.130> way<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.280> test<00:04:37.610> this<00:04:37.760> some<00:04:37.970> reason

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
effective way to test this some reason

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.930 
effective way to test this some reason
one<00:04:38.750> point<00:04:38.960> eight<00:04:39.050> point<00:04:39.290> six<00:04:39.530> okay<00:04:40.520> so<00:04:40.580> let's

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
one point eight point six okay so let's

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.940 
one point eight point six okay so let's
really<00:04:41.120> look<00:04:41.210> at<00:04:41.540> how<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.110> change<00:04:42.530> game

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
really look at how to change game

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.350 
really look at how to change game
versions<00:04:43.490> get<00:04:44.120> very<00:04:44.360> very<00:04:44.990> very<00:04:45.290> quickly<00:04:45.620> very

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
versions get very very very quickly very

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.670 
versions get very very very quickly very
very<00:04:47.360> quickly<00:04:47.630> what<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.020> need<00:04:48.140> to<00:04:48.170> do<00:04:48.320> is<00:04:48.350> when

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
very quickly what you need to do is when

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.340 
very quickly what you need to do is when
you<00:04:48.770> get<00:04:48.980> to<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.730> minecraft<00:04:50.000> Launcher<00:04:50.510> over

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
you get to the minecraft Launcher over

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.290 
you get to the minecraft Launcher over
here<00:04:51.530> you'll<00:04:51.680> see<00:04:51.770> you've<00:04:52.010> got<00:04:52.100> a<00:04:52.160> profile<00:04:52.610> you

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
here you'll see you've got a profile you

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.940 
here you'll see you've got a profile you
can<00:04:53.570> then<00:04:53.720> create<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:54.050> new<00:04:54.260> profile<00:04:54.680> which<00:04:54.800> i'm

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
can then create a new profile which i'm

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.470 
can then create a new profile which i'm
not<00:04:54.980> actually<00:04:55.340> going<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.670> do<00:04:55.790> okay<00:04:56.270> but<00:04:56.330> you

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
not actually going to do okay but you

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.260 
not actually going to do okay but you
can<00:04:56.630> create<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:56.900> new<00:04:56.960> profile<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:58.430> then<00:04:58.970> let's

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
can create a new profile and then let's

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.940 
can create a new profile and then let's
just<00:04:59.450> say<00:04:59.600> Drake<00:04:59.990> knows<00:05:00.110> one<00:05:00.260> let's<00:05:00.710> just<00:05:00.830> go

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
just say Drake knows one let's just go

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.150 
just say Drake knows one let's just go
to<00:05:01.010> one<00:05:01.220> point<00:05:01.670> eight<00:05:02.390> point<00:05:02.630> three<00:05:03.160> okay

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
to one point eight point three okay

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.560 
to one point eight point three okay
you'll<00:05:04.310> get<00:05:04.490> this<00:05:04.670> little<00:05:04.880> box<00:05:05.240> over<00:05:05.540> here

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
you'll get this little box over here

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.680 
you'll get this little box over here
which<00:05:05.810> allow<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.140> to<00:05:06.320> add<00:05:07.280> a<00:05:07.580> name<00:05:08.210> for<00:05:08.510> at<00:05:08.600> the

here<00:07:05.230> and<00:07:06.230> it'll<00:07:06.890> just<00:07:07.010> dispense<00:07:07.550> and<00:07:07.820> play

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
here and it'll just dispense and play

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.000 
here and it'll just dispense and play
and<00:07:08.620> run<00:07:09.620> the<00:07:09.860> game<00:07:10.070> as<00:07:10.780> it<00:07:11.780> should<00:07:12.290> but<00:07:12.830> as<00:07:12.920> you

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010 
and run the game as it should but as you

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.710 
and run the game as it should but as you
can<00:07:13.070> see<00:07:13.250> that<00:07:13.490> no<00:07:13.730> longer<00:07:13.940> works<00:07:14.150> because<00:07:14.690> it

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
can see that no longer works because it

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.750 
can see that no longer works because it
now<00:07:15.050> just<00:07:15.290> dispensers<00:07:15.980> come<00:07:16.250> on<00:07:16.370> blocks<00:07:16.580> and

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
now just dispensers come on blocks and

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.370 
now just dispensers come on blocks and
this<00:07:16.910> is<00:07:17.090> why<00:07:17.240> I<00:07:17.270> had<00:07:17.570> to<00:07:17.600> come<00:07:17.750> up<00:07:17.900> with<00:07:17.930> a<00:07:18.200> way

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:18.380 
this is why I had to come up with a way

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.610 
this is why I had to come up with a way
of<00:07:18.410> forcing<00:07:19.400> people<00:07:19.580> to<00:07:20.080> play<00:07:21.080> it<00:07:21.320> in<00:07:21.500> that

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:21.620 
of forcing people to play it in that

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.280 
of forcing people to play it in that
particular<00:07:21.830> version<00:07:22.580> I<00:07:22.820> mean<00:07:23.690> I<00:07:23.720> will<00:07:24.050> not<00:07:24.170> be

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.290 
particular version I mean I will not be

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.140 
particular version I mean I will not be
updating<00:07:24.710> this<00:07:24.740> because<00:07:25.070> it<00:07:25.190> is<00:07:25.220> just<00:07:25.640> a<00:07:25.820> troop

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.150 
updating this because it is just a troop

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.120 
updating this because it is just a troop
basically<00:07:26.750> means<00:07:26.930> i<00:07:27.080> have<00:07:27.110> to<00:07:27.230> recreate<00:07:27.770> the

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.130 
basically means i have to recreate the

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.190 
basically means i have to recreate the
whole<00:07:28.310> map<00:07:28.490> or<00:07:28.700> the<00:07:29.090> whole<00:07:29.240> mechanics<00:07:29.750> pretty

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:30.200 
whole map or the whole mechanics pretty

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.740 
whole map or the whole mechanics pretty
much<00:07:30.320> from<00:07:30.530> the<00:07:30.650> start<00:07:30.910> and<00:07:31.910> come<00:07:32.450> up<00:07:32.570> with<00:07:32.720> a

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750 
much from the start and come up with a

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.930 
much from the start and come up with a
whole<00:07:32.810> new<00:07:32.930> way<00:07:33.500> of<00:07:33.530> doing<00:07:33.710> us<00:07:33.980> i<00:07:34.130> mean<00:07:34.520> i<00:07:34.610> have

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:34.940 
whole new way of doing us i mean i have

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.040 
whole new way of doing us i mean i have
used<00:07:35.120> it<00:07:35.270> for<00:07:35.390> randomization<00:07:35.960> but

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.050 
used it for randomization but

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.360 
used it for randomization but
randomization<00:07:36.680> is<00:07:36.740> for<00:07:36.920> me<00:07:37.010> not<00:07:37.100> a<00:07:37.160> big<00:07:37.340> issue

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:37.370 
randomization is for me not a big issue

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.730 
randomization is for me not a big issue
we<00:07:38.090> do<00:07:38.300> have<00:07:38.450> the<00:07:38.570> entities<00:07:38.900> at<00:07:39.050> our<00:07:39.260> which<00:07:39.530> is
