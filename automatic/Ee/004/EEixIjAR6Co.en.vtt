00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
there needs to be some sort of

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.320 
there needs to be some sort of
sensitivity<00:04:28.930> training<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:30.550> then<00:04:30.700> cops<00:04:30.970> need

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
sensitivity training and then cops need

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.200 
sensitivity training and then cops need
constant<00:04:31.890> retraining<00:04:32.890> to<00:04:33.430> teach<00:04:33.700> them<00:04:34.000> that

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
constant retraining to teach them that

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.110 
constant retraining to teach them that
lethal<00:04:34.630> force<00:04:34.960> is<00:04:35.200> a<00:04:35.650> last<00:04:36.070> option<00:04:36.370> we<00:04:37.030> were

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
lethal force is a last option we were

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.880 
lethal force is a last option we were
saying<00:04:37.330> like<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:38.260> was<00:04:38.470> completely

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
saying like it was completely

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.400

and even after he was shot he demanded

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.580 
and even after he was shot he demanded
