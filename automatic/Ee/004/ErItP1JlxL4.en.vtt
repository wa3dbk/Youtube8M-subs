dake<00:03:13.370> extensively<00:03:14.370> my<00:03:14.640> dad<00:03:14.850> has<00:03:15.090> been<00:03:15.120> through

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
dake extensively my dad has been through

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.640 
dake extensively my dad has been through
the<00:03:17.010> through<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.430> Bible<00:03:18.080> ministry<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.260> the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
the through the Bible ministry of the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.949 
the through the Bible ministry of the
late<00:03:19.950> dr.<00:03:20.400> McGee<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.970> think<00:03:21.120> three<00:03:21.300> times<00:03:21.600> now

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
late dr. McGee I think three times now

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.000 
late dr. McGee I think three times now
and<00:03:22.610> as<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.700> know<00:03:23.820> they<00:03:24.030> are<00:03:24.239> five<00:03:24.540> years<00:03:25.010> some

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
and as you know they are five years some

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.500 
and as you know they are five years some
I<00:03:26.040> think<00:03:26.280> he's<00:03:26.430> either<00:03:26.550> going<00:03:26.820> used<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.270> start

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
I think he's either going used to start

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.140 
I think he's either going used to start
the<00:03:27.660> third<00:03:27.900> third<00:03:28.830> season<00:03:29.370> now<00:03:29.520> I<00:03:29.550> believe<00:03:29.910> so

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
the third third season now I believe so

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.800 
the third third season now I believe so
he's<00:03:30.300> five-ten<00:03:31.190> about<00:03:32.190> 11<00:03:32.880> years<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.660> he's

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
he's five-ten about 11 years in so he's

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.300 
he's five-ten about 11 years in so he's
been<00:03:33.959> say<00:03:34.140> about<00:03:34.350> 10<00:03:34.590> years<00:03:34.950> now

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
been say about 10 years now

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.270 
been say about 10 years now
but<00:03:35.730> anyway<00:03:36.000> McGee<00:03:36.870> does<00:03:37.380> quote<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:38.150> dake

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
but anyway McGee does quote a dake

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.600 
but anyway McGee does quote a dake
exclusively<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.550> say<00:03:42.120> he<00:03:42.360> was<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.570> Pentecostal

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
exclusively and say he was a Pentecostal

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.210 
exclusively and say he was a Pentecostal
so<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:44.970> feel<00:03:45.510> he<00:03:45.660> gets<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.130> dispensations<00:03:47.130> in

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
so I feel he gets the dispensations in

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.540 
so I feel he gets the dispensations in
the<00:03:47.310> wrong<00:03:47.489> place<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:49.040> Robbins<00:03:50.040> gonna<00:03:50.310> quit

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
the wrong place and Robbins gonna quit

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.750 
the wrong place and Robbins gonna quit
that<00:03:51.260> there's<00:03:52.260> also<00:03:52.470> been<00:03:52.800> some<00:03:53.070> controversy

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
that there's also been some controversy

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.170 
that there's also been some controversy
on<00:03:54.739> what<00:03:55.739> they<00:03:55.980> believe<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:56.970> day<00:03:57.150> of

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
on what they believe that the day of

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.880 
on what they believe that the day of
Christ<00:03:58.310> seen<00:03:59.310> some<00:03:59.700> sites<00:04:00.470> which<00:04:01.470> suggests

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
Christ seen some sites which suggests

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.729 
Christ seen some sites which suggests
that<00:04:01.980> he<00:04:02.070> didn't<00:04:02.340> believe<00:04:02.550> that<00:04:02.580> Jesus<00:04:03.090> is<00:04:03.900> God

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
that he didn't believe that Jesus is God

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.360 
that he didn't believe that Jesus is God
Almighty

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
Almighty

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.440

and<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:06.630> think<00:04:07.530> John<00:04:07.950> chapter<00:04:08.430> 1<00:04:08.610> might<00:04:08.850> help<00:04:09.239> us

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
and I think John chapter 1 might help us

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.259 
and I think John chapter 1 might help us
