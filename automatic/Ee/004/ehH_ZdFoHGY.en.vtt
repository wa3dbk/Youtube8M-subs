source<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.619> eat<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.970> specifically<00:01:27.540> what

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
source to eat so specifically what

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.560 
source to eat so specifically what
vegetable<00:01:28.350> II<00:01:28.409> well<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.299> wouldn't<00:01:30.299> recommend

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
vegetable II well I wouldn't recommend

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.069 
vegetable II well I wouldn't recommend
just<00:01:31.110> eating<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.740> vegetable<00:01:33.079> obviously

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
just eating one vegetable obviously

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.270 
just eating one vegetable obviously
because<00:01:34.380> different<00:01:34.770> vegetables<00:01:35.100> have

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
because different vegetables have

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.240 
because different vegetables have
different<00:01:35.310> nutrient<00:01:36.470> mix<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.009> there's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
different nutrient mix up so there's

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.429 
different nutrient mix up so there's
different<00:01:38.509> nutrients<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:39.600> spinach<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
different nutrients from spinach and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.440 
different nutrients from spinach and
different<00:01:41.009> nutrients<00:01:41.400> from<00:01:41.490> carrots<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
different nutrients from carrots you

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.149 
different nutrients from carrots you
don't<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.409> nutrients<00:01:43.860> from<00:01:43.920> just

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
don't get all the nutrients from just

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.540 
don't get all the nutrients from just
one<00:01:44.399> bed<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:45.119> there's<00:01:45.360> no

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
one bed or there's no

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.010 
one bed or there's no
that<00:01:46.060> idea<00:01:46.690> that<00:01:46.780> can<00:01:47.320> give<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:47.590> everything

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
that idea that can give you everything

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.600 
that idea that can give you everything
so<00:01:50.020> some<00:01:50.380> people<00:01:50.500> take<00:01:50.740> multivitamins

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
so some people take multivitamins

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.370 
so some people take multivitamins
so<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.150> multivitamins<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.870> you<00:01:52.960> take<00:01:53.200> will

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
so the multivitamins that you take will

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.530 
so the multivitamins that you take will
give<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:53.710> probably<00:01:54.280> your<00:01:54.490> daily<00:01:54.820> value<00:01:55.180> with

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
give you probably your daily value with

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.820 
give you probably your daily value with
everything<00:01:55.930> but<00:01:56.080> you<00:01:56.200> still<00:01:56.440> need<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.800> eat

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
everything but you still need to eat

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.980 
everything but you still need to eat
vegetables<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.790> get<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.090> natural<00:01:58.360> source

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
vegetables to get that natural source

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.230 
vegetables to get that natural source
that<00:01:59.710> non-synthetic<00:02:00.370> source<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.150> the

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
that non-synthetic source of the

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.930 
that non-synthetic source of the
vitamins<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:01.810> minerals<00:02:02.050> so<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.250> one<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:03.640> I

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
vitamins and minerals so the one that I

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.170 
vitamins and minerals so the one that I
eat<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.420> most<00:02:04.630> of<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:06.100> pretty<00:02:06.940> much<00:02:07.120> a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180
