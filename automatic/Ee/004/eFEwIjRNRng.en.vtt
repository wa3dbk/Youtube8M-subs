it's<00:02:47.239> not<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.480> best<00:02:47.690> thing<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.230> I'm<00:02:48.830> going<00:02:48.980> to

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
it's not the best thing but I'm going to

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.190 
it's not the best thing but I'm going to
put<00:02:49.280> probably<00:02:50.090> my<00:02:50.330> old<00:02:50.510> competitor<00:02:51.050> in<00:02:51.110> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
put probably my old competitor in the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.940 
put probably my old competitor in the
back<00:02:51.379> just<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.739> hold<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.069> in<00:02:52.160> place<00:02:52.250> for<00:02:52.370> now

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
back just to hold it in place for now

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.550 
back just to hold it in place for now
I'm<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.280> get<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.459> new<00:02:55.640> piece<00:02:55.849> of<00:02:55.910> MDF<00:02:56.599> I'm

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
I'm going to get a new piece of MDF I'm

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.699 
I'm going to get a new piece of MDF I'm
gonna<00:02:57.709> get<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:57.920> cut<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.190> fit<00:02:58.640> perfectly<00:02:59.150> and

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
gonna get it cut to fit perfectly and

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.990 
gonna get it cut to fit perfectly and
I'm<00:03:00.709> going<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.980> make<00:03:01.190> sure<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.489> measurements

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
I'm going to make sure the measurements

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.369 
I'm going to make sure the measurements
are<00:03:02.120> right<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.629> everything<00:03:03.080> is<00:03:03.170> going<00:03:03.319> to

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
are right and everything is going to

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.710 
are right and everything is going to
look<00:03:03.500> nice<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:03.739> smooth<00:03:04.190> I'm<00:03:04.879> I<00:03:05.209> still<00:03:05.569> need

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
look nice and smooth I'm I still need

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.540 
look nice and smooth I'm I still need
distribution<00:03:06.320> blocks<00:03:06.530> for<00:03:06.740> the<00:03:06.830> power<00:03:07.040> and

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
distribution blocks for the power and

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.110 
distribution blocks for the power and
the<00:03:07.820> ground<00:03:08.230> shorter<00:03:09.230> ground<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.710> better<00:03:10.120> so

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
the ground shorter ground the better so

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.280 
the ground shorter ground the better so
I<00:03:11.690> gotta<00:03:11.960> take<00:03:12.110> care<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.500> pretty<00:03:12.740> soon

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.259 

instead<00:03:15.920> of<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.129> zero<00:03:16.370> gauge<00:03:16.610> we<00:03:16.879> got<00:03:17.000> four

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
instead of the zero gauge we got four

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.089 
instead of the zero gauge we got four
gauge<00:03:17.480> sitting<00:03:17.930> real<00:03:18.110> nice<00:03:18.319> in<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.560> MV<00:03:18.860> core

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
gauge sitting real nice in the MV core

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.780 
gauge sitting real nice in the MV core
for<00:03:20.090> engagement<00:03:20.329> Sony

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.550 

the<00:03:25.790> Sony's<00:03:26.180> just<00:03:26.420> kind<00:03:27.050> of<00:03:27.080> sitting<00:03:27.380> in<00:03:27.470> the

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
the Sony's just kind of sitting in the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.490 
the Sony's just kind of sitting in the
air<00:03:27.680> right<00:03:27.890> now<00:03:27.920> which<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:29.260> know<00:03:30.260> it's<00:03:30.380> not

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
air right now which you know it's not

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.780 
air right now which you know it's not
the<00:03:30.650> best<00:03:30.830> but<00:03:30.980> like<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.370> said<00:03:31.430> this<00:03:31.610> is<00:03:31.760> just

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
the best but like I said this is just

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.080 
the best but like I said this is just
temporary<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.540> did<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:32.990> whole<00:03:33.170> setup<00:03:33.410> from

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
temporary I did this whole setup from

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.670 
temporary I did this whole setup from
took<00:03:35.090> me<00:03:35.180> about<00:03:35.330> five<00:03:35.570> hours<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:36.110> cut<00:03:36.350> and

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
took me about five hours to cut and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.350 
took me about five hours to cut and
solder<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.220> get<00:03:37.310> everything<00:03:37.520> right<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.060> had

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
solder and get everything right I had

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.360 
solder and get everything right I had
started<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.140> day<00:03:39.260> before<00:03:39.620> but<00:03:39.770> it<00:03:39.920> poured<00:03:40.190> on

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
started the day before but it poured on

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.480 
started the day before but it poured on
us<00:03:40.550> so<00:03:41.450> we<00:03:41.480> had<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.810> cut<00:03:41.960> it<00:03:42.080> short<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.280> got

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
us so we had to cut it short so I got

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.640 
us so we had to cut it short so I got
all<00:03:43.610> my<00:03:43.640> signal<00:03:44.120> all<00:03:44.720> my<00:03:44.900> signals<00:03:45.200> coming<00:03:45.530> from

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
all my signal all my signals coming from

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.680 
all my signal all my signals coming from
one<00:03:45.950> side<00:03:46.600> grounds<00:03:47.600> coming<00:03:47.900> from<00:03:47.990> the<00:03:48.140> other

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
one side grounds coming from the other

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.380 
one side grounds coming from the other
so<00:03:51.490> yeah<00:03:52.490> I<00:03:52.520> need<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.820> figure<00:03:53.030> out<00:03:53.120> how<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.210> put

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
so yeah I need to figure out how to put

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.870 
so yeah I need to figure out how to put
a<00:03:53.420> cover<00:03:53.660> on<00:03:53.870> that<00:03:54.020> because<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.350> don't<00:03:54.650> like<00:03:54.920> you

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
a cover on that because I don't like you

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.699 
a cover on that because I don't like you
know<00:03:56.000> they're<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:56.720> mean<00:03:56.900> they're<00:03:57.050> so<00:03:57.320> close<00:03:57.560> to

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
know they're I mean they're so close to

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.080 
know they're I mean they're so close to
touching<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.160> positive<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:58.700> negative<00:03:58.970> right

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
touching the positive and negative right

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.370 
touching the positive and negative right
there<00:03:59.270> if<00:03:59.360> it<00:03:59.420> falls<00:03:59.660> down<00:03:59.870> or<00:03:59.900> anything<00:04:00.170> like

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
there if it falls down or anything like

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.370 
there if it falls down or anything like
that<00:04:00.440> it's<00:04:00.770> it's<00:04:01.070> it's<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.150> real<00:04:02.380> hazardous

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
that it's it's it's a real hazardous

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.050 
that it's it's it's a real hazardous
thing<00:04:03.590> but<00:04:03.830> I'll<00:04:04.190> clean<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.430> up<00:04:04.610> guys<00:04:04.820> don't

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
thing but I'll clean it up guys don't

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.820 
thing but I'll clean it up guys don't
worry<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.450> know<00:04:05.600> it<00:04:05.810> looks<00:04:05.959> amateurish<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.709> all

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
worry I know it looks amateurish and all

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.770 
worry I know it looks amateurish and all
that<00:04:07.370> but<00:04:07.610> it's<00:04:08.360> gonna<00:04:08.480> be<00:04:08.570> all

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
that but it's gonna be all

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.760

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
right so I have my relay but I haven't

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.340 
right so I have my relay but I haven't
installed<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.370> relay<00:04:13.640> because<00:04:13.850> I<00:04:14.390> need<00:04:15.170> to

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
installed the relay because I need to

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.500 
installed the relay because I need to
place<00:04:15.830> it<00:04:15.860> somewhere<00:04:16.280> where<00:04:17.030> would<00:04:17.269> fit

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
place it somewhere where would fit

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.530 
place it somewhere where would fit
nicely<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:19.370> need<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.640> drill<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.359> need

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
nicely and I need a drill and I need

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.990 
nicely and I need a drill and I need
time<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:21.140> I<00:04:21.260> need<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.890> know<00:04:22.010> preparation<00:04:22.880> for

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
time and I need you know preparation for

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.300 
time and I need you know preparation for
all<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.240> stuff<00:04:23.480> so<00:04:24.470> as<00:04:24.590> soon<00:04:24.740> as<00:04:24.890> I<00:04:24.950> get<00:04:25.100> that

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
all the stuff so as soon as I get that

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.850 
all the stuff so as soon as I get that
there'll<00:04:25.700> be<00:04:25.730> a<00:04:25.820> video<00:04:26.090> of<00:04:26.240> that<00:04:26.830> but<00:04:27.830> uh

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
there'll be a video of that but uh

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.230 
there'll be a video of that but uh
there's<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:28.640> shot<00:04:28.910> of<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.120> amps<00:04:29.510> hooked<00:04:30.470> up

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.090 

ground<00:04:33.690> cables<00:04:34.199> and<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:36.930> think<00:04:37.919> this<00:04:38.070> looks

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
ground cables and I think this looks

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.370 
ground cables and I think this looks
pretty<00:04:38.310> sweet<00:04:38.699> as<00:04:39.240> far<00:04:39.509> as<00:04:39.630> how<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.810> fuse<00:04:40.139> goes

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
pretty sweet as far as how the fuse goes

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.010

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
from one of the cables or just barely

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.870 
from one of the cables or just barely
and<00:06:28.289> that's<00:06:28.560> the<00:06:28.860> only<00:06:29.099> signal<00:06:29.400> I<00:06:29.430> was<00:06:29.610> getting
