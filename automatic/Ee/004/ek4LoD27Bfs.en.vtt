bigger headrests as I mentioned so
here's<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> back-to-back<00:01:35.240> comparison<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
here's a back-to-back comparison or a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.630 
here's a back-to-back comparison or a
side<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.750> side<00:01:36.900> comparison<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.100> view<00:01:38.400> out

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
side to side comparison of the view out

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.719 
side to side comparison of the view out
of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> rear<00:01:39.119> view<00:01:39.150> mirror<00:01:39.600> from<00:01:40.380> my<00:01:40.409> p85<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
of the rear view mirror from my p85 and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.630 
of the rear view mirror from my p85 and
from<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> p85<00:01:42.600> d<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.590> you'll<00:01:43.829> see<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
from the p85 d and so you'll see the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.399 
from the p85 d and so you'll see the
visibility<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.360> pretty<00:01:45.720> significantly

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409

reduced<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:48.659> other<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.170> frunk<00:01:49.500> i

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
reduced the other one is the frunk i

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.760 
reduced the other one is the frunk i
said<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.220> frunk<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.579> smaller<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.899> took<00:01:52.350> some

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
said the frunk is smaller I took some

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.590 
said the frunk is smaller I took some
measurements<00:01:52.920> today<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:55.100> existing<00:01:56.100> front

the<00:02:20.580> bottom<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.180> it's<00:02:21.510> roughly<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.930> third

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
the bottom so it's roughly a third

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.080 
the bottom so it's roughly a third
smaller<00:02:23.040> plus<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.270> lose<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.990> microwave<00:02:26.090> so

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
smaller plus you lose the microwave so

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.340 
smaller plus you lose the microwave so
there<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.660> go<00:02:27.720> for<00:02:28.020> what<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.230> worth<00:02:30.350> right

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
there you go for what it's worth right

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.880 
there you go for what it's worth right
last<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:32.940> not<00:02:33.180> least<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:33.990> come<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
last but not least we come to the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.490 
last but not least we come to the
acceleration<00:02:35.670> test<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.600> last<00:02:36.810> video<00:02:37.050> I

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
acceleration test on the last video I

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.910 
acceleration test on the last video I
said<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.730> p85<00:02:39.120> d<00:02:39.540> didn't<00:02:40.080> feel<00:02:40.350> any<00:02:40.590> quicker

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
said the p85 d didn't feel any quicker

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.550 
said the p85 d didn't feel any quicker
than<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.400> p85<00:02:41.760> now<00:02:42.690> I've<00:02:42.900> had<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.260> two

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
than the p85 now I've had this for two

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.350 
than the p85 now I've had this for two
years<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.100> I've<00:02:44.460> had<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.000> drag<00:02:45.210> strip

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
years and I've had it on the drag strip

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.140 
years and I've had it on the drag strip
so<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.380> know<00:02:46.620> what<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.250> thing<00:02:47.490> is<00:02:47.520> capable<00:02:48.030> of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
so I know what this thing is capable of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.620 
so I know what this thing is capable of
and<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.450> know<00:02:48.480> what<00:02:49.190> four<00:02:50.190> point<00:02:50.630> something

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
and I know what four point something

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.210 
and I know what four point something
feels<00:02:51.900> like<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:54.300> in<00:02:54.690> insane<00:02:55.530> mode<00:02:55.890> on

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
feels like in this so in insane mode on

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.180 
feels like in this so in insane mode on
Saturday<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.330> didn't<00:02:57.900> think<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.170> p85<00:02:58.500> d<00:02:58.860> felt

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
Saturday I didn't think the p85 d felt

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.210 
Saturday I didn't think the p85 d felt
any<00:02:59.370> faster<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.150> thought<00:03:00.450> sport<00:03:01.050> mode<00:03:01.380> felt

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
any faster and I thought sport mode felt

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.110 
any faster and I thought sport mode felt
slower<00:03:02.970> than<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.730> suspected<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.880> was<00:03:05.940> due

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
slower than this I suspected it was due

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.360 
slower than this I suspected it was due
to<00:03:06.240> a<00:03:06.270> lack<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.540> charge<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.230> batteries<00:03:07.590> so

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
to a lack of charge in the batteries so

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.860 
to a lack of charge in the batteries so
I<00:03:08.400> did<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> test<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:10.940> initially<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.150> had<00:03:12.660> a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
I did a test on this initially I had a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.380 
I did a test on this initially I had a
seventy<00:03:13.260> percent<00:03:13.380> charge<00:03:13.860> in<00:03:14.130> my<00:03:14.250> p85<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.240> I

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
seventy percent charge in my p85 and I

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.320 
seventy percent charge in my p85 and I
did<00:03:15.630> several<00:03:16.020> zero<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.470> sixty<00:03:16.830> tests<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.550> the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
did several zero to sixty tests and the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.090 
did several zero to sixty tests and the
best<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.780> could<00:03:18.840> get<00:03:19.140> out<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.500> was<00:03:19.740> just

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
best I could get out of this was just

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.870 
best I could get out of this was just
over<00:03:20.430> 4.6<00:03:21.390> seconds<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.940> then<00:03:23.940> max<00:03:24.660> charged<00:03:25.290> it

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
over 4.6 seconds I then max charged it

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.450 
over 4.6 seconds I then max charged it
and<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:28.910> redid<00:03:29.910> though<00:03:30.330> 0-60<00:03:31.080> times<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.770> I<00:03:32.370> got

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
and I redid though 0-60 times and I got

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.320 
and I redid though 0-60 times and I got
it<00:03:32.760> down<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:32.940> 4.3<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.770> I<00:03:35.100> reckon<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:35.760> can<00:03:35.910> get<00:03:36.180> a

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
it down to 4.3 so I reckon you can get a

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.980 
it down to 4.3 so I reckon you can get a
third<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.110> second<00:03:37.650> extra<00:03:38.460> performance<00:03:38.990> by

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
third of a second extra performance by

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.050 
third of a second extra performance by
going<00:03:40.290> from<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.560> seventy<00:03:40.860> percent<00:03:40.950> charged<00:03:41.430> to

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
going from a seventy percent charged to

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.120 
going from a seventy percent charged to
a<00:03:42.090> hundred<00:03:42.450> percent<00:03:42.690> charge<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.740> I<00:03:43.980> was

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
a hundred percent charge and I was

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.070 
a hundred percent charge and I was
pretty<00:03:44.310> careful<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.880> try<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.180> recreate<00:03:45.660> the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
pretty careful to try and recreate the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.950 
pretty careful to try and recreate the
exact<00:03:46.410> same<00:03:46.650> conditions<00:03:47.160> every<00:03:47.340> time<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.780> that

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
exact same conditions every time so that

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.870 
exact same conditions every time so that
I'm<00:03:49.560> comments<00:03:50.070> that<00:03:50.190> that's<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.400> pretty<00:03:50.610> solid

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
I'm comments that that's a pretty solid

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.320 
I'm comments that that's a pretty solid
result<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.950> what<00:03:53.220> happened<00:03:53.460> with<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:53.610> p85<00:03:53.970> d

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
result so what happened with the p85 d

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.890 
result so what happened with the p85 d
well<00:03:54.690> we<00:03:54.900> went<00:03:55.050> back<00:03:55.200> today<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.520> had<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.900> 212

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
well we went back today and it had a 212

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.840 
well we went back today and it had a 212
mile<00:03:58.350> charge<00:03:58.740> which<00:03:59.040> still<00:03:59.310> isn't<00:03:59.460> a<00:03:59.610> hundred

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
mile charge which still isn't a hundred

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.480 
mile charge which still isn't a hundred
percent<00:03:59.940> but<00:04:00.360> it's<00:04:00.480> better<00:04:00.690> than<00:04:01.340> 150<00:04:02.340> or<00:04:02.460> so

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
percent but it's better than 150 or so

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.960 
percent but it's better than 150 or so
that<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.180> had<00:04:03.300> before<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.680> we<00:04:04.920> did<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.430> couple<00:04:05.790> of

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
that it had before so we did a couple of

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.950 
that it had before so we did a couple of
runs<00:04:06.210> and<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:08.190> results<00:04:08.700> were<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.480> managed<00:04:09.930> to

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
runs and the results were I managed to

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.010 
runs and the results were I managed to
get<00:04:12.110> 3.5<00:04:13.110> seconds<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.280> 60<00:04:14.610> what<00:04:15.450> was<00:04:15.660> most

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
get 3.5 seconds to 60 what was most

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.460 
get 3.5 seconds to 60 what was most
noticeable<00:04:16.799> was<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.420> initial<00:04:18.960> pull<00:04:19.320> away

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
noticeable was the initial pull away

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.360 
noticeable was the initial pull away
from<00:04:19.620> zero<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:21.299> combination<00:04:22.140> of<00:04:22.370> that

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
from zero and the combination of that

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.770 
from zero and the combination of that
extra<00:04:24.030> torque<00:04:24.270> near

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
extra torque near

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.990 
extra torque near
what<00:04:25.350> certainly<00:04:25.650> over<00:04:25.860> 900<00:04:26.430> foot-pounds<00:04:26.910> of

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
what certainly over 900 foot-pounds of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.680 
what certainly over 900 foot-pounds of
torque<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.540> that<00:04:28.290> all-wheel-drive<00:04:29.690> really

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
torque and that all-wheel-drive really

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.350 
torque and that all-wheel-drive really
does<00:04:30.990> boost<00:04:31.920> you<00:04:32.190> off<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.520> line<00:04:32.730> quite

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
does boost you off the line quite

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.450 
does boost you off the line quite
incredibly<00:04:34.050> initially<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.800> much<00:04:35.190> much

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
incredibly initially a much much

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.940 
incredibly initially a much much
stronger<00:04:35.820> than<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:37.260> that<00:04:37.440> power<00:04:37.650> then

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
stronger than this and that power then

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.820 
stronger than this and that power then
continues<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.730> build<00:04:38.910> so<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:39.870> managed<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.620> get

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
continues to build so I managed to get

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.280 
continues to build so I managed to get
not<00:04:41.550> quite<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:41.910> full<00:04:42.240> second<00:04:42.690> better<00:04:42.930> than<00:04:43.139> this

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
not quite a full second better than this

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.770 
not quite a full second better than this
but<00:04:43.560> point<00:04:43.860> eighth<00:04:44.010> of<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.250> second<00:04:44.639> and<00:04:45.480> it<00:04:45.630> was

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
but point eighth of a second and it was

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.200 
but point eighth of a second and it was
definitely<00:04:46.110> noticeable<00:04:47.040> so<00:04:47.700> here's<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:48.000> graph

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
definitely noticeable so here's a graph

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.510 
definitely noticeable so here's a graph
that<00:04:48.389> shows<00:04:48.450> those<00:04:48.780> different<00:04:49.169> runs<00:04:49.520> the

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
that shows those different runs the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.810 
that shows those different runs the
slowest<00:04:50.910> one<00:04:51.120> at<00:04:51.750> 4.6<00:04:52.500> seconds<00:04:53.010> is<00:04:53.360> my<00:04:54.360> p85<00:04:55.050> at

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
slowest one at 4.6 seconds is my p85 at

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.180 
slowest one at 4.6 seconds is my p85 at
a<00:04:56.820> better<00:04:57.330> seventy<00:04:57.870> percent<00:04:57.990> charged<00:04:58.440> 170

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
a better seventy percent charged 170

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.570 
a better seventy percent charged 170
miles<00:04:59.370> of<00:04:59.520> range<00:04:59.730> the<00:05:00.690> slightly<00:05:01.080> faster<00:05:01.580> 4.3

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
miles of range the slightly faster 4.3

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.930 
miles of range the slightly faster 4.3
second<00:05:03.060> run<00:05:03.270> is<00:05:03.600> the<00:05:03.660> same<00:05:04.230> car<00:05:04.530> at<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:04.940> hundred

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
second run is the same car at a hundred

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.480 
second run is the same car at a hundred
percent<00:05:06.210> charge<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.800> I<00:05:07.830> managed<00:05:08.100> to<00:05:08.130> knock<00:05:08.460> a

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
percent charge so I managed to knock a

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.330 
percent charge so I managed to knock a
third<00:05:08.760> of<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.910> second<00:05:09.270> off<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:10.290> final<00:05:10.710> graph<00:05:10.950> at

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
third of a second off the final graph at

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.240 
third of a second off the final graph at
3.5<00:05:12.270> seconds<00:05:13.080> is<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.320> p85<00:05:14.250> d<00:05:14.760> at<00:05:15.140> 212<00:05:16.140> miles<00:05:16.860> of

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
3.5 seconds is the p85 d at 212 miles of

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.300 
3.5 seconds is the p85 d at 212 miles of
range<00:05:17.490> so<00:05:18.419> there<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:19.020> go<00:05:19.080> definitive<00:05:20.010> proof

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
range so there you go definitive proof

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.850 
range so there you go definitive proof
that<00:05:20.600> certainly<00:05:21.600> with<00:05:22.020> me<00:05:22.260> as<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.590> driver

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
that certainly with me as the driver

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.680 
that certainly with me as the driver
doing<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.370> best<00:05:23.520> I<00:05:23.729> could<00:05:24.290> the<00:05:25.290> p85<00:05:25.740> d<00:05:26.220> is<00:05:26.690> very

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
doing the best I could the p85 d is very

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.010 
doing the best I could the p85 d is very
significantly<00:05:28.470> faster<00:05:28.680> than<00:05:28.979> the<00:05:29.070> p85<00:05:29.990> so<00:05:30.990> I

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
significantly faster than the p85 so I

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.260 
significantly faster than the p85 so I

p85 d runs the first half second of
footage<00:05:45.750> is<00:05:46.080> missing<00:05:46.470> but<00:05:47.310> then<00:05:47.490> they<00:05:47.669> will

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
footage is missing but then they will

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.570 
footage is missing but then they will
see<00:05:48.660> they<00:05:48.810> match<00:05:48.990> side-by-side<00:05:49.680> I've<00:05:50.340> also

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
see they match side-by-side I've also

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.719 
see they match side-by-side I've also
slowed<00:05:51.120> it<00:05:51.270> down<00:05:51.300> by<00:05:51.810> a<00:05:51.840> factor<00:05:52.200> of<00:05:52.410> five<00:05:52.860> so

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
slowed it down by a factor of five so

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.260 
slowed it down by a factor of five so
you<00:05:53.820> can<00:05:54.120> see<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.570> time<00:05:54.890> clicking<00:05:55.890> buy<00:05:56.130> it<00:05:57.060> is

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
you can see the time clicking buy it is

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:35.830 
you can see the time clicking buy it is
pretty<00:05:57.720> impressive

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.900
