00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
real pure so the Apple collaboration

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.959 
real pure so the Apple collaboration
honestly<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.410> was<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.850> of

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
honestly was was it was just one of

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.180 
honestly was was it was just one of
those<00:00:54.090> gifts<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.020> again<00:00:55.289> kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.770> happened

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
those gifts that again kind of happened

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.549 
those gifts that again kind of happened
it<00:00:56.340> was<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.329> was<00:00:57.539> whether<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.379> was

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
it was and I think it was whether it was

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.549 
it was and I think it was whether it was
coincidence<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:59.430> but<00:01:00.180> their<00:01:00.600> conference<00:01:01.410> was

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
coincidence or but their conference was
