00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.799
 hello dear people welcome to one 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.510
 new and thanks for turning it on 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.460
 Today I show you a new hairstyle 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.780
 I hope she succeeds you and is 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.579
 easy to imitate 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.410
 I explain you the whole step for 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:14.179
 step as always what you in any case 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.820
 you will need a few sensor 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.130
 second to be exact and hair ties 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.310
 then you need such a very thin one 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.750
 haargummi the can for example get in 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.100
 any pressure that exists 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.140
 really everywhere now 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.460
 they are so elastic but so 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.320
 unobtrusive as possible 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.200
 and of course you need it as well 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.480
 always a few bobby pins around the whole 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.520
 a little firmer and to fix and 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.710
 just go ahead you go on 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.980
 best a side vertex with her 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.239
 feels most comfortable and starts to 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.770
 how often and how do I do it? 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.590
 the hair behind the ear so that you me 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.149
 Do not disturb and I'll start that to myself 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.270
 I'm here again as always 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.510
 so little triangle maker and easy 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.579
 los lichen and that bad in me 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.220
 the technique of french pot that 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.620
 means I cross my strands above 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.140
 and only when I come from the bottom take 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.210
 I have a small party with the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.600
 I then cross the hair together as 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.299
 and a little strand to top again 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.580
 without clear intersecting and increasingly 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.140
 here again a little strand to it 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.909
 so that we keep the whole thing a little thinner 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.210
 we can take care of that if we can 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.100
 Hair is not quite consistent 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.990
 it does not mean we also have these hairs ever 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.299
 but we have to try 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.159
 really only at the lower part here 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.790
 to hold and take us only from there 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.990
 hair with 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:48.920
 So nice with the thumb off and 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.100
 Sweden try so all the time too 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.650
 hold 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.650
 and as I said only from under the hair 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.790
 to take and then form here 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.790
 with us 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.580
 and maybe we'll do it all the way 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.100
 not so far behind the ear 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.840
 a bit like that and then when we do that 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.900
 then perhaps with the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.500
 Just plait down so far 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.390
 braids are when her hair the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.550
 tear off the braided strands 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.100
 At the back, keep that about 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.660
 at least up to half of the head 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.330
 is enough and then we just take each other 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.190
 a thicker rubber and fix the 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.190
 strand so that it does not work anymore 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.270
 that's what it looks like and now 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.000
 of course we also on the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.400
 other side and then we both 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.120
 we have woven it 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.700
 rear nice to collect so and fix 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.270
 that with a halmi that is now 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:16.910
 comes these come this very thin 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:19.160
 namely, 1 and you have to 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.790
 take care yes there are also those 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.840
 break pretty fast 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.560
 but there are also some for example 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.540
 of the chives are there if you 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.850
 noticed there are always rubbers 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.830
 turn on household gums as well as for 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.510
 brown ones perfect for blonde hair 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.300
 fit and fit very well too 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.030
 because they are so nice 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.730
 such a little tip sex a bit 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.459
 funny tip but it just does it 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.180
 and that 's why you try it or you 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.950
 Just take 1 and combine 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.530
 makes two strands one that is 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.239
 in the two and does the hair ties 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:05.120
 get out of here and close the two 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:09.950
 strive to come up with this coming 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.709
 kept and nice stable 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.049
 so close the whole thing 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.580
 then look like this and you 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.769
 below 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.690
 Of course you can do this 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.350
 Just leave it as well now 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.540
 try or in which these hairs 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.600
 all down together and capture them 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.500
 with a day me of just that must yes 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.720
 Do not do it for example 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.940
 Have curly hair or even frizzy 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.790
 year that then holds almost by itself 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.590
 but if you are so silky smooth 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.750
 Hair then takes her son hair gum 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:47.110
 and fix that something down today 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:49.150
 about here that holds your hair 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.810
 just do something more together and help 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:57.690
 you now because we want the whole thing 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.690
 here and stick your hair here 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:09.970
 and to make sure that the hair too 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.670
 hold and do not just fall out 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.780
 suddenly we take now our 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:19.180
 bobby pins to reposition fixed so 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.480
 once left once right and once in 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.480
 the middle 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.139
 a page 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.199
 the other and maybe in 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:07.440
 the middle of it if you are a better one 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:09.840
 of course you can feel free 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.080
 still look that it is nicely distributed 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.620
 it does not look out that everything looks nice 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.490
 are fixed in it and that's nice 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.270
 stable if you still like it 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.270
 I do not like it 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.610
 Of course, 1000 percent will be satisfied 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:32.790
 otherwise you will be the whole day 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.280
 or evening about it zuckeln and 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.800
 think about what's down there 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.350
 actually happens because of it 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.040
 I wish I advise you 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:46.740
 always nice to fix everything and others 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.680
 that's all in here then you can 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:54.449
 of course, take out here and strÃ¤hnchen 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:56.850
 and make it all a little easier or 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:00.050
 Of course, you can also leave everything in it 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.050
 as you like 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.289
 and here you can of course one 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.130
 even before you braided let out 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:16.200
 these strands 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:21.020
 you do not have to be there in retrospect 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:23.490
 to get it all done that way and otherwise 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:27.419
 I hope that you succeed in the eat 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:30.060
 and also pleases and keeps beautiful 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.200
 So have fun imitating and me 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.150
 Hope you are her next time 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.889
 I'm always looking forward to seeing you again 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:38.010
 I am so happy about yours 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:39.660

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.389
