00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
see it's two parts so we're just going

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.959 
see it's two parts so we're just going
to<00:00:55.649> cut<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.100> part<00:00:56.340> I'm<00:00:56.579> not<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:56.910> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
to cut out this part I'm not going to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.729 
to cut out this part I'm not going to
layer<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.570> other<00:00:57.690> piece<00:00:57.930> behind<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.590> we'll

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
layer the other piece behind it so we'll

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.529 
layer the other piece behind it so we'll
just<00:00:58.920> cut<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.879> want<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> cut<00:01:00.329> more

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
just cut one if you want to cut more

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.000 
just cut one if you want to cut more
this<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.750> where<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.170> would<00:01:01.320> increase<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
this is where you would increase the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
this is where you would increase the
number<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.340> cuts<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:03.449> showing<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> crown<00:01:04.140> on

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
number of cuts here showing the crown on

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.710 
number of cuts here showing the crown on
my<00:01:04.320> mat<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.580> what<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> did<00:01:05.880> was<00:01:06.210> click<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
my mat and so what I did was click the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.020 
my mat and so what I did was click the
scanning<00:01:07.080> feature<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.189> scan<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.790> our

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
scanning feature so we can scan in our

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690 
scanning feature so we can scan in our
paper<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.659> cardstock<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.430> see

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
paper or cardstock and so now you see

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
paper or cardstock and so now you see
the<00:01:11.820> paper<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> screen<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.110> click

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the paper on the screen so I can click

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
the paper on the screen so I can click
and<00:01:13.740> drag<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.130> crown<00:01:14.369> wherever<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.970> want<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and drag the crown wherever I want it to

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.359 
and drag the crown wherever I want it to
be<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.080> these<00:01:16.259> features<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.799> great<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.340> use

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
be so these features are great to use

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
be so these features are great to use
when<00:01:17.729> you're<00:01:17.880> using<00:01:17.909> up<00:01:18.270> scraps<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.930> fabric<00:01:19.259> or

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
when you're using up scraps of fabric or

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.830 
when you're using up scraps of fabric or
paper<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.580> before<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.060> cut<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.390> want<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.720> adjust

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
paper so before we cut we want to adjust

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.080 
paper so before we cut we want to adjust
the<00:01:22.229> blade<00:01:22.530> depth<00:01:22.860> then<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.580> put<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the blade depth then we put it in the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
the blade depth then we put it in the
blade<00:01:24.299> housing<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.960> secure<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:25.799> then

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
blade housing and secure it down then

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.730 
blade housing and secure it down then
click<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.000> cut<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.479> hit<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> start<00:01:28.080> button<00:01:28.140> so

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
click on cut and hit the start button so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.870 
click on cut and hit the start button so
we're<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> let<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> machine<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.759> its

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
we're going to let the machine do its

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.280 
we're going to let the machine do its
thing<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> go<00:01:30.600> pretty<00:01:30.630> quickly

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
thing it's going to go pretty quickly

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.840 
thing it's going to go pretty quickly
because<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.579> Queen

little border designs I'm going to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.490 
little border designs I'm going to
choose<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.509> I'm<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.289> keep

choose one here and I'm going to keep

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.490 
choose one here and I'm going to keep
the<00:02:10.679> default<00:02:11.099> measurements<00:02:11.550> as<00:02:11.640> is

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
the default measurements as is

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.440 
the default measurements as is
and<00:02:12.590> use<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.190> scanning<00:02:13.520> feature<00:02:13.760> again<00:02:14.210> to

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
and use the scanning feature again to

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.300 
and use the scanning feature again to
scan<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:15.050> different<00:02:15.470> colored<00:02:15.740> scrap<00:02:16.100> of

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
scan in a different colored scrap of

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.430 
scan in a different colored scrap of
cardstock<00:02:16.850> that<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.030> want<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.390> use<00:02:17.570> now<00:02:18.410> I

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
cardstock that I want to use now I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.380 
cardstock that I want to use now I
already<00:02:18.980> know<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.370> default<00:02:19.820> size<00:02:20.120> is

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
already know that the default size is

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.660 
already know that the default size is
not<00:02:20.660> going<00:02:20.960> to<00:02:21.020> fit<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.290> my<00:02:21.650> scrap<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.250> can<00:02:22.430> see

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
not going to fit in my scrap you can see

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.420 
not going to fit in my scrap you can see
it's<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:22.940> lot<00:02:23.180> wider<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:24.290> because<00:02:24.950> I've<00:02:25.130> scanned

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
it's a lot wider so because I've scanned

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.030 
it's a lot wider so because I've scanned
in<00:02:25.640> my<00:02:25.790> cardstock<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.570> can<00:02:27.020> now<00:02:27.140> go<00:02:27.410> in<00:02:27.530> here<00:02:27.890> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
in my cardstock I can now go in here and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.010 
in my cardstock I can now go in here and
adjust<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.550> size<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.390> just<00:02:29.840> keep

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
adjust the size of this and just keep

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.690 
adjust the size of this and just keep
decreasing<00:02:30.709> it<00:02:30.800> until<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.220> see<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.580> it's

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
decreasing it until I see that it's

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.060 
decreasing it until I see that it's
within<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.270> edges<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.870> my<00:02:33.260> cardstock<00:02:33.560> scrap

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
within the edges of my cardstock scrap

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.980 
within the edges of my cardstock scrap
right<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.970> we're<00:02:35.150> going<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.330> put<00:02:35.570> it<00:02:35.660> where<00:02:35.870> we

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
right so we're going to put it where we

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.690 
right so we're going to put it where we
want<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.590> I'm<00:02:37.100> just<00:02:37.220> showing<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.550> with

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
want it and I'm just showing you with

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.400 
want it and I'm just showing you with
one<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.209> for<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.510> project<00:02:38.959> I've<00:02:39.080> cut<00:02:39.290> out

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
one but for this project I've cut out

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.060 
one but for this project I've cut out
two<00:02:39.740> at<00:02:40.070> first<00:02:40.459> set<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.600> cut<00:02:41.840> peel<00:02:42.740> it<00:02:42.890> back

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
two at first set it to cut peel it back

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.190 
two at first set it to cut peel it back
and<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.520> because<00:02:43.850> we<00:02:43.880> have<00:02:44.120> smaller<00:02:44.480> scraps<00:02:44.959> we

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
and so because we have smaller scraps we

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.900 
and so because we have smaller scraps we
have<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.470> piece<00:02:45.680> these<00:02:45.890> together<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.610> create

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
have to piece these together to create

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.479 
have to piece these together to create
the<00:02:47.390> little<00:02:47.540> headband<00:02:47.989> part<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:49.100> I'm<00:02:49.310> just

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
the little headband part and so I'm just

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.520 
the little headband part and so I'm just
using<00:02:49.670> glue<00:02:50.090> dots<00:02:50.360> because<00:02:50.660> they're<00:02:51.230> pretty

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
using glue dots because they're pretty

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.770 
using glue dots because they're pretty
sticky<00:02:52.100> they<00:02:52.610> will<00:02:52.790> hold<00:02:53.000> nicely<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:53.660> they

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
sticky they will hold nicely and they

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.510 
sticky they will hold nicely and they
don't<00:02:53.959> have<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.200> dry<00:02:54.440> but<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:54.830> can<00:02:55.010> use<00:02:55.160> double

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
don't have to dry but you can use double

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.610 
don't have to dry but you can use double
sided<00:02:55.730> tape<00:02:55.880> or<00:02:56.330> whatever<00:02:56.900> your<00:02:57.080> adhesive<00:02:57.350> of

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
sided tape or whatever your adhesive of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.699 
sided tape or whatever your adhesive of
choices<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.510> here's<00:02:59.810> two<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.110> them<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.590> I'm

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
choices so here's two of them and I'm

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.050 
choices so here's two of them and I'm
just<00:03:00.739> going<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.010> show<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.310> just<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.910> give<00:03:02.030> you

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
just going to show you just to give you

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.540 
just going to show you just to give you
the<00:03:02.209> idea<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.840> would<00:03:02.989> then<00:03:03.200> make<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.340> around

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
the idea you would then make it around

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.070
