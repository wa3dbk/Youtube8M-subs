00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.969
 to the wall before the mass runs or 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:15.980
 in case here before the texture it is that 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.110
 Will the garage be a texture then I 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.560
 I'll make the Senator's application. 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.770
 in this video then here is tex pitt is 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.689
 preparing the wall and applying sealer 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:37.180
 Thinking about trash is a good way to 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:37.180
 cut vichy deadline to make the graffiti 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:54.549
 Yes, yes, and works of art. 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:22.350
 this judgment it is half right that the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:26.360
 first using an easier air you 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.360
 strip the stones off the wall 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:58.920
 proof after having passed the spaces 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.980
 the island only passing trash is a grain sandpaper 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.800
 always and only to give a lamp in the 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.800
 sand with the wall 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.530
 good after plate 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.750
 We'll pass the broomstick . 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.860
 to get the dust out of the way 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.360
 the dust that is loose on the wall that is 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.200
 to clean before application 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.200
 from the senator 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:53.330
 The broom is gone and here I go. 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:57.720
 show that of the one who is your love 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:06.840
 sure is the contribution of 30 per 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:12.140
 cent will be applied as gold and 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:18.420
 from the top because the wall is rustic 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.739
 Okay, she's not ready and then to 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.510
 that it gets good 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.700
 the senator's penetration uses if a 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.740
 hair roller 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.930
 now I'm going to apply the seal to 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.930
 pain that is very simple 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.860
 i 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:55.370
 this process you do total will goes 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:07:01.330
 making up to complete is the whole wall 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:01.330
 always making good coverage 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:10.430
 for what was well sealed at the time the 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.830
 mass racing is all right all ok 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:18.890
 the senator you can work from 30 to 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:23.600
 50% sure dilution always a good 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:27.230
 quality does not get bad and this is 

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:35.120
 the senator's painting is already ready there 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:37.390
 to dry after receiving the mass 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.390
 running
