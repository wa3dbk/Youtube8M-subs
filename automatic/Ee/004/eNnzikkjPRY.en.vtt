doing this here I'm actually basically
creating<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.100> traffic<00:02:59.670> jam<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.959> have<00:03:01.140> to

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
creating a traffic jam and you have to

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.470 
creating a traffic jam and you have to
visualize<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:02.430> think<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:02.940> also<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.239> very

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
visualize I think this is also a very

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.800 
visualize I think this is also a very
important<00:03:03.959> thing<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:04.920> ballet<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.910> visualize

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
important thing in ballet to visualize

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.550 
important thing in ballet to visualize
so<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.850> have<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:09.000> tell<00:03:09.209> myself<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.930> my<00:03:10.080> muscles

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
so I have to tell myself and my muscles

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.600 
so I have to tell myself and my muscles
in<00:03:10.680> my<00:03:10.709> body<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:12.230> travel<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.950> same<00:03:14.190> if<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.430> was

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
in my body to travel the same if I was

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.640 
in my body to travel the same if I was
to<00:03:14.760> use<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.030> for<00:03:15.180> gone<00:03:15.329> of<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.799> travel<00:03:17.420> travel

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
to use it for gone of a travel travel

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.590 
to use it for gone of a travel travel
then<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.769> have<00:03:19.980> this<00:03:20.489> is<00:03:20.670> single<00:03:21.120> then<00:03:21.510> you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
then you have this is single then you
