00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.700
 the Sebastian call landing I'm 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.560
 fishing guide monitor 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.580
 it is a training that is approved by the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.980
 Ministry of Youth and Sports 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.650
 which allows me to propose 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.340
 fishing benefits voted here fishing 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.270
 crayfish for the general public 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.789
 also allow you to discover a region 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.439
 another way a territory that is 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.850
 sometimes poorly known since here you 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.260
 in the Marais Poitevin is not in 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.519
 this amazon ysebaert that everyone 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.439
 knows but in a mar party is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.029
 desiccated or also has the riches that's 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.759
 among others the wealth of fish 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.329
 crayfish because there was a 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.219
 who fell yesterday to the thumb that can 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.410
 to fall into the water ben it's raging and 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.610
 not another trophy clovis hugues 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.710
 lagrange and so is then train of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.489
 push back a yes yes and rewarding 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.700
 because we had good explanatory 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.960
 concerning the marsh poitevin et cetera 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.520
 crayfish nature is rewarding 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.920
 for the little ones and for the big ones like 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.989
 that and by doing that she pushes the water 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.399
 forward then it's a species that 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.570
 is highly undesirable actually 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.640
 since it has no place in 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.260
 the imaginary of the united states it poses of 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.130
 very strong imbalances aquatic night 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.360
 by making disappear 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.890
 obviously all the species that 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.510
 classically find like 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.430
 fish like insects to label 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 larvae of dragonflies or 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.299
 aquatic snails all this is in the process 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.560
 to disappear at great speed v go 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.280
 now eat a lot talked round 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.900
 by the storks by the european otter 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.430
 where other aquatic mammals 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.810
 it would take a lot more to 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.880
 happens to extinguish these populations it's 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.500
 really very good because in a few 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.299
 minutes the kids they already have in 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.369
 their except people have to give 10 euros 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.479
 to participate in the activity and then 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.490
 so they have to give a euro 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.939
 extra that allows them 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.600
 fishing stalemate that basically 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.170
 usable as part of services 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.180
 discoveries in the ground every 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.400
 benefits that I currently support 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.200
 according to 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 designed with the interregional park of 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.110
 marsh poitevin as part of a 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.180
 exit program called 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.370
 leaving way to discover the marsh and 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.970
 so there are fishing parties fishing at 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.440
 walk to discover also the fishing 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.300
 mullet for example fishing for 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.560
 crayfish and peach and 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.390
 then also I have a program in which 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.250
 there are pedestrian walks in 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.210
 bike so a partnership park 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.590
 Interregional Marais Poitevin 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.700
 the fishing guide monitor and the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.260
 tourist offices what makes it 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.280
 allows to propose on all 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.370
 territory where a whole series 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.330
 activities throughout the summer you can 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.430
 add 3 or 4 cm for the very big ones 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:34.959
 individuals were intentions because his 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.959
 cut and that thinks his thinking edwards
