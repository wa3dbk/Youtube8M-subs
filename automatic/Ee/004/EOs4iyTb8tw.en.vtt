 game discounts 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.120
 little things ended behind a white cardboard 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.970
 we remove the fence waiting for the main prize 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.750
 carton and carefully remove the large 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.250
 vintage style box 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.860
 by the way pay attention to the picture 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.500
 characters in red ties painfully 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.500
 remind fallout campaign posters 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.890
 the same pink blush and even curl 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.810
 hair is the same but without her box it's time 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.840
 get to main content 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:52.760
 figurines song holes in localization she 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:53.870
 a nightingale or just a bird and and yet 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.990
 to collect 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.160
 the figure is bolted with wire so 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.310
 cut and remove the parts themselves 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.670
 there are only 3 here it is a wingless animal 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.280
 on a pedestal and two wings turning and 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.470
 and bird 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.480
 take out the wings connect them together and 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.380
 finally stick them in a big pass to 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.220
 bird back 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.380
 until click by the way if you don't plan 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.360
 regularly assemble disassemble figure 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.340
 wings can be bonded to a pair of droplets 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.590
 superglue because here is the mount 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.120
 the clasp did not seem to us too 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.980
 reliably that's what happened in the end 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.320
 notice these claws on the wings 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.540
 look very fragile but they hardly 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.470
 whether it breaks with rubber or some 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.570
 soft plastic but the wings themselves are hard 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.000
 bird armor is very similar to dense skin 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.160
 we did not set it on fire for verification 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.310
 but the feeling that the skin is not real 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.040
 leaves us still look at her 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:03.609
 from different sides 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:05.769
 and the last thing left is a box with 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.409
 disk inside is predictable 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:13.150
 no surprises instruction manual 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:15.519
 Controller and drive circuit to itself it is possible to 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.109
 it would be finished but if we remember 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.220
 lies still premium edition 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:26.220
 let's open it and it will be faster 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:28.539
 cut the polyethylene box half empty 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.550
 funny whether they decided something not 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.680
 putting at the last moment if not the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.570
 figured out how to pack smaller 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.940
 the contents are already familiar Keychain yet 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.960
 one figure for the board game too 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.400
 Mechanic artbook with sketches the same as 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.419
 in a large collectibles 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.110
 and drive all the same box only 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:56.470
 x-box style acid green instruction 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.460
 for the xbox version of the game is already familiar 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.460
 postcard 3 flyers with codes 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:11.380
 soundtrack items for avatar clothes 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:13.539
 for booker and elizabeth take us 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.550
 itâ€™s time to end it would probably be worth it 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.590
 say that if bioshok infinite 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.930
 serious candidate for the game of the year then his 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.330
 collectible editions are just as serious 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.490
 claims to be the collector of the year 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.669
 above quality figure 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.909
 lots of nice little things and of course the game 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.740
 one hundred percent worthy of such 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:34.750
 serious edition 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:39.630
 gambling delighted 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.630
 on this all play only the best
