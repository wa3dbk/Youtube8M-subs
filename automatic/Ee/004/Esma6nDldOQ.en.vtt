empty five so we can do a real
simulation<00:03:28.069> feel<00:03:28.489> good<00:03:29.000> this<00:03:29.150> is<00:03:29.209> my<00:03:29.690> fault

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
simulation feel good this is my fault

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:37.150 
simulation feel good this is my fault
check<00:03:34.750> that<00:03:35.750> guarantee<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.290> there's<00:03:36.590> nothing
