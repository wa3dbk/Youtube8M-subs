00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
one of the most popular assault rifles

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.890 
one of the most popular assault rifles
it<00:00:26.010> was<00:00:26.189> definitely<00:00:26.550> my<00:00:26.820> favorites<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.779> it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
it was definitely my favorites and it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.200 
it was definitely my favorites and it
was<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> use<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.310> most<00:00:29.519> often<00:00:29.880> which

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
was the one I use the most often which

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.370 
was the one I use the most often which
is<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.779> FN<00:00:31.230> SCAR<00:00:31.740> H<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.300> sky<00:00:33.960> assault

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
is the FN SCAR H so the sky assault

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.170 
is the FN SCAR H so the sky assault
rifle<00:00:34.739> also<00:00:35.160> known<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> Special

so<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.820> guess<00:00:39.239> they<00:00:39.329> could<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.570> called<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.899> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.940

is<00:01:40.500> its<00:01:40.680> low<00:01:40.890> recoil<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.670> got<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> very<00:01:42.150> very

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
is its low recoil it's got a very very

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.999 
is its low recoil it's got a very very
tight<00:01:42.930> spread<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.500> bullets

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
tight spread of bullets

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.190 
tight spread of bullets
but<00:01:44.520> unfortunately<00:01:44.909> rate<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.750> fire<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.170> very

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
but unfortunately rate of fire is very

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.490 
but unfortunately rate of fire is very
slow<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.399> slow<00:01:47.640> fire<00:01:48.030> rate<00:01:48.090> weapon<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:49.259> all

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
slow it's a slow fire rate weapon of all

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.410

630 rounds per minute that's so consider

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
rifles in the game this obviously allows

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.670 
rifles in the game this obviously allows
you<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.459> wear<00:02:45.790> forget<00:02:46.269> about<00:02:46.380> optics<00:02:47.380> like<00:02:47.500> red

you to wear forget about optics like red

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.259 
you to wear forget about optics like red

unfortunate<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.299> does<00:02:52.420> have<00:02:52.569> that<00:02:52.720> very<00:02:52.989> slow

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
unfortunate it does have that very slow

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
play rate of 630 rounds per minute but I

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.780 
play rate of 630 rounds per minute but I
guess<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.290> does<00:02:56.410> help<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:57.040> keep<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.400> recoil

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
guess it does help to keep that recoil

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.460 
guess it does help to keep that recoil

quite drastically all the distance with
the<00:05:46.630> scar-h<00:05:46.960> meaning<00:05:47.830> you're<00:05:47.919> looking<00:05:48.160> at

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
the scar-h meaning you're looking at

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.700 
the scar-h meaning you're looking at
four<00:05:48.490> shots<00:05:48.760> to<00:05:48.910> kill<00:05:49.090> quite<00:05:49.930> close<00:05:50.230> ranges

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
four shots to kill quite close ranges

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.170 
four shots to kill quite close ranges
which<00:05:50.890> isn't<00:05:51.070> too<00:05:51.310> good<00:05:51.520> when<00:05:51.730> you<00:05:51.820> consider

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
which isn't too good when you consider

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.990 
which isn't too good when you consider
the<00:05:52.419> slow<00:05:53.169> rate<00:05:53.380> of<00:05:53.410> fire<00:05:53.530> so<00:05:54.430> I<00:05:54.460> can<00:05:54.700> mentioned

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
the slow rate of fire so I can mentioned

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.700 
the slow rate of fire so I can mentioned
in<00:05:55.120> all<00:05:55.240> the<00:05:55.330> other<00:05:55.450> episodes<00:05:55.630> so<00:05:56.230> far<00:05:56.290> in

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
in all the other episodes so far in

in all the other episodes so far in
these<00:05:56.860> little<00:05:57.190> guides<00:05:57.370> mostly<00:05:57.850> giving<00:05:58.030> a

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
these little guides mostly giving a

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.550 
these little guides mostly giving a
piece<00:05:58.270> of<00:05:58.480> recommended<00:05:58.990> equipment<00:05:59.440> they

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
piece of recommended equipment they

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.230 
piece of recommended equipment they
might<00:05:59.800> want<00:05:59.950> to<00:05:59.980> consider<00:06:00.310> with<00:06:00.580> the<00:06:00.760> weapon

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
might want to consider with the weapon

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.030 
might want to consider with the weapon
we're<00:06:01.480> looking<00:06:01.810> at<00:06:01.930> in<00:06:02.560> the<00:06:02.650> case<00:06:02.830> of<00:06:02.980> the

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
we're looking at in the case of the

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.830 
we're looking at in the case of the
scar-h<00:06:03.310> we've<00:06:03.790> we've<00:06:04.390> equipped<00:06:04.630> the

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
scar-h we've we've equipped the

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.810 
scar-h we've we've equipped the
scavenger<00:06:05.380> perk<00:06:05.590> in<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:05.919> first<00:06:06.160> tier<00:06:06.460> perk

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
scavenger perk in the first tier perk

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.360 
scavenger perk in the first tier perk
slot<00:06:07.060> so<00:06:07.510> a<00:06:07.750> good<00:06:08.230> equipment<00:06:08.800> choice<00:06:09.160> would<00:06:09.340> be

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
slot so a good equipment choice would be

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.040 
slot so a good equipment choice would be
the<00:06:09.520> Claymore<00:06:10.030> like<00:06:10.300> I<00:06:10.330> mentioned<00:06:10.780> with<00:06:10.840> the

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
the Claymore like I mentioned with the

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.710 
the Claymore like I mentioned with the
m4a1<00:06:11.860> in<00:06:12.580> warfare<00:06:13.090> -<00:06:13.270> we<00:06:13.390> can<00:06:13.510> obviously

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
m4a1 in warfare - we can obviously

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.810 
m4a1 in warfare - we can obviously
resupply<00:06:14.260> claymores<00:06:14.800> unlike<00:06:15.250> in<00:06:15.430> black<00:06:15.610> ops

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
resupply claymores unlike in black ops

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.730 
resupply claymores unlike in black ops
so<00:06:16.150> it<00:06:16.270> makes<00:06:16.450> sense<00:06:16.690> just<00:06:16.810> to<00:06:17.050> equipment

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
so it makes sense just to equipment

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.470 
so it makes sense just to equipment
claim<00:06:17.919> or<00:06:18.130> you<00:06:18.580> can<00:06:18.760> place<00:06:18.970> up<00:06:19.150> to<00:06:19.240> two<00:06:19.450> of

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
claim or you can place up to two of

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.760 
claim or you can place up to two of
these<00:06:19.660> things<00:06:19.930> down<00:06:20.110> at<00:06:20.260> any<00:06:20.320> one<00:06:20.500> time<00:06:20.530> and

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
these things down at any one time and

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.920 
these things down at any one time and
continuously<00:06:21.490> resupply<00:06:22.060> them<00:06:22.300> come<00:06:22.750> and<00:06:22.870> take

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
continuously resupply them come and take

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.780
