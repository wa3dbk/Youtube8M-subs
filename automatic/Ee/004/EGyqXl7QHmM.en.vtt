00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.070
 point 4 for your windows program for your 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.719
 pc in windows and well let's start 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.490
 first of all they have to leave the link 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.849
 want to leave in the description that would be 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.849
 this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.540
 here they download the file once 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.140
 have downloaded what they should do is 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.140
 open it 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.070
 here they begin to install the 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.840
 a program called minecraft damage 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.940
 next all 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.560
 next here you fuck if you want 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.340
 be with a direct access in the 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.430
 desk 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.720
 He said yes and then start installing 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.330
 I canceled it because I already have it 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.340
 and then what they have left is simply 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.630
 start playing the file now 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.680
 called minecraft that is in the 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.760
 desktop if I write the option for what 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.760
 create a shortcut 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.370
 here there will be 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.440
 well here I would load the page d 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.409
 of team extreme that would be a kind of 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.609
 dealer who created this game 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.819
 and good here is where they change the version 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:28.630
 that are going to play I have chosen the 1.6 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:29.840
 point 4 are from the 1.0 to the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.870
 last 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.790
 if you put 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.790
 your investment ballasts 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.320
 what happens is that it is updated but 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.680
 if you do not want 4.2 leave it alone 1.6 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.190
 point 4 that for what you came I think 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.790
 you leave that 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.450
 and well then wait profile 6 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.450
 profile 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.790
 well then they start playing here they put 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.790
 your username 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.670
 and here the tutorial for 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.490
 install the game and how to download it 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.680
 now comes a part of the tutorial that 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.420
 for 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.790
 machined for two people that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.390
 they asked for this and that it was for 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.319
 an earlier version and the 1.6 point 4 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.319
 to install LEDs 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.510
 good for this simply 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.310
 It is very simple but could not be 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.170
 understand so I 'm going to have to do it 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.680
 in video 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.680
 Y 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.379
 this is my minecraft 1.5 point 2 still 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.400
 I have it is to not mix the mods 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:50.510
 I just have it 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.090
 this folder is copied 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.989
 I do not forgive the copy here they were created 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.920
 Other users 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.690
 here to these users I mean not in 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.190
 the game but the users of your pc 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.710
 I for example have this one called 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.290
 Christ, let's pretend that I 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.710
 I access 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.900
 and I just pass the files of 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.510
 from one user to the other and so do not 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.500
 they would mix the mods since the 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.050
 game if they entered that was called for 1.5 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.880
 points 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.400
 With everyone 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.970
 and it has the 1.6 point 4 installed it reads 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.580
 for both games the two versions 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.350
 and they could not play any so why 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.350
 that's what I tell you this they two 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.790
 well here already ending tutorial I hope
