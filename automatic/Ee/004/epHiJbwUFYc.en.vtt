00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
experience may be different but i

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.200

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
three supply drops in this one game

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.240 
three supply drops in this one game
albeit<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.320> them<00:01:34.439> was<00:01:34.560> actually<00:01:34.710> from<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
albeit one of them was actually from the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
albeit one of them was actually from the
daily<00:01:35.490> supply<00:01:35.939> drop<00:01:36.210> challenge<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.750> had

daily supply drop challenge all you had

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.300 
daily supply drop challenge all you had
to<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.200> return<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> flag<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.040> that's<00:01:38.159> where

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
to do was return a flag so that's where

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.920 
to do was return a flag so that's where
one<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.549> them<00:01:38.700> came<00:01:38.939> from<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> other<00:01:39.600> two

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
one of them came from but the other two

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.749 
one of them came from but the other two
in<00:01:40.079> one<00:01:40.229> game<00:01:40.409> that's<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.009> rare<00:01:41.220> occurrence<00:01:41.640> in

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
in one game that's a rare occurrence in

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.819 
in one game that's a rare occurrence in
itself<00:01:42.090> two<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.810> game<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.259> definitely

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
itself two in one game I definitely

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.679 
itself two in one game I definitely
noticed<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> huge<00:01:44.549> increase<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> supply<00:01:45.360> drops

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
noticed a huge increase in supply drops

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.810 
noticed a huge increase in supply drops
once<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.960> started<00:01:46.290> varying<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.399> weapons

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
once I started varying up the weapons

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.700 
once I started varying up the weapons
that<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.000> use<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.479> bit<00:01:48.600> more<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.439> also

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
that I use a little bit more so I also

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.590 
that I use a little bit more so I also
heard<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.640> more<00:01:50.790> supply<00:01:51.119> drops<00:01:51.390> as

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
heard that you get more supply drops as

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.030 
heard that you get more supply drops as
a<00:01:51.630> lower<00:01:51.869> level<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.409> don't<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:53.009> if

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
a lower level I don't really know if

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.530 
a lower level I don't really know if
this<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.399> true<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:53.759> they<00:01:53.970> only<00:01:54.090> prestiged

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
this is true because they only prestiged

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.030 
this is true because they only prestiged
once<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.110> my<00:01:55.200> other<00:01:55.320> account<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:55.890> this

challenges then Supply Drop challenge
that's

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
that's

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.000 
that's
exactly<00:02:13.990> what<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.290> if<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.590> complete<00:02:14.980> that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
exactly what it is if you complete that

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.040 
exactly what it is if you complete that
challenge<00:02:15.580> right<00:02:15.760> there<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.390> get<00:02:16.570> one<00:02:16.750> supply

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
challenge right there you get one supply

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.870 
challenge right there you get one supply
dropping<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.650> then<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:17.920> resets<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.490> next<00:02:18.730> day

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
dropping and then it resets the next day

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.430 
dropping and then it resets the next day
so<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.150> get<00:02:19.210> another<00:02:19.480> chance<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.930> get<00:02:20.080> another

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
so you get another chance to get another

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.710 
so you get another chance to get another
supply<00:02:20.950> drop<00:02:21.280> from<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.940> challenge<00:02:22.510> so

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
supply drop from that challenge so

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.090 
supply drop from that challenge so
that's<00:02:22.990> what<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.140> was<00:02:23.260> going<00:02:23.470> for<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.740> this<00:02:23.890> game

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.420 
to capture the one flag Supply Drop
challenge<00:02:26.290> which<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.530> pretty<00:02:26.710> easy<00:02:26.800> one<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.310> my

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
challenge which is pretty easy one in my

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.250 
challenge which is pretty easy one in my
opinion<00:02:27.790> but<00:02:27.970> some<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.480> them<00:02:28.600> are<00:02:28.720> not<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:28.870> easy

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
opinion but some of them are not so easy

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.660 
opinion but some of them are not so easy
they're<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> little<00:02:29.740> bit<00:02:29.980> tedious<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:30.430> you

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
they're a little bit tedious but you

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.310 
they're a little bit tedious but you
just<00:02:30.880> do<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.510> be<00:02:31.660> honest<00:02:32.020> if<00:02:32.170> you're

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
just do it to be honest if you're

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.870 
just do it to be honest if you're
interested<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:32.920> getting<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.250> little<00:02:33.370> wet<00:02:33.580> ins<00:02:33.760> I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
interested in getting a little wet ins I

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.490 
interested in getting a little wet ins I
don't<00:02:34.030> know<00:02:34.120> why<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.390> wouldn't<00:02:34.720> do<00:02:34.960> this<00:02:35.170> most

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
don't know why you wouldn't do this most

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.810 
don't know why you wouldn't do this most
of<00:02:35.620> them<00:02:35.710> you<00:02:35.830> could<00:02:35.950> finish<00:02:36.280> within<00:02:36.490> one<00:02:36.790> game

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
of them you could finish within one game

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.150 
of them you could finish within one game
or<00:02:37.150> less<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:37.630> really<00:02:37.870> not<00:02:38.080> that

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
or less so it's really not that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.200 
or less so it's really not that
time-consuming<00:02:39.160> it's<00:02:39.460> definitely<00:02:39.850> worth<00:02:40.000> it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
time-consuming it's definitely worth it

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.970 
time-consuming it's definitely worth it

between resets you can get more Supply
Drop<00:02:52.270> challenges<00:02:52.990> and<00:02:53.110> thus<00:02:53.230> more<00:02:53.470> supply
