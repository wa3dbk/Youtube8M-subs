demonstration on how to glue up a handle
wahhhh<00:00:08.820> handle<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> knife<00:00:09.690> there's

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
wahhhh handle on a knife there's

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.709 
wahhhh handle on a knife there's
actually<00:00:11.040> two<00:00:11.250> parts<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:11.910> we're<00:00:12.599> going

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
actually two parts to this we're going

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.820 
actually two parts to this we're going
to<00:00:12.780> do<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.019> latter<00:00:13.650> part<00:00:14.070> first<00:00:15.470> part<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:16.680> is

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
to do the latter part first part one is

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.099 
to do the latter part first part one is
fitting<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.580> tang<00:00:17.850> into<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> handle<00:00:18.960> which

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
fitting the tang into the handle which

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.580 
fitting the tang into the handle which
is<00:00:20.300> subject<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.420> another<00:00:21.660> video<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.320> this

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
is subject of another video but this

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
once you have it fit into the handle the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
once you have it fit into the handle the
way<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.289> it

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
way you like it

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.019 
way you like it
we<00:00:26.519> usually<00:00:26.760> epoxy<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.880> what

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
we usually epoxy it and that's what

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.939 
we usually epoxy it and that's what
we're<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> talk<00:00:30.510> about<00:00:30.539> right<00:00:31.320> now<00:00:31.529> so

whatever<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.260> want<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.770> put<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> little<00:00:50.100> bit

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
whatever you want just put a little bit

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.389 
whatever you want just put a little bit
on<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> handle<00:00:51.230> this<00:00:52.230> helps<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> epoxy<00:00:53.190> from

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
on the handle this helps the epoxy from

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.139 
on the handle this helps the epoxy from
sticking<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.860> then<00:00:55.860> also<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
sticking to it and then also just a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.599 
sticking to it and then also just a
little<00:00:57.390> bit<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:59.280> knife<00:00:59.550> itself<00:01:01.609> on

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
little bit on the the knife itself on

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:13.780 
little bit on the the knife itself on
the<00:01:03.270> exposed<00:01:03.690> part<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> tank

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.630 

so<00:01:14.790> wants<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.510> that<00:01:15.800> and<00:01:16.800> typically<00:01:17.160> put<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
so wants to do that and typically put a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.000 
so wants to do that and typically put a
little<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.300> epoxy<00:01:18.600> into<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.680> handle

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
little bit of epoxy into the handle

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:28.460 
little bit of epoxy into the handle
itself<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.980> is<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.250> 3m<00:01:26.760> Scotch<00:01:27.150> weld<00:01:27.480> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
itself and this is a 3m Scotch weld the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.240 
itself and this is a 3m Scotch weld the
tight<00:01:28.890> behind<00:01:29.190> epoxies<00:01:30.000> 5<00:01:30.600> 5<00:01:31.380> minute<00:01:31.680> those

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
tight behind epoxies 5 5 minute those

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.360 
tight behind epoxies 5 5 minute those
work<00:01:32.490> well<00:01:32.960> also<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.830> about<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> hardware

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
work well also get about the hardware

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:50.460 
work well also get about the hardware
store

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.600 

so<00:01:51.470> then<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.680> get<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.830> handle<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.340> seat

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
so then you get the handle to seat

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.640 
so then you get the handle to seat
properly<00:01:52.840> they<00:01:53.840> typically<00:01:54.200> do<00:01:54.260> is<00:01:54.409> I<00:01:54.500> just

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
properly they typically do is I just

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.820 
properly they typically do is I just
hold<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:54.950> knife<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.490> then<00:01:55.700> gently<00:01:56.060> tap<00:01:56.360> the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
hold the knife and then gently tap the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.410 
hold the knife and then gently tap the
bottom<00:01:57.830> of<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.130> handle<00:01:58.310> with<00:01:59.030> a<00:01:59.060> piece<00:01:59.270> of

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
bottom of the handle with a piece of

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:11.080 
bottom of the handle with a piece of
wood<00:02:09.160> then<00:02:10.160> once<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.399> get<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:10.670> into<00:02:10.880> where

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
wood then once you get that into where

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.840 
wood then once you get that into where
you<00:02:11.180> like<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:12.340> again<00:02:13.340> check<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.670> make<00:02:13.760> sure

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
you like it again check to make sure

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.510 
you like it again check to make sure
that<00:02:14.120> it's<00:02:14.240> straight<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.040> spine<00:02:16.489> is

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
that it's straight that the spine is

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
that it's straight that the spine is
straight<00:02:16.970> with<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:18.340> knife<00:02:19.340> itself<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:25.580> then

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
straight with the knife itself and then

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.020 
straight with the knife itself and then
just<00:02:26.840> cap<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.200> off<00:02:27.320> on<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.709> top<00:02:27.980> with<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.760> little

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
just cap it off on the top with a little

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:38.840 
just cap it off on the top with a little
more<00:02:29.150> epoxy

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.940 

this<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.120> reason<00:02:40.300> he<00:02:40.600> whacks<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.260> top<00:02:41.770> of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
this is the reason he whacks the top of

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.330 
this is the reason he whacks the top of
the<00:02:42.040> ferrule<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.150> when<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.740> put<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:45.010> glob

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
the ferrule so that when we put a glob

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.520 
the ferrule so that when we put a glob
of<00:02:45.400> epoxy<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:46.300> top<00:02:46.570> we<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:46.930> peel<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.380> off

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
of epoxy on top we can peel it off

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.660 
of epoxy on top we can peel it off
easily<00:02:48.300> once<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.450> dries<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.960> it<00:02:50.020> dries<00:02:50.260> fast

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
easily once it dries and it dries fast

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.940 
easily once it dries and it dries fast
so<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:51.820> typically<00:02:52.090> once<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.510> have<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.960> the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
so then typically once I have the the

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.430 
so then typically once I have the the
epoxy<00:02:54.370> on<00:02:54.460> the<00:02:54.550> top<00:02:54.760> for<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.030> cap<00:02:55.210> let<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.200> sit

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
epoxy on the top for the cap let it sit

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.700 
epoxy on the top for the cap let it sit
for<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.680> minute<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:57.550> get<00:02:57.790> some<00:02:58.030> off<00:02:58.710> gassing

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
for a minute you get some off gassing

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.590 
for a minute you get some off gassing
some<00:02:59.860> air<00:03:00.040> coming<00:03:00.370> out<00:03:00.490> of<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.640> handle<00:03:00.940> and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
some air coming out of the handle and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.180 
some air coming out of the handle and
bubbles<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.470> then<00:03:02.620> you'll<00:03:02.800> want<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:02.980> fill

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
bubbles and then you'll want to fill

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.370 
bubbles and then you'll want to fill
those<00:03:03.460> and<00:03:03.640> again<00:03:03.810> these<00:03:04.810> are<00:03:04.930> something<00:03:05.350> that

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
those and again these are something that

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.300 
those and again these are something that
I've<00:03:05.560> already<00:03:05.740> done<00:03:07.830> they<00:03:08.830> look<00:03:09.010> pretty<00:03:09.190> good

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
I've already done they look pretty good

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.050 
I've already done they look pretty good
but<00:03:11.070> what<00:03:12.070> you<00:03:12.190> can<00:03:12.340> do<00:03:12.460> is<00:03:12.610> just<00:03:12.760> put<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.000> little

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
but what you can do is just put a little

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.390 
but what you can do is just put a little
more<00:03:13.450> epoxy<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:14.110> them<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:15.510> then<00:03:17.250> just<00:03:18.250> let

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
more epoxy on them and then just let

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.660 
more epoxy on them and then just let
them<00:03:18.490> set<00:03:18.870> that's<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:21.250> other<00:03:21.400> thing<00:03:21.610> about

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
them set that's it the other thing about

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.090 
them set that's it the other thing about
this<00:03:22.030> epoxy<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.630> we're<00:03:22.990> using<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.440> usually

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
this epoxy that we're using it usually

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.580 
this epoxy that we're using it usually
sets<00:03:24.370> up<00:03:24.580> in<00:03:24.820> 5-10<00:03:25.540> minutes<00:03:25.870> but<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.260> doesn't

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
sets up in 5-10 minutes but it doesn't

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.610 
sets up in 5-10 minutes but it doesn't
get<00:03:26.710> completely<00:03:26.940> hardened<00:03:27.940> till<00:03:28.500> usually<00:03:29.500> the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
get completely hardened till usually the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.300 
get completely hardened till usually the
next<00:03:29.920> day<00:03:30.130> so<00:03:30.240> just<00:03:31.350> just<00:03:32.350> know<00:03:32.860> that<00:03:33.040> when

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
next day so just just know that when

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.160 
next day so just just know that when
you're<00:03:33.430> using<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.880> just<00:03:34.120> set<00:03:34.600> it<00:03:34.720> up<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.050> let

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
you're using it just set it up and let

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.650 
you're using it just set it up and let
it<00:03:35.200> sit<00:03:35.560> for<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.770> while<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:35.980> should<00:03:36.970> be<00:03:37.120> fine

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
it sit for a while and should be fine

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.420 
it sit for a while and should be fine
and<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.230> last<00:03:38.410> step<00:03:38.770> that<00:03:38.800> we're<00:03:39.160> not<00:03:39.250> going

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
and the last step that we're not going

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.950 
and the last step that we're not going
to<00:03:39.490> do<00:03:39.640> here<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:40.030> we're<00:03:40.210> going<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.390> just<00:03:40.450> peel

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
to do here is we're going to just peel

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.740 
to do here is we're going to just peel
off<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.709> top<00:03:42.580> layer<00:03:42.850> of<00:03:42.880> epoxy<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.660> then

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
off that a top layer of epoxy and then

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.020 
off that a top layer of epoxy and then
it'll<00:03:43.900> be<00:03:43.959> done<00:03:44.170> that's<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.370> I'm<00:03:45.820> mark

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
it'll be done that's it I'm mark

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.930 
it'll be done that's it I'm mark
Richmond<00:03:46.390> stay<00:03:46.660> sharp
