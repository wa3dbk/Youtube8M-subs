there<00:04:38.020> will<00:04:38.140> be<00:04:38.169> a<00:04:38.290> block<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:38.620> was<00:04:38.950> a<00:04:39.040> trust

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
there will be a block that was a trust

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.740 
there will be a block that was a trust
factor<00:04:39.640> there<00:04:40.200> don't<00:04:41.200> worry<00:04:41.800> can<00:04:42.010> one<00:04:42.220> start

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
another block right where I should have

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.580 
another block right where I should have
been<00:05:18.310> done<00:05:18.610> skidding<00:05:19.030> but<00:05:19.660> ya<00:05:20.080> know<00:05:20.290> just<00:05:20.440> put

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.990 
been done skidding but ya know just put
a<00:05:20.620> block<00:05:20.890> right<00:05:21.160> underneath<00:05:21.610> where<00:05:21.790> they

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
a block right underneath where they

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.990 
a block right underneath where they
should<00:05:22.180> meet<00:05:22.330> where<00:05:22.479> they're<00:05:22.600> going<00:05:22.840> you<00:05:23.740> know

should meet where they're going you know
doesn't<00:05:25.000> sound<00:05:29.610> like<00:05:30.610> four<00:05:30.820> blocks<00:05:30.940> at<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.270> time

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
doesn't sound like four blocks at a time

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.180 
doesn't sound like four blocks at a time
though<00:05:31.690> yeah<00:05:32.169> you<00:05:32.229> go<00:05:32.380> in<00:05:32.470> place<00:05:32.650> for<00:05:32.890> yeah

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
though yeah you go in place for yeah

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.890 
though yeah you go in place for yeah
it's<00:05:33.880> for<00:05:34.090> I<00:05:34.210> don't<00:05:34.390> want<00:05:34.510> to<00:05:34.570> keep<00:05:34.660> tapping

not that another coming Duns we're due
still<00:05:51.960> you<00:05:52.960> you<00:05:52.990> gotta<00:05:53.410> do<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.590> better<00:05:53.740> job<00:05:53.890> of

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
still you you gotta do a better job of

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.430 
still you you gotta do a better job of
block<00:05:54.370> placing<00:05:54.970> that's<00:05:55.480> that's<00:05:55.960> what<00:05:56.260> it

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
block placing that's that's what it

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.950 
block placing that's that's what it
ultimately<00:05:56.650> boils<00:05:57.220> down<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.700> it<00:05:58.060> not<00:05:58.690> good

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
ultimately boils down to it not good

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.840 
ultimately boils down to it not good
enough<00:05:59.110> block<00:05:59.410> placing<00:05:59.890> here<00:06:00.070> we<00:06:00.130> go<00:06:00.310> no<00:06:02.850> what

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
enough block placing here we go no what

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.080
