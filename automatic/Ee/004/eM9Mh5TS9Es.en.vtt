before you from a shoot the schools to

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.300 
before you from a shoot the schools to

dealt with that response to the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.830 
dealt with that response to the
responsibility<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.670> being<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.299> iconic

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
responsibility of being like this iconic

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.499 
responsibility of being like this iconic
figure<00:02:01.560> for<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.070> league<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.640> also<00:02:03.299> being

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
figure for the league and also being

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.969

able<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.780> concentrate<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.500> your<00:02:04.710> game<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
able to concentrate on your game and

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.730 
able to concentrate on your game and
improve<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> game<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:06.030> every<00:02:06.180> other<00:02:06.360> player

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
improve the game like every other player

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.229 
improve the game like every other player
well<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.829> think<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.879> comes<00:02:09.090> with

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
well I think that you know it comes with

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.530 
well I think that you know it comes with
a<00:02:09.270> tremendous<00:02:10.110> amount<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.379> responsibility

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
a tremendous amount of responsibility

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.940 
a tremendous amount of responsibility
but<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.900> owe<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.230> to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
but we owe it to

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
but we owe it to
the<00:02:14.280> players<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.730> came<00:02:14.910> before<00:02:15.060> us<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
the players that came before us and the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.320 
the players that came before us and the
players<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.080> will<00:02:16.380> come<00:02:16.590> after<00:02:16.890> us<00:02:17.240> you<00:02:18.240> know

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
players that will come after us you know

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.730 
players that will come after us you know
I<00:02:18.360> think<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.810> my<00:02:18.959> motivation<00:02:19.590> now

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
I think that my motivation now

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.490 
I think that my motivation now
especially<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:21.420> allow<00:02:21.720> my<00:02:22.050> daughter<00:02:22.319> to

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
especially is to allow my daughter to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.490 
especially is to allow my daughter to
have<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.310> same<00:02:23.520> opportunities<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.500> another

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
have the same opportunities that another

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500 
have the same opportunities that another
little<00:02:25.830> boy<00:02:25.950> would<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.390> know

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
little boy would have and you know

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.540 
little boy would have and you know
that's<00:02:27.810> only<00:02:28.380> gonna<00:02:28.770> be<00:02:28.950> possible<00:02:29.370> if<00:02:29.459> we

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
that's only gonna be possible if we

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.670 
that's only gonna be possible if we
continue<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> grow<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.360> league<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.870> then

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
continue to grow this league and then

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.140 
continue to grow this league and then
who<00:02:31.830> knows<00:02:32.040> if<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.430> continue<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.880> grow<00:02:32.970> this

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
who knows if we continue to grow this

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.400 
who knows if we continue to grow this
league<00:02:33.330> maybe<00:02:33.570> there's<00:02:33.810> gonna<00:02:33.990> be<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> soccer

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
league maybe there's gonna be a soccer

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.320 
league maybe there's gonna be a soccer
league<00:02:34.560> or<00:02:34.890> maybe<00:02:35.070> they're<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:36.270> know

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330
