a dragon soul experiment trophy actually

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.939 
a dragon soul experiment trophy actually
drops<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.789> every<00:00:24.510> raid<00:00:24.720> setting<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.529> therefore

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
drops on every raid setting so therefore

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.400 
drops on every raid setting so therefore
you<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.340> do<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.760> any<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.480> desire<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
you can do it on any that you desire the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.230 
you can do it on any that you desire the
drop<00:00:28.590> chance<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:28.980> mount<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.340> accordingly<00:00:29.880> at

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
drop chance for mount is accordingly at

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.310 
drop chance for mount is accordingly at
1%

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
1%

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.010 
1%
however<00:00:31.769> accordingly<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.180> chance<00:00:33.450> lowers

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
however accordingly the chance lowers

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.110 
however accordingly the chance lowers
with<00:00:34.290> each<00:00:34.559> setting<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.579> you're<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
with each setting you that you're on the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
with each setting you that you're on the
easier<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> setting<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.260> less<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
easier the setting the less of the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.709 
easier the setting the less of the
chance<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> mount<00:00:38.550> dropping<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.540> it's

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
chance of the mount dropping but it's

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.810 
chance of the mount dropping but it's
only<00:00:39.870> very<00:00:40.170> slight<00:00:40.559> difference<00:00:41.040> per<00:00:41.309> setting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
only very slight difference per setting

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.500 
only very slight difference per setting
accordingly<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:43.040> 0.5<00:00:44.040> percent<00:00:44.940> drop<00:00:45.239> chance

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
accordingly is 0.5 percent drop chance

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.209 
accordingly is 0.5 percent drop chance
on<00:00:45.809> 10<00:00:46.530> man<00:00:46.800> normal<00:00:47.899> whereas<00:00:48.899> 25<00:00:49.410> man<00:00:49.680> heroic

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
on 10 man normal whereas 25 man heroic

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.060 
on 10 man normal whereas 25 man heroic
it<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:50.820> one<00:00:51.000> point<00:00:51.180> 1<00:00:51.480> percent<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.469> is

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
it is at one point 1 percent but that is

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.010 
it is at one point 1 percent but that is
very<00:00:53.520> slight<00:00:53.969> difference<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.899> gonna

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
very slight difference so I'm just gonna

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
very slight difference so I'm just gonna
say<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.410> everything<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.340> pretty<00:00:56.399> much<00:00:56.699> just

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
say for everything it's pretty much just

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.049 
say for everything it's pretty much just
1%<00:00:57.539> drop<00:00:57.780> chance<00:00:58.079> alright<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.340> which<00:00:59.550> Buster's

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
1% drop chance alright so which Buster's

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.750 
1% drop chance alright so which Buster's
experiment<00:01:00.780> 12b<00:01:01.140> drop<00:01:01.379> upload<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.489> full

chance at the mouth

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.840 
chance at the mouth
well<00:01:10.409> traxion<00:01:10.740> used<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.189> be<00:01:11.280> quite<00:01:11.460> difficult

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
well traxion used to be quite difficult

well traxion used to be quite difficult
to<00:01:12.180> defeat<00:01:12.600> at<00:01:12.900> level<00:01:13.470> 90<00:01:14.040> which<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.820> only

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
to defeat at level 90 which was only

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.090 
to defeat at level 90 which was only
just<00:01:15.450> doable<00:01:15.869> but<00:01:16.170> these<00:01:16.380> days<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.799> max

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
just doable but these days that max

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.190 
just doable but these days that max
level<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.640> quite<00:01:18.150> an<00:01:18.330> easy<00:01:18.509> fight<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.170> can

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
level is quite an easy fight and you can

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.160 
level is quite an easy fight and you can
do<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.890> most<00:01:20.549> settings<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.659> quite<00:01:21.960> have

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
do it on most settings it's quite have

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.910 
do it on most settings it's quite have
gotten<00:01:22.530> 25<00:01:23.280> man<00:01:23.729> heroic<00:01:24.299> solo<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.590> it's

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
gotten 25 man heroic solo but it's

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.310 
gotten 25 man heroic solo but it's
definitely<00:01:26.310> doable<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:27.210> 10<00:01:27.479> man<00:01:27.689> heroic<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
definitely doable on 10 man heroic and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.460 
definitely doable on 10 man heroic and
normal<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.000> definitely<00:01:30.000> doable<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.659> 25<00:01:31.229> man

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
normal and definitely doable on 25 man

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.140 
normal and definitely doable on 25 man
normal<00:01:31.950> also<00:01:32.759> although

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
normal also although

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.560 
normal also although
however<00:01:33.869> 25<00:01:34.350> man<00:01:34.530> heroic<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.070> quite<00:01:35.280> difficult

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
however 25 man heroic is quite difficult

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.420 
however 25 man heroic is quite difficult
probably<00:01:36.570> doable<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.290> recommend<00:01:38.009> having<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
probably doable but I recommend having a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
probably doable but I recommend having a
friend<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> last<00:01:39.450> setting<00:01:39.750> if

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
friend with you for the last setting if

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
friend with you for the last setting if
you<00:01:40.350> don't<00:01:40.560> know<00:01:40.770> how<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.070> fight<00:01:41.430> mechanics

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
you don't know how the fight mechanics

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.859 
you don't know how the fight mechanics
work<00:01:42.630> basically<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:44.369> sum<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> all<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:45.659> into

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
work basically to sum it all up go into

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.679 
work basically to sum it all up go into
the<00:01:46.049> fight<00:01:46.259> start<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.890> off<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.600> when<00:01:48.600> he

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the fight start it off and when he
