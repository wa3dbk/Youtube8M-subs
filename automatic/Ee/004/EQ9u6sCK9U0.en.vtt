00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
have to sit down and then I have to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.840 
have to sit down and then I have to
draft<00:01:51.679> it<00:01:51.829> designed<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.399> I<00:01:52.429> have<00:01:52.579> to<00:01:52.700> make

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850
