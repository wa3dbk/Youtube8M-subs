00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.840
 that radio a lot of people are saying 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:16.049
 dad clarity there is mother 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.360
 he sang any world giving peace and 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.759
 trying I wanted to try it and I got scared 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.529
 or if you did not get scared over here there are 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.140
 terrified people right now but it's 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.730
 that this is the other way around 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.110
 let's say we did we were all happy 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.050
 when the season ends not at 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.630
 I had a little taste of them 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.380
 change was God's destiny then everything 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.579
 already 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.899
 I said clearly that I was going to put the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.519
 numbers that I'm the best there is for 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.789
 here right now I know it has always 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.760
 been 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:50.519
 what were the numbers pp 653 how much 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.289
 653 200 and 210 because he had to pull out 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.440
 for so nervous in this sense 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.790
 strength so I think it holds month or so 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.100
 the king 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.040
 we are again as I tell you in the 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.410
 beginning of the season that will happen 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.540
 an effect of this season good 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.270
 I want drivers next to me I do not want 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.720
 talk that I can that I could not that 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.700
 that I have always said I can what 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.680
 do not believe in me they have to believe because 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.390
 they all do it to the bad that they believe in me 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.760
 so you do not know the keyboard of the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.770
 computer on facebook in the forums 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.150
 is to stand there in the tri chrism and say 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.880
 Well, look, these are good numbers 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.530
 this car is not Puerto Rico or 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.420
 australia am I is the very well and the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.890
 configuration that you have now I have 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.170
 understood by the rumors that there are 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.660
 there pp that you achieved is when you left 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.619
 of the road find some horses 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.330
 additional when I stumbled upon 90 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:53.130
 little horses but it goes there seems like it had 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:55.770
 like 600 boxes understand but this one 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.920
 I have more different tricks to all the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.229
 world and people do not believe me is not a 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.750
 tremendous reward for you for so many 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.770
 years of trusting to believe of staying 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.259
 mostly within the sport of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.530
 acceleration with its ups and downs because 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.140
 others 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.270
 in your position they would have paralyzed 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.720
 his project because simply because 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.000
 the ups and downs the costs the lack of 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.580
 trade et cetera et cetera but you 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.510
 you wanted to persevere to achieve that 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.000
 triumph 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.910
 that victory those numbers that always 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.910
 you had longed for good to those who throw me 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:40.060
 I have to tell them why they do not know that 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:42.739
 I was born for this understands and I do not have 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.140
 I brake this so that you breathe the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.810
 track I live this without this I prefer 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.360
 so dead 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.030
 pepe some words for people 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.160
 that they have been supporting from 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:59.490
 who have been supporting good 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.310
 It's the smoke where my pana canecas racing 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.620
 the amount the first one that rides the ok and 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.770
 already the numbers talked I think that the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.080

 competition style in couple exit 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.510

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.940
 people who are from the gate here 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.860
 inside they have to tighten 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.690

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.000

 I was a championship twice in two years 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.110
