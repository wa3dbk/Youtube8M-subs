00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 hi guys today new video on 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:09.030
 iphoneitalia.com we will test the resistance 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.790
 of this iphone 5 if with three falls one 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.429
 from the pocket one of use height and one 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.770
 from call height to understand 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.400
 how truly the last one is resistant 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.400
 apple iphone 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.850
 clearly the three tests will take place 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.370
 so completely random so not 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.580
 we know how the iphone will touch the 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.590
 ground could therefore impact on 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.690
 screen break immediately or impact 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.790
 on the edges and hold out longer 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.290
 we will see exactly how it will behave e 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.640
 so let's start immediately with the first one 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.640
 fall from the pocket 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.910
 as we can see the iphone has suffered 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.900
 very little cosmetic damage 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.360
 important in the area of ​​the camera 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.700
 we see the outer frame slightly 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.430
 scratched on iphone 5 if you notice 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.380
 much less the problem compared to 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.910
 what happened on iphone 5 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.160
 clearly the phone is fully 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.550
 working see the touchscreen button 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.550
 home 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.170
 we also try the touch that works 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.650
 without problems so let's go with the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.650
 second fall 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.490
 also in this case as you see 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.619
 the iphone is fully functional so far 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.470
 who is still recording the video that 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.360
 you have seen no one from himself 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.360
 relevant sign also in this case 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.130
 indeed very little has been alone 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.680
 unlucky the iphone happen again 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.619
 on the camera area then you are 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.540
 that sign that amplified in part 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.429
 however, we had already seen it as a garment 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.590
 no signs really intact 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.780
 no scratches on the screen and that's it 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.319
 clearly working we proceed with 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.319
 the third fall 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.560
 guys this iphone 5 be more 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.690
 resistant to expected we are at the third 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.140
 fall from call height then 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.870
 really quite high up is the only one 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.320
 clear sign besides those that are 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.880
 were already formed on the camera is a 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.640
 scratch on the frame or better, really 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.710
 a shock that the iphone has suffered the point 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.550
 of impact is clearly evident in the corner 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.550
 lower right 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.740
 clearly the impact was strong 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.080
 because the iphone fell very long into 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.510
 high since the iphone has survived 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.160
 the first series of tests without impacting 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.190
 never on the screen now let's go to 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.200
 repeat the first three tests but doing 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.560
 so that the iphone impacts on 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.560
 screen 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.470
 dry impact on the screen this time 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.260
 from pocket height and has formed some 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.959
 sign on the front frame of the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.170
 of the iPhone 5 s however the screen resists 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.829
 still no scratch no crack for 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.829
 the moment 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.250
 you guys saw my face said 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.069
 all and you even heard the noise or 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.860
 better and I heard it and it was different 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.699
 from others as you can see the iphone 5 ha 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.919
 ceded from height of use with impact 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.449
 on the screen you can see below a 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.330
 left the point of impact 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.010
 the screen is completely shattered 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.580
 luckily for iphone it still works 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.280
 you see everything working lcd home button 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.380
 we have also seen clearly that ios 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.479
 the rear camera works well 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.160
 it is even not actually not 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.310
 recording but the front one works 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.770
 we see it and it is fully functional 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.350
 in short, everything works but the screen has 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.000
 ceded from height of use with impact 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.680
 front 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.630
 to sum up this iphone 5 is either 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.850
 behaved quite well he resisted 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.860
 5 fallen sold only the last 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.800
 display for the rest we have only seen 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.900
 minor cosmetic damage such as gods 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.860
 scratches regarding the frame and 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.960
 little else 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.970
 despite the broken screen 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.010
 phone is fully functional then 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.810
 apple has done absolutely great 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.600
 work compared to what we had seen 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.220
 with iphone 5 and earlier 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.410
 this was our crash test of 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.180
 iphone 5 s.sede that on the video I invite you
