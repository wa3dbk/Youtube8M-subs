is<00:05:58.690> expecting<00:05:59.260> I'm<00:05:59.560> pretty<00:06:00.160> sure<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:00.580> Hawks

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
is expecting I'm pretty sure the Hawks

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.730

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
I'm thinking this is the lead for Jacobs

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.660 
I'm thinking this is the lead for Jacobs
to<00:06:04.990> put<00:06:05.170> up<00:06:05.260> some<00:06:05.410> points<00:06:05.590> do<00:06:06.250> I<00:06:06.310> expect<00:06:06.640> to
