00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
didn't see that so he's got the single

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.920

target in front of tower fries maybe a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.149 
target in front of tower fries maybe a
little<00:01:40.110> bit<00:01:40.290> too<00:01:40.439> early<00:01:40.470> there<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.979> thought

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
little bit too early there but I thought

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.130 
little bit too early there but I thought
because<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.549> had<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.210> wanted<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> keep<00:01:42.990> the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
buildings here my hope here is that he

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.890 
buildings here my hope here is that he
can<00:04:51.550> take<00:04:51.700> out<00:04:51.850> that<00:04:52.000> wizard<00:04:52.330> tower<00:04:52.510> as<00:04:52.690> well

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
can take out that wizard tower as well

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.960 
can take out that wizard tower as well
and<00:04:53.190> we'll<00:04:54.190> see<00:04:54.340> if<00:04:54.460> he<00:04:54.550> can<00:04:54.640> do<00:04:54.760> that<00:04:54.790> because

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
and we'll see if he can do that because

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.760 
and we'll see if he can do that because
once<00:04:55.180> that<00:04:55.240> wizard<00:04:55.570> tower<00:04:55.720> goes<00:04:55.990> we<00:04:56.440> are<00:04:56.620> in

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
once that wizard tower goes we are in

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.740 
once that wizard tower goes we are in
the<00:04:56.920> clear<00:04:57.100> and<00:04:57.160> it<00:04:57.400> does<00:04:57.610> not<00:04:57.970> go<00:04:58.420> it's<00:04:58.630> so

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
the clear and it does not go it's so

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.940 
the clear and it does not go it's so
close<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:59.110> dying<00:04:59.320> so<00:04:59.500> this<00:04:59.620> may<00:04:59.740> be<00:04:59.800> a<00:04:59.890> little

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490 
that two star you've got to be a little

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.100 
that two star you've got to be a little
bit<00:07:24.729> more<00:07:24.909> dangerous<00:07:25.389> with<00:07:25.599> it<00:07:25.780> by<00:07:25.930> sending

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
bit more dangerous with it by sending

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.080 
bit more dangerous with it by sending
your<00:07:26.319> heroes<00:07:26.620> into<00:07:26.770> the<00:07:27.009> tunnel<00:07:27.370> when<00:07:28.000> you

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090 
your heroes into the tunnel when you

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.550 
your heroes into the tunnel when you
let's<00:07:28.539> say<00:07:28.719> at<00:07:28.810> like<00:07:28.960> forty-five<00:07:29.409> percent

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 
let's say at like forty-five percent

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.869 
let's say at like forty-five percent
probably<00:07:30.009> not<00:07:30.099> the<00:07:30.190> best<00:07:30.219> idea<00:07:30.400> but<00:07:30.759> that's

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:30.879 
probably not the best idea but that's

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:32.490 
probably not the best idea but that's
where<00:07:31.090> we<00:07:31.180> are<00:07:31.300> so<00:07:31.449> far<00:07:31.629> guys<00:07:31.840> I'm<00:07:32.349> probably

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500 
where we are so far guys I'm probably

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.020 
where we are so far guys I'm probably
going<00:07:32.710> to<00:07:32.800> push<00:07:32.949> up<00:07:33.129> a<00:07:33.280> lot<00:07:33.490> higher<00:07:33.639> we'll<00:07:33.909> see

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.030 
going to push up a lot higher we'll see

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.640 
going to push up a lot higher we'll see
where<00:07:34.180> we<00:07:34.270> can<00:07:34.389> get<00:07:34.479> to<00:07:34.659> and<00:07:34.960> I<00:07:35.169> will<00:07:35.349> talk<00:07:35.620> to

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:35.650 
where we can get to and I will talk to

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:57.930 
where we can get to and I will talk to
you<00:07:35.830> guys<00:07:35.889> next<00:07:36.009> time<00:07:36.430> later

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:57.940
