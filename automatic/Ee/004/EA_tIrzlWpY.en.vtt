picture firstly let's talk about

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.869 
picture firstly let's talk about
resolution<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.739> resolution<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> amount

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
resolution the resolution is the amount

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.549 
resolution the resolution is the amount
of<00:00:54.059> information<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:54.840> captured<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
of information that's captured on the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.010 
of information that's captured on the
cameras<00:00:55.949> sensor<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.760> would<00:00:57.300> affect<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> size

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
cameras sensor it would affect the size

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.410 
cameras sensor it would affect the size
and<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.530> quality<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.309> picture<00:00:59.820> the

and the quality of your picture the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.110 
and the quality of your picture the
higher<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.140> resolution<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:02.190> better<00:01:02.219> quality

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
higher the resolution the better quality

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240 
higher the resolution the better quality
the<00:01:03.239> picture<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.989> lower<00:01:04.199> resolution<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the picture the lower resolution the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
the picture the lower resolution the
lower<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> quality<00:01:05.820> now<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.049> thing<00:01:07.290> about

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
lower the quality now the thing about

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.890 
lower the quality now the thing about
resolution<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.640> only<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.540> good<00:01:09.840> as

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
resolution is that it's only as good as

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.780 
resolution is that it's only as good as

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
television then you'll want to set the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.550 
television then you'll want to set the
resolution<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.189> your<00:01:20.340> camera<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:21.090> 4k<00:01:21.560> because

resolution on your camera for 4k because
the<00:01:22.920> quality<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.610> justified<00:01:24.180> however<00:01:24.869> if

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the quality will be justified however if

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.600 
the quality will be justified however if
your<00:01:25.560> videos<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> end<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.460> on

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
your videos are going to end up on

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.940 
your videos are going to end up on
YouTube<00:01:27.210> or<00:01:27.479> Facebook<00:01:27.560> then<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.680> don't<00:01:28.799> need

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
YouTube or Facebook then you don't need

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.080 
YouTube or Facebook then you don't need
to<00:01:29.070> shoot<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.400> such<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> high<00:01:29.850> resolution

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
to shoot it such a high resolution

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.660 
to shoot it such a high resolution
because<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.869> you'll<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.500> use<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.310> memory

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
because all you'll do is use up memory

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.850 
because all you'll do is use up memory
so<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.180> shoot<00:01:33.630> an<00:01:33.840> appropriate<00:01:34.710> resolution

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
so you shoot an appropriate resolution

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.370 
so you shoot an appropriate resolution
as<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.570> from<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.900> clip<00:01:37.200> the

half<00:03:06.000> speed<00:03:06.330> this<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.440> how<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.680> get<00:03:07.980> slow

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
half speed this is how you get slow

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.520 
half speed this is how you get slow
motion<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.330> is<00:03:09.510> why<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.750> frames<00:03:10.260> per

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
motion and this is why the frames per

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.620 
motion and this is why the frames per
second<00:03:10.920> are<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.640> important<00:03:12.270> when<00:03:12.510> you're

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
second are so important when you're

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.650 
second are so important when you're
shooting<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.110> your<00:03:13.230> GoPro<00:03:13.650> if<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:15.030> want<00:03:15.180> super

let's<00:03:53.370> talk<00:03:53.519> about<00:03:53.640> aspect<00:03:54.150> ratio<00:03:54.540> next<00:03:54.930> very

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
let's talk about aspect ratio next very

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.000 
let's talk about aspect ratio next very
briefly<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:56.010> aspect<00:03:56.549> ratio<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:58.290> shape<00:03:58.739> of

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
briefly the aspect ratio is the shape of

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.030 
briefly the aspect ratio is the shape of
your<00:03:59.100> screen<00:03:59.700> okay<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.750> on<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> GoPro<00:04:01.709> you

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
your screen okay and on the GoPro you

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.270 
your screen okay and on the GoPro you
can<00:04:02.220> shoot<00:04:02.459> in<00:04:02.870> 17<00:04:03.870> by<00:04:04.500> nine<00:04:04.830> which<00:04:05.250> is

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
can shoot in 17 by nine which is

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.479 
can shoot in 17 by nine which is
widescreen<00:04:06.030> format<00:04:06.290> 16<00:04:07.290> by<00:04:07.470> 9<00:04:07.769> which<00:04:08.040> isn't

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
widescreen format 16 by 9 which isn't

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.920 
widescreen format 16 by 9 which isn't
quite<00:04:08.700> as<00:04:08.880> wide<00:04:09.150> or<00:04:09.620> 4<00:04:10.620> by<00:04:10.860> 3<00:04:10.890> now<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.360> sensor

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
quite as wide or 4 by 3 now the sensor

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.949 
quite as wide or 4 by 3 now the sensor
on<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.440> GoPro<00:04:13.890> is<00:04:14.100> shaped<00:04:14.549> four<00:04:14.910> by<00:04:15.090> three<00:04:15.120> so

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
on the GoPro is shaped four by three so

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.560 
on the GoPro is shaped four by three so
when<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.260> shoot<00:04:16.650> in<00:04:16.950> sixteen<00:04:17.609> by<00:04:17.820> nine<00:04:17.850> and

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
when you shoot in sixteen by nine and

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.080 
when you shoot in sixteen by nine and
we'll<00:04:19.019> chop<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:20.010> top<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.459> bottom<00:04:20.640> off<00:04:20.940> the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
we'll chop the top and bottom off the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.670 
we'll chop the top and bottom off the
frame<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.570> give<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.870> wide<00:04:22.140> frame<00:04:22.410> picture

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.460 
frame to give you a wide frame picture
the<00:04:23.130> same<00:04:23.400> with<00:04:23.610> 17<00:04:24.090> by<00:04:24.270> nine<00:04:24.539> so<00:04:25.080> let's<00:04:25.320> look

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
the same with 17 by nine so let's look

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.580 
the same with 17 by nine so let's look
at<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.680> difference<00:04:26.039> between<00:04:26.130> sick

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
at the difference between sick

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.830 
at the difference between sick
steam<00:04:26.770> by<00:04:26.919> nine<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.400> four<00:04:27.820> by<00:04:28.030> three<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.630> these

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840

two clips when you play them
side-by-side<00:04:30.639> it's<00:04:31.570> quite<00:04:31.810> obvious<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.889> clip

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
side-by-side it's quite obvious the clip

what's<00:04:42.850> interesting<00:04:43.060> about<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.600> GoPro<00:04:44.050> is

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
what's interesting about the GoPro is

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.469 
what's interesting about the GoPro is
that<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:44.590> could<00:04:44.740> also<00:04:44.979> shoot<00:04:45.490> in<00:04:45.729> super<00:04:46.270> view

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
that you could also shoot in super view

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.460 
that you could also shoot in super view
now<00:04:47.110> they<00:04:47.680> say<00:04:48.010> it's<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.520> most<00:04:48.550> immersive

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
now they say it's the most immersive

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.290 
now they say it's the most immersive
video<00:04:50.470> picture<00:04:51.070> available<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.729> actually<00:04:52.120> it

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
video picture available and actually it

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.500 
video picture available and actually it
is<00:04:52.600> the<00:04:53.169> reason<00:04:53.650> for<00:04:53.800> this<00:04:53.919> is<00:04:54.210> super<00:04:55.210> view

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
is the reason for this is super view

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.080 
is the reason for this is super view
uses<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.139> entire<00:04:56.290> four<00:04:56.919> by<00:04:57.100> three<00:04:57.130> sensor<00:04:57.850> and

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
uses the entire four by three sensor and

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.780 
uses the entire four by three sensor and
it<00:04:58.870> stretches<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.440> sides<00:04:59.800> so<00:05:00.100> you<00:05:00.430> get<00:05:00.669> the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
it stretches the sides so you get the

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.820 
it stretches the sides so you get the
full<00:05:00.820> height<00:05:01.419> and<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:02.200> full<00:05:02.229> width<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.770> the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
full height and the full width of the

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.159 
full height and the full width of the
sensor<00:05:03.280> but<00:05:03.520> with<00:05:03.669> extra<00:05:04.360> width<00:05:04.570> so<00:05:04.840> it<00:05:04.930> shoots

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
sensor but with extra width so it shoots

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.680 
sensor but with extra width so it shoots
in<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:05.440> sixteen<00:05:05.979> by<00:05:06.190> nine<00:05:06.220> format<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:07.150> looks

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
in a sixteen by nine format it looks

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.050 
in a sixteen by nine format it looks
super<00:05:07.960> wide<00:05:08.290> it's<00:05:08.830> got<00:05:09.040> super<00:05:09.460> great<00:05:09.610> quality
