myself

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
myself

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.450 
myself
seems<00:00:59.750> like<00:01:00.050> start<00:01:00.410> pedaling<00:01:00.800> it<00:01:01.070> will<00:01:01.250> turn

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
seems like start pedaling it will turn

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.669 
seems like start pedaling it will turn
on<00:01:02.679> as<00:01:03.679> you<00:01:03.829> can<00:01:03.949> see

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:05.679 
on as you can see

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:09.359 
on as you can see
not<00:01:06.189> will<00:01:06.399> right<00:01:06.549> into<00:01:06.789> manual<00:01:07.119> mode<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.280> we

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
not will right into manual mode so we

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.569 
not will right into manual mode so we
get<00:01:09.490> started<00:01:09.880> 20<00:01:10.299> minutes<00:01:10.600> let's<00:01:10.990> start<00:01:11.579> go

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
get started 20 minutes let's start go

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.300 
get started 20 minutes let's start go
right<00:01:12.759> into<00:01:12.969> it<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:13.859> right<00:01:14.859> here<00:01:15.159> I<00:01:15.189> can

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
right into it and right here I can

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.770 
right into it and right here I can
adjust<00:01:15.490> my<00:01:15.640> resistance<00:01:15.759> from<00:01:16.390> here

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
adjust my resistance from here

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.870 
adjust my resistance from here
oh<00:01:18.090> sorry<00:01:19.090> from<00:01:19.329> here<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.340> goes<00:01:21.369> up<00:01:21.700> to

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
oh sorry from here and it goes up to

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:34.600 
oh sorry from here and it goes up to
that<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.689> is<00:01:25.959> getting<00:01:26.170> harder<00:01:26.679> and<00:01:26.799> harder

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.790 

so<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.150> can<00:01:35.270> see<00:01:35.390> calories<00:01:35.870> burned<00:01:36.110> elapsed

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
so you can see calories burned elapsed

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.280 
so you can see calories burned elapsed
time<00:01:36.980> rpm<00:01:37.670> which<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.480> your<00:01:38.690> resistance<00:01:38.930> right

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
time rpm which is your resistance right

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.100 
time rpm which is your resistance right
now<00:01:39.500> heart<00:01:39.890> rate<00:01:40.300> level<00:01:41.300> distance<00:01:41.840> calories

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
now heart rate level distance calories

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.040 
now heart rate level distance calories
hours<00:01:42.530> time<00:01:42.740> remaining<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:44.630> course<00:01:44.840> down

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
hours time remaining and of course down
