what<00:01:55.880> has<00:01:56.060> struck<00:01:56.390> me<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.570> most<00:01:56.690> is<00:01:57.080> that<00:01:57.110> when

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
what has struck me the most is that when

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.620 
what has struck me the most is that when
people<00:01:57.500> walk<00:01:57.860> in<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.190> door<00:01:58.570> there's<00:01:59.570> a

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
people walk in the door there's a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.120 
people walk in the door there's a
tendency<00:01:59.930> especially<00:02:00.260> for<00:02:00.740> people<00:02:00.800> that<00:02:01.040> are

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
tendency especially for people that are

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.750 
tendency especially for people that are
new<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.790> they<00:02:02.420> get<00:02:02.990> lost<00:02:03.260> and<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:04.250> left<00:02:04.520> you

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
new that they get lost and the left you

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.910 
new that they get lost and the left you
have<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.940> cafe<00:02:05.660> but<00:02:05.720> it's<00:02:06.020> small<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:06.650> can't

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
have a cafe but it's small so you can't

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.590 
have a cafe but it's small so you can't
fit<00:02:07.130> too<00:02:07.250> many<00:02:07.430> people<00:02:07.760> inside<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.119> there<00:02:08.420> and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
fit too many people inside of there and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.110 
fit too many people inside of there and
then<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.770> right<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.190> have<00:02:10.220> stairs<00:02:10.729> so

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
then to the right you have stairs so

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.240 
then to the right you have stairs so
it's<00:02:11.300> kind<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.630> just<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:12.020> very<00:02:12.410> small<00:02:12.860> area

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
it's kind of just this very small area

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.970
