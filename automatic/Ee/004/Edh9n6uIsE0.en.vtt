left<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:12.990> old<00:00:13.019> muffler<00:00:13.940> off<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.269> pipe

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.810 

which<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.470> good<00:00:31.679> thing<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.279> kind<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> an

which is a good thing it's kind of an
interesting<00:00:32.910> thing<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.690> pipe<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:35.219> this

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
interesting thing this pipe here on this

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.260 
interesting thing this pipe here on this
Dodge<00:00:36.290> is<00:00:37.290> quite<00:00:38.129> sturdy<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
Dodge is quite sturdy and this is the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.200 
Dodge is quite sturdy and this is the
pipe<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.660> runs<00:00:39.690> all<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> way<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:41.000> to<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
pipe that runs all the way up to the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.670 
pipe that runs all the way up to the
engine<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:43.170> fact<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:45.110> has<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> crossover

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
engine in fact it has a crossover

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.330 
engine in fact it has a crossover
there's<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:48.270> there<00:00:49.039> underneath<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.309> oil

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
there's way up there underneath the oil

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.540 
there's way up there underneath the oil
pan<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.590> people<00:00:52.590> say<00:00:52.739> well<00:00:52.920> I'll<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.309> draw<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
pan and people say well I'll just draw a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.069 
pan and people say well I'll just draw a
set<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.879> duals<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.629> well<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.960> would

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
set of duals on here well it would

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.680 
set of duals on here well it would
require<00:00:55.260> making<00:00:55.920> two<00:00:56.370> new<00:00:56.760> pipes<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.449> come

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
require making two new pipes that come

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.290 
require making two new pipes that come
off<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.260> intake<00:00:58.710> manifold<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.460> back<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.000> here

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
off the intake manifold and back to here

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.049 
off the intake manifold and back to here
which<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.410> not<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> easy<00:01:01.890> first<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:02.910> it's

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
which is not that easy first of all it's

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.189 
which is not that easy first of all it's
not<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.329> easy<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> get<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> bolts<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
not that easy to get the bolts out of

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.960 
not that easy to get the bolts out of
the<00:01:04.320> intake<00:01:04.589> manifold<00:01:05.159> most<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.729> time

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the intake manifold most of the time

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.109 
the intake manifold most of the time
because<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:06.930> tend<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.170> rust<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.590> place<00:01:08.119> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
because they tend to rust in place and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.490 
because they tend to rust in place and
they<00:01:09.360> tend<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> break<00:01:09.840> off<00:01:10.080> when<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.320> try<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
they tend to break off when you try to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.550 
they tend to break off when you try to
get<00:01:10.650> them<00:01:10.799> off<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.970> my<00:01:12.090> money<00:01:12.409> long<00:01:13.409> as

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
get them off so for my money long as

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.450 
get them off so for my money long as
this<00:01:13.710> pipes<00:01:13.950> good

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
this pipes good

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.850 
this pipes good
I'll<00:01:14.760> keep<00:01:14.909> drawing<00:01:15.210> mufflers<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.900> when<00:01:16.710> I

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
I'll keep drawing mufflers on it when I

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.440 
I'll keep drawing mufflers on it when I
have<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> replace<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.460> pipe<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.270> then

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
have to replace that pipe and then

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.609 
have to replace that pipe and then
that'll<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> good<00:01:18.960> time<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.229> put<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> set<00:01:19.590> of

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that'll be a good time to put a set of

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.450 
that'll be a good time to put a set of
duals<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.130> it

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
duals on it

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.330 
duals on it
but<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.270> today<00:01:21.500> just<00:01:22.500> an<00:01:22.619> interesting<00:01:23.070> fact

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
but not today just an interesting fact

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.359 
but not today just an interesting fact
I'm<00:01:23.580> sitting<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.420> looking<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.369> and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
I'm sitting here looking at this and

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.200 
I'm sitting here looking at this and
here's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.450> muffler<00:01:27.840> clamp<00:01:28.820> right<00:01:29.820> here<00:01:32.210> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
here's a muffler clamp right here that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.880 
here's a muffler clamp right here that
has<00:01:33.329> rested<00:01:33.750> away<00:01:33.960> completely<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.770> it's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
has rested away completely and it's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.069 
has rested away completely and it's
still<00:01:35.130> hanging<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:35.659> yeah<00:01:36.659> that's<00:01:36.810> kind<00:01:36.990> of

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
still hanging there yeah that's kind of

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.539 
still hanging there yeah that's kind of
interesting<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> suppose<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.369> could

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
interesting you know I suppose I could

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.870 
interesting you know I suppose I could
take<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.880> off<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.530> then<00:01:40.530> again<00:01:40.829> maybe<00:01:41.670> it's

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
take that off and then again maybe it's

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.109 
take that off and then again maybe it's
not<00:01:42.000> ready<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> come<00:01:42.509> off<00:01:42.570> yet<00:01:43.670> it's<00:01:44.670> rusted

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
not ready to come off yet it's rusted

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.999 
not ready to come off yet it's rusted
that's<00:01:45.329> not<00:01:45.509> rested<00:01:45.899> enough<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.200> fall<00:01:46.409> off<00:01:46.649> so

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that's not rested enough to fall off so

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.039 
that's not rested enough to fall off so
okay<00:01:47.399> I'll<00:01:48.119> leave<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.420> hanging<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:48.869> head

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
okay I'll leave it hanging here head

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.710 
okay I'll leave it hanging here head
don't<00:01:49.140> bother<00:01:49.380> me<00:01:49.590> too<00:01:49.740> much<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:51.270> muffler<00:01:51.630> is

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
don't bother me too much this muffler is

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.690 
don't bother me too much this muffler is
in<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> way<00:01:52.140> otherwise<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.619> could<00:01:52.979> maybe<00:01:53.340> slide

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
in the way otherwise I could maybe slide

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.360 
in the way otherwise I could maybe slide
that<00:01:53.909> out<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.119> my<00:01:54.210> friend<00:01:54.479> place

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.170 

get<00:02:03.370> rid<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.840> old<00:02:05.170> muffler<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:07.030> it's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
get rid of this old muffler I think it's

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.869 
get rid of this old muffler I think it's
time<00:02:07.360> for<00:02:07.420> some<00:02:09.390> liquid<00:02:10.390> ranch<00:02:10.600> on<00:02:10.840> it
