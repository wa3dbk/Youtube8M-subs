up from that and I just wasn't taking
care<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.670> them<00:03:22.880> properly<00:03:23.209> because<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.630> thought

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
care of them properly because I thought

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.750 
care of them properly because I thought

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.270 
well if the problems are there they'll
just<00:03:25.910> go<00:03:26.120> away<00:03:26.239> but<00:03:26.720> they<00:03:27.230> don't<00:03:27.560> go<00:03:27.769> away<00:03:27.890> so

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
just go away but they don't go away so

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.120
