quite<00:01:55.120> a<00:01:55.150> good<00:01:56.020> reason<00:01:56.380> he<00:01:56.500> loves<00:01:56.740> coming<00:01:56.920> to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
quite a good reason he loves coming to

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.969 
quite a good reason he loves coming to
America<00:01:57.760> and<00:01:57.910> boy<00:01:58.420> he<00:01:59.140> certainly<00:01:59.380> is<00:01:59.650> value

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
America and boy he certainly is value

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.550 
America and boy he certainly is value
for<00:02:00.010> money<00:02:00.310> isn't<00:02:00.580> it<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:02.020> was<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.140> great<00:02:02.320> sir

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
for money isn't it that was a great sir

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.440 
for money isn't it that was a great sir
once<00:02:02.890> again<00:02:03.160> he<00:02:03.280> came<00:02:03.520> up<00:02:03.729> with<00:02:03.760> a<00:02:03.910> brilliant

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
once again he came up with a brilliant

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.180 
once again he came up with a brilliant
victory<00:02:04.840> salute<00:02:05.229> on<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.590> running<00:02:05.830> towards<00:02:06.130> a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
victory salute on the running towards a

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.350 
victory salute on the running towards a
finish<00:02:06.430> would<00:02:06.520> have<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.760> figure<00:02:07.000> out<00:02:07.090> what<00:02:07.240> it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
finish would have to figure out what it

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.820 
finish would have to figure out what it
was<00:02:07.510> a<00:02:07.540> little<00:02:07.840> bit<00:02:07.960> later<00:02:08.170> on<00:02:08.320> but<00:02:08.560> he<00:02:08.709> was

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
was a little bit later on but he was

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.160 
was a little bit later on but he was
obviously<00:02:09.130> very<00:02:09.399> pleased<00:02:10.270> with<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.510> and<00:02:10.810> I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
obviously very pleased with that and I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.570 
obviously very pleased with that and I
think<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.470> fact<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:11.770> we<00:02:12.010> have<00:02:12.190> those<00:02:12.340> three

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
think the fact that we have those three

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.729 
think the fact that we have those three
tricky<00:02:12.970> corners<00:02:13.570> on<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.810> run<00:02:13.989> into<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.380> final

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
tricky corners on the run into the final

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.530 
tricky corners on the run into the final
kilometer<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.550> really<00:02:15.910> played<00:02:16.209> into<00:02:16.390> his

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
kilometer that really played into his

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.080 
kilometer that really played into his
abilities<00:02:17.170> as<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.380> beautiful<00:02:18.250> backup<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.000> they

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
abilities as a beautiful backup and they

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.430 
abilities as a beautiful backup and they
did<00:02:19.270> point<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.600> his<00:02:19.750> abilities<00:02:20.170> because<00:02:20.320> he

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
did point to his abilities because he

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.080 
did point to his abilities because he
doesn't<00:02:20.620> rips<00:02:20.920> through<00:02:21.100> corners<00:02:21.489> he<00:02:21.610> has

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
doesn't rips through corners he has

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.160 
doesn't rips through corners he has
absolutely<00:02:22.660> no<00:02:22.720> fear<00:02:23.470> whatsoever<00:02:23.620> and
