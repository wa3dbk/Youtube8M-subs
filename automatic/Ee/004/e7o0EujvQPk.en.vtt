00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 and then only personnel in the area with one more 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:14.099
 video and this video will show improvements 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.320
 and the end of a world fight and I also think 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.840
 that's just it 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.590
 his son leave a little more 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.590
 competitive 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.769
 the first structure 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:42.090
 I think in the past it says that the structure 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:54.899
 would be asked but had no access to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:57.350
 lose and also focused soon have a 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:09.960
 someone's plate here at home 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:11.700
 I cut her to do here instead of 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:36.750
 wood 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:41.570
 Only I do not have the tap yet. 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:47.340
 which is also good wooden plate here 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:55.530
 Flag I gave to do here I used here 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:58.110
 underneath is totally trapped here but 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.369
 did not get to turn the board 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.369
 the aluminum or I'll leave it that way 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.369
 same 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.709
 is another improvement that is thinking speech 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.670
 I'm thinking of doing only a few 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:19.780
 and that wheel the wheel which is not very good 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:24.010
 in the film I did what I wanted to change and 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.010
 who used a fake 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:03:52.669
 I saw a guy down below what it was 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:04:08.030
 his weapon on the aluminum plate and 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:04:10.599
 Sweet steel ball which is the used steel moves us 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.599
 the truck 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.560
 saw the people who are using this 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:25.070
 this subject we are going to draw a destination 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:30.110
 A lot of thinking about using this is me too. 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.520
 I'll put some some of the best 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.520
 the mall to do with the 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:41.330
 structure already made will only take another 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:47.270
 retouching is that it gives to let the robot more 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:05:16.700
 competitive was also seeing that the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:05:20.930
 google is chanti that the video there 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:28.479
 the channel and who is it? 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:28.479
 that the channel is written the channel 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:47.919
 and I will not do it now, that 's it 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.919
 Until then he spoke
