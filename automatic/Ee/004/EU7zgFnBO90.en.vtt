00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.839
 5 minutes 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:45.370
 I would like to say 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.330
 at the same time this does not unnecessarily lengthen the demand for troops in the 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.110
 round 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.800

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.009
 present or especially demand 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.599

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.839
 I'm trying my best 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:11.430
 So you should want to have some information, for example, order 

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:15.290
 first super cool when you first time there a bit more imaginary 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.150
 for example or 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.550
 For God's sake I can continue the e-street hunko backlog and so on 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.439
 I'll let that then go through the head accordingly 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:28.110
 evening that now an exclusion process make the games 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.679

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:34.949
 Once again in the round questions or just decide for yourself after 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.820
 of pictures, yes, two players who have been called names most often 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:41.830

 but again I learned and I say goodbye to my reason 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.430

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.430
