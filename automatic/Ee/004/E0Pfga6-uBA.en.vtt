00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:11.130
 greetings his fight announces it's worth 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.660
 it's okay before starting this 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.529
 gigord say something 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.940
 actually so why this 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.529
 is called secret place simply 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.970
 because in episode 1 we for 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.600
 those who watched the andron episode 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.769
 secret that dates from a few months 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.840
 so I said that she called the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.090
 syria like that so like as per 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.430
 example if I call kohler amazing of 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.420
 subscribers and secret place so that's 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.920
 just the name of the series 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.010
 so it's true that in some places 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.290
 which are not so secret but in 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.540
 done if you notice we do not care 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.129
 little of the place it depends on the places 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.680
 in fact blois who has by cons ak 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.719

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.899
 have fun more than we are interested in 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.340

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.579
 after you have more places really 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.690

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.549

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.990
 after we can change others maybe 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.869
