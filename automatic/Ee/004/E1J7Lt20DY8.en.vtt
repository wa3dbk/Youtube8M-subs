00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:18.460
 I have because I breast goshenka role 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.170
 switched to a mixture 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.460
 why it is necessary to feed the mixture why 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:28.530
 you can not give milk until what age 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:35.260
 all feed her this is because she 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:01:00.489
 cow's calcium allergen and 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:01:01.659
 phosphorus goes canzone horned there small 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.620
 guys 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.540
 but here are the free codecs sheets in the midst of heart 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.610
 here we are not in vain came to the execution of the farm 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.650
 in my group moms say that 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.470
 some art niki she is a mixture not 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.710
 want to translate and given cow's milk 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.720
 speak junk immediately give goat's milk 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.290
 well, just say that coffee moccona 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.300
 identical I can mother there is absolutely no 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.290
 so goat milk by chemical composition 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.680
 the same as the king is practically rich 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.210
 protein is rich in minerals fat composition 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.280
 different from mother's milk 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.320
 so the course milk kuzichka me 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.270
 The complex is not fat, that is, too, too 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.890
 the most also there is while team sky milk on 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.810
 road from suez until he can be 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.460
 clinical manifestation when used 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.560
 babyâ€™s milk won't have any there 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.140
 it will be normal to kill it will be normal 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.210
 develop but at this time he has 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.100
 the organism is a colossal 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.350
 load on the enzyme system on 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.030
 digestive system because it goes 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.640
 large amounts of protein intake 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.680
 do a lot of 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.869
 trace elements because it's a load 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.840
 on the kidneys further child depot masters 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.209
 others are intolerant but say 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.950
 that goat's milk mixtures are much 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.540
 better than him 7 strong cows yes 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.790
 quite right anally not so 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.310
 draped like a milk mixture and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.320
 NATO made the second hammer but later 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.930
 protein there is an allergen fraction 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.430
 protein is much less than cow and 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.340
 therefore this milk is counted in a palette 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.320
 lived in the village in the summer then my girls 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.420
 prescribed 5 min aziani cows although we 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.459
 drank the cow why goat milk on 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.350
 more easily its a and there less 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.090
 the protein itself is therefore either good 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.220
 digested smaller fat droplets 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.640
 so good 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.200
 and for the elderly it is food 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.270
 good enough products well that is 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.160
 In principle, it can be said that I am elderly 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.780
 because I lived honestly 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.780
 so for health and for health
