this<00:00:53.399> will<00:00:53.550> make<00:00:53.610> your<00:00:53.730> play<00:00:53.850> an<00:00:53.940> attempt<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
this will make your play an attempt to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.939 
this will make your play an attempt to
keep<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> weight<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.960> rear<00:00:55.110> wheels<00:00:55.170> if

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
keep the weight on the rear wheels if

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.229 
keep the weight on the rear wheels if
this<00:00:56.129> fails<00:00:56.280> however<00:00:56.640> you'll<00:00:56.940> need<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> move

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
this fails however you'll need to move

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.760 
this fails however you'll need to move
on<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.480> actually<00:00:57.660> redesigning<00:00:58.289> your<00:00:58.440> plane

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
on to actually redesigning your plane

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.709 
on to actually redesigning your plane
the<00:00:59.640> first<00:00:59.850> design<00:01:00.000> change<00:01:00.359> you'll<00:01:00.539> likely

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the first design change you'll likely

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.330 
the first design change you'll likely
need<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:00.989> make<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.469> place<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:01.829> front<00:01:02.190> gear

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
need to make is to place your front gear

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.280 
need to make is to place your front gear
lower<00:01:02.579> than<00:01:02.820> your<00:01:02.969> rear<00:01:03.180> gear<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.170> make

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
lower than your rear gear this will make

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.450 
lower than your rear gear this will make
your<00:01:04.350> plane's<00:01:04.589> start<00:01:04.860> out<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.070> nosed<00:01:05.280> up

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
your plane's start out and nosed up

your plane's start out and nosed up
slightly<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.060> runway<00:01:06.360> five<00:01:07.080> degrees<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
slightly on the runway five degrees is a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.380 
slightly on the runway five degrees is a
good<00:01:07.680> place<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> start<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.030> either<00:01:09.119> lower

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
good place to start you can either lower

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.120 
good place to start you can either lower
the<00:01:09.570> mounting<00:01:09.840> point<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.260> your<00:01:10.380> nose<00:01:10.560> gear<00:01:10.830> or

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the mounting point of your nose gear or

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.219 
the mounting point of your nose gear or
raise<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.700> your<00:01:11.850> rear<00:01:11.970> gears<00:01:12.240> keep<00:01:13.140> in

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
raise it for your rear gears keep in

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.390 
raise it for your rear gears keep in
mind<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.590> raising<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.010> rear<00:01:14.130> gears

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
mind that raising your rear gears

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.130 
mind that raising your rear gears
increases<00:01:14.970> your<00:01:15.090> chance<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.450> tail<00:01:15.689> striking

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
increases your chance of tail striking

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.840 
increases your chance of tail striking
so<00:01:16.560> watch<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.490> use<00:01:17.610> your<00:01:17.759> own

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
so watch out for this and use your own

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.480 
so watch out for this and use your own
discretion<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.680> other<00:01:19.799> option<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.280> is

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
discretion the other option you have is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.700 
discretion the other option you have is
to<00:01:20.700> tilt<00:01:20.970> your<00:01:21.090> wings<00:01:21.270> upwards<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.960> 5<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.560> 10

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
to tilt your wings upwards a 5 to 10

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.140 
to tilt your wings upwards a 5 to 10
degree<00:01:22.950> pitch<00:01:23.159> will<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.460> sufficient<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> give

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
degree pitch will be sufficient to give

the<00:01:52.000> best<00:01:52.180> way<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.300> check<00:01:52.540> for<00:01:52.720> this<00:01:52.780> is<00:01:52.990> just

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
the best way to check for this is just

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.350 
the best way to check for this is just
eyeball<00:01:53.620> it<00:01:53.650> unfortunately<00:01:54.340> this<00:01:55.060> usually

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
eyeball it unfortunately this usually

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.790 
eyeball it unfortunately this usually
happens<00:01:55.690> when<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:55.870> mount<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.110> gear<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.530> wing

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
happens when you mount a gear to a wing

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.320 
happens when you mount a gear to a wing
and<00:01:57.010> then<00:01:57.310> later<00:01:57.520> go<00:01:57.640> back<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.030> change<00:01:58.210> the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
and then later go back and change the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.210 
and then later go back and change the
wings<00:01:58.570> orientation<00:01:59.320> using<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.830> shift<00:02:00.070> key

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
wings orientation using the shift key

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.730 
wings orientation using the shift key
this<00:02:01.090> also<00:02:01.330> changes<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.840> landing<00:02:02.170> gear<00:02:02.350> so

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
this also changes the landing gear so

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.780 
this also changes the landing gear so
you<00:02:02.800> just<00:02:02.920> have<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.100> be<00:02:03.220> careful<00:02:03.580> when<00:02:03.670> you're

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
you just have to be careful when you're

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.130 
you just have to be careful when you're
designing<00:02:03.910> your<00:02:04.240> plane<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.690> watch<00:02:04.810> out<00:02:04.990> for

lift<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.410> can<00:03:17.530> add<00:03:17.680> more<00:03:17.890> wings<00:03:18.130> usually

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
lift you can add more wings usually

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.509 
lift you can add more wings usually

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
work with your specific design another

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.340 
work with your specific design another
option<00:03:31.300> would<00:03:31.390> be<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.660> add<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.780> VTOL<00:03:32.170> engine

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
option would be to add a VTOL engine

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.410 
option would be to add a VTOL engine
VTOL<00:03:33.190> stands<00:03:33.459> for<00:03:33.670> vertical<00:03:34.000> takeoff<00:03:34.390> and

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
VTOL stands for vertical takeoff and

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.630 
VTOL stands for vertical takeoff and
landing<00:03:34.870> I'll<00:03:35.650> be<00:03:35.800> covering<00:03:36.040> that<00:03:36.190> very<00:03:36.370> soon

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
landing I'll be covering that very soon

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.479 
landing I'll be covering that very soon
though<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.120> won't<00:03:37.269> get<00:03:37.420> into<00:03:37.570> it<00:03:37.660> now<00:03:38.190> as<00:03:39.190> for

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
though so I won't get into it now as for

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.130 
though so I won't get into it now as for
the<00:03:39.580> power<00:03:39.790> issue<00:03:40.090> there<00:03:40.630> are<00:03:40.660> two<00:03:40.840> things<00:03:41.050> you

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
the power issue there are two things you

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.229 
the power issue there are two things you
can<00:03:41.320> do<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:42.250> first<00:03:42.400> one<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.940> one<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.090> I

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
can do the first one and the one that I

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.030 
can do the first one and the one that I
recommend<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.050> reduce<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.620> weight<00:03:44.769> of<00:03:44.980> the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
recommend is to reduce the weight of the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.600 
recommend is to reduce the weight of the
aircraft

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
aircraft

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.699

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
don't get sucked into adding more and

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.620 
don't get sucked into adding more and
more<00:03:47.920> fuel<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.519> engines<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:49.000> your<00:03:49.120> plugin<00:03:49.450> as

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
more fuel and engines to your plugin as

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.300 
more fuel and engines to your plugin as
this<00:03:49.780> can<00:03:49.959> lead<00:03:50.079> you<00:03:50.200> down<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.380> dark<00:03:50.680> road

this can lead you down a dark road
less<00:03:52.310> weight<00:03:52.550> means<00:03:52.819> that<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.090> engines

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
less weight means that the engines

effective less weight also leads to
needing<00:03:56.540> less<00:03:56.690> fuel<00:03:57.050> just<00:03:57.440> keep<00:03:57.620> this<00:03:57.709> in<00:03:57.769> mind

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
center of mass even the tiniest bit of

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.180 
center of mass even the tiniest bit of
lift<00:04:23.990> in<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.200> front<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.590> plane<00:04:24.800> is<00:04:24.950> enough

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
lift in the front of the plane is enough

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.250 
lift in the front of the plane is enough
to<00:04:25.280> get<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:25.400> airborne<00:04:25.690> I'd<00:04:26.690> recommend<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.139> use

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
to get you airborne I'd recommend to use

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.110 
to get you airborne I'd recommend to use
the<00:04:27.530> small<00:04:27.830> control<00:04:28.160> surfaces<00:04:28.639> for<00:04:28.850> smaller

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
the small control surfaces for smaller

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.150 
the small control surfaces for smaller
aircraft<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.810> move<00:04:30.110> up<00:04:30.260> to<00:04:30.380> full<00:04:30.590> winglets<00:04:30.979> or

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
aircraft and move up to full winglets or

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.370 
aircraft and move up to full winglets or
canards<00:04:31.520> for<00:04:31.700> larger<00:04:31.970> designs<00:04:32.270> see<00:04:33.200> if<00:04:33.260> this

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
canards for larger designs see if this

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.730 
canards for larger designs see if this
works

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
works

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.350 
works
and<00:04:33.919> I'd<00:04:34.130> say<00:04:34.280> over<00:04:34.490> half<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:34.850> time<00:04:35.030> that<00:04:35.060> this

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
and I'd say over half the time that this

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.870 
and I'd say over half the time that this
does<00:04:35.600> it<00:04:35.979> if<00:04:36.979> that<00:04:37.130> didn't<00:04:37.400> work<00:04:37.490> or<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:37.820> don't

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
does it if that didn't work or you don't

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.520 
does it if that didn't work or you don't
want<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.120> use<00:04:38.210> canards<00:04:38.660> which<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:39.139> understand

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
want to use canards which I understand

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.140 
want to use canards which I understand
because<00:04:39.770> they<00:04:40.430> don't<00:04:40.580> fit<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.850> look<00:04:40.970> you're

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
because they don't fit the look you're

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.210 
because they don't fit the look you're
going<00:04:41.270> for<00:04:41.450> sometimes<00:04:42.020> then<00:04:42.919> we<00:04:43.010> need<00:04:43.160> to

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
going for sometimes then we need to

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.680 
going for sometimes then we need to
adjust<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.580> built<00:04:43.760> in<00:04:43.910> angle<00:04:44.120> of<00:04:44.270> attack<00:04:44.360> of

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
adjust the built in angle of attack of

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.230 
adjust the built in angle of attack of
your<00:04:44.810> plane<00:04:45.669> we<00:04:46.669> can<00:04:46.760> do<00:04:46.880> this<00:04:47.030> by<00:04:47.150> adjusting

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
your plane we can do this by adjusting

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.760 
your plane we can do this by adjusting
the<00:04:47.600> gear<00:04:47.780> placement<00:04:48.229> like<00:04:48.410> we<00:04:48.530> did<00:04:48.650> earlier

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
the gear placement like we did earlier

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.440 
the gear placement like we did earlier
to<00:04:49.130> get<00:04:49.220> rid<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.520> veering<00:04:49.760> problem<00:04:50.090> you

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
to get rid of the veering problem you

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.730 
to get rid of the veering problem you
should<00:04:50.630> try<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.840> have<00:04:50.990> your<00:04:51.110> nose<00:04:51.290> of<00:04:51.590> the

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
should try to have your nose of the

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.409 
should try to have your nose of the
plane<00:04:51.860> be<00:04:52.160> pitched<00:04:52.400> up<00:04:52.550> at<00:04:52.639> least<00:04:52.850> 5<00:04:53.090> degrees

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
plane be pitched up at least 5 degrees

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.060 
plane be pitched up at least 5 degrees
while<00:04:53.600> sitting<00:04:53.840> still<00:04:54.050> on<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.260> runway<00:04:54.530> you

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
while sitting still on the runway you

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.920 
while sitting still on the runway you
out<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.340> give<00:04:55.460> this<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.639> shot<00:04:55.880> now<00:04:56.060> if<00:04:56.750> you've

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
out and give this a shot now if you've

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.150 
out and give this a shot now if you've
done<00:04:57.050> all<00:04:57.200> these<00:04:57.320> things<00:04:57.380> then<00:04:57.860> your<00:04:57.979> plane

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
done all these things then your plane

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.430 
done all these things then your plane
should<00:04:58.460> be<00:04:58.639> in<00:04:58.729> the<00:04:58.850> air<00:04:58.990> one<00:04:59.990> problem<00:05:00.320> that<00:05:00.410> a

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
should be in the air one problem that a

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.500 
should be in the air one problem that a
lot<00:05:00.560> of<00:05:00.590> people<00:05:00.830> say<00:05:01.039> causes<00:05:01.430> takeoff<00:05:02.000> issues

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
lot of people say causes takeoff issues

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.540 
lot of people say causes takeoff issues
is<00:05:02.750> that<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:03.410> rear<00:05:03.560> gears<00:05:03.830> are<00:05:04.070> mounted<00:05:04.430> too

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
is that the rear gears are mounted too

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.700 
is that the rear gears are mounted too
far<00:05:04.760> away<00:05:04.910> from<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.150> center<00:05:05.360> of<00:05:05.419> mass<00:05:05.600> I<00:05:05.870> don't

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
far away from the center of mass I don't

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.140 
far away from the center of mass I don't
agree<00:05:06.830> with<00:05:06.979> this<00:05:07.130> though<00:05:07.340> as<00:05:07.580> if<00:05:07.880> you've<00:05:08.030> got

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
agree with this though as if you've got

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.760 
agree with this though as if you've got
the<00:05:08.270> three<00:05:08.479> ingredients<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:09.110> mentioned<00:05:09.440> for

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
the three ingredients I mentioned for

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.129 
the three ingredients I mentioned for
lift<00:05:10.220> power<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:10.789> angle<00:05:11.030> of<00:05:11.090> attack<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:12.050> you

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
lift power and angle of attack and you

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.840 
lift power and angle of attack and you
can<00:05:12.289> mount<00:05:12.410> your<00:05:12.500> rear<00:05:12.740> gears<00:05:12.979> way<00:05:13.280> behind

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
can mount your rear gears way behind

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.070 
can mount your rear gears way behind
your<00:05:13.940> center<00:05:14.150> of<00:05:14.180> mass<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:14.600> it<00:05:14.810> won't<00:05:14.960> matter

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
your center of mass and it won't matter

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.740 
your center of mass and it won't matter
you'll<00:05:15.590> still<00:05:15.800> take<00:05:15.979> off<00:05:16.240> that<00:05:17.240> being<00:05:17.539> said

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
you'll still take off that being said

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.300 
you'll still take off that being said
mounting<00:05:18.260> your<00:05:18.350> rear<00:05:18.500> gears<00:05:18.740> closer<00:05:19.070> to<00:05:19.220> your

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
mounting your rear gears closer to your

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.770 
mounting your rear gears closer to your
center<00:05:19.580> of<00:05:19.610> mass<00:05:19.669> could<00:05:20.090> enable<00:05:20.419> you<00:05:20.510> to<00:05:20.570> take

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
center of mass could enable you to take

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.300 
center of mass could enable you to take
off<00:05:20.930> with<00:05:21.139> less<00:05:21.320> angle<00:05:21.620> of<00:05:21.680> attack<00:05:21.740> as<00:05:22.160> your

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
off with less angle of attack as your

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.860 
off with less angle of attack as your
plane<00:05:22.460> will<00:05:22.610> naturally<00:05:22.760> pitch<00:05:23.150> up<00:05:23.300> easier<00:05:23.630> but

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
plane will naturally pitch up easier but

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.270 
plane will naturally pitch up easier but
you<00:05:23.930> might<00:05:24.080> be<00:05:24.169> vulnerable<00:05:24.380> to<00:05:24.650> tail<00:05:24.950> striking

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
you might be vulnerable to tail striking

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.850 
you might be vulnerable to tail striking
again<00:05:25.580> so<00:05:26.000> be<00:05:26.180> careful<00:05:26.479> and<00:05:26.750> now<00:05:27.590> we'll<00:05:27.740> cover
