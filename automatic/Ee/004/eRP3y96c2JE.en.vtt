00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.970 
ones for me and I did end up getting
three<00:01:00.690> suits<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.320> they're<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.739> from

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
three suits and they're all from

swimsuits for all calm and I think the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.210 
swimsuits for all calm and I think the
most<00:01:05.220> expensive<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.150> maybe<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:07.010> $58<00:01:08.010> or

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
most expensive one was maybe like $58 or

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.370 
most expensive one was maybe like $58 or
something<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.570> most<00:01:09.720> affordable<00:01:09.990> one

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
something and the most affordable one

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.490 
something and the most affordable one
was<00:01:10.560> around<00:01:10.740> 25<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.750> price<00:01:12.960> range<00:01:13.260> was

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
was around 25 so the price range was

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.929

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
able to find three that are basically

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.740 
able to find three that are basically
all<00:01:49.920> made<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.759> same<00:01:51.030> they<00:01:51.570> are<00:01:51.600> different

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
designers but they're made the same so

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.780 
designers but they're made the same so
I'm<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:55.770> looking<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
I'm what I was looking for I like a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.990 
I'm what I was looking for I like a
one-piece<00:01:57.329> with<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> halter<00:01:58.110> neck<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
one-piece with a halter neck I like the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.639 
one-piece with a halter neck I like the
thicker<00:02:00.360> straps<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:01.140> they're<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.439> more

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
thicker straps because they're just more

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.319 
thicker straps because they're just more
in<00:02:01.740> proportion<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.430> they<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.759> provide<00:02:03.119> more

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
in proportion and they just provide more

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.080 
in proportion and they just provide more
support<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.500> halter<00:02:04.860> neck<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.369> mean<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.909> is

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
support and a halter neck I mean this is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.760 
support and a halter neck I mean this is
what<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.390> looks<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.960> ties<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> back

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
what it looks like it ties in the back

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.630 
what it looks like it ties in the back
so<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.610> fits<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.330> know<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.640> know

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
so it fits you know like that I know

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.230 
so it fits you know like that I know
this<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.940> an

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
this is an

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.320 
this is an
then<00:02:12.810> perfectly<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:14.190> get<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.430> idea<00:02:14.460> but

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
then perfectly but you get the idea but

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.810 
then perfectly but you get the idea but
I<00:02:15.660> do<00:02:15.960> like<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.410> thicker<00:02:16.740> strap<00:02:17.130> just<00:02:17.490> because

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
I do like a thicker strap just because

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.850 
I do like a thicker strap just because
it<00:02:18.030> provides<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.600> support<00:02:18.810> sometimes<00:02:19.530> those

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
it provides the support sometimes those

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.800 
it provides the support sometimes those
thinner<00:02:20.250> straps<00:02:20.610> will<00:02:20.820> leave<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.060> sagging<00:02:21.570> or

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
thinner straps will leave you sagging or

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.420 
thinner straps will leave you sagging or
just<00:02:22.050> not<00:02:22.290> leave<00:02:22.500> your<00:02:22.740> weight<00:02:23.010> distributed

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
just not leave your weight distributed

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.970 
just not leave your weight distributed
evenly<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.480> may<00:02:24.990> put<00:02:25.200> some<00:02:25.410> more<00:02:25.560> strain<00:02:25.830> on

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
evenly and may put some more strain on

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.350 
evenly and may put some more strain on
your<00:02:26.100> back<00:02:26.280> than<00:02:26.580> necessary

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
your back than necessary

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.680 
your back than necessary
whereas<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.220> that<00:02:29.220> ties<00:02:29.460> behind<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.360> has<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
whereas this that ties behind it has the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.790 
whereas this that ties behind it has the
thicker<00:02:30.930> shock<00:02:31.140> will<00:02:31.290> really<00:02:31.530> give<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
thicker shock will really give you the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.490 
thicker shock will really give you the
extra<00:02:32.100> support<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.880> do<00:02:33.780> look<00:02:33.960> for<00:02:34.170> something

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500

that<00:02:34.650> does<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> little<00:02:35.460> support<00:02:35.730> inside

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
that does have a little support inside

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.260 
that does have a little support inside
whether<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.080> full<00:02:37.290> bra<00:02:37.560> or<00:02:38.120> some<00:02:39.120> nice

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
thicker halter strap to it so it's

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.689

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.400 
and then it's got a nice little fun
design<00:05:27.220> right<00:05:27.430> there<00:05:27.840> cups<00:05:28.840> on<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.440> back<00:05:34.410> and

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
here which probably provides a little

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.879 
here which probably provides a little
bit<00:05:40.270> of<00:05:40.389> tummy<00:05:41.020> control<00:05:41.260> if<00:05:41.710> you're
