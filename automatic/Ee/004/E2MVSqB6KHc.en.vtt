why<00:00:19.250> that<00:00:19.279> is<00:00:19.460> but<00:00:20.240> for<00:00:20.570> some<00:00:20.750> reason<00:00:21.050> we've

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
why that is but for some reason we've

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.880 
why that is but for some reason we've
always<00:00:21.320> stopped<00:00:21.740> at<00:00:22.039> our<00:00:22.880> 30s<00:00:23.359> I<00:00:23.630> guess<00:00:24.170> I<00:00:24.380> sort

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
always stopped at our 30s I guess I sort

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.919 
always stopped at our 30s I guess I sort
of<00:00:25.010> gravitate<00:00:25.460> more<00:00:25.490> towards<00:00:26.210> older<00:00:26.660> cars

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
of gravitate more towards older cars

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.120 
of gravitate more towards older cars
maybe<00:00:27.410> that's<00:00:27.710> it

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
maybe that's it

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.980 
maybe that's it
but<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.670> Nissan<00:00:28.910> Skyline<00:00:29.000> is<00:00:29.570> certainly<00:00:29.900> a

but the Nissan Skyline is certainly a

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
house now I didn't have a clue about our

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.600 
house now I didn't have a clue about our
thirty-one<00:01:24.680> house<00:01:24.890> but<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.190> seems<00:01:25.430> they're

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
thirty-one house but it seems they're

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.700 
thirty-one house but it seems they're
fairly<00:01:26.000> well<00:01:26.120> known<00:01:26.150> I<00:01:26.660> did<00:01:27.260> some<00:01:27.380> googling

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
fairly well known I did some googling

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.030 
fairly well known I did some googling
and<00:01:28.040> they're<00:01:28.700> in<00:01:29.120> Gifu<00:01:29.690> Gifu<00:01:30.140> is<00:01:30.290> like<00:01:30.740> right

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
and they're in Gifu Gifu is like right

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.860 
and they're in Gifu Gifu is like right
in<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.340> center<00:01:31.670> of<00:01:31.700> Japan<00:01:32.120> and<00:01:32.420> I'm<00:01:32.510> just<00:01:32.690> way

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
in the center of Japan and I'm just way

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.930 
in the center of Japan and I'm just way
out<00:01:33.050> west<00:01:33.260> so<00:01:33.680> there's<00:01:34.280> certainly<00:01:34.520> no<00:01:34.670> chance

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
out west so there's certainly no chance

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.940 
out west so there's certainly no chance
I<00:01:35.060> could<00:01:35.150> ever<00:01:35.330> visit<00:01:35.720> but<00:01:36.320> it<00:01:36.440> seems<00:01:36.710> they<00:01:36.890> do

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
I could ever visit but it seems they do

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.120 
I could ever visit but it seems they do
maintenance<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.180> repairs<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.440> restorations

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
maintenance and repairs and restorations

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.180 
maintenance and repairs and restorations
and<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.850> guess<00:01:41.360> they<00:01:41.510> just<00:01:41.720> love<00:01:41.990> our<00:01:42.800> thirty

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
and I guess they just love our thirty

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.190 
and I guess they just love our thirty
ones<00:01:43.430> exclusively<00:01:44.420> hence<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.810> name<00:01:44.930> of<00:01:45.110> the

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
ones exclusively hence the name of the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.590 
ones exclusively hence the name of the
business<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:46.070> makes<00:01:46.280> sense<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.820> apparently

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
business that makes sense and apparently

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.910 
business that makes sense and apparently
they<00:01:47.780> have<00:01:47.810> quite<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.200> fan<00:01:48.440> base<00:01:48.590> in<00:01:48.800> Australia

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
they have quite a fan base in Australia

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.670 
they have quite a fan base in Australia
which<00:01:49.490> actually<00:01:49.940> could<00:01:50.060> explain<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:51.200> email

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
which actually could explain the email

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.560 
which actually could explain the email
in<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:51.890> first<00:01:52.100> place<00:01:52.310> okay<00:01:52.550> guys<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:53.390> hope

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
in the first place okay guys I hope

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.200 
in the first place okay guys I hope
