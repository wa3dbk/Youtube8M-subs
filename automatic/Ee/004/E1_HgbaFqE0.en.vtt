mean bringing up here basically he

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.120 
mean bringing up here basically he
probably<00:02:31.630> wouldn't<00:02:31.930> do<00:02:32.019> it<00:02:32.170> what<00:02:32.769> was<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.010> like

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
probably wouldn't do it what was it like

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.710 
probably wouldn't do it what was it like
when<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.370> jumped<00:02:33.760> off<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.030> first<00:02:34.209> 10<00:02:34.510> meter

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
when you jumped off the first 10 meter

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.009 
when you jumped off the first 10 meter
did<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.080> think<00:02:36.390> yeah<00:02:37.390> was<00:02:37.630> horrible

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
did you think yeah was horrible

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.690 
did you think yeah was horrible
because<00:02:38.380> I'm<00:02:38.620> scared<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:38.950> heights<00:02:39.010> genuinely

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
because I'm scared of heights genuinely

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.850 
because I'm scared of heights genuinely
I<00:02:39.790> don't<00:02:40.000> like<00:02:40.150> Heights<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:40.810> I've<00:02:41.260> only<00:02:41.440> gents

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
I don't like Heights so I've only gents

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.530 
I don't like Heights so I've only gents
f<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.099> it<00:02:42.220> that's<00:02:42.790> actually<00:02:42.940> probably<00:02:43.269> more

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
f of it that's actually probably more

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.870 
f of it that's actually probably more
difficult<00:02:44.170> going<00:02:44.410> feet<00:02:44.620> first<00:02:44.890> in<00:02:45.459> fact<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.790> is

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
difficult going feet first in fact it is

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.229 
difficult going feet first in fact it is
more<00:02:46.150> difficult<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.530> needed<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.239> just

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
more difficult but I just needed to just

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.479 
more difficult but I just needed to just
to<00:02:49.329> go<00:02:49.510> without<00:02:49.780> barrier<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.980> i'm<00:02:51.130> glad<00:02:51.340> i've

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
to go without barrier and i'm glad i've

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.130 
to go without barrier and i'm glad i've
done<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.030> next<00:02:52.480> time<00:02:52.660> ever<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.019> go

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
done it and next time ever to go

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.190 
done it and next time ever to go
headfirst<00:02:53.350> which<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.310> actually<00:02:54.489> easier

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
headfirst which is actually easier

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.170 
headfirst which is actually easier
that's<00:02:56.200> easier<00:02:56.739> so<00:02:57.280> when<00:02:57.430> can<00:02:57.549> we<00:02:57.670> expect<00:02:57.700> it

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
that's easier so when can we expect it

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.729 
that's easier so when can we expect it
to<00:02:58.269> be<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.450> your<00:02:58.540> speedos<00:02:58.989> back<00:02:59.290> in<00:02:59.440> here<00:02:59.590> and

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
to be in your speedos back in here and

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.199 
to be in your speedos back in here and
doing<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.010> big<00:03:00.160> dive<00:03:00.340> then<00:03:00.640> well<00:03:00.850> i<00:03:00.880> don't

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
doing the big dive then well i don't

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.819 
doing the big dive then well i don't
know<00:03:01.299> i<00:03:01.390> mean<00:03:01.690> it<00:03:01.900> depends<00:03:02.260> on<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.470> event

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
know i mean it depends on the event

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.020 
know i mean it depends on the event
because<00:03:03.070> obviously<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.609> a<00:03:03.640> big<00:03:03.820> fee

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
because obviously this is a big fee

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.810 
because obviously this is a big fee
natur<00:03:04.570> World<00:03:04.780> Series<00:03:04.989> event<00:03:05.380> so<00:03:05.739> it's<00:03:06.519> it's

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
natur World Series event so it's it's

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.580 
natur World Series event so it's it's
more<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> case<00:03:07.299> of<00:03:07.359> finding<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.079> right<00:03:08.109> event

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
more a case of finding the right event

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.099 
more a case of finding the right event
so<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:08.950> think<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.340> next<00:03:09.549> big<00:03:09.700> event<00:03:09.819> here<00:03:10.450> is

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
so I think the next big event here is

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.650 
so I think the next big event here is
probably<00:03:11.440> July<00:03:12.069> so<00:03:12.819> it<00:03:12.940> could<00:03:13.120> be<00:03:13.150> back<00:03:13.420> here

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
probably July so it could be back here

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.140 
probably July so it could be back here
in<00:03:13.780> july<00:03:14.019> probably<00:03:14.230> not<00:03:14.560> before<00:03:14.680> then<00:03:15.130> or<00:03:15.430> it

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
in july probably not before then or it

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.309 
in july probably not before then or it
could<00:03:16.299> be<00:03:16.329> that<00:03:16.450> i<00:03:16.630> have<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.049> find<00:03:17.230> another

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
could be that i have to find another

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.020 
could be that i have to find another
event<00:03:17.739> symbols<00:03:18.130> around<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.549> world<00:03:18.730> that

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
event symbols around the world that

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.160 
event symbols around the world that
wouldn't<00:03:19.299> be<00:03:19.420> too<00:03:19.600> bad<00:03:19.630> what<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.019> could<00:03:20.140> be

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
wouldn't be too bad what it could be

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.170 
wouldn't be too bad what it could be
always

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
always

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.850
