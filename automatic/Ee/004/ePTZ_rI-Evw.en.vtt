minion<00:00:13.849> skateboard<00:00:14.849> minion<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.680> actually

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
minion skateboard minion and actually

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.240 
minion skateboard minion and actually
it's<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.900> different<00:00:18.900> parts<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.590> we<00:00:19.920> need<00:00:20.070> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
it's in different parts and we need to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.560 
it's in different parts and we need to
assemble<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:23.029> without<00:00:24.029> wasting<00:00:24.090> any

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
assemble it and so without wasting any

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.380 
assemble it and so without wasting any
further<00:00:24.900> time<00:00:25.230> let's<00:00:25.529> open<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.980> up<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.390> see

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
further time let's open it up and see

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.360 
further time let's open it up and see
how<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.930> works<00:00:32.180> here<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:34.160> million<00:00:35.160> on

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
how it works here we have a million on

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.139 
how it works here we have a million on
skateboard<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.899> actually<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.770> too<00:00:38.149> many

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
skateboard but it's actually in too many

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.950 
skateboard but it's actually in too many
paths<00:00:39.570> divided<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:42.590> let's<00:00:44.210> figure<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.390> out<00:00:45.629> how

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
paths divided so let's figure it out how

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.369 
paths divided so let's figure it out how
to<00:00:46.020> make<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:47.450> into<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.660> real<00:00:49.020> minion<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:52.050> far

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to make this into a real minion so far

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.689 
to make this into a real minion so far
it's<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.770> part<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.920> let's<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.840> first<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.020> all

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
it's just part so let's see first of all

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.450 
it's just part so let's see first of all
the<00:00:59.699> easy<00:00:59.850> parts<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:01.140> skateboard<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the easy parts the skateboard and this

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.649 
the easy parts the skateboard and this
are<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.879> wheels<00:01:03.170> so<00:01:04.170> we'll<00:01:04.379> assemble<00:01:05.659> that

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
are the wheels so we'll assemble that

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:15.080 
are the wheels so we'll assemble that
part<00:01:07.229> first<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.560> our<00:01:13.920> skateboard<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.729> ready

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
part first so our skateboard is ready

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:25.130 
part first so our skateboard is ready
now<00:01:16.430> we<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.799> body<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:23.659> this<00:01:24.659> seems<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
now we have this body and this seems to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.490 
now we have this body and this seems to
be<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> face<00:01:26.009> actually<00:01:27.680> with<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:30.350> single<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
be the face actually with the I single I

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.940 
be the face actually with the I single I
and<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:37.549> this<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.759> actually<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.509> part<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.770> his

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and so this is actually the part of his

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:52.140 
and so this is actually the part of his
ahead

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:51.500 

this<00:01:52.750> must<00:01:53.050> be<00:01:53.170> somewhere<00:01:54.040> at<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:58.360> bottom<00:01:58.690> or

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.740 

the<00:02:52.510> eye<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.230> body<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.739> almost<00:02:54.510> done<00:02:55.510> and

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
the eye and the body is almost done and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.530 
the eye and the body is almost done and
ready<00:02:56.760> not<00:02:57.760> satisfied<00:02:58.090> with<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.190> fix<00:03:00.540> so

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
ready not satisfied with this fix so

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.449 
ready not satisfied with this fix so
let's<00:03:01.690> try<00:03:02.050> something<00:03:02.349> else<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:03.239> think<00:03:07.890> okay<00:03:08.890> so

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
let's try something else I think okay so

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.650 
let's try something else I think okay so
now<00:03:09.760> it's<00:03:10.319> this<00:03:11.319> part<00:03:11.650> is<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.160> mouth<00:03:12.400> as<00:03:12.970> you

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
now it's this part is the mouth as you

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.979 
now it's this part is the mouth as you
can<00:03:13.810> see<00:03:14.080> so<00:03:14.700> now<00:03:15.700> it's<00:03:15.970> fixed<00:03:16.420> properly<00:03:16.750> and

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
can see so now it's fixed properly and

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:27.600 
can see so now it's fixed properly and
this<00:03:19.989> is<00:03:20.170> arm<00:03:24.569> again<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:26.190> there<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.340> some

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
this is arm again the there is some

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:37.059 
this is arm again the there is some
trick<00:03:28.000> with<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.510> arm

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.940 

so<00:03:38.069> one<00:03:38.280> arm<00:03:38.520> is<00:03:38.670> already<00:03:38.849> fixed<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:40.230> it's

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
so one arm is already fixed and it's

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:51.740 
so one arm is already fixed and it's
time<00:03:41.310> for<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.730> another<00:03:42.000> arm<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.630> be<00:03:42.750> placed<00:03:50.750> ok

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
time for the another arm to be placed ok

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.920 
time for the another arm to be placed ok
so<00:03:52.050> both<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.470> arms<00:03:52.800> are<00:03:52.920> ready<00:03:53.480> now<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.660> time

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
so both the arms are ready now it's time

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:12.070 
so both the arms are ready now it's time
for<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:57.500> leg

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.210 

is

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.440 

we<00:04:18.220> need<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.640> fix<00:04:19.120> his<00:04:20.190> hand<00:04:21.190> with<00:04:21.670> his<00:04:22.260> forum

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
we need to fix his hand with his forum

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.040 
we need to fix his hand with his forum
so<00:04:25.450> it's<00:04:25.860> done<00:04:26.860> on<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.070> one<00:04:27.340> side<00:04:27.780> now<00:04:28.780> only

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
so it's done on the one side now only

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:41.400 
so it's done on the one side now only
another<00:04:29.410> side<00:04:37.410> so<00:04:39.390> guess<00:04:40.390> that's<00:04:40.750> it<00:04:40.960> how<00:04:41.380> a

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
another side so guess that's it how a

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.740 
another side so guess that's it how a
minion<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:42.010> ready<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:43.000> roll<00:04:43.150> on<00:04:43.419> his
