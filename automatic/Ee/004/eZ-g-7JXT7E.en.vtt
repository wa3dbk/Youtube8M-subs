you want really great for training and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
you want really great for training and
racing<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.970> these<00:03:02.970> two<00:03:03.270> things<00:03:03.510> are<00:03:03.950> draught

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
racing and these two things are draught

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.880 
racing and these two things are draught
neutral<00:03:05.460> so<00:03:05.910> they<00:03:06.240> don't<00:03:06.420> necessarily<00:03:06.890> make

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
neutral so they don't necessarily make

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.240 
neutral so they don't necessarily make
you<00:03:07.950> faster<00:03:08.490> or<00:03:08.670> slow<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.000> down<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:10.770> one

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
you faster or slow you down and then one

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.610 
you faster or slow you down and then one
thing<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.640> does<00:03:11.910> actually<00:03:12.390> help<00:03:12.960> with

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
thing that does actually help with

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.900 
thing that does actually help with
aerodynamics<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.520> little<00:03:14.760> bit<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:16.110> 2-pack

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
aerodynamics a little bit is the 2-pack

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.130 
aerodynamics a little bit is the 2-pack
water<00:03:17.910> bottle<00:03:18.300> which<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.540> don't<00:03:18.690> have<00:03:18.900> right

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
water bottle which I don't have right

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.370 
water bottle which I don't have right
now<00:03:19.200> but<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.860> mounts<00:03:20.160> right<00:03:20.220> here<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
now but it mounts right here and in the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.690 
now but it mounts right here and in the
wind<00:03:22.590> tunnel<00:03:23.010> um<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:24.120> takes<00:03:24.570> off<00:03:24.810> 25<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:26.100> 30

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
wind tunnel um it takes off 25 to 30

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.660 
wind tunnel um it takes off 25 to 30
grams<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.360> drag<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.590> that's<00:03:28.890> roughly<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.430> few

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
grams of drag so that's roughly a few

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.330 
grams of drag so that's roughly a few
watts<00:03:29.910> or<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.540> then<00:03:31.500> speaking<00:03:32.220> of

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
watts or so and then speaking of

right there and then um speaking of
aerodynamics<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:03.380> see<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:05.100> front<00:04:05.400> part<00:04:06.270> of

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
aerodynamics you see the front part of

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.240 
aerodynamics you see the front part of
this<00:04:06.570> bike<00:04:06.780> is<00:04:07.020> very<00:04:07.320> clean<00:04:07.740> everything's

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
this bike is very clean everything's

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.790 
this bike is very clean everything's
integrated<00:04:08.630> Center<00:04:09.630> pole<00:04:09.870> brakes<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.500> front

integrated Center pole brakes the front

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.240 
integrated Center pole brakes the front
and<00:04:11.010> back<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.940> braking<00:04:12.300> surface<00:04:12.450> is<00:04:13.250> it's

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
and back so the braking surface is it's

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.430 
and back so the braking surface is it's
great<00:04:14.610> these<00:04:15.600> are<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.810> best<00:04:15.959> brakes<00:04:16.320> I've

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
great these are the best brakes I've

ever had in any Aero bike and they're

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.979 
ever had in any Aero bike and they're
very<00:04:19.920> adjustable<00:04:20.430> all<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.330> have<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.510> do<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.810> to

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
very adjustable all you have to do is to

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.200 
very adjustable all you have to do is to
stick<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.470> allen<00:04:22.770> key<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.070> here<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.820> adjust<00:04:24.090> the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
stick it allen key in here to adjust the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.840 
stick it allen key in here to adjust the
brakes<00:04:24.510> wider<00:04:25.169> or<00:04:25.500> shorter<00:04:25.979> right

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
brakes wider or shorter right

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.310 
brakes wider or shorter right
now<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:26.970> have<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:28.110> dura-ace<00:04:28.610> e75<00:04:30.050> race<00:04:31.050> wheel

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
now I have the dura-ace e75 race wheel

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.950 
now I have the dura-ace e75 race wheel
so<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:32.130> need<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.030> adjust<00:04:33.150> these<00:04:33.540> little<00:04:33.840> bit

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
so I need to adjust these little bit

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.480 
so I need to adjust these little bit
wider<00:04:34.170> because<00:04:34.500> my<00:04:34.770> training<00:04:35.130> wheels<00:04:35.250> are<00:04:35.460> a

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
wider because my training wheels are a

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.850 
wider because my training wheels are a
little<00:04:35.700> bit<00:04:35.820> um<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.600> little<00:04:37.380> bit<00:04:37.500> smaller

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
little bit um a little bit smaller

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.210 
little bit um a little bit smaller
millimeters<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.710> obvious<00:04:40.710> everything<00:04:41.100> is

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
millimeters so obvious everything is

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.640 
millimeters so obvious everything is
really<00:04:41.490> clean<00:04:41.700> everything's<00:04:42.150> hidden<00:04:42.480> away<00:04:43.080> on

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
really clean everything's hidden away on

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.730 
really clean everything's hidden away on
this<00:04:44.010> bike<00:04:44.360> I'm<00:04:45.360> running<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:46.110> Shimano<00:04:48.440> 11<00:04:49.440> speed

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
this bike I'm running a Shimano 11 speed

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.460 
this bike I'm running a Shimano 11 speed
on<00:04:49.980> this<00:04:50.220> whole<00:04:50.460> bike<00:04:51.180> some<00:04:51.660> Shimano<00:04:51.990> pedals

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
on this whole bike some Shimano pedals

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.980 
on this whole bike some Shimano pedals
the<00:04:53.160> only<00:04:53.370> thing<00:04:53.550> that's<00:04:53.790> not<00:04:53.910> 11<00:04:54.420> speed<00:04:54.690> is

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
the only thing that's not 11 speed is

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.380 
the only thing that's not 11 speed is
the<00:04:55.320> crank<00:04:55.560> be<00:04:56.520> getting<00:04:56.790> that<00:04:56.910> hopefully<00:04:57.300> in

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
the crank be getting that hopefully in

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.580 
the crank be getting that hopefully in
another<00:04:57.480> another<00:04:58.470> week<00:04:58.740> or<00:04:58.920> so<00:04:59.130> and<00:05:00.170> this<00:05:01.170> this

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
another another week or so and this this

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.840 
another another week or so and this this
bike<00:05:01.890> has<00:05:02.930> they<00:05:03.930> did<00:05:04.110> real-life<00:05:04.470> testing<00:05:04.980> they

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
bike has they did real-life testing they

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.390 
bike has they did real-life testing they
they<00:05:06.240> brought<00:05:06.450> it<00:05:06.570> out<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.840> Kona<00:05:07.080> they<00:05:07.950> also

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
they brought it out to Kona they also

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.420 
they brought it out to Kona they also
brought<00:05:08.700> out<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.090> Ironman<00:05:09.480> Arizona<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.430> they

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
brought out to Ironman Arizona and they

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.820 
brought out to Ironman Arizona and they
tested<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:14.100> degrees<00:05:14.550> of<00:05:14.580> yaw<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.660> and<00:05:16.230> they

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
tested the degrees of yaw and and they

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.330 
tested the degrees of yaw and and they
came<00:05:17.760> up<00:05:18.000> with<00:05:18.360> this<00:05:19.020> bike<00:05:19.350> versus<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.130> old

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
came up with this bike versus the old

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.720 
came up with this bike versus the old
speed<00:05:20.700> concept<00:05:21.240> is<00:05:21.620> this<00:05:22.620> bike<00:05:22.890> just<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.550> bike

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
speed concept is this bike just the bike

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.560 
speed concept is this bike just the bike
alone<00:05:24.090> on<00:05:25.050> this<00:05:25.830> bike<00:05:26.100> on<00:05:26.340> Kona<00:05:26.850> is<00:05:26.880> about<00:05:27.180> 90

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
alone on this bike on Kona is about 90

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.480 
alone on this bike on Kona is about 90
seconds<00:05:27.960> quicker<00:05:28.290> than<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.950> old<00:05:28.980> speed

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
seconds quicker than the old speed

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.390 
seconds quicker than the old speed
concept<00:05:30.030> and<00:05:30.330> on<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.530> Ironman<00:05:31.890> Arizona

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
concept and on the Ironman Arizona

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.580 
concept and on the Ironman Arizona
course<00:05:32.790> it's<00:05:33.180> roughly<00:05:33.690> I<00:05:33.810> think<00:05:34.080> two<00:05:34.410> and<00:05:34.560> a

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
course it's roughly I think two and a

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.750 
course it's roughly I think two and a
half<00:05:34.800> minutes<00:05:35.310> so<00:05:37.010> there<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:38.160> have<00:05:38.190> it's<00:05:38.610> a

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
half minutes so there you have it's a

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.930 
half minutes so there you have it's a
fast<00:05:39.300> bike<00:05:40.160> I'm<00:05:41.160> definitely<00:05:41.670> looking<00:05:41.760> forward

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
fast bike I'm definitely looking forward

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.440 
fast bike I'm definitely looking forward
