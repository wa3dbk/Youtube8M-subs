00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
the fifth course of architecture so it's

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.770 
the fifth course of architecture so it's
completely<00:03:07.430> different<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.330> you<00:03:08.510> of

everything that you have around I mean

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.460 
everything that you have around I mean
you're<00:03:13.790> studying<00:03:14.420> architecture<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.290> this

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
you're studying architecture in this

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.310 
you're studying architecture in this
ancient<00:03:15.950> Cathedral<00:03:16.790> things<00:03:17.239> like<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.600> you

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
ancient Cathedral things like that you

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.580 
ancient Cathedral things like that you
just<00:03:18.530> see<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:18.830> sort<00:03:19.400> of<00:03:19.489> all<00:03:19.640> around<00:03:19.880> you

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
just see it sort of all around you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.920 
just see it sort of all around you
architecture<00:03:22.459> please<00:03:22.970> again<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.599> mean<00:03:23.690> for<00:03:23.840> an

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
architecture please again I mean for an

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.199 
architecture please again I mean for an
architect<00:03:24.349> now<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:24.800> is<00:03:24.860> a<00:03:25.069> precise<00:03:25.730> setting

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
architect now so it is a precise setting

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.170 
architect now so it is a precise setting
of<00:03:26.599> the<00:03:26.989> classrooms<00:03:27.739> is<00:03:28.520> this<00:03:28.849> wonderful

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
of the classrooms is this wonderful

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.960 
of the classrooms is this wonderful
combination<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:30.290> new<00:03:30.950> technology<00:03:31.790> new

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
combination of new technology new

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.410 
combination of new technology new
facilities<00:03:32.690> but<00:03:33.410> within<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:34.000> historic<00:03:35.000> setting

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
facilities but within a historic setting

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.540 
facilities but within a historic setting
which<00:03:36.020> in<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.349> of<00:03:36.410> itself<00:03:36.770> is<00:03:36.980> really<00:03:37.190> quite

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
which in and of itself is really quite

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.640 
which in and of itself is really quite
quite<00:03:37.970> powerful<00:03:38.630> I<00:03:38.959> think<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.500> most

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
quite powerful I think the most

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.580 
quite powerful I think the most
important<00:03:40.099> elements<00:03:40.459> in<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.640> program<00:03:41.120> are

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
important elements in the program are

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.910 
important elements in the program are
basically<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.620> very<00:03:43.069> open<00:03:43.610> approach<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:45.019> the

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
basically a very open approach to the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.150 
basically a very open approach to the
curriculum<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:47.050> think<00:03:48.050> there<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.319> an<00:03:48.500> extreme

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
curriculum I think there is an extreme

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.910 
curriculum I think there is an extreme
amount<00:03:49.580> of<00:03:50.120> attention<00:03:50.510> as<00:03:50.959> best<00:03:51.349> paid<00:03:51.680> to

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
amount of attention as best paid to

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.090 
amount of attention as best paid to
individually<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.790> each<00:03:52.819> student<00:03:53.860> which<00:03:54.860> is

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
individually to each student which is

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.270 
individually to each student which is
which<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:55.580> something<00:03:55.819> that's<00:03:56.060> it's<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:57.350> wish<00:03:58.040> I

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
which is something that's it's I wish I

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.100 
which is something that's it's I wish I
had<00:03:58.519> gotten<00:03:58.670> more<00:03:58.970> of<00:03:59.090> as<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.239> student<00:03:59.720> I<00:03:59.930> think

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
had gotten more of as a student I think

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.340 
had gotten more of as a student I think
students<00:04:01.069> that<00:04:01.580> go<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.760> our<00:04:01.970> University<00:04:02.720> tend

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
students that go to our University tend

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.960 
students that go to our University tend
to<00:04:03.500> be<00:04:04.630> highly<00:04:05.630> motivated<00:04:06.970> they're

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
to be highly motivated they're

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.430 
to be highly motivated they're
individualistic<00:04:09.790> very<00:04:10.790> serious<00:04:11.780> about<00:04:12.110> their

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
individualistic very serious about their

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.979 
individualistic very serious about their
commitment<00:04:12.739> to<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.099> field<00:04:13.400> my<00:04:14.000> experiences

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
commitment to the field my experiences

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.629 
commitment to the field my experiences
mean<00:04:15.170> that<00:04:15.319> they've<00:04:15.470> been<00:04:15.620> also<00:04:15.769> very<00:04:15.920> open<00:04:16.459> to

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
mean that they've been also very open to

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.120 
mean that they've been also very open to
new<00:04:16.850> ideas<00:04:17.079> which<00:04:18.079> is<00:04:18.109> really<00:04:18.650> what<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.889> what

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
new ideas which is really what it what

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.860 
new ideas which is really what it what
it's<00:04:19.280> about<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:19.880> be<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.030> student<00:04:20.359> have<00:04:20.600> to<00:04:20.630> be<00:04:20.840> oh

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
it's about to be a student have to be oh

I<00:04:21.799> guess<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:23.169> mean<00:04:24.169> I<00:04:24.289> think<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:24.860> find<00:04:25.099> the<00:04:25.220> right

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
I guess I mean I think I find the right

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.640 
I guess I mean I think I find the right
spot<00:04:25.639> it's<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:26.539> mean<00:04:26.810> there's<00:04:26.960> so<00:04:27.259> many<00:04:27.410> choices

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
spot it's I mean there's so many choices

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.950 
spot it's I mean there's so many choices
out<00:04:28.009> there<00:04:28.039> so<00:04:28.580> many<00:04:28.759> choices<00:04:28.940> of<00:04:29.330> university

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
out there so many choices of university
