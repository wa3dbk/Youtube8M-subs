00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.280
 in front of 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.480
 the youtube units here normal 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.099
 I bring a new video and well then today 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.250
 I present you how to do what is 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.189
 the jailbreak a teapot version 511 what 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.570
 what is it is an iphone 4s device 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.730
 making this video because 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.920
 restores a device due to a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.480
 mistake that I had then I will take advantage 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.269
 do what is this video so that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.129
 you the new users that still 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.100
 they have not done what is the jailbreak 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.410
 can use it with networks is not very simple 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.780
 the truth and it takes about a minute 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.850
 to two minutes what is doing what 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.480
 is the jailbreak there are two methods for 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.309
 doing it one is the normal method that is 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.550
 clicking on jailbreak and it's going to be 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.710
 automatically and the second method is 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.920
 putting it first in df and then 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.870
 by clicking where it says jailbreak 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.539
 we need two requirements the one that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.629
 let's have the device restored from 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.360
 Factory in version 511 is the most 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.490
 recent for apple and we have to 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.700
 download also what is the version 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.740
 nou latest networks the 0.9 point 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.630
 fourteen beta 2 that was updated for 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.810
 to be able to do what is the downgrade 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.640
 to the neighbor of iphone 3gs and iphone 3g 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.619
 well let's start what it is with 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.329
 this video tutorial and well then I 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 I have already connected my device to the 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.049
 computer as you can appreciate to see and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.549
 I have also open what is the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.500
 What I'm going to do is give you 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.310
 cleaning the break and will start doing 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.369
 what is the servef process in this 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.710
 moment is preparing the archives 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.090
 as you can appreciate to see that in the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.689
 iphone has not happened at all 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.490
 is processing and is ending in the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.439
 iphone appears to be making a 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.500
 restoration of the retraction has 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.720
 finished 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.000
 here we get a message saying 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.100
 that he has always finished 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.200
 completely and that puts the device 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.920
 at this moment what is being done is 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.630
 is a reboot at this precise moment a 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.610
 once finished what appears in the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.020
 computer screen and you are going to 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.420
 be able to appreciate to see that you already have 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.910
 installed what is xiria are we going to 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.670
 wait a couple of seconds is doing 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.340
 what is a reboot 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.860
 this little sign that we have here what 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.500
 we can give ok or we can leave it there 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.630
 until everything appears in order I 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.700
 I'm going to leave and we're going to wait 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.770
 finish the jailbreak process 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.770
 well you are doing what is a crystal 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.650
 it's almost coming out what is in the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.650
 computer screen 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.370
 and fine here is what the iphone has 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.780
 already restored with version 5.1.1 already 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.180
 I have already done what is the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.840
 jailbreak and 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.000
 what is what is called with the cydia a 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.579
 once they connect you 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.409
 already appear but when they have done 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.629
 see what a reboot is the device 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.109
 automatically that you enter your 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.750
 sprint board is going to be a small one 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.909
 small respite in which you are already going to 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.040
 unlock automatically and you will 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.659
 leave what is the second page in the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.599
 which you already find what is the 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.730
 cycle here in the kingdom I can see you 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.069
 ok and we can also close what is the 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.209
 rest and good friends this would be all the 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.769
 true 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.680
 it's that simple what you say 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.230
 jailbreak to an iphone 4s works in 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.120
 all iphone models the ipad 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.870
 third generation is not compatible with 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.330
 ash tree 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.340
 and the ipad2 and first generation if what 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.200
 they can do 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.450
 they are asking me a lot via twitter or 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.190
 via mail which of the two which 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.069
 program recommends me to do it that 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.140
 is the always to my device are the 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.150
 there are two programs is the reyno and the 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.849
 apps in any of the two programs 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.849
 what does jailbreak do 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.470
 only the taste of each one with 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.260
 rest not as you could appreciate to see is 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.780
 super fast I do not take even two minutes with 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.920
 Apps him too well and fast either 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.599
 they have to put what is the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.000
 device on facebook like before 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.680
 had to do in networks do not turn off your 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.780
 device after putting the facebook 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.660
 and it took a little bit of time now it 's 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.389
 much faster we just give it a 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.800
 click on a button and already in a couple of 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.289
 seconds is doing what is the 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.270
 break to our device and good 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.979
 friends, I recommend him, either 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.840
 of the two if you are comfortable 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.060
 they have liked a lot of time rest and 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.880
 like networks do not use networks have not 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.910
 used apps in then use napster and have 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.410
 liked the two as in my case the use 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.030
 either of us I'm just 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.310
 using networks one hour to 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.840
 in this video tutorial and well I would 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.730
 dismissal with a greeting for all of you 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.560
