00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 today slow I hope that you in super well the 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.040
 today and today I got exactly 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.200
 two packages so I wanted them 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.210
 immediately show one of the page 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.429
 choi is dotcom and the other is from the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.719
 page of jess ford dotcom so 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.700
 let's start to show the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.740
 little things that sees the first thing that arrives 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.510
 I will show a blouse and cho 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.270
 that the color does not look very good but it's 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.910
 like a mint green and it's like that when I 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.160
 I saw her, I said that this is super short 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.050
 and it's very wide then and I'm going to look 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.090
 anything then it turns out that you do not see 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.369
 as bad as with a blazer over and not 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.590
 I know 15 a blouse like that it falls pretty 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.559
 ok so I liked it a lot 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.690
 tone I love because I give you mind 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.340
 it fascinates me so I'm super 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.230
 happy has a closure on the part of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.730
 back obviously one does not use because 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 you do not need to open the garment to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.350
 place fabric so it's super good and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.000
 I was not disappointed with the fall 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.590
 thank goodness because when we saw you 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.469
 pretty orchid as very cut very 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.420
 wide and that scares me but 10 so 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.640
 I liked the next thing I have here is 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.950
 like a blouse shirt that has some 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.780
 little pocket and buttons attention 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.870
 It is quite wrinkled obviously because 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.490
 it was coming but that's just like a 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.190
 green military green very or pretty 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.990
 pretty I love this color like to 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.540
 winter because for summer I do not 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.910
 I use a lot has a pretty way 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.350
 pretty here on the chest part 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.360
 We liked how you do all of them 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.310
 like my body and all that, so 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.660
 it's quite good that you have 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.490
 counted so far with the sizes 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.290
 The next thing I asked for is this quality 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 that has me but fascinated I love 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.610
 this design that has that is how I do not know 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.930
 if tribal or will mean something but I 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.790
 love that you have as well as the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.470
 inverted triangles that living 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.690
 only you can put something over it a 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.000
 blazer a scarf something 7 do it well 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.040
 I do not know I love stable mandate was a 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.770
 of my favorites and what I also 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.619
 has fascinated is this polerón that 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.540
 loved it because it simulates a panda in the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.030
 top of the hat and I love 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.860
 that has its little ears and also you 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.020
 ojito and nose then this is 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.970
 as above on put on your face 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.220
 because the hat is quite big and 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.400
 down is normal is a bolero in gray that 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.800
 he has identical cases his long sleeves 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.390
 nothing of a waistband down black and 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.280
 fans of valera or what I like 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.320
 very much your forest hat is tender 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.320
 so on over your head 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.870
 so it's super big but so what 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.030
 you can obviously use as a hat 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.550
 normal and the polerón is pretty good 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.560
 same 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.450
 and the next thing that I come here is also 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.610
 a mint green blouse but this has no 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.730
 sleeves and also the particular thing about this 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.610
 is that he has a chick here super cute 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.140
 and what it has like a crochet is blue 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.630
 marine and I thought it was black in the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.640
 page but it's navy blue so I do not 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.950
 It bothers me so much, but it's not like 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.440
 that something that kills the color of my neck 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.120
 but if it goes well enough it 's as well to 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.970
 journalists and that does fit me as a 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.140
 little close here so nothing I 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.120
 I think I'll use as 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.830
 some glazer on top or something like that 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.650
 next I have is also this 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.840
 blouse that what has particular is 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.610
 your neck because your car is made of 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.670
 pure little golden sequins and 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.010
 I love it is like a beige tone between 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.350
 during beige and has here the neck 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.970
 of slow school is super cute but it's 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.680
 as for a special song it's like 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.810
 for the day to day that I use it like this 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.310
 if I have any special occasion not 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.290
 doubt for the teacher is that I really 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.390
 really liked how it is from the neck and what 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.270
 another one that I have in fact and it's this bolero 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.310
 that I love because it 's like such 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.300
 I like the house and I do not know what I like 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.190
 much 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.370
 and the sleeves are like this key 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.530
 Scottish and here is like gray and is more 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.360
 ladito behind that later because a 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.460
 little bit shorter if he says the look on me 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.930
 and I love I liked it very much 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:47.140
 like super sueltito and it's comfortable and that 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.720
 thing I like a lot so that was 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.030
 what came by choice and now the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.950
 yes page for which I had never 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.960
 I collaborated with them and I liked them 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.540
 quite your things the first thing I have 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.310
 here is this little bag that I ordered that according to 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.830
 I the tachas were golden but they arrived 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.230
 like between silver and gold and I do not know 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.720
 He missed me I wanted him to like 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.700
 transport like the notebook or in the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.970
 notebooks I needed to walk bringing 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.090
 so their short antlers are tiny they are 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.830
 very short as hand and their antlers 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.540
 long are like this 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.150
 fit as fair on the shoulder so 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.130
 It's still pretty good because I'm 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.690
 more attached to my things as personal 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.360
 and the notebook and something that has to 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.160
 take care of them and that pretty well is super 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.960
 thick super tough so it looks 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.419
 which is like good quality 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.370
 but they are new accessories and first 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.830
 I ordered this mint green watch that 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.800
 love is like silicone is like no 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.210
 I know it doubles but it 's pretty nice 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.889
 love and as with the blouses that had 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.530
 enzo order and that's how I think it's going 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.539
 pretty good and I like it a lot I liked it 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.580
 in the quality of the watch is everything super 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.819
 well the only thing that yes that here has like 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.860
 the accessories the details in gold and 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.380
 this comes silver so I do not know if 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.240
 It will be like this normally or there will be 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.910
 wrong or something like that next thing 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.530
 I asked was a collar for blouses that 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.210
 uses on top of the lusas that not 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.610
 they have nothing or they are not funny 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.770
 then one puts it like this and like that 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.169
 it's a pretty nice accessory which 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.000
 yes he got a cost on the way 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.919
 but I have it out there saved so 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.720
 I'm going to stick it with silicone that's what 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.910
 unique as uncomfortable from this tank that 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.550
 the little things are coming out, I do not think 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.470
 it comes very well peeled but the rest already 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.419
 it's going pretty well our that I asked was 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.000
 like this one that already quoted that truth 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.310
 loved it because I find that it's like a 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.070
 golden touch with black for some blouse 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.870
 that has no river 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.580
 just high this cost because what 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.500
 I find super simple but at the same time a 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.840
 accessory that can change any 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.850
 blouse or any super happy outfit with 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.740
 He really loved that I love and 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.300
 last of accessories I have this pair 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.520
 of hoop that I liked a lot because it's 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.160
 super mint with pink I find you 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.830
 as cute as super cute and I liked it 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.990
 as much as for some white pollerita 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.540
 or he gets it so I liked it 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.000
 They are like super tender and sweet are like 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.190
 my colors and finally I ordered this hat 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.650
 which I had requested in tone 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.200
 beige but it came in gray but I say the 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:14.040
 way I like it because as it is outside 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.430
 winter or something like that I do not know I feel that 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.450
 I like and have left me pretty well 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:24.200
 liked this hat as if fallen as not 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.300
 I know why 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.040
 so super good jenson and I 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.540
 dismissal here with my chubby because even 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.240
 is next I live in conception of 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.470
 it's really cold and I do not like it 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.510
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.160
 this video that would demand that that you 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.750
 liked that do not forget to subscribe to 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.480
 channel if I have not done it 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.710
 I lived with a giant kiss do not forget 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.150
 that under the laws of information I 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.530
 I always leave the links of the 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.690

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:52.970
 they want to order it so that we 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.970
 we see here in the next video chao
