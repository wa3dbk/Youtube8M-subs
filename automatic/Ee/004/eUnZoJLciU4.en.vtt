00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.580
 mano is the heavenly team for almost a 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.379
 century 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.420
 shimano focused on producing the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.719
 more advanced bicycle components 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.460
 of the world constantly surpassing 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.269
 the limits of innovation in the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.220
 streaming 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.609
 we have revolutionized the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.810
 cycling numerous times from cubes of 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.939
 wheels to cassettes and our pedals 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.920
 designers and engineers are always looking for 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.810
 a new level of efficiency 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.059
 so our products are always 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.640
 seen on the top of the podiums of the best 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.320
 world races 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.149
 we ask ourselves will it always be that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.559
 we really managed to maximize 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.510
 efficiency of the transmission system 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.510
 as a whole or something to be improved 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.380
 We certainly present the shimano team 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.330
 light blue cycling shoes 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.970
 optimized for maximum throughput 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.800
 power which may be more important 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.440
 that the place where the transfer of 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.910
 Power begins another sneakers 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.950
 cycling are made on the same 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.380
 tennis and hiking platform 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.900
 dae the east on the other hand indicated for 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.390
 road cycling and nothing else 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.860
 optimize the angle of the fingers and keep the 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.960
 foot in an ideal position 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.000
 the east of china one year reduces 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.500
 loss of power when the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.200
 cyclist prepares for the next 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.000
 pedal testing have proven that the loss of 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.310
 pedal power is reduced by more than 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.200
 of 5 percent making the area east 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.900
 cycling shoe more efficient than 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.880
 market in the real world 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.580
 this can mean five seconds 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.710
 gain every 25 kilometers which can 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.440
 be the difference between finishing on the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.570
 out of it with reduced attention on the plant 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.850
 calf and leg muscles the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.250
 benefits of east and east passing foot 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.330
 to the leg promoting a rotation of 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.850
 most complete hip included - tension 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.740
 legs and hip means more 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.060
 chances of the next stretch seem more 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.950
 a warmth than suffering to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.509
 technology in the eastern part of 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.970
 carbon fiber with the channel the people 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.940
 increases contact area by adding force 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.010
 and stiffness while decreasing weight a 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.290
 new heel support designed in 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.410
 carbon fiber provides better 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.300
 heel stability and power and the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.010
 11 mm locking adjustment 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.200
 allows cyclists to increase 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.440
 comfort with the ideal foot position in the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.440
 pedal 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.560
 dae in the east of the week optimizes 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.170
 connection of the transmission assembly to 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.180
 competitors and triathletes in 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.030
 search for a more powerful and 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.250
 efficiently available across multiple lines 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.560
 everyone can experience the difference of the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.690
 dae eastern weekend cyclist 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.330
 to the professional 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.880
 finally the power transfer is 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:56.120
 optimized where everything starts 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.120
 shimano and east power on the pedaling
