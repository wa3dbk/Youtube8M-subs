I<00:00:06.480> love<00:00:07.480> keeping<00:00:07.960> students<00:00:08.320> guessing<00:00:08.650> they

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
I love keeping students guessing they

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.980 
I love keeping students guessing they
expect<00:00:09.849> one<00:00:10.030> result<00:00:10.420> and<00:00:10.630> get<00:00:10.720> something

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
expect one result and get something

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.600 
expect one result and get something
completely<00:00:11.380> different<00:00:11.440> and<00:00:11.769> then<00:00:12.310> seeing

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
completely different and then seeing

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.640 
completely different and then seeing
them<00:00:12.820> actually<00:00:13.210> work<00:00:13.390> out<00:00:13.600> why<00:00:13.960> they<00:00:14.440> got<00:00:14.620> that

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
them actually work out why they got that

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.199 
them actually work out why they got that
different<00:00:15.100> results<00:00:15.550> that's<00:00:15.790> something<00:00:16.090> that

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
different results that's something that

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.189 
different results that's something that
I<00:00:16.270> find<00:00:16.539> really<00:00:16.689> rewarding<00:00:18.689> I've<00:00:19.689> always<00:00:20.019> had

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
I find really rewarding I've always had

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.859 
I find really rewarding I've always had
an<00:00:20.349> innate<00:00:20.589> desire<00:00:21.039> to<00:00:21.820> teach<00:00:22.029> even<00:00:22.749> as<00:00:22.839> a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.649 
teach it to someone else and I've always
loved<00:00:26.470> science<00:00:26.759> but<00:00:27.759> I<00:00:27.909> couldn't<00:00:28.329> see<00:00:28.480> myself

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:28.659 
loved science but I couldn't see myself

working<00:00:28.960> in<00:00:29.439> a<00:00:29.769> laboratory<00:00:30.130> environment<00:00:30.759> so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
working in a laboratory environment so

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.660 
working in a laboratory environment so
it<00:00:31.630> was<00:00:31.749> as<00:00:31.869> logical<00:00:32.320> progression<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.310> combine

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
it was as logical progression to combine

it was as logical progression to combine
my<00:00:33.880> passion<00:00:34.510> for<00:00:34.660> science<00:00:35.020> with<00:00:35.230> my<00:00:35.470> desire<00:00:36.250> to

disabilities we have autistic students
students<00:01:13.810> with<00:01:13.870> Down<00:01:14.200> syndrome<00:01:14.230> so<00:01:14.770> we've<00:01:14.890> got

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
students with Down syndrome so we've got

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.240 
students with Down syndrome so we've got
a<00:01:15.070> real<00:01:15.430> mixture<00:01:15.880> within<00:01:16.570> that<00:01:16.840> group<00:01:17.170> I<00:01:17.440> think

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
a real mixture within that group I think

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.320 
a real mixture within that group I think
they<00:01:18.520> need<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.730> be<00:01:18.820> given<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.270> same

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
they need to be given the same

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.320 
they need to be given the same
opportunities<00:01:20.140> as<00:01:20.520> mainstream<00:01:21.520> students<00:01:22.120> so

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
opportunities as mainstream students so

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.510 
opportunities as mainstream students so
that<00:01:22.479> they<00:01:22.659> can<00:01:22.690> learn<00:01:23.110> about<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:24.159> wonders<00:01:24.460> of

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
that they can learn about the wonders of
