00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
battleship New Jersey in the background

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.969 
battleship New Jersey in the background
as<00:02:04.469> we<00:02:04.680> will<00:02:04.860> write<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:06.299> Delaware<00:02:06.899> River

what how did I do this photo well going

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.910 
what how did I do this photo well going
up<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.390> stage<00:02:12.660> walking<00:02:13.290> up<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.500> stairs<00:02:13.709> I

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
up the stage walking up the stairs I

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.770 
up the stage walking up the stairs I
knew<00:02:14.160> there<00:02:14.370> was<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> ramp<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.569> knew<00:02:15.750> that

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
knew there was a ramp and I knew that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.690 
knew there was a ramp and I knew that
Alex<00:02:16.290> would<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.590> walking<00:02:16.770> up<00:02:17.040> either<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.430> ramp

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
Alex would be walking up either the ramp

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.970 
Alex would be walking up either the ramp
or<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.000> stairs<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.810> was<00:02:19.290> prepared<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
or the stairs I was prepared on the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.190 
or the stairs I was prepared on the
stair<00:02:20.280> side<00:02:20.640> until<00:02:21.000> he<00:02:21.240> walked<00:02:21.510> by<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.080> he

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
stair side until he walked by and he

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.230 
stair side until he walked by and he
started<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.280> know<00:02:23.310> he<00:02:23.550> walked<00:02:23.730> past<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
started to you know he walked past the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.030 
started to you know he walked past the
ramp<00:02:24.480> back<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:25.020> somewhere<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.590> then<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.860> knew

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
ramp back to somewhere and then I knew

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.130 
ramp back to somewhere and then I knew
he<00:02:26.250> was<00:02:26.340> going<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.550> go<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.270> ramp<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.110> I

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
he was going to go up the ramp so I

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.590 
he was going to go up the ramp so I
waited<00:02:28.530> for<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.920> good<00:02:29.130> 10<00:02:29.430> minutes<00:02:29.459> in<00:02:30.030> that

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
waited for a good 10 minutes in that

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.540 
waited for a good 10 minutes in that
position<00:02:30.810> because<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.470> knew<00:02:31.709> what<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.010> wanted<00:02:32.400> to

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
position because I knew what I wanted to

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.520 
position because I knew what I wanted to
get<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.970> wanted<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.569> get<00:02:33.690> him<00:02:33.870> walking<00:02:34.290> up<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
get I wanted to get him walking up the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.050 
get I wanted to get him walking up the
ramp<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.010> didn't<00:02:35.370> want<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.640> be<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> wide

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
ramp and I didn't want it to be a wide

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.270 
ramp and I didn't want it to be a wide
angle<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.600> time<00:02:36.660> because<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.709> background

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
angle this time because the background

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.550 
angle this time because the background
wasn't<00:02:39.060> very<00:02:39.209> interesting<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.080> wide<00:02:40.319> angle

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
wasn't very interesting for a wide angle

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.259 
wasn't very interesting for a wide angle
there<00:02:40.860> were<00:02:40.950> trucks<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.610> trailers<00:02:41.850> and

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
there were trucks and trailers and

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.810 
there were trucks and trailers and
things<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:42.720> fencing<00:02:43.680> along<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.160> left<00:02:44.400> side<00:02:44.610> of

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
things in fencing along the left side of

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.090 
things in fencing along the left side of
the<00:02:44.910> stage<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.959> just<00:02:46.260> didn't<00:02:46.560> look<00:02:46.620> good

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the stage and it just didn't look good

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.610 
the stage and it just didn't look good
so<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.610> wanted<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.209> 70<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.660> 200<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.200> compress

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
so I wanted the 70 to 200 to compress

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.440 
so I wanted the 70 to 200 to compress
the<00:02:49.830> background<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.489> took<00:02:50.790> about<00:02:51.090> four

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
the background I took about four

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.229 
the background I took about four
pictures<00:02:51.720> as<00:02:52.050> he<00:02:52.200> walked<00:02:52.470> up<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.280> ramp<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.209> I

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
pictures as he walked up the ramp so I

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.320 
pictures as he walked up the ramp so I
was<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.660> right<00:02:54.780> position<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.380> was<00:02:55.590> down<00:02:55.830> low

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
was in the right position I was down low

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.449 
was in the right position I was down low
squatting<00:02:57.330> down<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.810> get<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.110> shot<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.650> he

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
squatting down to get this shot and he

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.300 
squatting down to get this shot and he
finally<00:02:59.760> started<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.239> walk<00:03:00.420> up<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.780> ramp<00:03:00.930> and

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
finally started to walk up the ramp and

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.630 
finally started to walk up the ramp and
I<00:03:02.310> locked<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.940> on<00:03:03.120> his<00:03:03.269> eyes<00:03:04.370> continuous<00:03:05.370> focus

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
I locked in on his eyes continuous focus

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.330 
I locked in on his eyes continuous focus
so<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.810> would<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.860> focus<00:03:08.100> would

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
so that it would so that the focus would

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.309 
so that it would so that the focus would
move<00:03:08.550> as<00:03:08.730> he<00:03:08.910> moved<00:03:09.180> because<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.660> single<00:03:09.989> focus

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
move as he moved because in single focus

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.559 
move as he moved because in single focus
if<00:03:10.440> he<00:03:10.650> was<00:03:10.920> locked<00:03:11.400> in<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.850> then<00:03:11.970> he<00:03:12.120> moved<00:03:12.360> it

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
if he was locked in and then he moved it

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.560 
if he was locked in and then he moved it
wouldn't<00:03:13.170> be<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.500> focus<00:03:14.329> because<00:03:15.329> would<00:03:15.450> be

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
wouldn't be in focus because would be

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.840 
wouldn't be in focus because would be
locked<00:03:15.810> in<00:03:16.049> so<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.500> just<00:03:16.799> liked<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.579> feel<00:03:17.820> of

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
locked in so I just liked the feel of

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.000 
locked in so I just liked the feel of
this<00:03:18.090> he's<00:03:18.269> in<00:03:18.299> mid<00:03:18.690> walk<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.590> know<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.799> hips

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
probably 20 photographers in the pit and

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.620 
probably 20 photographers in the pit and
the<00:03:41.160> stage<00:03:41.549> was<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.940> good<00:03:42.239> what<00:03:43.109> probably<00:03:44.630> seven

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
the stage was a good what probably seven

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.420 
the stage was a good what probably seven
feet<00:03:45.930> tall<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.680> makes<00:03:46.829> it<00:03:46.920> difficult<00:03:47.130> to

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
feet tall so that makes it difficult to

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.349 
feet tall so that makes it difficult to
shoot<00:03:47.609> because<00:03:47.760> all<00:03:47.940> you're<00:03:48.060> doing<00:03:48.269> is

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
shoot because all you're doing is

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.020 
shoot because all you're doing is
shooting<00:03:48.630> up<00:03:48.720> somebody's<00:03:49.079> nose<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.940> know

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
shooting up somebody's nose and you know

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.000 
shooting up somebody's nose and you know
photography<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:52.079> type<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.350> photography<00:03:52.590> you

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
photography this type of photography you

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.170 
photography this type of photography you
want<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.340> see<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.579> crowd<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:53.970> you're<00:03:54.090> going

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
want to see the crowd and you're going

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.569 
want to see the crowd and you're going
to<00:03:54.239> see<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.170> photos<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.829> are

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.090 
to see that in the photos that are
coming<00:03:56.940> up<00:03:57.060> when<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:57.930> do<00:03:58.079> show<00:03:58.500> all<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.980> the

photos from the day you're going to see
the<00:04:00.570> crowd<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.380> how<00:04:01.829> I<00:04:01.859> shot<00:04:02.280> from<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.670> stage

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
the crowd and how I shot from the stage

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.660 
the crowd and how I shot from the stage
just<00:04:03.450> remember<00:04:03.840> anybody<00:04:04.380> can<00:04:04.620> shoot<00:04:04.980> from<00:04:05.579> the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
just remember anybody can shoot from the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.300 
just remember anybody can shoot from the
pit<00:04:06.090> but<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:06.959> takes<00:04:07.170> something<00:04:07.500> else<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:08.070> shoot

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
pit but it takes something else to shoot

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.580 
pit but it takes something else to shoot
from<00:04:08.519> backstage<00:04:09.060> or<00:04:09.359> on<00:04:09.480> stage<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.019> yes<00:04:10.230> you

there<00:04:12.780> sure<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.620> may<00:04:13.739> be<00:04:13.799> with<00:04:14.070> a<00:04:14.100> smaller<00:04:14.459> band

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
there sure it may be with a smaller band

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.759 
there sure it may be with a smaller band
to<00:04:14.940> start<00:04:15.000> but<00:04:15.720> it's<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.959> start<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:16.470> know

it's a nice to and quarter shot I have a
tendency<00:04:38.410> to<00:04:38.440> leave<00:04:38.680> more<00:04:38.919> Headroom<00:04:39.310> because

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
tendency to leave more Headroom because

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.260 
tendency to leave more Headroom because
i<00:04:39.669> don't<00:04:40.030> like<00:04:40.919> really<00:04:41.919> shots<00:04:42.610> where<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:42.940> put

this as an eight-by-ten which I don't

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.839 
this as an eight-by-ten which I don't
recommend<00:04:56.380> because<00:04:56.949> I<00:04:57.039> like<00:04:57.310> full<00:04:57.580> frame

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
recommend because I like full frame

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.909 
recommend because I like full frame
shots<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.360> way<00:04:58.479> they<00:04:58.630> are<00:04:58.660> you<00:04:59.470> have<00:04:59.710> that

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
shots the way they are you have that

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.969 
shots the way they are you have that
extra<00:05:00.220> Headroom<00:05:01.259> you<00:05:02.259> know<00:05:02.349> and<00:05:02.500> if<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.650> cut<00:05:02.860> off

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
extra Headroom you know and if I cut off

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.110 
extra Headroom you know and if I cut off
at<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.220> ankles<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:03.759> I<00:05:03.789> would<00:05:03.910> have<00:05:04.000> said

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
at the ankles and I would have said

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.969 
at the ankles and I would have said
where<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.509> feet<00:05:04.750> now<00:05:05.020> I<00:05:05.050> have<00:05:05.320> some<00:05:05.560> images

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
where the feet now I have some images

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.029 
where the feet now I have some images
that<00:05:06.130> I<00:05:06.160> did<00:05:06.430> do<00:05:06.580> full<00:05:06.940> body<00:05:07.660> but<00:05:08.349> I<00:05:08.500> like<00:05:08.860> this

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
that I did do full body but I like this

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.409 
that I did do full body but I like this
better<00:05:09.280> because<00:05:09.580> it<00:05:09.669> was<00:05:09.789> higher<00:05:10.030> up<00:05:10.240> on<00:05:10.360> the

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
better because it was higher up on the

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:11.879 
better because it was higher up on the
ramp<00:05:10.659> and<00:05:10.810> you<00:05:10.900> had<00:05:10.990> more<00:05:11.199> of<00:05:11.289> that<00:05:11.409> battleship

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
ramp and you had more of that battleship

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.339 
ramp and you had more of that battleship
I<00:05:12.220> just<00:05:12.550> like<00:05:12.789> how<00:05:13.000> soft<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.780> lighting<00:05:14.169> is

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
I just like how soft the lighting is

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.100 
I just like how soft the lighting is
here<00:05:14.590> I<00:05:14.880> probably<00:05:15.880> shot<00:05:16.150> this<00:05:16.360> on<00:05:16.539> manual

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
here I probably shot this on manual

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.249

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
I don't remember if I did it in manual

I don't remember if I did it in manual
or<00:05:23.710> aperture<00:05:24.099> priority<00:05:24.570> but<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:26.770> know<00:05:26.889> it<00:05:27.070> was

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
or aperture priority but you know it was

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.600

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
nothing like spending a day with

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.089 
nothing like spending a day with
musicians<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.460> just<00:05:33.789> hanging<00:05:34.180> out<00:05:34.330> talking

comfortable with me allowing me to be on

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.520 
comfortable with me allowing me to be on
