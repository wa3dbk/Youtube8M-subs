00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.529 

mmm<00:00:57.030> not<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.930> dump<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.210> now<00:01:00.210> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
mmm not like that dump it in now you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.479 
mmm not like that dump it in now you
want<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.750> stir<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.020> all<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.500> before<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.280> add

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
want to stir that all up before you add

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.510 
want to stir that all up before you add
your<00:01:03.149> shortening<00:01:06.110> now<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.229> you're<00:01:07.380> using<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
your shortening now if you're using the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.140 
your shortening now if you're using the
recipe<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.510> calls<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.650> half<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.070> cup<00:01:11.280> but

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
recipe it calls for a half a cup but

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090 
recipe it calls for a half a cup but
since<00:01:12.570> I'm<00:01:12.720> adding<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.380> well<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:13.830> sorry<00:01:13.979> it

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
since I'm adding up well I'm sorry it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.460 
since I'm adding up well I'm sorry it
calls<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.520> third<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> cup<00:01:15.080> but<00:01:16.080> I'm<00:01:16.200> doing

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
calls for a third of a cup but I'm doing

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.410 
calls for a third of a cup but I'm doing
about<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.710> half<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.130> cup<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.000> part<00:01:21.240> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
about a half a cup this is the part I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.090 
about a half a cup this is the part I
think<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.869> might<00:01:22.049> throw<00:01:22.320> some<00:01:22.380> people<00:01:22.860> off

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
think that might throw some people off

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.550 
think that might throw some people off
because<00:01:23.520> you're<00:01:23.939> supposed<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.740> work<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:26.220> in

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
because you're supposed to work it in

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.539 
because you're supposed to work it in
until<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.860> resembles<00:01:29.340> coarse<00:01:30.530> cornmeal<00:01:31.549> now

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
until it resembles coarse cornmeal now

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.740 
until it resembles coarse cornmeal now
that<00:01:32.729> doesn't<00:01:33.000> look<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.150> anything's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that doesn't look like anything's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.140 
that doesn't look like anything's
happening<00:01:34.939> but<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.060> still<00:01:36.299> go

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.510 

and<00:01:41.150> I<00:01:41.270> didn't<00:01:41.540> know<00:01:41.810> any<00:01:42.080> other<00:01:42.170> way<00:01:42.470> but<00:01:43.340> to

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520

that much about you can also add in more

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.030 
that much about you can also add in more
flour<00:02:24.530> if<00:02:24.950> it's<00:02:25.700> all<00:02:26.050> absorbed<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:27.200> there<00:02:27.440> or

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
flour if it's all absorbed in there or
