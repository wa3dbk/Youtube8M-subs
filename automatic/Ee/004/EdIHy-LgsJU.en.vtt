00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.410
 h 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.269
 in the rooms carved in the rock 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.380
 There are many places where fico can 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.130
 be lost 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.130
 boy 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.710
 as a kangaroo who does not want to let go of me 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.660
 excellent na hair that was observed a 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.660
 desert rodent challenge 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.380
 and look at the people who built 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.559
 this place our carved seats of 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.010
 stone 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.210
 i 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.210
 to recover my ball 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 hears 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.129
 for where it went I do not know but 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.000
 we need our keys to return 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.190
 to home 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:16.760
 we have to divide ourselves in pairs and look for it 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:19.160
 see you here in 10 minutes a message 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.000
 today our lost city had already 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.800
 found 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.050
 We are in the old city of Petra 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.690
 who built it a long time ago 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.119
 time a few spices merchants 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.290
 we see nobody selling spices now 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:38.110
 it seems that everyone left 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.110
 and there it is still has my keys 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.759
 things 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.200
 two 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.100
 i 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.650
 my keys excellent only there is a 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.740
 problem how are we supposed to get out of 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.740
 here 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.250
 it's hot I wish there were trees that we 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.280
 give shade 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.110
 bojan if there were no trees people 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.450
 who built stone not to have wood 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.600
 to build it so they used what 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.580
 they had stones and they carved a whole 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.580
 hidden city that ready 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.740
 let's see this 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.150
 amazing 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.820
 is this place good there are many 200 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.330
 carved and everyone looks towards that place 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.330
 flat 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.780
 they're under the theater keep yelling 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.780
 we will follow their voices 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.849
 as a friend 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.939
 the oar shot the keys in a pit and 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:22.150
 we slide to recover the 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:24.909
 freedom that seems like a thing for rain 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.180
 maybe when it rained in the water it ran 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.209
 around here and he stored so far 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.359
 it only stores us we had 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.579
 friends we will throw them in the second hopefully 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.920
 I would not have forgotten my rope you can 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.110
 reach my hand 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:47.880

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:50.970

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.840

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.800

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:15.860

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:15.860
 Of course I already have the first peak 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.080
 thank you friends a great rescue life 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.319
 I think we did learn something from those who 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.409
 they built petras or they use what they have 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.509
 if pity we can not build a 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.629
 cupboard using expedition backpacks 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:46.409
 maybe not but we have things that 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.409
 we can do 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:58.490
 welcome your hand 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:03.830

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:06.740
 everything is perfect friends thank you as not 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.010
 we had wood we used what we had 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.710
 like the people who built Petra and what 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.590
 better is that there is a lot of room for more 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.400
 ingredients so where will we go to 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.400
