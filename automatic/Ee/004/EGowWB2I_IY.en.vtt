00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.960
 day 9 of the league mx with an entry 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.580
 in the lion stadium I think I've 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.800
 repeated in absolutely every 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.189
 summaries but that's with an entry 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.050
 with a full hobby to see his 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.570
 lion facing the camoteros del 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.269
 people better known as the fringe 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.140
 the match began with two 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:29.060
 good and surprise notifications the 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.609
 William Yarbrough's entry into the goal 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.320
 of the lion team and that will be so 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.989
 the remainder of the tournament will no longer stop more 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.510
 cristian martínez and also the entrance 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.969
 from mauricio castañeda a very young boy 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.769
 of basic forces that has more or less 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.769
 eight months working with the first 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.559
 team and playing with the lion sub-20 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.219
 bona fourth would also enter by yovanny 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.350
 arrechea 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.070
 Well, the match would start with 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.100
 approximations of both sets both 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.980
 in free kick as long shots and 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.220
 medium distance and the first one would be 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.150
 for the lion mauricio castañeda fails in 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.540
 the first 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.170
 to put the pole farthest away your shot 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.290
 and thus close the score would continue to 0 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.930
 by 01 plays from both sides and there it is 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.230
 another one of mauritius castañeda but 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.140
 she tries to cross it too much better 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.390
 said a center first post and with a lot 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.300
 speed mauricio castañeda to try 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.950
 finish and go again out of the arch 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.659
 a headbutt out there also from matías 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.319
 britos is what would happen 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.530
 until 45 minutes so we would go to 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:43.020
 rest you have to say how desperate and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.780
 lion to recover that lost road 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.909
 with manuel lapuente sitting on the bench 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.340
 and they say that three brains think better 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.099
 that one and that manuel lapuente has 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.950
 between their ranks both carlos poblete 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:02:00.090
 like carlos turrubiates, so 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.579
 good this technical trident then to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.109
 seem to have emerged effect both sets 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.319
 they had already said opportunities 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.959
 but that's how we would go to rest at 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.540
 start of the second half of course 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.079
 at minute 52 the balance had to be 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.900
 tilt in favor of some team and what 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:21.599
 made of the camoteros the annotation of 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.780
 diego must be wrong when trying 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.299
 delay the ball of Luis Montes 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.459
 makes it reach matías 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.260
 alústiza el chavo and of left leg 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.810
 give it to diego debuen that is of 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.970
 right leg sticks it in the post 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.579
 and it nests in the arc of william 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.900
 yarbrough the 1 for 0 the despair 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.299
 started to make me 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.209
 and havoc in the emerald set 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.670
 they tried with balls they tried 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.489
 failed compasses the half court that does not 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.549
 failed now fails but well so we 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.120
 we would go to the end of the match so we 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:00.030
 we went and with this result at the end of 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.739
 party the poblano set there 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.950
 saying it handled the encounter and one of the 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.079
 top players of the match and also 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.620
 the poblano group was Matías avalanche 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.049
 alústiza el chavo the excellent Argentine 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.239
 excellent player so with this 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.150
 result in favor of puebla listen 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.940
 both the words of Carlos de Carlos 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.940
 poblete like de gustavo matosas that says 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.790
 that is not going away that sebastián more 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.959
 will lose the whole tournament and also speaks 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.599
 of the ownership that already won william 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.970
 yarbrough was thus started a very 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.270
 difficult we came from a defeat 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.140
 complicated and 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.880
 monterrey so this result gives us 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.740
 a lot of confidence for 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.720
 and try the remaining half 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.510
 season that by obligation in a 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.950
 Leo result needed to continue with 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.800
 life a good order qualification and 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.790
 Well, we had several opportunities 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.430
 fortunately diego I can find 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.440
 that starting the second half and I think 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.490
 that we did not know how to defend well we apply 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.530
 take off a little back to have 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.740
 spaces to counterattack and know 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.810
 take a little more advantage but in 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.660
 general terms the team in all 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.900
 its lines the feeling of sadness for 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.900
 the defeat 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.560
 and some crazy mixed feelings 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.169
 by the debut some players but what 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.969
 that leaves me is sad because of the defeat 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.749
 and what I liked the least is not a 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.749
 equipment that has 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.810
 a set of individualities the opening 

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:43.729
 extraction always of collective game and 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.860
 is what I always work but good at 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.479
 times when you want to play that 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.070
 enthusiasm negotiated with a ball is 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.770
 so strange that the tail provides none 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.720
 and I received a lot of affection from all the people 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.540
 of my players commitment of all the 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.560
 directive so 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:03.770
 I go to the end of the waking room 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.870
 for the case of Mauritius we will evaluate it 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.780
 but in the case of william is already a 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.380
 decision taken by means and I think that 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.160
 these matches for him 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.200
 they will be a preparation for what 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.660
 I would have in the next championship I think 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.190
 that is out disorder so I 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.120
 I talked to my doctor about the different 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.120
 studies that has been done 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.730
 imagine that although the best in this 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.920
 two weeks later comes the theme of 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.390
 put it physically well I 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.070
 particularly I think that 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:39.740
 with images of Luis Alatorre for 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.740
 centers with signatures with the look
