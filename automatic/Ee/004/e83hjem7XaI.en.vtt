00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 the bible the magazine here is a novelty 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.000
 who could not leave mcbeal 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.259
 indifferent two years of work then 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.780
 to illustrate this version of the new 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.820
 Will halfway between magazines and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.580
 art books meet with the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.130
 responsible for this daring project the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.439
 14 hours when david and isolde arrive 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.789
 at first party editions they have 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.340
 go with jonathan boulet are 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.949
 responsible the trip was good very 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.300
 very good at the program a session of 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.369
 work on the latest born of this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.189
 evangelical publishing house the bible 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.840
 magazine an illustrated bible at the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.960
 fashion magazines and other 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.640
 houde architecture art reviews around 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.730
 from this table three young talents 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.440
 among others for a project a little crazy 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.309
 published a Bible with the most graphic 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.980
 modern that is when we think Christian 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.090
 we do not think at all art and I believe that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.910
 when we look in history 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.559
 the church has always been enormously 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.539
 invested in there at the level 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.460
 paintings architecture and that's 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.890
 as if in fact over the years they 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.320
 have lost a little this this inspiration 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.670
 this creativity and I believe that there one 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.320
 more and more like a new 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.030
 generation who wants to say what we 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.119
 we want to be artists it wants 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.400
 a little transmit what we live with 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.990
 god what we discover of god and we 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.880
 wants to transfer through the image 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.280
 through video and I believe that this 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.549
 project is part of the origin of this 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.479
 project a man jonathan cannonball 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.140
 financial analysts in early 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.909
 career 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.130
 this thirty has left everything for a 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.170
 less lucrative activity on behalf of his 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.580
 faith 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.650
 from a dream live these prayers 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.979
 published a bible that they can 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.600
 flip through as one reads a magazine a 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.340
 way of praying more playful and 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.770
 carrier 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.020
 to realize this dream jonathan boulet has 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.630
 took his time two long years of 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.670
 work of a man decides and his strength 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.549
 I'm waiting for her from her faith and her 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.319
 desire to share it the day I 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.360
 realized that by praying there was a god 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.979
 who listens and my prayers and who has 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.209
 answered my brothers I told myself he 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.729
 is something that goes beyond me in the 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.409
 reality and from there I told myself I 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.819
 discovered a place that even a god who has 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.829
 want to make me grow indicates desire 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.720
 that I will succeed in life a god who 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.870
 I want to be happy that I 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.160
 be fulfilled and this hope that 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.380
 I wanted to transmit it 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.840
 and so I was always looking for 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.970
 means for paris v what am I doing this 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.760
 that I live internally can 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.569
 reflected externally since his 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.160
 project was born 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.790
 jonathan turned into real 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.680
 vrp especially with his friends this 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.200
 afternoon he has an appointment with Florent 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.180
 etienne young two friends one 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.150
 Buddhists and the other agnostic who 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.310
 yet he welcomed them 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.910
 a teenager today Christians who 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.590
 will be addressed by faith would have a beautiful 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.120
 tool with sarah that would make him want 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.600
 which will allow him to access more 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.489
 easily 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.329
 it's a format that never 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.209
 changed since 2000 after married that 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.230
 is good for your new computer is 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.549
 I have so much I think it's 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.819
 something effective to touch 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.049
 more people to touch them otherwise 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.329
 in front of the basilica our lady of 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.130
 fourvière the name of the rhône one of 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.440
 main Protestant bookstores of the 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.019
 city with sales starts rather 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.510
 good the bible magazine is already doing 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.770
 followers personally in my room 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.830
 a friend 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.020
 I always have a new testament that 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.010
 I leave for my friends I have friends 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.070
 who are not Christians and often I 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.710
 say that when the person is gone 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.770
 the new testament was neither 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.320
 watch nor touch and look at his 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.600
 new testament magazine this bible 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.440
 of magazines I told myself for sure 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.080
 if I had it at my house on my 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.690
 small table or in the guest room 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.360
 that's the person will sit down 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.430
 will tell a man what is it 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.010
 I'm not saying it will be read from a to z 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.370
 but in less it will flip through it will be 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.280
