00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and then just here install won't take a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.299 
and then just here install won't take a
moment<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:45.510> basically<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.800> melting

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
moment and so basically what melting

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.889 
moment and so basically what melting
disk<00:00:47.550> image<00:00:47.850> does<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.270> basically<00:00:48.570> makes<00:00:48.809> your

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
disk image does it basically makes your

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.470 
disk image does it basically makes your
computer<00:00:49.410> think<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.730> disk<00:00:51.180> in

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
computer think that there is a disk in

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.439 
computer think that there is a disk in
it<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:52.260> file<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.280> however<00:00:53.940> there<00:00:54.300> isn't

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it with file on however there isn't

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.540 
it with file on however there isn't
actually<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> disk<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.590> all<00:00:55.829> virtual<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
actually a disk it's all virtual and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.189 
actually a disk it's all virtual and
this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.480> useful<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.020> want<00:00:58.109> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
this is really useful if you want to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.840 
this is really useful if you want to
have<00:00:58.350> loads<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.739> disks<00:00:59.250> mounted<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.820> your

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
have loads of disks mounted to your

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.520 
have loads of disks mounted to your
computer<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.420> once<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.199> only<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.500> one

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
computer at once but you only have one

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.429 
computer at once but you only have one
disk<00:01:01.949> drive<00:01:02.280> also<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:03.149> mean<00:01:03.510> staff<00:01:03.870> does<00:01:04.080> it

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
disk drive also I mean staff does it

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.320 
disk drive also I mean staff does it
means<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.220> save<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.670> time<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.939> burning

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
means you can save the time of burning

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.390 
means you can save the time of burning
image<00:01:07.290> files<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.830> disk<00:01:08.100> now<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.720> program

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
image files to a disk now this program

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.730 
image files to a disk now this program
it<00:01:11.400> works<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:12.119> all<00:01:12.689> kinds<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.080> files<00:01:13.470> with

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it works with all kinds of files with

moment you can only mount one disk at a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.999 
moment you can only mount one disk at a
time<00:02:03.209> so<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.349> try<00:02:04.409> mount<00:02:04.799> something
