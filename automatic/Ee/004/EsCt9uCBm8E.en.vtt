we're<00:00:49.360> very<00:00:49.539> intrigued<00:00:49.899> by<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.140> use<00:00:50.350> of<00:00:50.379> color

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
we're very intrigued by the use of color

we're very intrigued by the use of color
and<00:00:50.860> color<00:00:51.129> therapy<00:00:51.430> and<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.600> idea<00:00:52.899> of<00:00:53.020> that

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
and color therapy and the idea of that

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.299 
and color therapy and the idea of that
color<00:00:53.890> can<00:00:54.600> inspire<00:00:55.600> happiness<00:00:55.949> also<00:00:56.949> with

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
color can inspire happiness also with

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
the idea about the rainbow I think they

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.479 
the idea about the rainbow I think they
may<00:00:59.110> pose<00:00:59.289> something<00:00:59.590> that<00:00:59.890> has<00:01:00.219> very

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
may pose something that has very

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.720 
may pose something that has very
interesting<00:01:01.320> mythical<00:01:02.320> industry<00:01:02.859> and<00:01:03.370> we're

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
interesting mythical industry and we're

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.979 
interesting mythical industry and we're
just<00:01:03.879> very<00:01:04.030> intrigued<00:01:04.390> with<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.720> kind<00:01:04.930> of

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
just very intrigued with the kind of

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.469 
just very intrigued with the kind of
cultural<00:01:05.379> reference<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:07.119> history

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
cultural reference and the the history

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.090 
cultural reference and the the history
of<00:01:07.630> a<00:01:07.750> rainbow<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:08.530> we<00:01:08.619> wanted<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:08.950> create

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
of a rainbow and so we wanted to create

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.700 
of a rainbow and so we wanted to create
something<00:01:10.090> that<00:01:10.210> was<00:01:10.450> really<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.720> saturation

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
something that was really a saturation

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.590 
something that was really a saturation
of<00:01:11.830> color<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.460> if<00:01:12.580> happiness<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.180> was<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.330> color

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
of color and if happiness it was a color

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.660 
of color and if happiness it was a color
what<00:01:13.810> would<00:01:13.960> it<00:01:14.080> be<00:01:14.110> i<00:01:14.530> Chara<00:01:14.979> from<00:01:15.369> my<00:01:15.490> own

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
what would it be i Chara from my own

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.550 
what would it be i Chara from my own
experiences<00:01:16.180> when<00:01:16.360> I<00:01:16.450> was<00:01:16.600> a<00:01:16.689> child<00:01:16.900> I<00:01:17.229> love

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
experiences when I was a child I love

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.770 
experiences when I was a child I love
things<00:01:17.830> that<00:01:17.950> are<00:01:18.220> very<00:01:18.430> pared<00:01:18.970> down<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.570> very

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
things that are very pared down and very

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.080 
things that are very pared down and very
simple<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:20.950> things<00:01:21.100> that<00:01:21.159> I<00:01:21.340> can<00:01:21.549> build<00:01:21.729> and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
simple and things that I can build and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.730 
simple and things that I can build and
move<00:01:22.570> around<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.290> shape<00:01:23.799> I<00:01:24.670> think<00:01:25.150> that<00:01:25.299> we

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
move around and shape I think that we

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.210 
move around and shape I think that we

to give the child it's very basic tools

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.650 
to give the child it's very basic tools

head versus dictating what it should do

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.590 
head versus dictating what it should do

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
to them and with this particular work

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.290 
to them and with this particular work
I've<00:01:40.600> created<00:01:40.900> almost<00:01:41.470> three<00:01:41.740> more<00:01:41.980> pieces

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
I've created almost three more pieces

I've created almost three more pieces
big<00:01:43.300> star<00:01:43.570> golf

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
big star golf

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.110 
big star golf
kind<00:01:44.710> of<00:01:44.800> painting<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.460> floor<00:01:45.700> which<00:01:45.910> they

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
kind of painting the floor which they

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.090 
kind of painting the floor which they
can<00:01:46.270> lift<00:01:46.420> up<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:46.870> move<00:01:47.050> around<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.740> kind<00:01:48.010> of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
can lift up and move around and kind of

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.460 
can lift up and move around and kind of
join<00:01:48.310> them<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.730> corresponding<00:01:49.720> several<00:01:50.200> drops

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
join them to corresponding several drops

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.820 
join them to corresponding several drops
and<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:51.940> it's<00:01:52.420> very<00:01:52.570> simple<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.380> think<00:01:53.650> it's

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
and so it's very simple I think it's

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.010 
and so it's very simple I think it's
small<00:01:54.100> for<00:01:54.400> for<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.790> younger<00:01:55.120> agents<00:01:55.630> are<00:01:55.900> we

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
small for for the younger agents are we

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.800 
small for for the younger agents are we
kids<00:01:56.290> from<00:01:56.500> two<00:01:57.160> three<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.640> four<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:58.450> that<00:01:58.630> can

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
kids from two three and four is that can

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.660 
kids from two three and four is that can
move<00:01:58.960> things<00:01:59.200> around<00:01:59.440> with<00:01:59.860> basic<00:02:00.280> crawling

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
move things around with basic crawling

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.940 
move things around with basic crawling
but<00:02:00.880> helps<00:02:01.180> them<00:02:01.330> engage<00:02:01.540> with<00:02:01.960> color<00:02:02.200> shapes

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
but helps them engage with color shapes

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.090 
but helps them engage with color shapes
and<00:02:03.369> basic<00:02:04.180> design<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:05.320> whole<00:02:05.470> idea<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.830> art

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
and basic design the whole idea of art

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
individuals this piece is I think a good

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.450 
individuals this piece is I think a good
example<00:03:29.100> of<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.700> instead<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:31.070> giving<00:03:32.070> them<00:03:32.430> a

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
example of that instead of giving them a

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.090 
example of that instead of giving them a
ready-made<00:03:33.030> image<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:34.290> they<00:03:34.500> have<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.860> deal

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
ready-made image that they have to deal

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.460 
ready-made image that they have to deal
with<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.580> translate<00:03:36.150> they<00:03:36.660> actually<00:03:37.200> get<00:03:37.440> to

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
with and translate they actually get to

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.070 
with and translate they actually get to
create<00:03:38.010> their<00:03:38.250> own<00:03:38.280> image<00:03:38.820> there's<00:03:39.420> no<00:03:39.750> right

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
create their own image there's no right

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.620 
create their own image there's no right
or<00:03:40.110> wrong<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:40.920> think<00:03:41.040> that's<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:42.239> good

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
or wrong so I think that's a good

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.360 
or wrong so I think that's a good
platform<00:03:42.930> where<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.920> know<00:03:44.040> they<00:03:44.190> can<00:03:44.340> just

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
platform where you know they can just

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.490 
platform where you know they can just
express<00:03:44.940> themselves<00:03:45.450> however<00:03:45.690> they<00:03:45.989> want<00:03:46.320> to

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
express themselves however they want to

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.590 
express themselves however they want to
and<00:03:46.709> there<00:03:47.250> are<00:03:47.400> more<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.790> more<00:03:47.820> artists<00:03:48.360> and
