all<00:01:46.910> right<00:01:47.030> let's<00:01:47.210> shut<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.510> machines<00:01:47.810> down

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
all right let's shut the machines down

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.480 
all right let's shut the machines down
and<00:01:48.410> then<00:01:48.500> we'll<00:01:48.620> look<00:01:48.770> at<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.010> install<00:01:49.370> on

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
and then we'll look at the install on

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:59.020 
and then we'll look at the install on
the<00:01:49.580> bottom<00:01:57.370> press<00:01:58.370> the<00:01:58.490> button<00:01:58.700> at<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.850> same

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
the bottom press the button at the same

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.960 
the bottom press the button at the same
time<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.890> machine<00:02:00.890> on<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.130> right<00:02:01.220> I'm

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
time and the machine on the right I'm

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.670 
time and the machine on the right I'm
actually<00:02:02.180> on<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.480> left<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.870> memory<00:02:03.440> card

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
actually on the left the memory card

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.270 
actually on the left the memory card
machine<00:02:04.100> shuts<00:02:05.000> down<00:02:05.180> right<00:02:05.450> away<00:02:05.920> looks<00:02:06.920> like

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
machine shuts down right away looks like

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.050 
machine shuts down right away looks like
the<00:02:07.550> hard<00:02:07.910> drive<00:02:08.149> based<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.630> EPC<00:02:09.700> not<00:02:10.700> quite

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
the hard drive based the EPC not quite

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.460 
the hard drive based the EPC not quite
ready<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.960> shut<00:02:12.230> down<00:02:12.260> yet<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:14.470> windows

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
ready to shut down yet the windows

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.280 
ready to shut down yet the windows
install<00:02:16.070> on<00:02:16.220> these<00:02:16.340> machines<00:02:16.520> are<00:02:17.290> ghost

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
install on these machines are ghost

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.400 
install on these machines are ghost
copies<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:20.150> there<00:02:20.300> are<00:02:20.500> 100%<00:02:21.500> bit<00:02:22.340> 4-bit

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
copies so there are 100% bit 4-bit

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:35.040 
copies so there are 100% bit 4-bit
identical

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.750 

so<00:02:35.620> I'll<00:02:35.680> shut<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.950> down<00:02:36.040> okay<00:02:36.310> while<00:02:36.520> we<00:02:36.610> wait

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
so I'll shut it down okay while we wait

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.280 
so I'll shut it down okay while we wait
for<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.970> white<00:02:37.120> one<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.360> shut<00:02:37.510> down<00:02:37.900> let's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
for the white one to shut down let's

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.710 
for the white one to shut down let's
look<00:02:38.590> at<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:39.250> bottom<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.940> black<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.660> can

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
look at the bottom of the black you can

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.740

still<00:02:56.590> shutting<00:02:56.950> down<00:02:57.160> but<00:02:57.640> we're<00:02:58.000> going<00:02:58.120> to

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
still shutting down but we're going to

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.190 
still shutting down but we're going to
flip<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.480> over<00:02:58.540> anyway

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
flip it over anyway
