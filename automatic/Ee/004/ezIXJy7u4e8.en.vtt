00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
what bloody car skateboards did with

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.589 
what bloody car skateboards did with
this<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.019> spinto<00:00:28.490> it's<00:00:29.490> dropped<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.390> lot

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
this for the spinto it's dropped a lot

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.910 
this for the spinto it's dropped a lot
close<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.439> two<00:00:31.830> inches<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:33.380> but<00:00:34.380> things<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.739> set

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
close to two inches and but things I set

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.830 
close to two inches and but things I set
it<00:00:35.010> apart<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.399> sure<00:00:35.520> that's<00:00:35.850> 40<00:00:36.360> inches<00:00:36.600> long

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
it apart for sure that's 40 inches long

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.130 
it apart for sure that's 40 inches long
and<00:00:37.820> it's<00:00:38.820> nine<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> half<00:00:39.149> inches<00:00:39.450> wide<00:00:39.840> so

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
and it's nine and a half inches wide so

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.410 
and it's nine and a half inches wide so
it's<00:00:40.290> not<00:00:40.440> super<00:00:40.890> wide<00:00:41.070> at<00:00:41.219> all<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.239> this

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it's not super wide at all so what this

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.569 
it's not super wide at all so what this
does<00:00:42.690> makes<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.500> good<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:43.950> sprinting

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
does makes it really good for sprinting

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.630 
does makes it really good for sprinting
around<00:00:44.730> town<00:00:45.230> in<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.590> ply<00:00:46.920> maple<00:00:47.129> instead<00:00:47.550> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
around town in a ply maple instead of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.100 
around town in a ply maple instead of
usual<00:00:47.879> nine<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:49.230> 11<00:00:49.920> ply<00:00:50.280> maple<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.809> lot

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
usual nine to 11 ply maple so it's a lot

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.319 
usual nine to 11 ply maple so it's a lot
lighter<00:00:52.440> easier<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.190> carry<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.879> coffee<00:00:54.120> shop

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
lighter easier to carry in a coffee shop

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.660 
lighter easier to carry in a coffee shop
or<00:00:54.840> class<00:00:55.289> or<00:00:55.649> wherever<00:00:56.100> you're<00:00:56.190> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> go

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
um since it is a ply that has a pretty

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.090 
um since it is a ply that has a pretty
big<00:01:00.329> wheel<00:01:00.570> base<00:01:00.750> route<00:01:01.020> 33<00:01:01.350> inches<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.920> does

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
big wheel base route 33 inches it does

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.820 
big wheel base route 33 inches it does
have<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.489> flex<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.350> actually<00:01:04.530> like

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
have some flex to it and I actually like

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.789 
have some flex to it and I actually like
this<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.280> getting<00:01:05.640> around<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.350> push<00:01:07.350> races

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
this for getting around and push races

this for getting around and push races
and<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.310> pushing<00:01:08.820> around<00:01:08.880> town<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:10.020> makes

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and just pushing around town just makes

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.460 
and just pushing around town just makes
the<00:01:10.350> board<00:01:11.240> soak<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.540> lot<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.750> bad<00:01:12.900> pavement

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the board soak up a lot of bad pavement

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.010 
the board soak up a lot of bad pavement
it<00:01:13.740> which<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.100> Lansing<00:01:14.520> has<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.670> ton<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.240> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
it which is Lansing has a ton of it so

we got this set up right now with some
Paris<00:01:19.140> 180s<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.920> some<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.640> heats<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.150> really

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
Paris 180s and some in heats just really

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.780 
Paris 180s and some in heats just really
like<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.259> heats<00:01:22.500> push<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.040> around<00:01:23.220> otherwise

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
like it heats push it around otherwise

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.580 
like it heats push it around otherwise
and<00:01:24.030> how<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.119> rock<00:01:24.420> metro<00:01:24.810> express<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.439> my

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and how I rock metro express on my

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.249 
and how I rock metro express on my
personal<00:01:26.070> one<00:01:26.540> what<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.049> this

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
personal one what I like to do on this

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
personal one what I like to do on this
board<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.799> actually<00:01:29.670> flip<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.060> wheels<00:01:30.240> around

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
board is actually flip the wheels around

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.870 
board is actually flip the wheels around
so<00:01:30.810> they're<00:01:30.930> inside<00:01:31.290> out<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:32.460> makes<00:01:32.700> them

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
so they're inside out that makes them

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270 
so they're inside out that makes them
that<00:01:33.000> stick<00:01:33.299> out<00:01:33.420> as<00:01:33.630> far<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.110> then<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.799> are

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
that stick out as far and then you are

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.330 
that stick out as far and then you are
less<00:01:35.520> likely<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.850> kick<00:01:36.119> your<00:01:36.240> wheels<00:01:36.450> or

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
less likely to kick your wheels or

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.560 
less likely to kick your wheels or
integer<00:01:38.340> set<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.579> as<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> pusher<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.090> then<00:01:39.420> when

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
integer set up as a pusher and then when

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.090 
integer set up as a pusher and then when
I'm<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:40.049> coming<00:01:40.320> into<00:01:40.409> an<00:01:40.530> intersection<00:01:40.979> too

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
I'm like coming into an intersection too

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.740 
I'm like coming into an intersection too
hot<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.729> still<00:01:41.939> throw<00:01:42.060> sand<00:01:42.329> up<00:01:42.540> slide

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
hot I can still throw sand up slide

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.520 
hot I can still throw sand up slide
power<00:01:43.079> slide<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.710> make<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
power slide to make it
