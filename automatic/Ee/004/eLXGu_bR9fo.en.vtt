this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> captain<00:01:35.130> 120<00:01:35.700> right<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this is the captain 120 right there and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.960 
this is the captain 120 right there and
even<00:01:36.810> though<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> very<00:01:37.320> tall<00:01:38.220> block<00:01:38.670> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
even though this is a very tall block it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.120 
even though this is a very tall block it
will<00:01:39.150> still<00:01:39.450> fit<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:39.960> fine<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.680> you

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
will still fit just fine so you can you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.190 
will still fit just fine so you can you
have<00:01:41.340> room<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.850> about<00:01:41.939> any<00:01:42.420> block<00:01:42.659> on

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
have room for just about any block on

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
have room for just about any block on
the<00:01:43.320> market<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.890> also<00:01:44.159> there<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.520> plenty<00:01:44.909> of

over the components and out the back so

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.750 
over the components and out the back so
you<00:02:11.680> have<00:02:11.740> like<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:11.980> wind<00:02:12.250> tunnel<00:02:12.370> going

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
you have like a wind tunnel going

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.700 
you have like a wind tunnel going
through<00:02:12.940> there<00:02:13.150> alright<00:02:14.140> now<00:02:14.290> let's<00:02:14.470> go<00:02:14.590> ahead

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
through there alright now let's go ahead

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.110 
through there alright now let's go ahead
and<00:02:14.980> take<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.130> look<00:02:15.310> at<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.520> graphics<00:02:15.880> card

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and take a look at the graphics card

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.960 
and take a look at the graphics card
compartment<00:02:16.900> here<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.070> side<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.550> can

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
compartment here so on this side you can

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.190 
compartment here so on this side you can
see<00:02:19.180> we<00:02:19.270> have<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.390> graphics<00:02:19.810> card<00:02:19.990> in<00:02:20.080> there

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
see we have a graphics card in there

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.280 
see we have a graphics card in there
mounted<00:02:20.530> on<00:02:20.620> our<00:02:20.650> bracket<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.870> bracket

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290

feeds<00:02:23.530> back<00:02:23.770> down<00:02:24.010> into<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.640> know<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
feeds back down into the you know the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.700 
feeds back down into the you know the
area<00:02:25.780> where<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.960> motherboard<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.530> plugs

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
area where the motherboard is and plugs

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.580 
area where the motherboard is and plugs
in<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:26.980> way<00:02:27.100> too<00:02:27.160> with<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.430> ribbon<00:02:27.760> cable<00:02:28.120> and

we<00:02:34.660> won't<00:02:34.750> pre<00:02:34.990> mount<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.320> in<00:02:35.440> there<00:02:35.590> if<00:02:36.400> you're

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
we won't pre mount it in there if you're

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.710 
we won't pre mount it in there if you're
using<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.850> graphics<00:02:37.150> card<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.390> here<00:02:37.540> there's

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
using a graphics card in here there's

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.110 
using a graphics card in here there's
going<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.960> be<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.170> vent<00:02:38.560> on<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.070> side<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:40.090> that

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
going to be a vent on the side so that

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.880 
going to be a vent on the side so that
the<00:02:40.360> graphics<00:02:40.720> card<00:02:40.990> can<00:02:41.050> breathe<00:02:41.470> it's<00:02:41.740> not

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
the graphics card can breathe it's not

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.110 
the graphics card can breathe it's not
just<00:02:42.010> going<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.160> be<00:02:42.280> in<00:02:42.430> here<00:02:42.610> all<00:02:42.700> by<00:02:42.730> itself

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
just going to be in here all by itself

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.520 
just going to be in here all by itself
suffocating<00:02:43.750> you'll<00:02:44.140> be<00:02:44.200> able<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.410> breathe

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
suffocating you'll be able to breathe

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.000 
suffocating you'll be able to breathe
and<00:02:44.860> there's<00:02:45.310> also<00:02:46.440> some<00:02:47.440> holes<00:02:47.650> here<00:02:47.770> in<00:02:47.950> the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
and there's also some holes here in the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.820 
and there's also some holes here in the
back<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.790> allow<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.030> air<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.300> flow<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:50.080> little

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
back to allow the air to flow a little

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.680 
back to allow the air to flow a little
bit<00:02:50.920> worried<00:02:51.130> about<00:02:51.280> air<00:02:51.490> flow<00:02:51.700> with<00:02:52.330> some

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
bit worried about air flow with some

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.320 
bit worried about air flow with some
configurations<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:54.190> with<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:55.120> know<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
configurations but with the you know the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.610 
configurations but with the you know the
ventilation<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.900> side<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.290> should<00:02:56.470> be

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
ventilation on the side it should be

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.380 
ventilation on the side it should be
okay<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.130> then<00:02:57.550> if<00:02:57.640> you're<00:02:57.760> exhausting<00:02:58.300> out

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
okay and then if you're exhausting out

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.320 
okay and then if you're exhausting out
the<00:02:58.540> back<00:02:58.720> here<00:02:59.050> that<00:02:59.740> should<00:02:59.920> also<00:03:00.040> help<00:03:00.330> the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
the back here that should also help the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.690 
the back here that should also help the
backside<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:02.020> that<00:03:02.110> we<00:03:02.920> have<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.130> three<00:03:03.400> spots

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
backside of that we have the three spots

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.820 
backside of that we have the three spots
for<00:03:04.000> SSDs<00:03:04.720> or<00:03:04.990> two<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> half<00:03:05.350> inch<00:03:05.530> drives

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
for SSDs or two and a half inch drives

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.460 
for SSDs or two and a half inch drives
and<00:03:06.130> these<00:03:06.880> all<00:03:07.090> have<00:03:07.270> power<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:07.900> SATA<00:03:08.140> that's

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
and these all have power and SATA that's

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.920 
and these all have power and SATA that's
been<00:03:08.650> pre<00:03:08.890> run<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:09.850> they<00:03:10.060> just<00:03:10.239> plug<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.720> play

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
been pre run so they just plug and play

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.229 
been pre run so they just plug and play
pretty<00:03:11.140> much<00:03:11.230> right<00:03:11.530> in<00:03:11.560> there<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.130> if<00:03:13.120> your

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
pretty much right in there and if your

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.420 
pretty much right in there and if your
motherboard<00:03:13.450> supports<00:03:14.200> hot-swap<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.280> should

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
motherboard supports hot-swap you should

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.040 
motherboard supports hot-swap you should
be<00:03:15.489> able<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.670> configure<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.480> just<00:03:16.930> use

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
be able to configure that and just use

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.170 
be able to configure that and just use
these<00:03:17.200> as<00:03:17.380> hot-swap<00:03:17.769> if<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.040> like<00:03:18.190> there's

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
these as hot-swap if you like there's

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.080 
these as hot-swap if you like there's
one<00:03:19.360> that's<00:03:19.450> already<00:03:19.660> installed<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:21.310> then

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
one that's already installed and then

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.720 
one that's already installed and then
those<00:03:22.269> again<00:03:22.680> set<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:23.709> on<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.010> back<00:03:24.160> plugs<00:03:24.580> in

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
those again set it on the back plugs in

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.970 
those again set it on the back plugs in
there<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:25.120> then<00:03:25.209> goes<00:03:25.390> over<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.780> the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
there and then goes over to the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.199 
there and then goes over to the
motherboard<00:03:26.980> chamber<00:03:27.489> alright<00:03:28.030> let's<00:03:28.150> look

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
motherboard chamber alright let's look

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.509 
motherboard chamber alright let's look
at<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.390> last<00:03:28.570> chamber<00:03:28.840> here<00:03:29.140> this<00:03:29.860> is<00:03:30.190> where

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
at the last chamber here this is where

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.340 
at the last chamber here this is where
the<00:03:30.550> power<00:03:30.910> supply<00:03:31.269> goes<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.840> all<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.019> cables

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
the power supply goes and all the cables

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.979 
the power supply goes and all the cables
have<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.800> bit<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.430> room<00:03:33.550> in<00:03:33.790> here<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:34.900> know

we saw on the graphics card the power

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.120 
we saw on the graphics card the power
supply<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.320> going<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.530> go<00:03:46.620> right<00:03:46.800> there<00:03:46.980> it's

supply is going to go right there it's

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.250 
supply is going to go right there it's
pretty<00:03:47.310> snug<00:03:47.400> if<00:03:48.390> you're<00:03:48.510> putting<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.870> really

lot of interesting options with this as

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.030 
lot of interesting options with this as
the<00:04:45.140> the<00:04:46.140> first<00:04:46.350> one<00:04:46.470> is<00:04:46.530> going<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.710> come<00:04:46.830> is

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
going to be covered but they are making

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.040

top so that you can see your components

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.730 
top so that you can see your components
windows<00:04:54.120> on<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.390> side<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:54.840> I<00:04:55.350> want<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.590> really

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
windows on the side and I want to really

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.990 
windows on the side and I want to really
see<00:04:55.920> what<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.130> modding<00:04:56.430> community<00:04:56.550> is<00:04:56.880> going

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
see what the modding community is going

to<00:04:57.060> do<00:04:57.180> with<00:04:57.300> this<00:04:57.390> and<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.540> think<00:04:57.570> this<00:04:57.870> is<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
to do with this and I think this is the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.900 
to do with this and I think this is the
case<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.530> modding<00:04:58.800> community<00:04:58.830> is<00:04:59.220> probably

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
case the modding community is probably

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.070 
case the modding community is probably
going<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.270> like<00:05:00.450> more<00:05:00.630> than<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.840> lot<00:05:00.990> of
