00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.000
 you never had to run 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.330
 barefoot on hot for 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.650
 and we all would have to learn 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.200
 this trick 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.520
 if it was not around the earth 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.560
 rescue shell of the aerial ocean 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.769
 the atmosphere is where it is needed 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.660
 cools the heat and where you need it softens the cold 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.660
 how does she do it 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.510
 the atmosphere freely misses visible 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.440
 the sun's rays and absorbs the invisible 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.890
 thermal reflected ground surface 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.930
 the air above ground warms up 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.949
 but the earth's surface is not the same 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.920
 This land and sea mountains and plains are hot 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.870
 deserts and ice spaces they are all 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.600
 give a different amount to the atmosphere 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.610
 heat and moisture water vapor and dust here 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.320
 and going over different plots of land 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.850
 differently heated 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.799
 and differently moistened air masses 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.609
 they are very large as the Siberian 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.999
 taiga 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:16.520
 like the ice cover of the arctic like an ocean in 

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:17.460
 the tropics like places over which they 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.880
 formed 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.259
 [music] 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.039
 and we give the name in these places 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.039
 equatorial air masses 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.039
 tropical 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.170
 moderate 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.600
 [music] 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.390
 arctic and antarctic 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.620
 [music] 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.630
 you never had to run 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.990
 barefoot on hot coals 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.620
 and we all would have to learn 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.590
 this trick if not around the earth 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.210
 it was a saving air shell 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.970
 of the ocean 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.330
 the atmosphere is where it cools down 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.350
 the heat and where you need it softens the cold 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.350
 she succeeds 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.209
 the atmosphere freely misses visible 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.080
 the sun's rays and absorbs the invisible 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.110
 thermal 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.590
 reflected ground surface air 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.599
 warming up above the ground 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.650
 but the earth's surface is not the same 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:30.590
 This land and sea mountains and plains are hot 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.540
 deserts and ice spaces they are all 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.150
 give a different amount to the atmosphere 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.890
 heat and moisture of water vapor and in theory 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.989
 Here also gather over different sites 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.480
 differently heated lands 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:49.489
 and differently humid air mass 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.850
 they are very large as the Siberian 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:56.030
 the taiga is like the ice sheet of the arctic like 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.140
 ocean in the tropics as places over which 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.600
 they formed 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.920
 [music] 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.730
 and we give the name in these places 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.730
 equatorial air masses 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.730
 tropical 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.849
 moderate 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.280
 [music] 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.310
 arctic and antarctic 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.799
 [music] 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.209
 but you should know that the air masses 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:31.370
 not tied to their places of birth a 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.879
 otherwise the weather in these places would never 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.879
 changed 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.459
 it would rain for centuries 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.150
 somewhere to centuries 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.150
 snow 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.890
 but somewhere a century 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.890
 abe great dry 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.030
 no air masses stand still 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.590
 they move above the ground 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:07.269
 enduring heat and cold rain and snow 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:11.709
 the weather what makes them move 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.709
 difference in atmospheric pressure
