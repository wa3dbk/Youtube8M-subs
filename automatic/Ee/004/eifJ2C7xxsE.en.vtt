00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
materials that were on the Nike Mars

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.940 
materials that were on the Nike Mars
rover<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.850> came<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.329> little<00:01:51.630> hangtag

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
rover and it came with a little hangtag

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.969 
rover and it came with a little hangtag
that<00:01:52.950> details<00:01:53.399> all<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.909> these<00:01:54.060> things<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
that details all of these things so the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.160 
that details all of these things so the
materials<00:01:56.579> are<00:01:56.790> second<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.479> none<00:01:57.630> they're

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
materials are second to none they're

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.620 
materials are second to none they're
literally<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.790> we're<00:01:59.969> used<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.420> Mars

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
literally what we're used for the Mars

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.410 
literally what we're used for the Mars
rover<00:02:01.020> which<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.320> too<00:02:01.560> cool<00:02:01.829> they<00:02:02.759> also<00:02:02.969> came

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.650 
to because there are some nice details
but<00:02:21.570> before<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:21.960> do<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:23.280> last<00:02:23.460> detail<00:02:24.000> or

came with in a sketch Tom Sachs did of
the<00:02:39.300> solar<00:02:39.570> system<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:42.030> was<00:02:42.240> part<00:02:42.510> of

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
the solar system so this was part of

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.500 
the solar system so this was part of
like<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.900> wrapping<00:02:43.140> paper<00:02:43.490> like<00:02:44.490> how<00:02:44.700> cool<00:02:45.330> is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
like the wrapping paper like how cool is

that you know what I mean like how many

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.190 
that you know what I mean like how many
stickers<00:02:47.220> come<00:02:48.030> with<00:02:48.180> all<00:02:48.420> those<00:02:48.660> features

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
stickers come with all those features

a little bit up close for you guys so
here<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.959> insoles<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.530> was<00:02:55.650> talking<00:02:56.010> to

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
here are the insoles I was talking to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.650 
here are the insoles I was talking to
you<00:02:56.190> about<00:02:56.220> now<00:02:56.820> they<00:02:57.000> have<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.360> kind<00:02:57.570> of

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
you about now they have that kind of

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.750 
you about now they have that kind of
knot<00:02:57.870> system<00:02:58.380> as<00:02:58.620> well<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.250> talks<00:02:59.610> about

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
knot system as well and it talks about

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.480 
knot system as well and it talks about
the<00:03:00.240> human<00:03:00.990> elemental<00:03:01.560> composition<00:03:02.340> by<00:03:02.459> mass

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
the human elemental composition by mass

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.970 
the human elemental composition by mass
so<00:03:03.030> those<00:03:03.209> are<00:03:03.360> all<00:03:03.510> accurate<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.709> then<00:03:04.860> on

so those are all accurate and then on
the<00:03:05.130> other<00:03:05.160> side<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:06.000> talks<00:03:06.390> about<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
the other side it talks about the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.620 
the other side it talks about the
elemental<00:03:07.350> composition<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.340> universe

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
elemental composition of the universe

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.460 
elemental composition of the universe
along<00:03:09.630> with<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> sketch<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.260> our<00:03:10.350> solar<00:03:10.680> system

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
along with a sketch of our solar system

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.560 
along with a sketch of our solar system
and<00:03:13.470> then<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.709> shoes<00:03:13.890> themselves<00:03:14.550> there<00:03:15.540> is

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
these are so ugly and I agree they're

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.890 
these are so ugly and I agree they're
not<00:03:20.160> for<00:03:20.370> everyone<00:03:20.640> but<00:03:20.970> they<00:03:21.300> just<00:03:21.480> have<00:03:21.630> such

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.250 
cool materials I mean around the toe box
this<00:03:23.820> can<00:03:24.000> be<00:03:24.090> equated<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.630> nubuck<00:03:24.959> just<00:03:25.200> to

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
this can be equated to a nubuck just to

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.810 
this can be equated to a nubuck just to
give<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.470> an<00:03:25.560> idea<00:03:25.680> they've<00:03:26.370> kind<00:03:26.610> of<00:03:26.640> got<00:03:26.790> a
