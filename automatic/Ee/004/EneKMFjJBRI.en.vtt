thing out for this flight because I want

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.700 
thing out for this flight because I want
to<00:00:48.450> keep<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.690> close<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:52.199> binding<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
to keep it close and binding the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.660 
to keep it close and binding the
quadcopter<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:54.260> lift<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.410> off<00:00:55.559> got<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> little

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
quadcopter and lift it off got a little

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.279 
quadcopter and lift it off got a little
bit<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> forward<00:00:57.090> moving<00:00:59.000> no<00:01:00.000> more<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
bit of forward moving no more in a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.799 
bit of forward moving no more in a
little<00:01:01.530> right<00:01:01.770> trim<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.510> should<00:01:03.690> be

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
little right trim and that should be

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.740 
little right trim and that should be
good<00:01:04.489> because<00:01:05.489> their<00:01:05.760> movement<00:01:06.479> now<00:01:06.600> is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
good because their movement now is

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.870 
good because their movement now is
caused<00:01:06.960> by<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.200> breeze<00:01:07.470> okay<00:01:08.369> again<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:08.760> in

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
caused by the breeze okay again I'm in

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.350 
caused by the breeze okay again I'm in
low<00:01:09.799> it<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> pre<00:01:11.790> quadcopter<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
low it is a pre quadcopter this is the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.779

you<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:34.180> got<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.420> little<00:02:34.690> practice<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.260> got<00:02:35.409> a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
you you got a little practice you got a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.020 
you you got a little practice you got a
little<00:02:35.769> better<00:02:35.950> with<00:02:36.099> this<00:02:36.220> quadcopter<00:02:36.580> now

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
little better with this quadcopter now

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.850 
little better with this quadcopter now
you<00:02:37.090> want<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.599> y'all<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.870> little<00:02:38.110> faster<00:02:38.680> and

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
you want it to y'all a little faster and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.500 
you want it to y'all a little faster and
you<00:02:39.340> can<00:02:39.519> do<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.849> by<00:02:40.030> putting<00:02:40.269> an

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
you can do that by putting an

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.479 
you can do that by putting an
intermediate<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.349> you<00:02:42.010> got<00:02:42.129> a<00:02:42.159> little<00:02:42.250> more

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
intermediate and you got a little more

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.890 
intermediate and you got a little more
pitch<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.849> little<00:02:42.970> more<00:02:43.209> speed<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.569> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
pitch a little more speed on the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.770 
pitch a little more speed on the
quadcopter<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.890> intermediate<00:02:45.750> again<00:02:46.750> I

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
quadcopter in intermediate again I

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.360 
quadcopter in intermediate again I
selected<00:02:47.200> intermediate<00:02:47.709> by<00:02:47.860> pressing<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.340> up

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
selected intermediate by pressing the up

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.149 
selected intermediate by pressing the up
left<00:02:48.700> trigger<00:02:48.909> button<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.920> type<00:02:51.129> of

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
left trigger button this is the type of

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.920 
left trigger button this is the type of
funnels<00:02:51.610> you'll<00:02:51.760> be<00:02:51.909> doing<00:02:52.239> as<00:02:52.390> an

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
funnels you'll be doing as an

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:03.319 
funnels you'll be doing as an
intermediate<00:02:53.500> flier<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.440> still<00:02:56.650> can<00:02:56.799> flip

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.180 

okay<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:05.079> can<00:03:05.230> try<00:03:05.440> getting<00:03:05.769> it'll<00:03:05.950> something

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
okay you can try getting it'll something

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.819 
okay you can try getting it'll something
for<00:03:06.370> my<00:03:06.579> bottom<00:03:06.760> hitting<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.180> flip<00:03:07.359> and<00:03:07.390> then

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
for my bottom hitting the flip and then

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.289 
for my bottom hitting the flip and then
pulling<00:03:08.829> back<00:03:09.010> on<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.190> stick<00:03:09.250> get<00:03:10.060> some

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
pulling back on the stick get some

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.210 
pulling back on the stick get some
forward<00:03:10.659> momentum<00:03:10.900> hit<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.620> flip<00:03:11.799> pull

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
forward momentum hit the flip pull

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.630 
forward momentum hit the flip pull
button<00:03:13.049> pull<00:03:14.049> back<00:03:14.260> on<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.530> stick<00:03:17.549> there<00:03:18.549> we

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
button pull back on the stick there we

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.089 
button pull back on the stick there we
go<00:03:18.909> so<00:03:19.180> that's<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.810> way<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:19.989> do<00:03:20.170> move<00:03:20.799> or

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
go so that's the way you do move or

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.479 
go so that's the way you do move or
fourth<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:22.390> gotta<00:03:22.540> let<00:03:22.690> go<00:03:22.810> into<00:03:22.959> stick<00:03:23.230> first

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
fourth you gotta let go into stick first

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.280 
fourth you gotta let go into stick first
get<00:03:24.489> some<00:03:24.670> momentum<00:03:24.879> going<00:03:25.180> like<00:03:26.079> on<00:03:26.230> the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
get some momentum going like on the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.789 
get some momentum going like on the
stick<00:03:26.500> pull<00:03:26.680> back<00:03:27.660> do<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.720> again<00:03:28.840> get<00:03:29.620> some

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
stick pull back do it again get some

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.500 
stick pull back do it again get some
momentum<00:03:29.950> going<00:03:30.340> let<00:03:30.609> go<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.910> stick<00:03:31.120> pull

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
momentum going let go of the stick pull

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.330 
momentum going let go of the stick pull
back<00:03:31.720> let's<00:03:32.590> get<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.799> little<00:03:32.889> more<00:03:33.069> than<00:03:33.220> that

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
back let's get a little more than that

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.199 
back let's get a little more than that
I'm<00:03:33.430> going<00:03:33.720> get<00:03:34.720> some<00:03:34.900> momentum<00:03:34.989> going<00:03:36.209> like

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
I'm going get some momentum going like

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.030 
I'm going get some momentum going like
over<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.450> stick<00:03:37.660> pull<00:03:37.810> back<00:03:40.709> okay<00:03:41.709> let's<00:03:41.859> go

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
over the stick pull back okay let's go

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.289 
over the stick pull back okay let's go
to<00:03:42.099> expert<00:03:43.019> okay<00:03:44.019> now<00:03:44.230> we're<00:03:44.410> an<00:03:44.500> expert<00:03:45.299> this

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
to expert okay now we're an expert this

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.050 
to expert okay now we're an expert this
is<00:03:46.419> the<00:03:46.540> funnels<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:46.989> can<00:03:47.169> do<00:03:47.290> an<00:03:47.410> expert<00:03:51.060> okay

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
is the funnels you can do an expert okay

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.449 
is the funnels you can do an expert okay
you<00:03:52.299> got<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.569> little<00:03:52.810> more<00:03:52.959> yaw<00:03:53.109> rate<00:03:53.379> and<00:03:54.250> more

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
you got a little more yaw rate and more

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.699 
you got a little more yaw rate and more
for<00:03:54.760> momentum<00:03:55.329> it's<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.810> little<00:03:56.079> faster<00:03:56.560> it's

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
for momentum it's a little faster it's

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.740 
for momentum it's a little faster it's
actually<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.069> lot<00:03:57.250> faster<00:03:57.699> now<00:03:57.910> let's<00:03:58.449> get<00:03:58.599> some

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
actually a lot faster now let's get some

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.960 
actually a lot faster now let's get some
forward<00:03:59.019> momentum<00:03:59.139> going<00:03:59.590> again<00:03:59.919> like<00:04:00.819> I'm

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
forward momentum going again like I'm

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.770 
forward momentum going again like I'm
the<00:04:01.060> sick<00:04:01.239> pullback<00:04:02.849> for<00:04:03.849> momentum<00:04:04.419> hit<00:04:04.690> the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
the sick pullback for momentum hit the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.319 
the sick pullback for momentum hit the
spit<00:04:04.989> pullback<00:04:07.349> that's<00:04:08.349> how<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:08.500> do<00:04:08.680> loops

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
spit pullback that's how you do loops

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.080 
spit pullback that's how you do loops
let<00:04:10.329> go<00:04:10.510> pull<00:04:10.930> back

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
let go pull back

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.369 
let go pull back
get<00:04:13.090> some<00:04:13.269> four<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:13.690> then<00:04:13.840> I'm<00:04:13.959> hit<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.169> stick

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
get some four and then I'm hit the stick

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.729 
get some four and then I'm hit the stick
pullback<00:04:14.680> so<00:04:15.870> cool<00:04:16.870> little<00:04:17.079> quirk<00:04:17.349> of<00:04:17.560> your

so<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:06.650> drops<00:05:08.710> okay<00:05:09.740> right<00:05:10.070> it's<00:05:10.310> right<00:05:10.520> at

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639

the<00:05:16.669> battery<00:05:16.970> actually<00:05:17.300> died<00:05:17.539> on<00:05:17.570> that<00:05:18.470> time

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
the battery actually died on that time

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.490 
the battery actually died on that time
but<00:05:20.000> it<00:05:20.120> went<00:05:20.270> up<00:05:20.419> as<00:05:20.570> high<00:05:20.720> as<00:05:20.750> it<00:05:20.990> could<00:05:21.169> there

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
but it went up as high as it could there

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.589 
but it went up as high as it could there
and<00:05:21.740> then<00:05:21.860> just<00:05:21.889> hovered<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:23.180> know<00:05:23.300> right<00:05:23.509> at

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
and then just hovered you know right at

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.420 
and then just hovered you know right at
the<00:05:23.720> edge<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.139> its<00:05:24.320> reception<00:05:24.680> range<00:05:25.039> and<00:05:25.310> then

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
the edge of its reception range and then

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.750 
the edge of its reception range and then
the<00:05:25.520> battery<00:05:25.820> finally<00:05:26.979> went<00:05:27.979> kaput<00:05:28.340> and<00:05:28.400> came

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
the battery finally went kaput and came

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.460 
the battery finally went kaput and came
back<00:05:28.789> down<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.360> ground<00:05:29.449> but<00:05:30.229> it's<00:05:30.320> still

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
back down to the ground but it's still

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.960 
back down to the ground but it's still
in<00:05:30.590> one<00:05:30.650> piece<00:05:30.860> this<00:05:31.130> thing<00:05:31.340> is<00:05:31.460> really<00:05:31.669> tough

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
in one piece this thing is really tough

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.390 
in one piece this thing is really tough
if<00:05:32.240> you<00:05:32.419> looked<00:05:32.659> at<00:05:32.840> if<00:05:33.050> you<00:05:33.199> look<00:05:33.380> at<00:05:33.530> it<00:05:33.710> it's

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
if you looked at if you look at it it's

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.140 
if you looked at if you look at it it's
nice<00:05:34.669> soft<00:05:35.380> flexible<00:05:36.380> plastic<00:05:37.340> it's<00:05:37.820> is

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
nice soft flexible plastic it's is

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.939 
nice soft flexible plastic it's is
really<00:05:38.750> unlikely<00:05:39.080> that<00:05:39.320> this<00:05:39.470> is<00:05:39.590> going<00:05:39.830> to

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
really unlikely that this is going to

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.659 
really unlikely that this is going to
crack<00:05:40.479> and<00:05:41.479> these<00:05:41.810> guards<00:05:42.500> do<00:05:42.770> protect<00:05:43.220> the

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
crack and these guards do protect the

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.610 
crack and these guards do protect the
blades<00:05:43.940> if<00:05:44.180> you<00:05:44.270> look<00:05:44.419> at<00:05:44.570> sideways<00:05:44.930> they<00:05:45.440> do

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
blades if you look at sideways they do

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.020 
blades if you look at sideways they do
provide<00:05:45.800> some<00:05:46.099> good<00:05:46.370> protection<00:05:46.699> in<00:05:46.909> those

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
provide some good protection in those

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.480 
provide some good protection in those
blades<00:05:47.300> so<00:05:48.229> again<00:05:48.620> this<00:05:48.740> is<00:05:48.919> an<00:05:49.070> excellent

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
blades so again this is an excellent

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.370 
blades so again this is an excellent
