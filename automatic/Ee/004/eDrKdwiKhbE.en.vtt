00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.869 
not an echo petals really touching so
you<00:03:55.890> have<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.430> constantly<00:03:56.819> be<00:03:58.730> lifting<00:03:59.730> your

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
you have to constantly be lifting your

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.559 
you have to constantly be lifting your
foot<00:04:00.150> in<00:04:00.420> my<00:04:00.450> ear<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:02.250> exhaust

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:20.000 

but<00:04:05.170> you<00:04:05.319> know<00:04:05.439> I<00:04:05.469> just<00:04:05.530> got<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.069> car<00:04:06.310> so

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.730 

that's<00:04:20.640> why<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:20.880> always<00:04:21.870> Drive<00:04:22.110> the<00:04:22.260> Eco<00:04:22.530> mode

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
that's why I always Drive the Eco mode

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.820 
that's why I always Drive the Eco mode
because<00:04:23.160> it's<00:04:23.340> easier

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.900 

consumer<00:04:29.580> coasting

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.710 

a<00:04:35.930> little<00:04:36.930> bit<00:04:37.080> less<00:04:37.380> realistic<00:04:37.770> because<00:04:38.720> if

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
a little bit less realistic because if

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.800 
a little bit less realistic because if
the<00:04:40.050> region

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
the region

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.640 
the region
higher<00:04:41.520> let's<00:04:42.520> see<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:43.389> all<00:04:44.080> it<00:04:44.260> does<00:04:44.470> is

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
higher let's see it all it does is

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.659 
higher let's see it all it does is
increase<00:04:44.889> scales<00:04:45.490> with<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.270> travel<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:48.460> if<00:04:48.580> I

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
increase scales with the travel so if I

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.680 
increase scales with the travel so if I
Florida<00:04:49.210> eco-mode<00:04:49.810> it's<00:04:50.230> like<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.650> Florida

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
Florida eco-mode it's like a Florida

00:04:51.690 --> 00:05:00.240 
Florida eco-mode it's like a Florida
still<00:04:52.690> have<00:04:52.840> all<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.110> power

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.210 

so

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:16.890 

yeah<00:05:05.760> I<00:05:05.790> mean<00:05:06.150> either<00:05:06.270> Delta

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.650 

let's<00:05:17.440> eat<00:05:17.680> the<00:05:17.830> trumpets<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:19.030> second<00:05:19.480> that's

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
let's eat the trumpets the second that's

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.700 
let's eat the trumpets the second that's
it

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.140 

I<00:05:22.770> mean<00:05:23.340> if<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:23.610> get<00:05:23.730> discards

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
I mean if you get discards

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.450 
I mean if you get discards
gonna<00:05:25.270> be<00:05:25.420> hard<00:05:25.770> it's<00:05:26.770> gonna<00:05:26.920> be<00:05:27.010> hard<00:05:27.130> to<00:05:27.370> have

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
gonna be hard it's gonna be hard to have

00:05:27.460 --> 00:06:00.480 
gonna be hard it's gonna be hard to have
two<00:05:27.640> corners<00:05:27.940> yeah

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.910

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.309 

it<00:06:06.920> looks<00:06:07.130> like<00:06:07.250> it's<00:06:07.460> just

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.990
