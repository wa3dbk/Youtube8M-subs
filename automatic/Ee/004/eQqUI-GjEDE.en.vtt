I've cut up three of these paddles now a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.110 
I've cut up three of these paddles now a
lot<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.500> people<00:02:00.830> do<00:02:00.980> a<00:02:01.160> journalist<00:02:01.670> huh<00:02:01.820> skirt

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
with only two panels of fabric but I

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.820 
with only two panels of fabric but I
find<00:02:06.050> that<00:02:06.610> three<00:02:07.610> pounds<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.060> fabric<00:02:08.450> looks

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
find that three pounds of fabric looks

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.250 
find that three pounds of fabric looks
infinitely<00:02:09.830> better<00:02:09.979> it's<00:02:10.310> like<00:02:10.490> that<00:02:11.260> secret

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
infinitely better it's like that secret

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.080 
infinitely better it's like that secret
ingredient<00:02:12.740> on<00:02:12.830> us<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.220> one<00:02:13.400> thing<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.640> you

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
ingredient on us that one thing that you

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.590 
ingredient on us that one thing that you
know<00:02:14.290> it's<00:02:15.290> there<00:02:15.710> but<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:17.210> don't<00:02:17.420> really

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
know it's there but you don't really

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.630 
know it's there but you don't really
notice<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:18.470> not<00:02:18.560> really<00:02:18.770> obvious<00:02:19.070> but<00:02:19.520> it

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
notice it it's not really obvious but it

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.550 
notice it it's not really obvious but it
just<00:02:19.820> makes<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:20.570> much<00:02:20.630> better<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.350> long

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
just makes it so much better in the long

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.320 
just makes it so much better in the long
run<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.490> I've<00:02:22.730> cut<00:02:22.910> out<00:02:22.940> three<00:02:23.210> of<00:02:23.270> these

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
run so I've cut out three of these

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.760 
run so I've cut out three of these
panels<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.810> fabric<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.260> I'm<00:02:24.380> just<00:02:24.500> going<00:02:24.650> to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
panels of fabric and I'm just going to

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.430 
panels of fabric and I'm just going to
sew<00:02:24.920> them<00:02:25.070> together<00:02:25.190> into<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.880> loop<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:30.140> this<00:02:30.260> is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
sew them together into a loop so this is

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.460 
sew them together into a loop so this is
what<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.680> looks<00:02:30.920> like<00:02:31.390> as<00:02:32.390> always<00:02:32.870> I've<00:02:33.110> left

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
what this looks like as always I've left

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.860 
what this looks like as always I've left
kind<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.070> a<00:02:34.160> gap<00:02:34.370> at<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.970> top<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.510> one<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
kind of a gap at the top of one of the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.540 
kind of a gap at the top of one of the
scenes<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.920> put<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.310> zipper<00:02:37.400> into<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:39.550> then

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
scenes to put a zipper into and then

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.880 
scenes to put a zipper into and then
it's<00:02:40.700> sewn<00:02:40.940> in<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.150> zipper<00:02:41.470> now<00:02:42.470> I've<00:02:42.770> been

stitches the more rows of stitches you

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.300 
stitches the more rows of stitches you
do<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.180> more<00:04:41.360> evenly<00:04:41.900> gathering<00:04:42.530> will<00:04:42.710> be<00:04:42.890> if

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
do the more evenly gathering will be if

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.670 
do the more evenly gathering will be if
you<00:04:43.460> just<00:04:43.490> do<00:04:43.880> one<00:04:44.540> row<00:04:44.810> will<00:04:45.020> happen<00:04:45.440> it'll

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
you just do one row will happen it'll

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.620 
locate the ends of the thread and you're
gonna<00:04:57.710> choose<00:04:58.010> either<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.520> top<00:04:58.790> threads<00:04:59.270> or

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
gonna choose either the top threads or

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.620 
gonna choose either the top threads or
the<00:05:00.080> bottom<00:05:00.440> threads<00:05:00.770> don't<00:05:01.340> take<00:05:01.940> both<00:05:02.330> if

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
the bottom threads don't take both if

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.720 
the bottom threads don't take both if
you<00:05:03.080> take<00:05:03.320> both<00:05:03.560> sides<00:05:03.919> of<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.280> thread<00:05:04.550> and

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
you take both sides of the thread and

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.310 
you take both sides of the thread and
pull<00:05:05.030> you're<00:05:05.300> just<00:05:05.450> basically<00:05:05.840> going<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.140> tie

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.100 
you have to cut out a strip of fabric to
become<00:05:24.380> your<00:05:24.590> waistband<00:05:25.160> the<00:05:26.150> width<00:05:26.450> should

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
become your waistband the width should

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.350 
become your waistband the width should
be<00:05:27.320> two<00:05:27.860> times<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.580> desired<00:05:28.880> width<00:05:29.090> of<00:05:29.270> the

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
be two times the desired width of the

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.840 
be two times the desired width of the
finished<00:05:29.690> waistband<00:05:30.200> plus<00:05:30.979> seam<00:05:31.310> allowances

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
finished waistband plus seam allowances

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.610 
finished waistband plus seam allowances
so<00:05:32.030> they'll<00:05:32.180> probably<00:05:32.570> end<00:05:32.930> up<00:05:33.140> being<00:05:33.410> about

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
so they'll probably end up being about

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.640 
so they'll probably end up being about
three<00:05:34.040> four<00:05:34.250> five<00:05:34.460> inches<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:36.020> then<00:05:36.470> the

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
three four five inches and then the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.980 
three four five inches and then the
length<00:05:36.890> needs<00:05:37.340> to<00:05:37.460> be<00:05:37.610> at<00:05:38.330> least<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.780> length

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
length needs to be at least the length

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.230 
length needs to be at least the length
of<00:05:39.140> your<00:05:39.260> waist<00:05:39.320> plus<00:05:40.280> several<00:05:40.880> inches<00:05:41.060> of

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.279 
of your waist plus several inches of
overlap<00:05:41.840> and<00:05:42.770> then<00:05:42.979> I

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
overlap and then I

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.999 
overlap and then I

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
a little bit of interfacing and I've

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.909 
a little bit of interfacing and I've
marked<00:05:47.460> off<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:48.089> exact<00:05:48.960> length<00:05:49.469> of<00:05:49.680> my<00:05:49.889> waist

try<00:06:07.080> to<00:06:07.139> ensure<00:06:07.439> that<00:06:07.919> all<00:06:08.159> the<00:06:08.309> gathers<00:06:08.699> are

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
try to ensure that all the gathers are

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.059 
try to ensure that all the gathers are
fairly<00:06:09.479> evenly<00:06:09.869> distributed<00:06:10.649> along<00:06:11.009> the

fairly evenly distributed along the

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
waistband and then just sew and then

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.689 
waistband and then just sew and then
just<00:06:19.259> trim<00:06:19.589> off<00:06:19.649> the<00:06:20.009> extra<00:06:20.399> waistband<00:06:21.180> about

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699 
just trim off the extra waistband about

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:28.939 
just trim off the extra waistband about
half<00:06:23.699> an<00:06:23.909> inch<00:06:24.029> out<00:06:27.199> and<00:06:28.199> on<00:06:28.349> the<00:06:28.439> other<00:06:28.589> side

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
half an inch out and on the other side

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:30.529 
half an inch out and on the other side
though<00:06:29.159> you'll<00:06:29.369> do<00:06:29.490> it<00:06:29.610> about<00:06:29.789> two<00:06:30.089> inches<00:06:30.389> out

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
though you'll do it about two inches out

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.449 
though you'll do it about two inches out
because<00:06:30.779> you<00:06:30.959> have<00:06:31.110> a<00:06:31.139> bit<00:06:31.409> of<00:06:31.439> a<00:06:31.680> flop<00:06:32.219> that

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:32.459 
because you have a bit of a flop that

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:37.149 
because you have a bit of a flop that
overlaps<00:06:34.459> so<00:06:35.459> like<00:06:35.639> that<00:06:35.789> and<00:06:36.599> like<00:06:36.749> that<00:06:36.779> and

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:37.159 
overlaps so like that and like that and

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:40.209 
overlaps so like that and like that and
then<00:06:38.159> you<00:06:38.279> turn<00:06:38.639> it<00:06:38.669> to<00:06:38.879> that<00:06:39.240> it's<00:06:39.360> facing

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:40.219 
then you turn it to that it's facing

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:44.480 
then you turn it to that it's facing
right<00:06:41.219> sides<00:06:41.669> together<00:06:42.479> and<00:06:43.229> then<00:06:44.069> you're<00:06:44.249> so

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
right sides together and then you're so

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.609 
right sides together and then you're so
up<00:06:44.669> here<00:06:44.879> to<00:06:44.999> close<00:06:45.180> the<00:06:45.419> end<00:06:45.539> and<00:06:46.169> then<00:06:46.439> just

00:06:46.609 --> 00:06:46.619 
up here to close the end and then just

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:49.459 
up here to close the end and then just
kind<00:06:46.860> of<00:06:46.949> fold<00:06:47.189> everything<00:06:47.699> in<00:06:47.909> and<00:06:48.469> top

kind of fold everything in and top

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:54.469 
kind of fold everything in and top
stitch<00:06:51.800> and<00:06:52.800> this<00:06:53.490> is<00:06:53.669> what<00:06:53.879> you<00:06:53.999> should<00:06:54.059> end
