00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.540 
going in a similar fashion to black ops
1<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> lot<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> people<00:00:53.219> thought

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
1 and you know a lot of people thought

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.459 
1 and you know a lot of people thought
that<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.879> next<00:00:54.449> map<00:00:54.629> was<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.079> some

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
that the next map was going to be some

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.279 
that the next map was going to be some
kind<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.800> mythological<00:00:56.190> location<00:00:57.149> now<00:00:57.780> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
kind of mythological location now this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.170 
kind of mythological location now this
must<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.710> follow<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.219> shangri-la

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
must be a follow up to shangri-la

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.510 
must be a follow up to shangri-la
because<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> Garza<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:01.890> had<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> storyline

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
because a Garza you know had a storyline

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.359 
because a Garza you know had a storyline
in<00:01:02.969> shangri-la<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.989> from<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.010> I'm<00:01:05.129> saying

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I mean it just came out and when the mob

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.170 
I mean it just came out and when the mob
of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> dead<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:28.320> image<00:01:29.220> came<00:01:29.430> out<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.790> at

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
of the dead you know image came out I at

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.910 
of the dead you know image came out I at
first<00:01:30.390> thought<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:30.960> fake<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.229> then<00:01:31.650> I

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
first thought it was fake and then I

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.480 
first thought it was fake and then I
came<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.759> realize<00:01:32.970> later<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:35.040> was

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
came to realize later on that it was

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.700 
came to realize later on that it was
apparently<00:01:36.060> real<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:37.229> turned<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.590> who

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
apparently real and it turned out who

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.999 
apparently real and it turned out who
was<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.119> know<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.540> any<00:01:40.170> case<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.799> could

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
was so you know in any case this could

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.950 
was so you know in any case this could
