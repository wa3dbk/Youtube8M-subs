00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
think today I'm going to use Crayola

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.610 
think today I'm going to use Crayola
crayons<00:00:44.909> they<00:00:45.909> are<00:00:46.360> made<00:00:46.839> with<00:00:47.019> paraffin<00:00:47.379> wax

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
crayons they are made with paraffin wax

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.240 
crayons they are made with paraffin wax
and<00:00:47.980> non-toxic<00:00:48.640> pigments<00:00:49.390> so<00:00:49.930> you<00:00:50.890> can<00:00:51.070> feel

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
and non-toxic pigments so you can feel

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.740 
and non-toxic pigments so you can feel
free<00:00:51.519> to<00:00:51.580> use<00:00:51.790> them<00:00:51.940> all<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.089> time<00:00:52.360> you<00:00:52.659> don't

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
free to use them all the time you don't

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.420 
free to use them all the time you don't
have<00:00:52.839> to<00:00:52.960> worry<00:00:53.229> because<00:00:53.559> they<00:00:53.830> are<00:00:54.070> for

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
have to worry because they are for

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.310 
have to worry because they are for
children<00:00:54.879> and<00:00:55.089> for<00:00:55.360> children<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.780> handle<00:00:56.080> so

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
children and for children to handle so

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.530 
children and for children to handle so
they're<00:00:56.920> not<00:00:57.100> going<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:57.339> be<00:00:57.400> bad<00:00:57.580> I<00:00:57.879> find<00:00:58.390> that

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
they're not going to be bad I find that

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.630 
they're not going to be bad I find that
the<00:00:58.839> Crayola<00:00:59.199> works<00:00:59.619> a<00:00:59.769> lot<00:00:59.890> better<00:01:00.100> than<00:01:00.189> some

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
the Crayola works a lot better than some

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.350 
the Crayola works a lot better than some
of<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:00.939> other<00:01:01.170> crayons<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.589> I've<00:01:02.979> used

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
of the other crayons that I've used

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.090 
of the other crayons that I've used
I<00:01:04.390> wouldn't<00:01:04.900> recommend<00:01:04.989> picking<00:01:05.560> any<00:01:05.680> up<00:01:05.860> from

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
I wouldn't recommend picking any up from

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.469 
I wouldn't recommend picking any up from
the<00:01:06.220> dollar<00:01:06.400> store<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:06.729> know<00:01:06.880> it<00:01:07.150> saves<00:01:07.360> you

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
the dollar store I know it saves you

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.810 
the dollar store I know it saves you
money<00:01:07.659> but<00:01:07.960> if<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:08.920> might<00:01:09.130> as<00:01:09.280> well<00:01:09.400> just<00:01:09.640> pick

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
money but if you might as well just pick

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.899 
money but if you might as well just pick
up<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.180> four<00:01:10.420> dollar<00:01:11.310> Crayola<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:12.549> just<00:01:12.729> lasts

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
up the four dollar Crayola it just lasts

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.880 
up the four dollar Crayola it just lasts
a<00:01:13.030> lot<00:01:13.119> longer<00:01:13.180> in<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.630> colors<00:01:13.960> tend<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.680> stand

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
a lot longer in the colors tend to stand

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.469 
a lot longer in the colors tend to stand
out<00:01:15.040> a<00:01:15.070> little<00:01:15.369> bit<00:01:15.549> more<00:01:15.729> so<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.240> would

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
out a little bit more so I would

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.450 
out a little bit more so I would
definitely<00:01:16.630> recommend<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:17.530> so<00:01:17.920> if<00:01:18.159> you<00:01:18.280> want

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
definitely recommend that so if you want

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.069 
definitely recommend that so if you want
to<00:01:18.520> learn<00:01:18.640> how<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.759> do<00:01:18.939> that<00:01:19.090> just<00:01:19.570> keep

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
to learn how to do that just keep

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.499 
to learn how to do that just keep
watching<00:01:20.579> the<00:01:21.579> first<00:01:21.820> product<00:01:22.149> that<00:01:22.179> you<00:01:22.329> need

product I also found at the natural food

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.169 
product I also found at the natural food
store<00:01:28.840> it's<00:01:29.380> shea<00:01:29.829> butter<00:01:30.100> this<00:01:30.880> particular

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
store it's shea butter this particular

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.669 
store it's shea butter this particular
one<00:01:31.479> actually<00:01:31.659> has<00:01:31.960> cocoa<00:01:32.259> butter<00:01:32.439> in<00:01:32.590> it

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
one actually has cocoa butter in it

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.340 
one actually has cocoa butter in it
because<00:01:33.069> I<00:01:33.369> find<00:01:33.909> that<00:01:34.119> shea<00:01:34.539> butter<00:01:34.780> doesn't

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
because I find that shea butter doesn't

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.770 
because I find that shea butter doesn't
really<00:01:35.499> smell<00:01:35.619> that<00:01:36.219> good<00:01:36.539> if<00:01:37.539> you're<00:01:37.719> going

really smell that good if you're going

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.359 
really smell that good if you're going

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
to use natural shea butter then I would

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.130 
to use natural shea butter then I would
recommend<00:01:39.490> using<00:01:39.999> a<00:01:40.299> food<00:01:40.539> grade<00:01:40.780> essential

recommend using a food grade essential

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.219 
recommend using a food grade essential

your bowl right on top and your double

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.800 
your bowl right on top and your double
boiler<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:59.230> complete<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.670> can<00:03:00.700> use<00:03:01.180> any<00:03:01.480> type

of bowl for your double boiler the

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.220 
of bowl for your double boiler the
reason<00:03:03.849> why<00:03:03.939> I'm<00:03:04.090> using<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.450> metal<00:03:04.659> bowl<00:03:04.959> is

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
reason why I'm using a metal bowl is

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.690 
reason why I'm using a metal bowl is
because<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.620> does<00:03:05.769> conduct<00:03:06.099> heat<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.519> lot

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
because it does conduct heat a lot
