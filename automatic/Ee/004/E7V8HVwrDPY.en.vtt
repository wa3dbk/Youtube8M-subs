you're<00:01:05.189> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.180> very

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you're going to see that it's a very

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.420 
you're going to see that it's a very
much<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.930> metallic<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.619> pearl<00:01:07.890> gray<00:01:08.159> which<00:01:08.340> I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
much a metallic or pearl gray which I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.710 
much a metallic or pearl gray which I
like<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.760> really<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> battleship

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
like it's really it's not a battleship

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.390 
like it's really it's not a battleship
gray<00:01:09.990> its<00:01:10.140> core<00:01:10.350> more<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.650> gun<00:01:10.920> metal<00:01:11.220> gray

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
gray its core more of a gun metal gray

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.190 
gray its core more of a gun metal gray
and<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.270> sweeping<00:01:12.780> areas

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
and then you have these sweeping areas

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
and then you have these sweeping areas
that<00:01:13.320> are<00:01:13.409> really<00:01:13.650> an<00:01:13.770> abstract<00:01:14.520> kind<00:01:14.790> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that are really an abstract kind of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.700 
that are really an abstract kind of
concentric<00:01:15.930> circles<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.500> they're<00:01:16.680> very

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
concentric circles but they're very

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.310 
concentric circles but they're very
jagged<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.759> see<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.090> gloss<00:01:18.720> black<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
jagged if you can see of gloss black and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.530 
jagged if you can see of gloss black and
gloss<00:01:19.680> over<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.400> really<00:01:20.549> tonal<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.150> like

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
gloss over it's really tonal I like

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
gloss over it's really tonal I like
anything<00:01:21.720> that's<00:01:21.960> tonal<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.560> me<00:01:22.710> tonal<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.310> one

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
anything that's tonal to me tonal is one

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.880 
anything that's tonal to me tonal is one
of<00:01:23.790> those<00:01:23.880> looks<00:01:24.659> very<00:01:24.960> fast<00:01:25.380> depending<00:01:25.799> on

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
of those looks very fast depending on

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.260 
of those looks very fast depending on
the<00:01:25.950> graphic<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.820> classic

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the graphic but it's going to be classic

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.450
