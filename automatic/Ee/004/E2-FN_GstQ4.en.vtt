a<00:01:51.360> Rotter<00:01:51.630> whichever<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.259> want<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.440> call<00:01:52.500> that

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
a Rotter whichever you want to call that

a Rotter whichever you want to call that
I<00:01:53.160> actually<00:01:53.369> get<00:01:53.670> into<00:01:53.850> my<00:01:53.970> next<00:01:54.240> question<00:01:55.130> but

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
I actually get into my next question but

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.060 
I actually get into my next question but
basically<00:01:57.090> what<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.450> does<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:58.050> if<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> stops<00:01:58.860> at

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
basically what it does is if it stops at

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.919 
basically what it does is if it stops at
fifty<00:01:59.369> percent<00:01:59.759> what's<00:02:00.149> your<00:02:00.600> drive<00:02:00.899> is

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
fifty percent what's your drive is

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.469 
fifty percent what's your drive is
failing<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.070> whether<00:02:02.789> it<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.179> under

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
failing to do whether it be under

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.779 
failing to do whether it be under
computer<00:02:04.050> or<00:02:04.289> your<00:02:04.590> Xbox<00:02:05.069> it's<00:02:05.280> failing<00:02:05.520> to

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
computer or your Xbox it's failing to

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.770 
computer or your Xbox it's failing to
read<00:02:06.210> or<00:02:07.020> rot<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:08.160> second<00:02:09.060> layer<00:02:09.330> because

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
read or rot the second layer because

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.120 
read or rot the second layer because
what<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> dual<00:02:10.170> layer<00:02:10.200> does<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.829> it<00:02:10.979> goes

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
what a dual layer does is it goes

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.699 
what a dual layer does is it goes
through<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.579> disc<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.120> installs<00:02:13.079> the<00:02:13.470> first

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
through the disc and installs the first

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.650 
through the disc and installs the first
layer<00:02:13.920> which<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.190> one<00:02:14.640> through<00:02:14.940> fifty<00:02:15.299> percent

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
layer which is one through fifty percent

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.539 
layer which is one through fifty percent
and<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:15.989> second<00:02:16.860> layer<00:02:16.980> which<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.160> fifty

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
and the second layer which is fifty

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.460 
and the second layer which is fifty
percent<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> hundred<00:02:18.450> percent<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:19.260> when<00:02:19.380> it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
percent to a hundred percent so when it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.410 
percent to a hundred percent so when it
tries<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.680> rot<00:02:20.040> over<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.670> if<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.940> don't<00:02:21.180> have<00:02:21.390> a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
tries to rot over it if you don't have a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.410 
tries to rot over it if you don't have a
DVD<00:02:21.989> burner<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.370> actually<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.120> dual<00:02:24.390> layer

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
DVD burner that is actually a dual layer

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.930 
DVD burner that is actually a dual layer
then<00:02:25.049> you<00:02:25.200> will<00:02:25.410> get<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.650> air<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:26.820> you're

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
whenever you stealth patch it the second

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.270 
whenever you stealth patch it the second
time<00:03:43.180> it's<00:03:43.870> not<00:03:44.080> needed<00:03:44.409> really<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.069> stealth

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
time it's not needed really to stealth

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.559 
time it's not needed really to stealth
patch<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.730> first<00:03:45.970> time<00:03:46.060> I'll<00:03:46.330> just<00:03:46.420> do

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569

that to stealth patch stealth patch the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.610 
that to stealth patch stealth patch the
original<00:03:49.480> ah<00:03:49.540> so<00:03:49.780> then<00:03:49.959> I<00:03:50.080> stealth<00:03:50.379> patch

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
original ah so then I stealth patch

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.039 
original ah so then I stealth patch
again<00:03:50.860> after<00:03:51.340> I'm<00:03:51.459> on<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.849> after<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.810> put<00:03:53.019> the

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
again after I'm on it after you put the

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.630 
again after I'm on it after you put the
files<00:03:53.349> in<00:03:53.739> using<00:03:54.250> W<00:03:54.670> X<00:03:54.849> 360<00:03:55.660> or<00:03:55.900> whatever

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
files in using W X 360 or whatever

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.670 
files in using W X 360 or whatever
program<00:03:57.640> you're<00:03:57.760> using<00:03:57.819> you<00:03:58.750> are<00:03:59.049> going<00:03:59.530> to

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
program you're using you are going to

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.410 
program you're using you are going to
get<00:03:59.890> a<00:04:00.129> red<00:04:00.610> text<00:04:01.150> in<00:04:01.629> your<00:04:02.790> image<00:04:03.790> but<00:04:04.120> I<00:04:04.150> think

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
get a red text in your image but I think

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.830 
get a red text in your image but I think
it<00:04:04.510> says<00:04:04.739> CNI<00:04:05.739> image<00:04:05.980> from<00:04:06.069> a<00:04:06.220> B<00:04:06.280> abgx<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.329> says

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
it says CNI image from a B abgx it says

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.140 
it says CNI image from a B abgx it says
like<00:04:08.019> crcs<00:04:08.650> did<00:04:08.860> not<00:04:09.010> match<00:04:09.190> that<00:04:09.549> means<00:04:09.760> the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
like crcs did not match that means the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.569 
like crcs did not match that means the
files<00:04:10.420> were<00:04:10.840> mounted<00:04:11.260> correctly<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:12.129> then

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
files were mounted correctly and then

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.119 
files were mounted correctly and then
you're<00:04:12.700> ready<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.970> go<00:04:13.650> addressing<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.739> next

it in the disk drive and play it I mean
that's<00:04:35.500> pretty<00:04:35.889> much<00:04:36.070> what<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.280> flashed<00:04:36.580> xbox

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
that's pretty much what a flashed xbox

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.020 
that's pretty much what a flashed xbox
is<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.539> lets<00:04:37.720> you<00:04:37.900> run<00:04:38.740> burnt<00:04:39.100> iso<00:04:39.639> discs<00:04:39.940> which

is it lets you run burnt iso discs which
I<00:04:40.120> don't<00:04:40.180> do<00:04:40.780> not<00:04:40.930> recommend<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:42.250> band<00:04:42.520> right

I don't do not recommend the band right
on<00:04:42.849> those<00:04:43.000> are<00:04:43.150> pretty<00:04:43.330> hot<00:04:43.630> if<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.200> don't

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
on those are pretty hot if you don't

on those are pretty hot if you don't
keep<00:04:44.500> up<00:04:44.680> with<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.919> firmware<00:04:45.310> updates<00:04:45.700> the

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
keep up with the firmware updates the

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.210 
keep up with the firmware updates the
second<00:04:47.229> technique<00:04:47.410> of<00:04:47.740> course<00:04:47.919> is<00:04:48.039> ha

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
second technique of course is ha

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.159 
second technique of course is ha
swapping<00:04:48.729> which<00:04:48.970> is<00:04:49.240> opening<00:04:50.020> your<00:04:50.110> Xbox

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
swapping which is opening your Xbox

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.950 
swapping which is opening your Xbox
opening<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.250> disc<00:04:51.430> drive<00:04:51.669> pulling<00:04:52.660> disc<00:04:52.810> out

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
opening the disc drive pulling disc out

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.510 
opening the disc drive pulling disc out
put<00:04:53.229> your<00:04:53.260> modeling<00:04:53.680> in<00:04:53.800> installing<00:04:54.250> it

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
put your modeling in installing it

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.460 
put your modeling in installing it
starting<00:04:54.910> up<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.060> regular<00:04:55.389> game<00:04:55.570> and<00:04:55.900> your

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
starting up the regular game and your

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.440 
starting up the regular game and your
mods<00:04:56.680> are<00:04:56.860> there<00:04:57.039> which<00:04:57.760> is<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:58.000> technique<00:04:58.300> I

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
mods are there which is the technique I

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.779 
mods are there which is the technique I
use<00:04:58.720> because<00:04:59.590> it's<00:04:59.889> more<00:05:00.099> simple<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.669> you

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
use because it's more simple and you

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.150 
use because it's more simple and you
have<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.150> buy<00:05:01.240> a<00:05:01.270> probe<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:02.080> SATA<00:05:02.500> cables<00:05:02.979> and

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
have to buy a probe and SATA cables and

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.469 
have to buy a probe and SATA cables and
things<00:05:03.310> like<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.490> to<00:05:03.639> actually<00:05:03.849> flash<00:05:04.240> or

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
things like that to actually flash or

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.140 
things like that to actually flash or
dvd<00:05:04.780> drop<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:06.310> third<00:05:06.490> way<00:05:06.669> of<00:05:06.789> course<00:05:06.940> is

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
dvd drop and the third way of course is

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.930 
dvd drop and the third way of course is
a<00:05:07.180> jtag<00:05:07.690> now<00:05:07.900> jtags<00:05:08.440> are<00:05:08.740> currently<00:05:09.099> offline

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
a jtag now jtags are currently offline

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.790 
a jtag now jtags are currently offline
mostly<00:05:10.660> I'm<00:05:10.870> there<00:05:11.169> I<00:05:11.200> think<00:05:11.530> there<00:05:11.680> is<00:05:11.770> a

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
mostly I'm there I think there is a

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.339 
mostly I'm there I think there is a
technique<00:05:12.160> to<00:05:12.340> get<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:12.639> back<00:05:12.880> online<00:05:13.210> but<00:05:14.169> that

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
technique to get it back online but that

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:15.879 
technique to get it back online but that
has<00:05:14.440> not<00:05:14.560> been<00:05:14.620> released<00:05:14.889> but

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
has not been released but

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.879 
has not been released but
is<00:05:16.009> same<00:05:16.460> thing<00:05:16.759> only<00:05:17.539> you<00:05:17.900> can<00:05:18.199> you<00:05:18.319> only<00:05:18.560> use

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
is same thing only you can you only use
