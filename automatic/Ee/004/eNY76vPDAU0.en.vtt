00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.070
 British scientists conducted research and 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.119
 more relevant, moreover, they continue 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.090
 develop and produce new models 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.730
 Today our review we will talk to mp3 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.130

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 with a nice gloss and metal 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.489
 frame around the body which is not only 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.860
 adorns the player but also performs protective 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.079
 function naturally on glossy 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.690
 surfaces are noticeable fingerprints 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.170
 assembly is good when you press nothing 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.079
 crunches 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.420

 which does not request individual 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.480
 apartments 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.780
 the hardware of the device is unpretentious and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.940
 Headphones are charging from us full time 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.800
 charging about 3 hours work time 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.470
 approximately 11 hours in mode

 music playback do not know about you 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.930
 but I have enough on the bottom 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.810
 three and a half millimeter connector parts 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.180

 all connectors are turned nice to see 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.070

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.900
 there is a microphone hole on the back 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.909
 player side is conditional 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.240
 designation of all holes on the ending 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.610
 which makes life easier for the user and immediately 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.140
 I want to say a special thank you 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.130
 manufacturer for lack of sensory 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.890
 the buttons of temptation was great but cost under 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.140
 the screen are two thin buttons one 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.439
 responsible for playing pause and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.799
 shutdown 2 to confirm the action 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.700
 you for the extra menu below

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.700
 which menu item are you on the left 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.040
 the end of the power switch that is 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 this function was duplicated was hard 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.119
 get used to the idea that he is not 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.540
 responsible for locking the buttons usually 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.090
 similar levers exactly 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.000
 this makes the buttons nice and smooth 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.320
 diagonal display stroke 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.970

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.130
 video formats but as far as I need 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.320
 I can only evaluate subjectively as I 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.720
 it seems watching a movie on this except 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.190
 like torture can be saved here 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.080
 some rollers for fun but no more 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.700
 menu and weiss simple and easy 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.900
 Immediately clear that where is t-479 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.530

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.500

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.709
 while playing audio on screen 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.470

 built-in radio finds 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.160
 most stations of the range which 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.220
 you can save player memory quality 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.090
 texet t-479 sound is on high 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.890
 level 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.989

 playoff x 3d bass boost sounds 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.940
 Separately worth noting useful

 voice recorder application that records 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.010

 which serves as a supplement 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.780
 texet t-479 is a great solution. 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.700
