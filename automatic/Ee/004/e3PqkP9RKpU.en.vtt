annoying
around<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.830> now<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.130> air<00:04:24.310> paths<00:04:24.580> themselves

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
around you now the air paths themselves

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.670 
around you now the air paths themselves
are<00:04:25.360> actually<00:04:25.420> made<00:04:25.810> from<00:04:25.990> really<00:04:26.320> thick

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
are actually made from really thick

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.130 
are actually made from really thick
leather<00:04:27.190> at<00:04:27.430> down<00:04:27.670> dual-layer<00:04:28.360> memory<00:04:28.900> foam

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
leather at down dual-layer memory foam

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.270 
leather at down dual-layer memory foam
so<00:04:29.380> they're<00:04:29.560> going<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.770> be<00:04:29.860> really

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
excited and then the microphone will

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.530 
excited and then the microphone will
pick<00:05:47.200> that<00:05:47.710> up<00:05:47.770> so<00:05:48.160> down<00:05:48.790> half<00:05:49.030> an<00:05:49.210> inch<00:05:49.360> and

out half inch at least that is what

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.800 
out half inch at least that is what
works<00:05:52.510> best<00:05:52.810> for<00:05:53.020> me<00:05:53.290> these<00:05:53.920> boom<00:05:54.190> microphones
