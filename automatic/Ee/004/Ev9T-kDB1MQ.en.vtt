easy<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.350> me<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.530> say<00:01:43.829> after

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
easy for me to say after

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.910 
easy for me to say after
but<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.910> thought<00:01:45.120> they<00:01:45.410> they<00:01:46.410> went<00:01:46.530> about<00:01:46.740> their

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
but I thought they they went about their

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.060 
but I thought they they went about their
jobs<00:01:47.220> well<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:47.640> made<00:01:47.910> it<00:01:48.030> difficult<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.480> us<00:01:49.070> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
jobs well I made it difficult for us and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.010 
jobs well I made it difficult for us and
when<00:01:50.190> it<00:01:50.310> sets<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> be

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
when it sets it up but we have to be

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.750
