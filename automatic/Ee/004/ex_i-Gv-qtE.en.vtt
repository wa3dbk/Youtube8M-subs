HTC HD seems to be a quite capable video

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.869 
HTC HD seems to be a quite capable video
long<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.980> don't<00:00:41.129> mind<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.489> bit<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
long as you don't mind a little bit of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.650 
long as you don't mind a little bit of
shaking<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.870> here's<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.980> 17<00:00:44.489> what<00:00:45.329> some

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
shaking so here's the 17 what some

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.360 
shaking so here's the 17 what some
people<00:00:45.780> don't<00:00:45.960> realize<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.590> really<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.129> not

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
people don't realize is really it's not

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.279 
people don't realize is really it's not
as<00:00:47.670> big<00:00:48.000> as<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> think<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.719> might<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:49.140> be

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
as big as you think it might really be

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.529 
as big as you think it might really be
to<00:00:49.829> kind<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.039> put<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.340> perspective<00:00:50.539> here's

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to kind of put it in perspective here's

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.650 
to kind of put it in perspective here's
a<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> gust<00:00:52.590> spray<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.489> top<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.510> you

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
a can of the gust spray on top of it you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.750 
a can of the gust spray on top of it you
can<00:00:54.690> tell<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.489> much

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
can tell it's really not that much

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.880 
can tell it's really not that much
bigger<00:00:57.920> than<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.160> 15<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.559> you're<00:01:01.710> really

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
bigger than the 15 so if you're really

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.410 
bigger than the 15 so if you're really
worried<00:01:02.190> about<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.460> size<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.059> weight<00:01:03.270> of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
worried about the size or the weight of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.509 
worried about the size or the weight of
the<00:01:03.480> thing<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.930> light<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.860> not<00:01:05.070> heavy

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the thing it's light it's it's not heavy

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.460 
the thing it's light it's it's not heavy
if<00:01:05.760> you've<00:01:05.970> been<00:01:06.180> using<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.540> MacBook<00:01:06.930> Air<00:01:07.170> all

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
if you've been using a MacBook Air all

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.410 
if you've been using a MacBook Air all
this<00:01:07.619> time<00:01:07.890> yeah<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.820> might<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.150> little<00:01:09.330> bit

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
this time yeah it might be a little bit

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.510 
this time yeah it might be a little bit
of<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> shock<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.049> you've<00:01:10.619> been<00:01:10.770> using<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.070> 13

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
of a shock if you've been using a 13

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.570 
of a shock if you've been using a 13
it'll<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.450> bit<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.990> weight

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
it'll be a little bit of a weight

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.609 
it'll be a little bit of a weight
differential<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:14.700> not<00:01:14.880> too<00:01:15.090> much<00:01:15.350> it's<00:01:16.350> not

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
differential but not too much it's not

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.130 
differential but not too much it's not
as<00:01:16.860> portable<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.610> 13<00:01:17.970> no<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:18.869> it's

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
as portable as a 13 no it's not but it's

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.200 
as portable as a 13 no it's not but it's
not<00:01:19.290> any<00:01:19.680> less<00:01:19.920> portable<00:01:20.310> than<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> 15<00:01:21.060> if

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
not any less portable than the 15 if

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.700 
not any less portable than the 15 if
that<00:01:21.360> makes<00:01:21.540> any<00:01:21.720> sense<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> course

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that makes any sense and then of course

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.620 
that makes any sense and then of course
if<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> had<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> air<00:01:23.400> you're<00:01:24.030> used<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.330> super

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
if you had the air you're used to super

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.030 
if you had the air you're used to super
light<00:01:24.780> anyway<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.439> doesn't<00:01:25.470> really<00:01:25.770> matter

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
light anyway so it doesn't really matter

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.370 
light anyway so it doesn't really matter
other<00:01:26.880> than<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.570> build<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.960> virtually

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
other than that the build is virtually

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.319 
other than that the build is virtually
the<00:01:28.470> same<00:01:28.640> there<00:01:29.640> are<00:01:29.670> two<00:01:29.909> notable

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the same there are two notable

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.850 
the same there are two notable
differences<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> side<00:01:31.290> which<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.680> will

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
differences on the side which I will

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.999 
differences on the side which I will
point<00:01:32.070> out<00:01:32.189> right<00:01:32.400> now

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
point out right now

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.350 
point out right now
first<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.189> foremost<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.729> get<00:01:35.909> three<00:01:36.210> USB

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
first and foremost you get three USB

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.990 
first and foremost you get three USB
ports<00:01:36.600> instead<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.350> standard<00:01:37.710> two<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.850> do

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
ports instead of the standard two you do

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.080 
ports instead of the standard two you do
get<00:01:39.240> discrete<00:01:39.689> jacks<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.710> line-in<00:01:41.610> as

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
get discrete jacks for the line-in as

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
get discrete jacks for the line-in as
well<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.869> headphone<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.530> now<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
well as the headphone and now it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.910 
well as the headphone and now it
actually<00:01:44.820> has<00:01:44.970> an<00:01:45.119> Express<00:01:45.450> card<00:01:45.689> port<00:01:46.320> rather

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
actually has an Express card port rather

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.240 
actually has an Express card port rather
than<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.780> SD<00:01:48.780> card<00:01:49.049> slot<00:01:49.590> that's<00:01:49.829> found<00:01:50.100> on

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
than the SD card slot that's found on

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.630 
than the SD card slot that's found on
some<00:01:50.490> others<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.950> that's<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
some others so that's it for the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.630 
some others so that's it for the
exterior<00:01:54.180> everything<00:01:54.540> else<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.840> same<00:01:55.640> so

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
exterior everything else is the same so

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.620 
exterior everything else is the same so
you'll<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.090> used<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> Express

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
you'll have to get used to the Express

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.179 
you'll have to get used to the Express
card<00:01:57.899> slot<00:01:57.930> now<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.619> get<00:01:58.829> an<00:01:58.890> Express

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
card slot now you can get an Express

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
card slot now you can get an Express
card<00:01:59.430> adapter<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.329> will<00:02:00.509> let<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> read<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
card adapter that will let you read the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.510 
card adapter that will let you read the
SD<00:02:01.320> card<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.799> can't<00:02:02.009> get<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> best<00:02:02.369> of

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
SD card so you can't get the best of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.100 
SD card so you can't get the best of
both<00:02:02.640> worlds<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:03.149> way<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.869> you're<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.049> a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
both worlds that way so you're not a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.649 
both worlds that way so you're not a
total<00:02:04.619> loss<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.820> kind<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.180> bothersome

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
total loss but it is kind of bothersome

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.730 
total loss but it is kind of bothersome
that<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.170> with<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.950> port<00:02:08.250> rather

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
that it with that port rather

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.560 
that it with that port rather
just<00:02:08.920> going<00:02:09.160> with<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.400> standard<00:02:09.880> or<00:02:10.180> at<00:02:10.420> least

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
just going with the standard or at least

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.440 
just going with the standard or at least
doing<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.930> in<00:02:11.020> both<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:12.340> other<00:02:13.090> thing<00:02:13.360> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
doing it in both the other thing to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.880 
doing it in both the other thing to
notice<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.140> lid<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.470> little<00:02:14.800> bit

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
notice is that the lid is a little bit

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.890 
notice is that the lid is a little bit
more<00:02:15.070> difficult<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.550> open<00:02:16.000> than<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.750> other

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
more difficult to open than the other

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.590 
more difficult to open than the other
ones<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:18.520> can<00:02:18.700> see<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:19.060> there's<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.270> lot<00:02:19.450> of

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
ones you can see that there's a lot of

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.240 
ones you can see that there's a lot of
wasted<00:02:19.930> space<00:02:20.230> on<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.710> left<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.160> on<00:02:21.220> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
wasted space on the left and on the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.160 
wasted space on the left and on the
right<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.640> keyboard<00:02:21.870> there's<00:02:22.870> not<00:02:23.140> a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
right of the keyboard there's not a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.550 
right of the keyboard there's not a
number<00:02:23.500> keypad<00:02:24.070> per<00:02:24.400> se<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.480> trackpad<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:26.290> not

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
number keypad per se the trackpad is not

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.520 
number keypad per se the trackpad is not
the<00:02:26.800> same<00:02:27.040> as<00:02:27.310> what<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.730> on<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:27.970> 13<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:29.230> click

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
the same as what is on the 13 the click

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.960 
the same as what is on the 13 the click
is<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.770> lot<00:02:29.980> more<00:02:30.160> audible<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.340> 13<00:02:33.760> has<00:02:33.940> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
is a lot more audible the 13 has a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.570 
is a lot more audible the 13 has a
muffled<00:02:34.510> click<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.680> 15<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> little

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
muffled click to it the 15 is a little

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.910 
muffled click to it the 15 is a little
bit<00:02:36.700> louder<00:02:37.030> than<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:40.170> 13<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.350> but<00:02:41.560> not<00:02:41.710> by

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
bit louder than the 13 is but not by

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.280 
bit louder than the 13 is but not by
much<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.460> then<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.270> course<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.840> screen<00:02:44.110> is

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
much and then of course the screen is

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.440 
much and then of course the screen is
definitely<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.740> mirror<00:02:45.070> at<00:02:45.310> heart<00:02:45.550> as<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.270> can

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
definitely a mirror at heart as you can

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.170 
definitely a mirror at heart as you can
easily<00:02:46.600> tell<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.550> can<00:02:48.670> see<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.940> screen

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
easily tell and you can see the screen

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.930 
easily tell and you can see the screen
real-estate<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.900> not<00:02:50.310> small<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.580> mean<00:02:51.820> you've

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
real-estate is not small I mean you've

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.640 
real-estate is not small I mean you've
got<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.120> lot<00:02:52.330> of<00:02:52.360> room<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.900> really<00:02:53.140> work<00:02:53.290> here

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
got a lot of room to really work here

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.620 
got a lot of room to really work here
I'm<00:02:54.370> going<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:54.640> just<00:02:54.790> minimize<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.360> windows

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
I'm going to just minimize the windows

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.330 
I'm going to just minimize the windows
here<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:55.990> you<00:02:56.050> can<00:02:56.200> see<00:02:56.350> my<00:02:56.500> leopard<00:02:56.950> up<00:02:57.070> there

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
here so you can see my leopard up there

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.940 
here so you can see my leopard up there
as<00:02:57.550> you<00:02:58.510> can<00:02:58.660> tell<00:02:58.840> there's<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.170> lot<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.650> room

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
as you can tell there's a lot of room

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.770 
as you can tell there's a lot of room
there's<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.310> lot<00:03:00.490> of<00:03:00.730> space<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.300> fonts<00:03:01.660> are

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
there's a lot of space the fonts are

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.960 
there's a lot of space the fonts are
little<00:03:01.960> small<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.800> can<00:03:03.070> obviously<00:03:03.460> zoom<00:03:03.790> them

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
little small you can obviously zoom them

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.030 
little small you can obviously zoom them
in<00:03:04.150> but<00:03:04.420> it's<00:03:04.540> not<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:05.590> me<00:03:05.710> it's<00:03:05.860> not<00:03:05.920> a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
in but it's not to me it's not a

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.860 
in but it's not to me it's not a
deal-breaker<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.610> mean<00:03:06.730> once<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.030> use<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.330> for

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
deal-breaker I mean once you use it for

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.020 
deal-breaker I mean once you use it for
like<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.020> week<00:03:08.260> maybe<00:03:08.590> two<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.370> get<00:03:09.580> used<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.940> it

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
like a week maybe two you get used to it

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.550 
like a week maybe two you get used to it
your<00:03:10.270> eyes<00:03:10.420> start<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.780> adjust<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.440> you

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
your eyes start to adjust to it you

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.930 
your eyes start to adjust to it you
really<00:03:11.800> don't<00:03:11.890> need<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.250> have<00:03:12.370> anything<00:03:12.640> much

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
really don't need to have anything much

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.270 
really don't need to have anything much
bigger<00:03:13.270> I<00:03:13.570> do<00:03:14.260> have<00:03:14.560> some<00:03:14.740> comparison

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
bigger I do have some comparison

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.110 
bigger I do have some comparison
pictures<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:16.750> show<00:03:16.960> you<00:03:17.020> here<00:03:17.790> you'll<00:03:18.790> see<00:03:19.030> the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
pictures to show you here you'll see the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.540 
pictures to show you here you'll see the
comparison<00:03:19.660> between<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:20.470> 13-inch<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.340> the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550

17<00:03:45.250> if<00:03:45.610> you're<00:03:46.570> just<00:03:46.750> that<00:03:47.020> nit<00:03:47.530> picky<00:03:47.890> about

17 if you're just that nit picky about
that<00:03:48.160> extra<00:03:48.640> pound<00:03:48.880> of<00:03:49.240> weight<00:03:49.420> or<00:03:49.870> whatnot

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
that extra pound of weight or whatnot

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.050 
that extra pound of weight or whatnot
then<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.040> can<00:03:51.190> fall<00:03:51.370> back<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.730> high<00:03:51.880> res

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
it is heavier than the 13 but it's more

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.080 
it is heavier than the 13 but it's more

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
I think it's louder than a 13 by far and

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.390 
I think it's louder than a 13 by far and
it<00:04:50.560> is<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.710> little<00:04:50.980> bit<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.160> annoying

is somewhat of an irritant not too much

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.260 
is somewhat of an irritant not too much
but<00:04:56.440> it<00:04:56.530> is<00:04:56.620> somewhat<00:04:56.920> of<00:04:56.950> an<00:04:57.100> irritant<00:04:57.430> and

but it is somewhat of an irritant and
then<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:58.690> lack<00:04:58.870> of<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.170> standard<00:04:59.530> SD<00:04:59.680> card<00:05:00.180> slot

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.960 
to turn it into an SD card slot I
understand<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.920> reason<00:05:09.250> why<00:05:09.370> they<00:05:09.490> did<00:05:09.670> it<00:05:09.820> I

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
understand the reason why they did it I

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.270 
understand the reason why they did it I
just<00:05:10.180> disagree<00:05:10.480> with<00:05:10.750> it<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.890> other<00:05:12.010> thing<00:05:12.100> I

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
just disagree with it the other thing I

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.920 
just disagree with it the other thing I
want<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.520> note<00:05:12.640> on<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.820> 17<00:05:13.270> is<00:05:13.480> that<00:05:13.660> if<00:05:13.810> you

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
want to note on the 17 is that if you

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.070 
want to note on the 17 is that if you
are<00:05:14.080> going<00:05:14.230> to<00:05:14.290> get<00:05:14.440> a<00:05:14.470> 17<00:05:14.980> know<00:05:15.940> that<00:05:16.240> a<00:05:16.270> 7200

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
are going to get a 17 know that a 7200

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.740 
are going to get a 17 know that a 7200
rpm<00:05:17.470> Drive<00:05:17.830> is<00:05:18.250> going<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:18.940> reveal<00:05:19.300> for<00:05:19.570> you<00:05:19.720> a

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
rpm Drive is going to reveal for you a

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.190 
rpm Drive is going to reveal for you a
performance<00:05:20.530> boost<00:05:20.850> above<00:05:21.850> and<00:05:22.000> beyond<00:05:22.270> the

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
performance boost above and beyond the

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.920 
performance boost above and beyond the
basic<00:05:23.500> configuration<00:05:24.390> this<00:05:25.390> is<00:05:25.600> because

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
basic configuration this is because

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.390 
basic configuration this is because
there's<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.170> lot<00:05:26.320> of<00:05:26.350> Drive<00:05:26.590> accessing<00:05:27.160> going

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
there's a lot of Drive accessing going

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.100 
there's a lot of Drive accessing going
on<00:05:27.580> there's<00:05:27.880> a<00:05:27.910> lot<00:05:28.000> of<00:05:28.120> Drive<00:05:28.300> writes<00:05:28.630> reads

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
on there's a lot of Drive writes reads

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.350 
on there's a lot of Drive writes reads
so<00:05:29.980> you<00:05:30.040> want<00:05:30.310> a<00:05:30.370> fast<00:05:30.610> driver<00:05:30.820> p.m.<00:05:31.030> tried<00:05:31.240> to

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
so you want a fast driver p.m. tried to

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.450 
so you want a fast driver p.m. tried to
do<00:05:31.480> it<00:05:31.660> if<00:05:31.990> you're<00:05:32.260> gung<00:05:32.560> ho<00:05:32.770> and<00:05:33.010> you<00:05:33.070> got<00:05:33.220> cash

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
do it if you're gung ho and you got cash

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.000 
do it if you're gung ho and you got cash
to<00:05:33.670> burn<00:05:33.820> go<00:05:34.150> ahead<00:05:34.270> and<00:05:34.390> get<00:05:34.480> the<00:05:34.600> solid-state

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
to burn go ahead and get the solid-state

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.130 
to burn go ahead and get the solid-state
personally<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.040> find<00:05:36.370> solid-state<00:05:37.000> is<00:05:37.810> too

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
personally I find solid-state is too

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.790 
personally I find solid-state is too
expensive<00:05:38.350> as<00:05:38.740> a<00:05:38.770> technology<00:05:39.430> I<00:05:40.710> you<00:05:41.710> know

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
expensive as a technology I you know

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.080 
expensive as a technology I you know
it'll<00:05:41.980> get<00:05:42.160> there<00:05:42.430> but<00:05:42.610> right<00:05:42.790> now<00:05:42.940> I<00:05:43.000> just

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
it'll get there but right now I just

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.640 
it'll get there but right now I just
think<00:05:43.419> it's<00:05:43.510> too<00:05:43.630> expensive<00:05:43.900> and<00:05:44.290> just<00:05:44.440> not

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
think it's too expensive and just not

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.970 
think it's too expensive and just not
worth<00:05:45.160> it<00:05:45.430> it's<00:05:45.880> up<00:05:46.060> to<00:05:46.180> you<00:05:46.300> though<00:05:46.800> if<00:05:47.800> you're

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
worth it it's up to you though if you're

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.440 
worth it it's up to you though if you're
going<00:05:48.100> to<00:05:48.190> be<00:05:48.310> running<00:05:48.520> Windows<00:05:48.880> on<00:05:49.270> it

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
going to be running Windows on it

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.260 
going to be running Windows on it
obviously<00:05:49.600> you<00:05:50.050> can<00:05:50.350> boot<00:05:50.560> camp<00:05:50.830> that<00:05:51.270> start

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
obviously you can boot camp that start

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.360 
obviously you can boot camp that start
with<00:05:52.390> Vista<00:05:52.810> if<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:53.650> want<00:05:53.860> to<00:05:53.919> go<00:05:54.010> to<00:05:54.100> Windows

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
with Vista if you want to go to Windows

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.100 
with Vista if you want to go to Windows
7<00:05:54.700> you<00:05:54.790> need<00:05:54.940> to<00:05:55.030> go<00:05:55.120> to<00:05:55.180> Vista<00:05:55.510> first<00:05:55.750> and<00:05:55.990> then

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
7 you need to go to Vista first and then

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.270 
7 you need to go to Vista first and then
upgrade<00:05:56.320> Vista<00:05:56.919> to<00:05:57.130> 7<00:05:57.580> to<00:05:58.240> do<00:05:58.600> that<00:05:59.190> and<00:06:00.190> then

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
upgrade Vista to 7 to do that and then

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.230 
upgrade Vista to 7 to do that and then
you<00:06:00.370> can<00:06:00.490> leverage<00:06:00.669> all<00:06:00.910> this<00:06:01.030> wonderful

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
you can leverage all this wonderful

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.170 
you can leverage all this wonderful
screen<00:06:01.630> real<00:06:01.780> estate<00:06:01.810> for<00:06:02.200> that<00:06:02.320> if<00:06:02.620> you<00:06:02.770> want

if you're going to virtualize I suggest
using<00:06:06.100> VMware<00:06:06.730> if<00:06:07.030> you<00:06:07.240> want<00:06:07.510> stability<00:06:07.780> and

support use parallels if you care about
