00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.689 
there I'm messing up a few times along
the<00:00:15.449> way<00:00:15.600> which<00:00:15.869> I<00:00:15.990> did<00:00:16.139> cut<00:00:16.379> out<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> lot<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.130> if

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the way which I did cut out a lot so if

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.359 
the way which I did cut out a lot so if
you<00:00:17.820> want<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.090> skip<00:00:18.359> ahead<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.050> bit<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:20.160> can<00:00:20.279> go

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
you want to skip ahead a bit you can go

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.310

ahead<00:00:20.579> but<00:00:20.849> if<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.060> want<00:00:21.179> to<00:00:21.210> watch<00:00:21.329> it<00:00:21.509> go<00:00:21.660> you

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
ahead but if you want to watch it go you

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.130 
ahead but if you want to watch it go you
can<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.800> too<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.720> go<00:00:24.810> right<00:00:24.960> through

how<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.670> do<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:55.970> so<00:01:56.750> this<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.470> number<00:01:57.710> 12<00:01:58.040> now

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
how to do it so this is number 12 now

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.010 
how to do it so this is number 12 now
and<00:02:00.040> number<00:02:01.040> 12<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:02.120> can<00:02:02.270> see<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.540> in<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.750> top

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
and number 12 you can see it in the top

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.680 
and number 12 you can see it in the top
right<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.740> see<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.010> purple<00:02:04.430> glow<00:02:04.760> and<00:02:05.450> slow

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
right you see the purple glow and slow

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.080 
right you see the purple glow and slow
it<00:02:05.780> down<00:02:05.840> here<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.410> yeah<00:02:07.160> there<00:02:07.400> it<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.550> you

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
it down here and yeah there it is you

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.370 
it down here and yeah there it is you
can't<00:02:08.270> get<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.450> from<00:02:08.570> that<00:02:08.780> way<00:02:09.170> because

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
can't get it from that way because

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.630 
can't get it from that way because
there's<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.679> bear<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.130> way<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.280> what<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.580> got

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
there's a bear in a way so what you got

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.430 
there's a bear in a way so what you got
to<00:02:10.730> do<00:02:10.790> is<00:02:10.910> go<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.210> left<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.660> there<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.140> a

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
to do is go to the left and there is a

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.590 
to do is go to the left and there is a
little<00:02:12.950> wall<00:02:13.220> jump<00:02:13.520> thing<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.850> get<00:02:14.120> here<00:02:14.450> and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
little wall jump thing you get here and

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.800 
little wall jump thing you get here and
then<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.680> can<00:02:15.830> just<00:02:15.980> go<00:02:16.910> right<00:02:17.180> there<00:02:17.630> pretty

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
then you can just go right there pretty

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.240 
then you can just go right there pretty
straightforward<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:21.170> there<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:21.920> cake

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
straightforward and there it is cake

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:30.820 
straightforward and there it is cake
number<00:02:22.730> 12<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:25.030> now<00:02:26.030> number<00:02:26.300> 13<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.560> now

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
number 12 and now number 13 so now

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.680 
number 12 and now number 13 so now
they're<00:02:30.980> gonna<00:02:31.070> start<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.370> be<00:02:31.600> showing<00:02:32.600> up

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
they're gonna start to be showing up

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.570 
they're gonna start to be showing up
earlier<00:02:33.290> on<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.590> levels<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:36.250> kill<00:02:37.250> this<00:02:37.400> guy

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
earlier on the levels I kill this guy

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.610 
earlier on the levels I kill this guy
and<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:37.970> just<00:02:38.090> go<00:02:38.480> through<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.440> think

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
and you just go through it and I think

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.100 
and you just go through it and I think
the<00:02:39.739> one<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:39.980> really<00:02:40.820> just<00:02:41.570> right<00:02:41.750> at<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.930> top

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
the one is really just right at the top

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.870 
the one is really just right at the top
is<00:02:42.350> good<00:02:42.500> at<00:02:42.590> Yeah<00:02:42.770> right<00:02:43.010> here<00:02:43.520> just<00:02:43.670> go<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.790> a

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
is good at Yeah right here just go to a

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.060 
is good at Yeah right here just go to a
big<00:02:44.239> long<00:02:44.600> jump<00:02:44.840> it's<00:02:44.989> at<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.200> very<00:02:45.230> top<00:02:45.650> left

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
big long jump it's at the very top left

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.820 
big long jump it's at the very top left
like<00:02:46.310> from<00:02:46.550> where<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.230> very<00:02:48.410> beginning

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
like from where you the very beginning

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.140 
like from where you the very beginning
of<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.010> level<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.489> that's<00:02:49.640> cake<00:02:49.940> number<00:02:50.180> 13

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
of the level and that's cake number 13

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.930 
of the level and that's cake number 13
so<00:02:53.150> that's<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:53.390> pretty<00:02:53.540> easy<00:02:53.750> one<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.989> find<00:02:54.230> and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
so that's a pretty easy one to find and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.170 
so that's a pretty easy one to find and
now<00:02:55.940> number<00:02:56.150> 14

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.530 

kill<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.299> guy<00:03:04.540> quick<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:06.120> she<00:03:07.120> keep<00:03:07.329> going

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
kill that guy quick and she keep going

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.729 
kill that guy quick and she keep going
through<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.750> level<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.870> can<00:03:14.019> find<00:03:14.379> most<00:03:14.590> of

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
through the level you can find most of

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.229 
through the level you can find most of
these<00:03:14.799> on<00:03:14.980> your<00:03:15.099> own<00:03:15.159> but<00:03:15.579> some<00:03:15.849> of<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.030> later

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
these on your own but some of the later

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.089 
these on your own but some of the later
ones<00:03:16.480> are<00:03:16.629> really<00:03:16.750> difficult<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.290> find<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:17.799> I

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
ones are really difficult to find so I

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.610 
ones are really difficult to find so I
thought<00:03:18.370> I'd<00:03:18.489> just<00:03:18.519> do<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> whole<00:03:19.030> set<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:19.659> yeah

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
thought I'd just do a whole set and yeah

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.399 
thought I'd just do a whole set and yeah
the<00:03:20.739> one<00:03:20.890> is<00:03:21.099> right<00:03:21.280> after<00:03:21.400> this<00:03:22.319> after<00:03:23.319> you

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
the one is right after this after you

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.220 
the one is right after this after you
get<00:03:23.500> up<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:24.010> gotta<00:03:24.159> you<00:03:25.060> know<00:03:25.230> trigger

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
get up this you gotta you know trigger

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.680 
get up this you gotta you know trigger
the<00:03:26.409> barrel<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.709> fall<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.190> then<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.489> gotta

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
the barrel to fall and then you gotta

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.910 
the barrel to fall and then you gotta
make<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.720> so<00:03:28.930> hits<00:03:29.109> a<00:03:29.200> scientist<00:03:29.590> this<00:03:29.709> time<00:03:29.890> I

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
make it so hits a scientist this time I

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.240 
make it so hits a scientist this time I
mess<00:03:30.190> up<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.019> got<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.260> make<00:03:32.349> it<00:03:32.409> see<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.799> SB

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
mess up so you got to make it see the SB

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.369 
mess up so you got to make it see the SB
a--<00:03:33.280> he<00:03:33.579> triggers<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.540> barrier<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.140> that

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
a-- he triggers the barrier and that

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.500 
a-- he triggers the barrier and that
won't<00:03:35.530> let<00:03:35.739> you<00:03:35.829> get<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.250> cake<00:03:36.879> if<00:03:37.120> he<00:03:37.299> does

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
won't let you get the cake if he does

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.880 
won't let you get the cake if he does
that<00:03:37.750> so<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.079> got<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.379> quick<00:03:38.620> enough<00:03:38.650> so

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
that so you got to it quick enough so

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.330 
that so you got to it quick enough so
that<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.340> kill<00:03:39.670> them<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.799> here's<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.980> normal

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
that you kill them and here's the normal

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.319 
that you kill them and here's the normal
speed<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:45.220> it's<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.430> lot<00:03:45.549> slower<00:03:45.819> for<00:03:46.150> some

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
speed so it's a lot slower for some

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:52.740 
speed so it's a lot slower for some
reason<00:03:46.569> on<00:03:46.690> why<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.920> then<00:03:51.849> you<00:03:51.970> do<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.359> and

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
reason on why and then you do that and

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.899 
reason on why and then you do that and
if<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.109> do<00:03:53.200> it<00:03:53.290> quick<00:03:53.470> enough<00:03:53.500> you'll<00:03:54.040> make

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
if you do it quick enough you'll make

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.879 
if you do it quick enough you'll make
sure<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.209> won't<00:03:55.389> close<00:03:55.659> it<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:56.139> that's<00:03:56.650> cake

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
sure you won't close it and that's cake

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:06.800 
sure you won't close it and that's cake
number<00:03:57.159> 14<00:04:00.000> all<00:04:01.000> right<00:04:01.209> Kate<00:04:01.480> number<00:04:01.750> 15

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.589 

deflect<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.930> rocket<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:10.379> kill<00:04:11.379> him<00:04:11.590> okay<00:04:12.519> so

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
deflect the rocket and kill him okay so

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:19.120 
deflect the rocket and kill him okay so
