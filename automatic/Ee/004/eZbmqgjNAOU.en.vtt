00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.539
 on this potential the last time eh 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.340
 well he did not have the best of 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.239
 course though well finished for 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.020
 take an accessit 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.190
 here if the driver shows inspired 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.769
 horse perfectly has the means to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.490
 fight for success number 12 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.670

 disqualification but also a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.619
 victory which you will have understood if 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.729
 the wise it seems to me able to 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.580
 play the leading roles 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.990

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.000
 lot the horse and just won a 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.009
 quinté plus it was the 1st of january at my 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.650
 opinion this is the main opposition to 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.939
 aforementioned horses the number 9 8 lots of 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.950
 room just to prove its shape 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.759
 last by winning on the racecourse 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.320
 from rouen mauquenchy 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.299
 he's making his comeback to vincennes with 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.490
 ambitions the number 17 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.110
 a dc that could come spice 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.409
 the reports of this test a good 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.270
 horse 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.680
 know also that nicolas roussel his 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.479
 river coach the undo the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.579
 previous what was not done anymore 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.520
 since the month of June it is necessary 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.020
 also see it as a sign of confidence 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.270
 the number 8 ulysses started at this horse 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.700
 seems to me a priori barred for 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.269
 first places but a place seems 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.910
 in his strings 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.590
 the number 11 is ubu the master if he 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.300
 must buy him he proved especially 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.590
 last winter who had the potential 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.910
 to shine at this level he could 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.790
 he too come to spice up the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:24.950
 quinté reports + 14 18 12 19 9 17 8 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.799
 and 11 here is my selection for this quinté 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.810
 of Saturday, January 25 of the other courses of 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.730
 the 3rd pole compass presented 3 out of 9 1 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.530
 gone the horse stays on a series of 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.690
 good results of similar podiums 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.040
 society and under the saddle little the compass 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.569
 the present always wisely 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.920
 he is expecting here again a good 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.970
 result I think able to finish 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.180
 among the first three 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.930
 the 307 ugolin two rooms will be a 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.810
 serious rival 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.700
 the horse will be rewound of 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.980
 four feet his last two 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.170
 attempts in this foot configuration 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.569
 they have been so successful 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.819
 a success on 2007 and another on 2002 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.910
 so not all its distances 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.970
 concerning 309 307 in the price of 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.380
 luxembourg a group iii on a test 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.660
 played on a speed course 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.519
 well it will be necessary to trust 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.290
 new times 608 bettman 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.870
 the horse stays on five wins 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.940
 consecutive equally convincing the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.650
 as others, including three on the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.130
 course of interest 2100 meters 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.049
 autostart 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.060
 it comes from elsewhere to market an ounce i 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.620
 on this course it is actually a home 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.269
 of favorite but beware I think 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.609
 sincerely that he will have a hard time doing 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.870
 faso if they are two on track driving a 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.209
 horse that is the subject of very loud noises 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.519
 favorable he has lines he had 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.920
 finished fifth or sixth of the price 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.359
 summer behind the timoko or else elie 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.250
 hide that day he had finished well 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.959
 he was facing his elders what will not 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.410
 not the case here know that since in 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.389
 Sweden 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.160
 well, he's got ahead of yara a lot 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.519
 double winner of the prize 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.849
 Belgium 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.709
 he also beat maharaja to on the 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.910
 solvalla palms brief a business card 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.680
 who pleads in his favor 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.829
 it is a priori the main opposition them 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.900
 also are at 8 beckmann 600 2 608 for 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.400
 the places I would recommend 605 street 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.380
 wheels on horseback that has a 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.940
 fearsome final speed spike 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.300
 the selective rhythm will allow him to 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.440
 exploit it the 606 and alicia bella is worth 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.150
 better than his two 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.840
 last attempts recorded during 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.150
 of January 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.970

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.520
 years 2 608 605 606 for this price on 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.290
 luxembourg about skin in meeting 2 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.960
 I targeted three races the first 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.670
 with the blood a hydrogen that counts 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.780
 three attempts on the steeple chase 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.140
 for as many podiums but no 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.350
 victory 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.580
 the protected jean pierre thomin finds 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.410
 here the opportunity to sign his first 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.090
 victory over the steeple-chase that already has 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.020

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.770
 notice in this lot she must be able to play
