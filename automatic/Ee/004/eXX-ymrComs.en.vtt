sport I like watching it great times and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.120 
sport I like watching it great times and
so<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:33.660> very<00:00:33.809> excited<00:00:34.320> when<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.469> saw<00:00:34.710> Nestor

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
so I was very excited when I saw Nestor

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.620 
so I was very excited when I saw Nestor
came<00:00:35.370> out<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.640> game<00:00:35.730> called<00:00:36.030> eleven

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
came out with the game called eleven

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.010 
came out with the game called eleven
which<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.649> basically<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.280> football<00:00:38.730> match

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
which is basically a football match

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.110 
which is basically a football match
putting<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.079> down<00:00:40.230> now<00:00:40.500> I've<00:00:41.250> found<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
putting it down now I've found that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.190 
putting it down now I've found that
soccer<00:00:42.390> games<00:00:42.750> football<00:00:43.020> games

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
soccer games football games

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.319 
soccer games football games
what-have-you<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.460> very<00:00:44.700> difficult<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
what-have-you are very difficult to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.930 
what-have-you are very difficult to
simulate<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.410> board<00:00:47.160> game<00:00:47.219> because<00:00:47.760> it's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
simulate on a board game because it's

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.910 
simulate on a board game because it's
such<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> quick<00:00:48.300> moving<00:00:48.690> game<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.680> hard

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
such a quick moving game and it's hard

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.260 
such a quick moving game and it's hard
to<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.309> sort<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.730> thing<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> board<00:00:51.239> game

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
to do that sort of thing on a board game

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.850 
to do that sort of thing on a board game
let's<00:00:51.629> usually<00:00:52.199> leave<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> video

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
let's usually leave it to the video

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.209 
let's usually leave it to the video
games<00:00:53.129> well<00:00:53.489> guess<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.120> another<00:00:54.750> failure

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
games well guess what another failure

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.799 
games well guess what another failure
huh<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.879> Nestor<00:00:57.180> games<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.629> one

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
huh I like Nestor games but this one

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.799 
huh I like Nestor games but this one
just<00:00:57.989> did<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.289> come<00:00:58.620> across<00:00:58.829> very<00:00:59.250> well<00:00:59.809> let's

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
just did not come across very well let's

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.090 
just did not come across very well let's
look<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.289> I'll<00:01:01.350> show<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> problems

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
look at and I'll show you the problems

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:12.560 
look at and I'll show you the problems
with<00:01:02.219> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.749 

the<00:01:13.570> game's<00:01:13.780> very<00:01:14.049> simple<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.770> ball<00:01:15.430> was<00:01:15.579> placed

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
the game's very simple a ball was placed

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.490 
the game's very simple a ball was placed
in<00:01:16.000> middle<00:01:16.210> it's<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.390> little<00:01:16.630> white<00:01:16.840> disc<00:01:17.229> which

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
in middle it's a little white disc which

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.920 
in middle it's a little white disc which
has<00:01:17.710> somehow<00:01:17.950> mysteriously<00:01:18.490> disappeared<00:01:19.329> so

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
has somehow mysteriously disappeared so

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.240 
has somehow mysteriously disappeared so
we'll<00:01:20.049> use<00:01:20.200> this<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.380> little<00:01:20.680> yellow<00:01:20.890> cube

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
we'll use this a little yellow cube

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.670 
we'll use this a little yellow cube
doesn't<00:01:21.549> matter<00:01:21.909> each<00:01:22.899> player<00:01:23.289> is<00:01:23.439> going<00:01:23.590> to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
doesn't matter each player is going to

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.980 
doesn't matter each player is going to
on<00:01:24.100> your<00:01:24.280> turn<00:01:24.549> you<00:01:24.820> roll<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.299> die<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.630> that

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
on your turn you roll a die and that

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.289 
on your turn you roll a die and that
shows<00:01:26.380> me<00:01:26.560> movement<00:01:27.009> points<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.369> have<00:01:27.579> now

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
shows me movement points you have now

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.320 
shows me movement points you have now
when<00:01:28.509> you<00:01:28.659> move<00:01:28.929> to<00:01:29.259> take<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.590> closer<00:01:29.799> look

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
when you move to take a closer look

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.820 
when you move to take a closer look
let's<00:01:31.330> say<00:01:31.479> for<00:01:31.659> example<00:01:31.720> number<00:01:32.170> 8<00:01:32.439> when<00:01:32.740> he

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
let's say for example number 8 when he

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.870 
let's say for example number 8 when he
moves<00:01:33.070> here<00:01:33.460> he<00:01:33.939> can<00:01:34.119> move<00:01:34.299> here<00:01:35.170> here<00:01:36.070> here

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
moves here he can move here here here

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.389 
moves here he can move here here here
here<00:01:37.270> he<00:01:37.420> can't<00:01:37.630> move<00:01:37.750> into<00:01:37.899> his<00:01:38.079> own<00:01:38.259> guy<00:01:38.530> down

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
here he can't move into his own guy down

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.850 
here he can't move into his own guy down
there<00:01:39.670> where<00:01:39.850> number<00:01:40.090> 2<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.679> can

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
there where number 2 is so you you can

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.380 
there where number 2 is so you you can
move<00:01:42.039> around<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.490> board<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:42.880> these<00:01:43.030> kind<00:01:43.299> of

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
move around the board and these kind of

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.510 
move around the board and these kind of
funky<00:01:43.720> little<00:01:43.990> lines<00:01:44.200> as<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:44.890> move<00:01:45.100> back<00:01:45.340> and

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
funky little lines as you move back and

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.760 
funky little lines as you move back and
forth<00:01:45.789> now<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.569> are<00:01:46.959> actually<00:01:47.259> allowed<00:01:47.740> to

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
forth now you are actually allowed to

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.680 
forth now you are actually allowed to
move<00:01:48.190> into<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.459> spot<00:01:48.819> where<00:01:49.030> your<00:01:49.209> opponent<00:01:49.299> is

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
move into a spot where your opponent is

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.660 
move into a spot where your opponent is
you<00:01:50.679> can<00:01:50.830> move<00:01:50.979> in<00:01:51.130> there<00:01:51.310> but<00:01:51.429> then<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.580> have

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
you can move in there but then you have

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.980 
you can move in there but then you have
to<00:01:51.729> pay<00:01:51.850> one<00:01:52.060> more<00:01:52.179> movement<00:01:52.509> point<00:01:52.689> to<00:01:52.810> move

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
to pay one more movement point to move

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.460 
to pay one more movement point to move
him<00:01:53.200> out<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:55.209> costs<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.780> basically<00:01:56.259> then

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
him out so it costs to basically then

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.080 
him out so it costs to basically then
move<00:01:56.619> into<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.890> spot<00:01:57.189> where<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.459> opponent<00:01:57.670> is

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
move into a spot where the opponent is

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.480 
move into a spot where the opponent is
you<00:01:58.659> can<00:01:58.840> grab<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.200> ball<00:01:59.409> if<00:01:59.770> you<00:02:00.189> move<00:02:00.340> into

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
you can grab the ball if you move into

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.760 
you can grab the ball if you move into
that<00:02:00.670> spot<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.299> then<00:02:01.780> instead<00:02:02.020> of<00:02:02.140> moving<00:02:02.319> you

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
that spot and then instead of moving you

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.670 
chance of making it if the goal scored
we<00:02:57.519> start<00:02:57.790> over<00:02:57.970> again

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
we start over again

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.840 
we start over again
now<00:02:59.680> when<00:02:59.829> you<00:02:59.950> shoot<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.250> ball<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.579> doesn't

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
now when you shoot the ball it doesn't

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.879 
now when you shoot the ball it doesn't
actually<00:03:00.940> take<00:03:01.329> one<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.630> your<00:03:01.750> actions<00:03:01.930> but

actually take one of your actions but
for<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.459> rest<00:03:03.639> of<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.030> really<00:03:04.060> does<00:03:04.480> come

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
for the rest of it it really does come

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.660 
for the rest of it it really does come
down<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.079> die<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.620> can<00:03:05.799> see<00:03:06.010> right

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
down to the die and you can see right

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.160 
down to the die and you can see right
now<00:03:06.880> when<00:03:07.090> my<00:03:07.239> problems<00:03:07.630> with<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:07.810> game<00:03:08.019> will

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
now when my problems with this game will

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.229 
now when my problems with this game will
be<00:03:08.200> frustrating<00:03:08.889> for<00:03:09.010> one<00:03:09.489> person<00:03:09.850> who<00:03:10.000> rules

be frustrating for one person who rules

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.580 
be frustrating for one person who rules
low<00:03:10.480> several<00:03:10.870> times<00:03:11.079> in<00:03:11.200> Iran<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.440> other

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
a goal other than that that's basically

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.330 
a goal other than that that's basically
the<00:03:17.049> game<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> game<00:03:17.560> takes<00:03:17.799> place<00:03:18.040> over<00:03:18.220> a

certain amount of time you'd like 20
minutes<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:21.819> then<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.569> was<00:03:22.989> after<00:03:23.530> 20<00:03:23.769> minutes

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
minutes and then it was after 20 minutes

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.500 
minutes and then it was after 20 minutes
are<00:03:24.010> up<00:03:24.040> as<00:03:24.280> soon<00:03:24.430> as<00:03:24.549> someone<00:03:24.700> rolls<00:03:24.939> a1<00:03:25.299> the

so there's some uncertainty as when the
game<00:03:27.640> runs<00:03:28.060> or<00:03:28.660> as<00:03:28.810> most<00:03:29.019> points<00:03:29.530> there's<00:03:29.709> a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
game runs or as most points there's a

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.410 
game runs or as most points there's a

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
way to do penalty shootouts but that's

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.740 
way to do penalty shootouts but that's
the<00:03:31.569> game<00:03:31.750> man<00:03:32.550> that<00:03:33.550> die<00:03:33.910> roll<00:03:34.180> just<00:03:34.420> kills
