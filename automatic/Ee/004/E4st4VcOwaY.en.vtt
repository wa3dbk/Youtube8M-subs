00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
these is they grow fantastically in the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.429 
these is they grow fantastically in the
UK<00:00:20.520> they're<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.850> perfect<00:00:21.170> subtropical<00:00:22.170> plant

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
UK they're the perfect subtropical plant

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.130 
UK they're the perfect subtropical plant
for<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.680> UK<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:24.119> originate<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:24.660> Japan

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
for the UK and they originate from Japan

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.859 
for the UK and they originate from Japan
originally<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.890> they're<00:00:26.849> very<00:00:27.000> Hardy<00:00:27.480> plants

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
originally and they're very Hardy plants

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.939 
originally and they're very Hardy plants
for<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> UK<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.250> UK<00:00:30.349> they<00:00:31.349> grow<00:00:31.590> really

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
for the UK in the UK they grow really

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.479 
for the UK in the UK they grow really
really<00:00:32.460> fast<00:00:32.700> actually<00:00:33.770> from<00:00:34.770> between<00:00:35.340> our

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
really fast actually from between our

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.280 
really fast actually from between our
spring<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:35.880> summer<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.809> potential

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
spring and summer this is the potential

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530 
spring and summer this is the potential
to<00:00:37.440> grow<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.649> seven<00:00:38.190> foot<00:00:38.430> they<00:00:38.700> go<00:00:38.879> really

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
to grow to seven foot they go really

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.340 
to grow to seven foot they go really
fast<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.430> do<00:00:42.140> they<00:00:43.140> don't

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
fast and then what you can do they don't

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.229 
fast and then what you can do they don't
do<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.829> well<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> winter<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.149> to

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
do so well in the winter so you have to

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
do so well in the winter so you have to
give<00:00:45.390> them<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.570> little<00:00:45.719> bit<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.960> protection<00:00:46.170> so

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
give them a little bit of protection so

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.729 
give them a little bit of protection so
I'm<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.090> come<00:00:49.079> October<00:00:49.230> time

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
I'm going to do and come October time

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.290 
I'm going to do and come October time
I'm<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.190> cut<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.760> down<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
I'm going to cut it right down to the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.420 
I'm going to cut it right down to the
base<00:00:51.449> right<00:00:51.840> that's<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> ground<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.160> then

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
base right that's the ground and then

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.279 
base right that's the ground and then
just<00:00:53.640> give<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.969> thick<00:00:54.239> mulch<00:00:54.510> over<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> top

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
just give it a thick mulch over the top

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.569 
just give it a thick mulch over the top
then<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.800> will<00:00:55.920> give<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.129> some<00:00:56.250> protection

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
then that will give it some protection

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.139 
then that will give it some protection
over<00:00:57.090> winter<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.370> also<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.940> for

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
over winter and also what you can do for

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.070 
over winter and also what you can do for
auntie<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.500> actually<00:01:01.800> dig<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
auntie you can actually dig it out and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.350 
auntie you can actually dig it out and
just<00:01:04.080> cut<00:01:04.559> off<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.680> top<00:01:04.830> leaves<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.549> so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
just cut off the top leaves there so

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
just cut off the top leaves there so
it's<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.780> stalk<00:01:07.020> shown<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.619> she<00:01:07.979> can

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it's just the stalk shown and she can

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.890 
it's just the stalk shown and she can
leave<00:01:08.400> there<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:08.909> stick<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> pantry

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
leave there like stick it in the pantry

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.469 
leave there like stick it in the pantry
or<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.590> garden<00:01:11.310> shed<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> garage<00:01:11.850> somewhere

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
or a garden shed or a garage somewhere

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.730 
or a garden shed or a garage somewhere
nice<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.409> dark<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:15.170> it's<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.530> some

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
nice and dark and it's got to be some

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.410 
nice and dark and it's got to be some
way<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.890> warm<00:01:17.189> something<00:01:17.909> you've<00:01:18.090> got<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> keep

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
way of warm something you've got to keep

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.289 
way of warm something you've got to keep
it<00:01:18.630> reasonably<00:01:19.380> warm<00:01:19.680> over<00:01:20.369> winter<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> then

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it reasonably warm over winter and then

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.080 
it reasonably warm over winter and then
that<00:01:21.479> will<00:01:21.630> preserve<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.200> trunk<00:01:22.939> if<00:01:23.939> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that will preserve the trunk if you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.520 
that will preserve the trunk if you
don't<00:01:24.240> keep<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.540> warm<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> frost<00:01:25.320> will

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
don't keep it warm then the frost will

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.830 
don't keep it warm then the frost will
kill<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.060> kill<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.240> down<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.630> ground

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
kill it it will kill it down to ground

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.289 
kill it it will kill it down to ground
level<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:29.189> rhizome<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> bottom

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
level but the the rhizome at the bottom

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.480 
level but the the rhizome at the bottom
will<00:01:30.869> still<00:01:31.110> stay<00:01:31.439> alive<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.220> will<00:01:32.340> still

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
will still stay alive so it will still

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.020 
will still stay alive so it will still
grow<00:01:32.670> back<00:01:32.850> next<00:01:33.090> year<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:33.930> tall

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
grow back next year but just not as tall

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.039 
grow back next year but just not as tall
so<00:01:36.030> yeah<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.360> what<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.509> love<00:01:36.630> about<00:01:36.659> this
