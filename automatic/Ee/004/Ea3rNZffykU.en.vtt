00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.520
 I'm going to show you how it works 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.500
 basic of what a new meter is 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.069
 digital that you are talking about right now 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.069
 the company 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.050
 a counter the new digital counter 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.779
 I was installing they have several 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.599
 pilots this pilot the pilot who 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.439
 detect consumption right now is 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:27.140
 off because there is no power consumption 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:29.240
 this this button pp for when 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.970
 block because these new counters 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.400
 It has an internal power limiter 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.019
 depending on the power contracted 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.120
 when it is blocked we will have to give 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.150
 button to unlock it and when it 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.040
 I blocked here the pilot will turn red 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.979
 I'm going to do a simple check 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.010
 right now there is no charge the pilot is 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:51.460
 on does not turn on does not blink or anything 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.920
 we go to the loads manually 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.070
 so you can see what happens 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.909
 the l1 has been turned on means that 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.610
 the line is working and already the 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.640
 pilot is flashing in fact already the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.610
 numeritos begins to vary is 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.220
 increasing is giving a consumption 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.250
 found and is counting 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.830
 this pilot varies according to consumption 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.430
 the more consumption the more blinking starts 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.530
 to blink faster still and as I have 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.780
 said before when it is blocked by 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.240
 power limitation remains the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.720
 pilot in red to unlock it there 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.270
 two of two ways to make it one to give 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.060
 to the button because here it puts a revenue that 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.649
 put the pp we give the block or the button 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.620
 it unlocks another one already the housing and 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.980
 count the load 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.600
 and cut off the load and there's no more flicker 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.390
 right now these are the new ones 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.670
 accountants who are assembling the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.510
 digital company and they wanted to show you 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.850
 a basic operation for you to see 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.370
 if it had a breakdown this can help 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.200
 to understand if you are consuming 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.080
 If you are not consuming, the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.140
 counter so thank you very much 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.910
 today December 21 end day 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.890
 of the world I'm going to stay here 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.960
 sometimes looking for the button to 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.510
 deactivate this day because obviously 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.120
 I want to continue working in that rock 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.270
 work that I do because I have many 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:31.580
 desire 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:34.630
 thanks to disable 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.630
 finally
