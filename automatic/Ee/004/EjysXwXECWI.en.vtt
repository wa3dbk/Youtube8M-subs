 cousin Carlos because he is given the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.640
 value to a horse as fifth of the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.670
 one clear that if this is a horse that 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.530
 has given us a lot of satisfaction and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.390
 I'm sure that if I have 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 retained their health would have followed 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.770
 giving then a horse with a very heart 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.070
 noble with a warrior spirit and 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.930
 besides not only the satisfactions that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.050
 gave us on the track here in venezuela 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.780
 winning very important careers in 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.820
 Grade 1 degree races the cup 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.610
 gold the classic of the owners the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.920
 also outside the border 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.200
 in venezuela when he was crowned in 2012 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.250
 as the best mature horse in the area 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.020
 Caribbean by winning the classic 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.360
 fellowship I think that the most 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.970
 important that you have 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.490
 this horse is he joined a group of 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.430
 I introduce myself to these people who have 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.920
 been so good with me are great 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.470
 friends of mine at this time and maybe that's 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.880
 it is the gift the greatest legacy that I 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.350
 has given this horse to me all this 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.690
 group of people who worked around 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.360
 him the foremen the chilean joseph flores 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.330
 the owners carlos but sos joan 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.240
 gutiÃ©rrez the godmother of the team in short 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.550
 really that eternally grateful and 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.909
 I will always remember this horse as the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.880
 reason 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.649
 why I had to go back to 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.569
 training racehorses no 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.539
 it's very cheerful not to fire a champion 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.700
 but it is the health of the horse yes good of 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.510
 true 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.430
 a very difficult decision 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.160
 a decision made by the group or 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.320
 Carlos Alberto my partner Carlos but 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.090
 we definitely think then that it is the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.520
 more accurate decision because 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.400
 first the horses during a whole 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.990
 late very important can recognize 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.670
 then the running ability as keys 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.980
 Carlos plays a champion horse outside 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.040
 of the country here in the corner if it's worth 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.640
 This good as you saw before 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.740
 a little sad because of course not 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.140
 it was what we wanted for him and in 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.200
 this time but many satisfactions 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.390
 and we will wait for the children our grandchildren 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.130
 we are with the rider jose robber 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.200
 Chilean flowers man key in the advance 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.670
 in the running capacity in ordering 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.530

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.370
 very sad horse very sad because I 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.590
 Leave a mouse or a big horse I 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.720
 gave five great actions and I believe that 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.300
 a best ever riding on 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.430
 venezuela panama and puerto rico 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.630
