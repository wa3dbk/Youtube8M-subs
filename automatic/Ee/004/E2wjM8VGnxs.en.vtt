00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.390
 Metallica drummer Ulrich of 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.279
 best drummers in the world 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.309
 in case I 'm here with a hammer net 5 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.210
 adam is model dollars the difference of this 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.260
 cool it is as follows it is made of metal 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.090
 My god , metal drumstick, serious. 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.489
 always speaking seriously the drumstick she has 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.039
 a metal body can see here and 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.829
 The big cheap thing about this stick is that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.320
 have a refill here that you can change 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.250
 that we saw this movie is a part had 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.770
 nylon and as you play 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.589
 Of course she's spending here that you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.720
 You can change to show how it works 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.330
 You pick up pliers and I'll 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.250
 make a protection here not pro pliers 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.710
 if you pick up a piece of paper 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.710
 will wrap with paper 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.960
 I swear to God that's what's in the manual. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 I had not seen you, just see the friend. 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:31.229
 she points is threaded on the drumstick no 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:39.869
 You know that you do not take the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:41.579
 your drumstick and you take our refill 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.119
 plastic sharing you can 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.460
 replace the machine will last for years 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.500
 in your hand there is only the metal part 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.630
 which is the body of the drumstick besides that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.920
 is saying here in 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.320
 my box that has 50% - shock of the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.759
 than wooden drumsticks then when 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.259
 you touch you will feel less 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.899
 vibration in your hand 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.090
 the consistency that a drumstick is 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.959
 identical to the other because it is not 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.300
 certainty is made of iron and of course the 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.090
 probability 30 being that it lasts for six 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.830
 to ten times more than a drumstick 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.500
 I think wood is inclusive 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.080
 speaking of this part and carbon fiber and 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.950
 not in the metal priest's house 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.750
 if you do not break it using so 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.209
 Underserved will last forever. 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.340
 so she's more expensive but she lasts a lot 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.209
 more than the stick of wood 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.360
 have not tried drumstick 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.810
 It's worth your time to have it for life. 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.980
 all you find to buy too 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.650
 in this profile 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.940
 What they say is for you to feel cold. 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.400
 and pimba a super bonder here to spin 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.349
 again, so the tip does not come out 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.310
 Flying you'll touch her. 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.380
 dropping 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.079
 that's it's the drumsticks are the network 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.079
 available on paper all with a bar
