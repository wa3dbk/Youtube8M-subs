00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.740 
thought oh no it's gonna be all over I
don't<00:01:52.560> know<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:53.100> after<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> first<00:01:53.939> game<00:01:54.570> I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
don't know like after the first game I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.800 
don't know like after the first game I
was<00:01:54.899> crushed<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:56.060> I'm<00:01:57.060> feeling<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.450> bit<00:01:57.540> sick

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
was crushed and I'm feeling a bit sick

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.940 
was crushed and I'm feeling a bit sick
so<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.750> had<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.869> just<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.380> relax<00:02:01.799> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
so like I had to just like relax and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.770 
so like I had to just like relax and
think<00:02:02.040> about<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> first<00:02:02.670> eight<00:02:02.880> games<00:02:02.909> what<00:02:03.750> I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
think about the first eight games what I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.530 
think about the first eight games what I
use<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.469> we<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:05.100> do<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.579> win<00:02:05.880> they

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
use it like we can do it we can win they

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.080 
use it like we can do it we can win they
didn't<00:02:06.810> show<00:02:06.990> anything<00:02:07.200> special<00:02:07.619> only<00:02:08.580> that

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
didn't show anything special only that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.720 
didn't show anything special only that
zach<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.420> broken<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.080> like

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
zach is broken and like

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.240 
zach is broken and like
they<00:02:12.360> play<00:02:12.569> really<00:02:12.810> good<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.980> strategy

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
they play really good like the strategy

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.890 
they play really good like the strategy
was<00:02:14.550> really<00:02:14.819> good<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.180> was<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.420> second<00:02:15.720> game

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
was really good it was the second game

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.740 
was really good it was the second game
this<00:02:16.200> thread<00:02:16.500> was<00:02:16.680> Opie<00:02:17.069> like<00:02:17.640> they're<00:02:17.940> sneaky

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
this thread was Opie like they're sneaky

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.589 
this thread was Opie like they're sneaky
initial<00:02:19.140> strategy<00:02:19.760> but<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.970> thought<00:02:21.120> about<00:02:21.360> it

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
initial strategy but we thought about it

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.199 
initial strategy but we thought about it
after<00:02:21.900> zaira<00:02:22.110> has<00:02:22.470> built<00:02:22.799> a<00:02:23.010> jungle<00:02:23.459> item<00:02:23.610> that

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
after zaira has built a jungle item that

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.089 
after zaira has built a jungle item that
they<00:02:24.480> want<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.870> focus<00:02:25.049> on<00:02:25.379> something<00:02:25.860> like

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
they want to focus on something like

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.610 
they want to focus on something like
Drake's<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.610> nature's<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:28.019> don't<00:02:28.349> know<00:02:28.470> if

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
Drake's and nature's and I don't know if

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.500 
Drake's and nature's and I don't know if
it's<00:02:28.769> like<00:02:28.980> or<00:02:29.220> direct<00:02:29.819> but<00:02:29.970> Darren<00:02:30.239> checked

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it's like or direct but Darren checked

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.289 
it's like or direct but Darren checked
and<00:02:30.780> they<00:02:31.560> were<00:02:31.680> doing<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.549> we<00:02:32.910> prevented

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
and they were doing it so we prevented

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.449 
and they were doing it so we prevented
it<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.629> after<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.049> we<00:02:34.500> got<00:02:34.650> huge<00:02:35.099> advantage

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
it and after that we got huge advantage

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.490 
it and after that we got huge advantage
in<00:02:35.580> second<00:02:35.910> game<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.660> think<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.049> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
in second game and I think like the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.220 
in second game and I think like the
third<00:02:37.680> game<00:02:37.829> was<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.129> main<00:02:38.280> game<00:02:38.549> like<00:02:38.790> I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
third game was the main game like I

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.470 
third game was the main game like I
don't<00:02:40.230> know<00:02:40.410> you're<00:02:41.340> very<00:02:41.489> analytical<00:02:42.030> about

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
don't know you're very analytical about

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.569 
don't know you're very analytical about
this<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.079> way<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.379> want<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:43.829> can<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.400> put

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
this is the way we want but can you put

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.720 
this is the way we want but can you put
into<00:02:44.700> words<00:02:44.849> how<00:02:45.560> important<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.709> was<00:02:46.769> this

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
into words how important this was this

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.259 
into words how important this was this
is<00:02:47.849> this<00:02:47.970> final<00:02:48.299> victory<00:02:48.599> here<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:50.060> think<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.239> is

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
is this final victory here I think it is

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.900 
is this final victory here I think it is
as<00:02:52.079> important<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:52.709> us<00:02:52.859> as<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.310> was<00:02:53.489> important

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
as important for us as it was important

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.800 
as important for us as it was important
for<00:02:53.940> them<00:02:54.150> like<00:02:55.250> both<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.280> our<00:02:56.670> teams<00:02:56.940> are<00:02:57.239> like

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
for them like both of our teams are like

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.920 
for them like both of our teams are like
that<00:02:58.609> maybe<00:02:59.609> it<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.910> be<00:03:00.060> already<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.599> legends

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
that maybe it can be already the legends

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
that maybe it can be already the legends
of<00:03:01.109> League<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.319> Legends<00:03:01.849> so<00:03:03.049> it's<00:03:04.049> like<00:03:04.200> the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
of League of Legends so it's like the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.009 
of League of Legends so it's like the
one<00:03:05.129> will<00:03:05.579> go<00:03:05.760> through<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.480> one<00:03:06.599> will<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:06.900> out

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
one will go through the one will be out

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.360 
one will go through the one will be out
so<00:03:07.970> where<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.000> go<00:03:09.180> through<00:03:09.560> yes<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.739> do<00:03:10.950> it

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.860
