00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.190
well I said that we have seen the
scale of do be in the whole record

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:13.049
as from the serious going up to the
half going through the spokesperson to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.740
record more and recorded half let's say
we still did not go we have not gone to the sharp

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.830
but we already have if the sun goes down

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.780
re my fa sun the yes do re my fa sun the yes do
up to the acute and what we're going to try

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:41.219
is with this same scale start doing
a game that gives us a sense

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:49.020
melodic as to be able
let's say to some extent start

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.160
type that is coming out of what is
the proper order of the scala as do

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.110
re my fa sun if we are not going to repeat
eternally the scale and it is not this

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.659
let's say a very nice music
scales are only to have

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.790
knowledge of the note that compose it
and a practical sense of the fingers

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.650
now we have to be to jump with the
fingers of irregular shape

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:28.320
around scale or if we have the
middle note that would be a good

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:36.450
area like to start practicing something
let's try to irregularly touch when playing

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.170
notes of the scale but do not leave from
very down towards a sharp note jumping

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.340
8 kilometers for example but around
of the note that we initiate the movement or

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.729
be

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:15.300
for example the do my re no, always
close to the side, the highs that more

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.900
advantage they can give you in principle are
towards a third for example of the no

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.310
we play the if we go to do it
that we are jumping a third this

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.970
case a minor third if we have a sun
we jump a fourth we go to the do or

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.290
be around not very large jumps
let's try to work over distances

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.980
Very short
for example or work on the hand

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.120
left nothing more
and I make a melody on that hand

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.709
I did not play with another hand other than
left do not include the right hand in

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:31.970
this game also let's say apart from
link the notes that are linked well and the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:40.790
sound is not cut is good also to
Repeat the notes because they do not have

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:49.030
why be let's say touched from one to one
all the notes one can grab and repeat and do

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.830

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.580
that is you you ru tu you is like
I'm repeating notes and adorned with other

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.050
notes this is more or less the idea so that
you are practicing on the note

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:43.740
of each of do and seek knowledge about
the sounds of this scale how to go

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.050
memorizing how are the sounds of this
scale and deal with it including

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.590
take out some topics that you know
by ear or maybe compose a bit their

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.490
own little melodies do not fear
Repeating a melody several times can

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.919
do it several times for a little
memorize them also good my name

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.580

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.580
