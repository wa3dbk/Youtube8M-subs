00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
it you'll see when I'm on offense kind

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.349 
it you'll see when I'm on offense kind
of<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> main<00:00:26.189> upgrade<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> made<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.330> I

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
of the main upgrade that I made or I

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.700 
of the main upgrade that I made or I
don't<00:00:27.630> know<00:00:27.689> if<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.869> consider<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.529> be<00:00:28.560> an

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
don't know if you consider it to be an

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.560 
don't know if you consider it to be an
upgrade<00:00:29.130> or<00:00:29.160> what<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.699> personally<00:00:30.240> thought<00:00:30.420> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
upgrade or what I personally thought it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.080 
upgrade or what I personally thought it
was<00:00:30.689> an<00:00:30.779> upgrade<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.399> think<00:00:32.460> he<00:00:32.730> plays<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
was an upgrade and I think he plays a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
was an upgrade and I think he plays a
little<00:00:33.510> bit<00:00:33.750> better<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.230> well<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:34.920> we'll<00:00:35.040> get

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
little bit better as well but we'll get

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.130 
little bit better as well but we'll get
to<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.309> when<00:00:35.550> i'm<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.850> offense<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:37.110> we

to that when i'm on offense so here we

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.780 
to that when i'm on offense so here we
are<00:00:37.320> guys<00:00:37.469> starting<00:00:37.860> things<00:00:38.040> off<00:00:38.190> by<00:00:38.399> defense

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
there with a nice pass and then he's

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610 
there with a nice pass and then he's
gonna<00:00:42.210> take<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> ball<00:00:42.840> up<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.140> middle<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.559> I

definitely<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.190> not<00:00:44.219> expecting<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.940> most

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
definitely was not expecting that most

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.660 
definitely was not expecting that most
people<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.260> not<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.980> run<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> ball<00:00:47.489> up

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
people are not going to run the ball up

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.610 
people are not going to run the ball up
the<00:00:47.910> middle<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.270> Jamal<00:00:48.719> Charles<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.559> is

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the middle with Jamal Charles this is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
the middle with Jamal Charles this is
kind<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.039> more<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.610> expect<00:00:51.120> he's<00:00:51.480> still

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
kind of more of what I expect he's still

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.090 
kind of more of what I expect he's still
got<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> big<00:00:52.050> play<00:00:52.289> even<00:00:52.530> though<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:52.860> kind<00:00:53.039> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
got a big play even though I was kind of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
got a big play even though I was kind of
expecting<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:53.760> most<00:00:54.510> people<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:54.840> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
expecting it but most people just you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.010 
expecting it but most people just you
know<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.300> gym<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.449> Charles<00:00:57.780> on

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
put him out at receiver here he didn't

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.490 
put him out at receiver here he didn't
have<00:01:43.950> anyone<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:44.909> covering<00:01:45.780> Marshawn

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
have anyone out there covering Marshawn

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.350 
have anyone out there covering Marshawn
Lynch<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> probably<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
Lynch and that is probably one of the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.179 
Lynch and that is probably one of the
easiest<00:01:48.390> touchdowns<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.649> had<00:01:49.860> all

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
easiest touchdowns that I have had all

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.639 
easiest touchdowns that I have had all
season<00:01:50.549> feeling<00:01:51.509> very<00:01:51.540> very<00:01:52.140> good<00:01:52.290> about<00:01:52.409> that

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
season feeling very very good about that

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.980 
season feeling very very good about that
one<00:01:52.860> definitely<00:01:53.040> outsmarted<00:01:53.880> him<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.149> don't

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
one definitely outsmarted him I don't

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
one definitely outsmarted him I don't
know<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.079> guess<00:01:55.259> he<00:01:55.470> was<00:01:55.560> probably<00:01:55.799> trying<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
know I guess he was probably trying to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.830 
know I guess he was probably trying to
base<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> line<00:01:57.180> or<00:01:57.360> something<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.780> that

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
base a line or something like that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.630 
base a line or something like that
toward<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.409> end<00:01:58.500> there<00:01:58.829> once<00:01:59.009> he<00:01:59.130> saw<00:01:59.340> Lynch

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
toward the end there once he saw Lynch

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.399 
toward the end there once he saw Lynch
go<00:01:59.820> out<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.659> guess<00:02:00.810> he<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:00.990> didn't<00:02:01.290> have

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
go out and I guess he just didn't have

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.139 
go out and I guess he just didn't have
the<00:02:01.439> time<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> get<00:02:01.950> him<00:02:02.070> out<00:02:02.159> there<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.549> time<00:02:02.909> so

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the time to get him out there in time so

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.850 
the time to get him out there in time so
we<00:02:03.270> are<00:02:03.420> gonna<00:02:03.540> tie<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:03.930> game<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:04.320> here<00:02:04.680> at

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
there's just absolutely no way because

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.070 
there's just absolutely no way because
it<00:04:45.460> just<00:04:45.580> feels<00:04:45.820> like<00:04:45.940> if<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.240> didn't<00:04:46.600> score<00:04:46.900> on

every drive in this game that I was

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.070 
every drive in this game that I was
going<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:48.790> have<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:48.970> really<00:04:49.300> really<00:04:49.540> tough<00:04:49.810> time

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080

much able to shut him down for the most
part<00:05:03.100> I<00:05:03.220> don't<00:05:03.370> think<00:05:03.550> he<00:05:03.670> really<00:05:03.940> gained

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
part I don't think he really gained

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.390 
part I don't think he really gained
anything<00:05:04.450> on<00:05:04.720> any<00:05:04.960> of<00:05:05.110> those<00:05:05.230> plays<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.800> he

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
anything on any of those plays and he

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.890 
anything on any of those plays and he
ran<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.790> on<00:05:06.880> third<00:05:07.210> down<00:05:07.420> for<00:05:07.450> some<00:05:07.870> reason

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
ran it on third down for some reason

there<00:05:08.350> which<00:05:08.590> then<00:05:08.920> set<00:05:09.130> up<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.340> really<00:05:09.670> long

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
there which then set up a really long

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.700 
there which then set up a really long
fourth<00:05:10.480> down<00:05:10.630> and<00:05:10.660> he<00:05:10.900> did<00:05:11.140> to<00:05:11.290> actually
