00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.580 
and two eyes of course but as you fire I
don't<00:02:07.970> know<00:02:08.060> if<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.209> can<00:02:08.330> see<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:08.569> there<00:02:08.810> but

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.449 
don't know if you can see it there but
it<00:02:09.860> lengthens<00:02:10.580> out<00:02:11.439> quickly<00:02:12.439> but<00:02:13.010> then<00:02:13.159> it

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
it lengthens out quickly but then it

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.149 
it lengthens out quickly but then it
comes<00:02:14.180> back<00:02:14.359> in<00:02:14.719> quickly<00:02:14.989> so<00:02:15.769> it's<00:02:15.950> accurate

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
comes back in quickly so it's accurate

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.700 
comes back in quickly so it's accurate
at<00:02:16.579> one<00:02:16.730> point<00:02:16.909> for<00:02:17.870> like<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:17.989> second<00:02:18.349> attacker

it<00:02:18.740> for<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:18.980> second<00:02:19.310> it's<00:02:19.430> inaccurate<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.390> it's

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
it for a second it's inaccurate so it's

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.560 
it for a second it's inaccurate so it's
kind<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.810> wonky<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.960> now<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:26.090> smiley

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
which is good but then the accuracy it

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.050 
which is good but then the accuracy it
goes<00:04:41.140> down<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.680> with<00:04:42.310> this<00:04:42.460> gun<00:04:42.640> it's<00:04:42.850> already

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
goes down and with this gun it's already

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.400 
goes down and with this gun it's already
inaccurate<00:04:43.570> enough<00:04:44.790> it<00:04:45.790> also<00:04:45.820> has<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.410> pretty

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
inaccurate enough it also has a pretty

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.730 
inaccurate enough it also has a pretty
low<00:04:47.800> fire<00:04:48.160> rate<00:04:48.690> like<00:04:49.690> for<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.110> Vlad<00:04:50.320> off<00:04:50.470> it's

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
low fire rate like for a Vlad off it's

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.160 
low fire rate like for a Vlad off it's
six<00:04:51.130> point<00:04:51.370> seven<00:04:51.700> with<00:04:52.090> all<00:04:52.540> of<00:04:52.750> them<00:04:52.870> are<00:04:52.990> six

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
six point seven with all of them are six

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.480 
six point seven with all of them are six
point<00:04:53.380> seven<00:04:53.470> I<00:04:53.650> think<00:04:53.680> it's<00:04:53.920> locked<00:04:54.160> to<00:04:54.340> that

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
point seven I think it's locked to that

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.190 
point seven I think it's locked to that
because<00:04:54.820> all<00:04:55.060> for<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.750> ones<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:56.020> have<00:04:56.170> here

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
because all for the ones I have here

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.310 
because all for the ones I have here
that's<00:04:56.950> what<00:04:57.160> they<00:04:57.280> are<00:04:57.660> now<00:04:58.660> if<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:58.930> noticed

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
that's what they are now if you noticed

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.730 
that's what they are now if you noticed
the<00:04:59.950> gun<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.460> like<00:05:01.410> when<00:05:02.410> you're<00:05:02.530> halfway

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
the gun it like when you're halfway

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.710 
the gun it like when you're halfway
through<00:05:02.950> firing<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.580> it<00:05:03.730> fires<00:05:04.060> faster<00:05:04.330> that's

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
through firing it it fires faster that's

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.900 
through firing it it fires faster that's
just<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:04.960> gauge<00:05:05.170> thing<00:05:05.440> that's<00:05:05.620> not<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.830> gun<00:05:06.010> so

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
just a gauge thing that's not the gun so

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.010 
just a gauge thing that's not the gun so
if<00:05:06.970> you're<00:05:07.090> not<00:05:07.150> playing<00:05:07.390> as<00:05:07.540> gauge<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:07.960> I

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
if you're not playing as gauge and I

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.360 
if you're not playing as gauge and I
have<00:05:08.110> like<00:05:08.230> a<00:05:08.260> fire<00:05:08.530> rate<00:05:08.740> bonus<00:05:09.040> or<00:05:09.160> something

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
have like a fire rate bonus or something

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.520 
have like a fire rate bonus or something
like<00:05:09.460> that<00:05:09.700> it's<00:05:10.510> just<00:05:10.750> going<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:10.930> shoot<00:05:11.230> like

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
like that it's just going to shoot like

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.370 
like that it's just going to shoot like
that<00:05:11.800> fast<00:05:12.430> right<00:05:12.670> there<00:05:15.270> now<00:05:16.270> I<00:05:16.600> didn't<00:05:17.260> get

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
that fast right there now I didn't get

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.470 
that fast right there now I didn't get
to<00:05:17.590> show<00:05:17.800> you<00:05:17.860> guys<00:05:18.130> too<00:05:18.430> much<00:05:18.520> corrosive<00:05:19.210> in

to show you guys too much corrosive in

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.760 
to show you guys too much corrosive in
that<00:05:19.720> clip<00:05:19.990> because<00:05:20.110> there<00:05:20.290> was<00:05:20.410> like<00:05:20.470> one

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
that clip because there was like one

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.370 
that clip because there was like one
armored<00:05:21.100> maniac<00:05:21.630> so<00:05:22.630> I'm<00:05:22.930> going<00:05:23.260> with<00:05:23.290> the

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
armored maniac so I'm going with the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.450 
armored maniac so I'm going with the
loaders<00:05:23.770> now<00:05:23.890> as<00:05:24.010> you<00:05:24.100> can<00:05:24.190> see<00:05:24.310> right<00:05:24.370> here

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
loaders now as you can see right here

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.850 
loaders now as you can see right here
that<00:05:24.790> spread<00:05:25.480> perfect<00:05:26.260> for<00:05:26.410> loaders<00:05:26.680> it's

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
that spread perfect for loaders it's

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.190 
that spread perfect for loaders it's
like<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.070> infinity<00:05:27.430> pistol<00:05:27.820> because<00:05:28.000> as<00:05:28.480> it's

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
like the infinity pistol because as it's

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.980 
like the infinity pistol because as it's
going<00:05:29.470> out<00:05:29.590> it<00:05:30.070> hits<00:05:30.760> them<00:05:31.060> in<00:05:31.210> their<00:05:31.600> joints

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
going out it hits them in their joints

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.830 
going out it hits them in their joints
where<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.530> criticals<00:05:32.919> are<00:05:33.070> just<00:05:33.820> tears<00:05:34.630> off

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
where the criticals are just tears off

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.870 
where the criticals are just tears off
their<00:05:35.110> arms<00:05:35.410> and<00:05:35.530> then<00:05:36.010> as<00:05:36.130> it<00:05:36.250> comes<00:05:36.430> back<00:05:36.610> in

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
their arms and then as it comes back in

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.000 
their arms and then as it comes back in
it<00:05:37.540> gets<00:05:37.780> them<00:05:38.020> in<00:05:38.169> their<00:05:38.410> eye<00:05:38.440> which<00:05:38.980> is

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
it gets them in their eye which is

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.310 
it gets them in their eye which is
another<00:05:39.310> critical<00:05:39.550> point<00:05:40.080> so<00:05:41.080> it<00:05:41.140> just

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
another critical point so it just

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.350 
another critical point so it just
destroys<00:05:41.860> them<00:05:42.100> you<00:05:42.220> get<00:05:42.310> up<00:05:42.460> close<00:05:42.730> there

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
destroys them you get up close there
