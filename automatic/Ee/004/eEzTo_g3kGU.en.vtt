see<00:01:54.960> when<00:01:55.170> they<00:01:55.290> hit<00:01:55.439> each<00:01:55.500> other<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.070> shoot

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
see when they hit each other the shoot

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
see when they hit each other the shoot
dies<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> shoot<00:01:57.329> goes<00:01:57.540> away<00:01:57.719> rather

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
dies or the shoot goes away rather

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.889 
dies or the shoot goes away rather
doesn't<00:01:58.439> die<00:01:58.590> shoots<00:01:59.040> inanimate<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.719> goes

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
doesn't die shoots inanimate but it goes

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.770 
doesn't die shoots inanimate but it goes
away<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.469> then<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:02.579> robot<00:02:03.030> falls<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
away and then your robot falls to the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.179 
away and then your robot falls to the
ground<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.380> gets<00:02:04.590> carried<00:02:04.829> away<00:02:04.890> by<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
ground and gets carried away by the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.249 
ground and gets carried away by the
conveyor<00:02:05.549> belt<00:02:05.820> at<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.000> bottom<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:06.990> want

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
conveyor belt at the bottom so you want

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.660 
conveyor belt at the bottom so you want
to<00:02:07.350> use<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.649> power<00:02:07.770> zona<00:02:08.160> not<00:02:08.340> only<00:02:08.489> four

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
to use the power zona not only four

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.070 
to use the power zona not only four
points<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.300> gets<00:02:09.390> ready<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.720> robots

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
points but it gets ready to robots

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.740 
points but it gets ready to robots
faster<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.910> see<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.629> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
faster and as you can see that is the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.640 
faster and as you can see that is the
way<00:02:12.930> you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
way you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.839 
way you
want<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.829> do<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.159> you<00:02:14.310> want<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.489> break<00:02:14.670> your

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
want to do it you want to break your

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.960 
want to do it you want to break your
high<00:02:15.000> score<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.530> want<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.829> be<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.250> leader

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970

that there will be other robots that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.059 
that there will be other robots that
come<00:02:27.900> out<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.170> they're<00:02:28.230> really<00:02:28.409> cool<00:02:28.680> i<00:02:28.739> mean

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.649 
come out and they're really cool i mean
the<00:02:29.280> designs<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.909> robots<00:02:30.269> are<00:02:30.450> pretty

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
the designs and the robots are pretty

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.839 
the designs and the robots are pretty
neat<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.109> graphics<00:02:31.560> are<00:02:31.680> sweet<00:02:32.010> their

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849

and<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:40.470> know<00:02:40.560> as<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:40.769> can<00:02:41.040> see<00:02:41.220> i'm<00:02:41.400> doing

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
and you know as you can see i'm doing

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.390 
and you know as you can see i'm doing
much<00:02:41.909> better<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.390> round<00:02:42.450> because<00:02:42.870> i'm<00:02:43.109> not

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
much better this round because i'm not

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.640 
much better this round because i'm not
focusing<00:02:44.400> on<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:45.329> camera<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:45.959> much<00:02:46.200> as<00:02:46.349> i<00:02:46.470> am

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
focusing on the camera as much as i am

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.089 
focusing on the camera as much as i am
on<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:46.950> gameplay<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:49.260> let's<00:02:49.440> see<00:02:49.650> if<00:02:49.769> we<00:02:49.920> can

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
on the gameplay so let's see if we can

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:57.319 
on the gameplay so let's see if we can
jam<00:02:50.430> out<00:02:50.639> to<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:51.239> loop<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.879> can<00:02:57.030> move<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
jam out to this loop so you can move the

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.670 
jam out to this loop so you can move the
robots<00:02:57.690> too<00:02:57.959> by<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.230> way<00:03:00.049> hope<00:03:01.049> lost<00:03:01.349> one

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
robots too by the way hope lost one

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:14.300 
robots too by the way hope lost one
still<00:03:02.609> hanging<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:02.939> there<00:03:03.000> though

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.500 

hang<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:15.489> there<00:03:15.519> you're<00:03:15.970> going<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.180> see<00:03:16.330> some

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
hang in there you're going to see some

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.530 
hang in there you're going to see some
other<00:03:16.599> robots<00:03:17.050> I'm<00:03:17.200> pretty<00:03:17.440> confident<00:03:21.540> there

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
other robots I'm pretty confident there

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.039 
other robots I'm pretty confident there
we<00:03:22.629> go<00:03:27.150> so<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.239> got<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.390> guy<00:03:28.659> with<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.840> hat
