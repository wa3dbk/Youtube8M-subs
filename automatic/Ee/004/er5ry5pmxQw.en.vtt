 we 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.840
 for 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.840
 tomorrow 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.860
 at the time of laundry that is to say that 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.430
 the proposed songs are sorted by 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.920
 easy order of difficulty for 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.739
 calves intermediate beginners for

 of those who interpreted by the hand 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:20.750
 will suffice today relay trouble to

 Tuesday morning 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:02:00.880
 chavez of being where we leave him 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.880
 place in mollo 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.869
 sting first 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.800
 by the way, look at us tell us 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.140
 mollo 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.980
 gic seduced 2 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.800
 I 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:57.340
 and Gibraltar mosson on the mind of 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:03:00.850
 two males seek together decomposed 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.880
 in four elements the words the 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.390
 chords the accompaniment of tonight the 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.980
 title or by mark pages and complexion 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.650
 disagreement in this method we're going 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.490
 use the universal encryption that's at 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:22.540
 say we will use letters a 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:28.090
 and it's def and ga for example it's 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:31.030
 peace it's the ccc the back ercis 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.000
 in the diagram reason for the position 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.560
 of the race the neck of the guitar 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.209
 the six horizontal lines or 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.880
 vertical everything depends on the passion of the 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.060
 drawing represents the six strings of the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.489
 guitar the half fare represents the knows 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.820
 the vertical lines are the 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.860
 touch balls that separates the squares the 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.660
 number in a circle tells us the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.260
 finger to be asked and in what 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.830
 place the task usually of the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.310
 following way the thought thumb in the 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.690
 base card ie to compare a 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.019
 fifth and sixth round 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.959
 the index paints his third when the 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.890
 major by the second door and the 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.840
 light goes first the pace for 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.709
 facilitate the understanding of rhythms 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.110
 we use onomatopoeia to the MP 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.050
 end to define the different sounds 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:31.270
 we will have no grades and sounds 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.750
 and the central opera dom can not 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.730
 him not 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.990
 on the guitar we will use the thumb 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.950
 from the right hand to get the doom 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.680
 usually by attacking the fangs 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.670
 serious and we will use the index for 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.050
 get the tac by attacking the transits 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.600
 in this method we propose you 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.880
 here the pickups used him in the 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.870
 Kabyle song of Kabyle players 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.870
 cascade 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.930
 2 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:22.730
 at the lease of four of the rallies 6.8 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.580
 simple rumba of 4 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.980
 bada the bone 6 8 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:12.320
 2 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.320
 and the result takes 4 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.369
 theme theme and melody 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:35.969
 principal the taken throughout the 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:39.389
 song the telethon will not be beaten and 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:41.639
 in solfeggio tablatures is first of all 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.469
 the six lines representing the six 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.379
 guitar strings in the position 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:49.289
 laid flat on the knees bicycle ropes 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:51.779
 then the numbers representing the boxes 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:52.770
 on which fingers must be pressed 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:55.949
 left hand 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.800
 for example the Lombard 2 on the 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:01.050
 fourth line between montceau duo 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:06.409
 means that a finger finger pressed on the 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.409
 4th string in box two in Switzerland 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:19.490
 the extent to bind a hatch to the 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.490
 most fat drug 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.170
 and now at 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.170
 but for
