over his head

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.460 
over his head
it's<00:01:17.790> similar<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.930> product<00:01:19.380> that's

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
it's similar to that one product that's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.649 
it's similar to that one product that's
out<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.159> sponge<00:01:20.549> product<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.390> don't<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.570> if

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
out that sponge product I don't know if

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
out that sponge product I don't know if
any<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.990> heard<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> product

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
any of you heard of that but the product

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.910 
any of you heard of that but the product
where<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.090> has<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.720> holes<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> sponge<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
where it has the holes in the sponge and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.920 
where it has the holes in the sponge and
they<00:01:26.369> take<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> sponge<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.299> rub<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
they take the sponge and just rub in a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.260 
they take the sponge and just rub in a
circular<00:01:28.170> motion<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:29.460> kind<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
circular motion it's kind of like that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.480 
circular motion it's kind of like that
but<00:01:30.689> I'm<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.710> using<00:01:31.890> my<00:01:32.040> hands<00:01:32.430> instead<00:01:33.439> and

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
but I'm just using my hands instead and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.830 
but I'm just using my hands instead and
the<00:01:35.490> reason<00:01:35.729> why<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> did<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.270> circular<00:01:36.659> motion

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the reason why I did a circular motion

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.670 
the reason why I did a circular motion
is<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.880> enhance<00:01:38.880> its<00:01:39.030> curl<00:01:39.270> pattern<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.049> I'm

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
is to enhance its curl pattern and I'm

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.710 
is to enhance its curl pattern and I'm
seeing<00:01:40.950> some<00:01:41.189> curls<00:01:41.579> already<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.630> want

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
seeing some curls already but I want

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.560 
seeing some curls already but I want
more<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.470> compounding<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.310> I'm<00:01:45.030> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> get

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
more for compounding so I'm going to get

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.630 
more for compounding so I'm going to get
a<00:01:45.600> little<00:01:45.780> bit<00:01:45.960> more<00:01:46.200> gel<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.579> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
a little bit more gel so if I have to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.789 
a little bit more gel so if I have to
same<00:01:47.820> amount<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.240> had<00:01:48.329> before<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.170> I'm

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
same amount that I had before and I'm

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.859 
same amount that I had before and I'm
going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.220> apply<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.030> areas<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.360> needs

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
going to apply to the areas that needs

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.110 

okay<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.770> it's<00:02:23.950> also<00:02:24.100> great<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.550> do<00:02:24.670> this<00:02:24.820> kind

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.530 
of style on hair that is already wet but
his<00:02:29.050> hair<00:02:29.230> would<00:02:29.320> stay<00:02:29.500> up<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.770> that's<00:02:29.950> fine

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
his hair would stay up so that's fine

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.200 
his hair would stay up so that's fine
so<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:32.220> think<00:02:33.220> I'll<00:02:33.460> do<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.610> little<00:02:33.790> bit<00:02:34.000> more

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
so I think I'll do a little bit more

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:47.850 
so I think I'll do a little bit more
insight<00:02:44.070> okay<00:02:45.930> not<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.140> I'm<00:02:47.230> done<00:02:47.440> with<00:02:47.650> that

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
insight okay not and I'm done with that

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.090 
insight okay not and I'm done with that
I<00:02:48.480> top<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.630> off<00:02:49.810> with<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.290> extra<00:02:50.620> virgin<00:02:50.770> olive

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
I top it off with the extra virgin olive

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.740 
I top it off with the extra virgin olive
oil<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.850> reason<00:02:52.090> why<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.240> use<00:02:52.330> this

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
oil and the reason why I use this

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.260 
oil and the reason why I use this
product<00:02:53.080> is<00:02:53.320> because<00:02:53.550> it's<00:02:54.550> great<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.030> feel<00:02:55.209> a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
product is because it's great to feel a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.330 
product is because it's great to feel a
moister<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:55.959> also<00:02:56.440> like<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.800> shine<00:02:57.040> in<00:02:57.310> it

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
moister and also like the shine in it

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.580 
moister and also like the shine in it
