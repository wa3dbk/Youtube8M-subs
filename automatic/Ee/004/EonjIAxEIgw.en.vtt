Hi, I'm Ciro Oliva of pizzeria Oliva da Concettina ai Tre Santi in Napoli

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.500
next to me there's my teacher and uncle Salvatore Oliva

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
now let's make a capricious pizza

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the first step is the dough preparation

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to make a good dough at home you need 1l of water, 1,5kg of flour, 25gr of yeast and 60gr of salt

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
it must be worked by hands very well

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
here the dough!

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the final product

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
2,5kg of dough

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The second step is the pizza rolling

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
this is our final product

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
let's put it in the flour

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
just a little bit

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
this is the pizza rolling

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.000
and now the pizza stuffing

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
let's put some San Marzano tomato

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
80gr fiordilatte made near Caserta

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
do not forget the edge crust must be wide to help the pizza rising

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
then Neapolitan salami

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and some champignon mushrooms

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.500
to make this wonderful capricious pizza

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
put some grated cheese

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and 6/8gr of oil

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The third step is the pizza baking

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
let's put the last 3gr of oil

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.500
and the pizza is ready!
