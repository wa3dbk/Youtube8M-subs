00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
application so I'm going to take this

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.080 
application so I'm going to take this
sponge<00:02:21.880> here<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.770> open<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:23.860> up<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.640> now<00:02:24.670> I'll

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
sponge here and open it up and now I'll

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.990 
sponge here and open it up and now I'll
go<00:02:25.270> ahead<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.990> press<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.770> on<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.640> sponge

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
go ahead and press it on to the sponge

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.860 
go ahead and press it on to the sponge
sponge<00:02:28.810> onto<00:02:29.110> sponge<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.730> releases<00:02:31.150> this

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
sponge onto sponge and it releases this

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.110 
sponge onto sponge and it releases this
as<00:02:32.170> mentioned<00:02:32.980> before<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.550> very<00:02:33.820> thin

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
as mentioned before this very thin

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.270 
as mentioned before this very thin
liquid<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:35.740> shade<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:37.260> great<00:02:38.260> for<00:02:38.860> the

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
liquid and this shade is great for the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.490 
liquid and this shade is great for the
NC<00:02:40.270> 20<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.740> 25<00:02:42.430> ranged<00:02:43.030> skin<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.750> think<00:02:44.320> maybe

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
NC 20 to 25 ranged skin I think maybe

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.060 
NC 20 to 25 ranged skin I think maybe
even<00:02:44.650> those<00:02:45.220> with<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.870> NW<00:02:46.870> skin<00:02:47.350> tone<00:02:47.650> could

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
even those with a NW skin tone could

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.440 
even those with a NW skin tone could
probably<00:02:48.310> get<00:02:48.550> away<00:02:48.700> with<00:02:48.880> this<00:02:49.000> it's<00:02:49.270> fairly

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
probably get away with this it's fairly

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.930 
probably get away with this it's fairly

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
neutral but what I've just done as I'm

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.020 
neutral but what I've just done as I'm
speaking<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:53.350> press<00:02:53.770> it<00:02:54.010> into<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
speaking is just press it into the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.900 
speaking is just press it into the
sponge<00:02:55.510> area<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.260> then<00:02:56.709> I'm<00:02:56.860> pressing<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:57.730> or

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
patting it onto my skin right now you

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.180 
patting it onto my skin right now you
can<00:03:01.030> already<00:03:01.390> see<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:02.650> completely

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
can already see that it's completely

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
day and I'm pressing again and I just

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.080 
day and I'm pressing again and I just
press<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:12.970> right<00:03:13.270> into<00:03:15.959> my<00:03:16.959> face<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.910> find<00:03:18.910> that

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
press it right into my face I find that

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.449 
press it right into my face I find that
this<00:03:19.330> pressing<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.110> patting<00:03:20.709> motion<00:03:21.160> is

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
this pressing and patting motion is

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.509 
this pressing and patting motion is
infinitely<00:03:22.360> preferable<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:23.410> trying<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.100> swipe

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
infinitely preferable to trying to swipe

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.400 
infinitely preferable to trying to swipe

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
pressing just makes all the difference

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.479 
pressing just makes all the difference
in<00:03:32.050> terms<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.680> melding<00:03:33.670> with<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.000> skin<00:03:34.330> and

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
fragrance products because my skin is so

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.440 
fragrance products because my skin is so
sensitive<00:03:55.660> as<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:57.160> know<00:03:57.220> many<00:03:57.580> people's<00:03:58.030> are

but<00:03:59.230> in<00:03:59.560> this<00:03:59.980> case<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:00.519> have<00:04:00.790> used<00:04:01.030> this<00:04:01.150> for<00:04:01.209> a

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
but in this case I have used this for a

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.970 
but in this case I have used this for a
few<00:04:01.660> weeks<00:04:01.690> now<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.260> haven't<00:04:02.500> had<00:04:02.650> any

negative reactions which I'm thankful

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.120 
negative reactions which I'm thankful
for<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:06.180> keep<00:04:07.180> patting<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:08.080> in<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.799> can<00:04:08.920> see

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
for so keep patting it in you can see

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.150 
for so keep patting it in you can see
it's<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:09.910> light<00:04:10.299> that<00:04:10.330> you<00:04:10.660> cannot<00:04:11.320> even

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
it's so light that you cannot even

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
perceive it on the skin per se but it

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.469 
perceive it on the skin per se but it
does<00:04:17.500> yield<00:04:18.220> coverage<00:04:18.669> I<00:04:18.790> already<00:04:19.090> look<00:04:19.269> more

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
does yield coverage I already look more

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.890 
does yield coverage I already look more
even<00:04:19.930> there's<00:04:20.650> also<00:04:20.919> kind<00:04:21.280> of<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.520> satin<00:04:22.120> matte

definitely not shiny or shimmery and and
I<00:04:28.620> really<00:04:28.919> prefer<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:29.690> type<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.930> finish<00:04:31.500> when

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
I really prefer that type of finish when

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.580 
I really prefer that type of finish when
I'm<00:04:32.460> applying<00:04:32.819> foundation<00:04:33.199> apply<00:04:34.199> this<00:04:34.289> on<00:04:34.560> my

entire face takes me about 60 seconds of
concerted<00:04:37.560> effort<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.550> might<00:04:38.910> just<00:04:38.940> finish

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
concerted effort so I might just finish

shade<00:07:27.600> range<00:07:27.900> so<00:07:28.110> it's<00:07:28.260> unfortunate<00:07:28.410> that

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:28.980 
shade range so it's unfortunate that

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.070

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.450 
into account skin tones lighter than 20
it's<00:07:33.930> certainly<00:07:34.230> darker<00:07:34.710> than<00:07:34.860> 40<00:07:35.220> and<00:07:35.370> I'm
