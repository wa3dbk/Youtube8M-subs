tricks because a heap chart and yeah so
before<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.160> try<00:00:32.310> this<00:00:32.400> trick<00:00:32.580> you're

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
before you try this trick you're

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.890 
before you try this trick you're
probably<00:00:33.180> gonna<00:00:33.390> want<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> learn<00:00:33.750> how<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
probably gonna want to learn how to

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.160 
probably gonna want to learn how to
board<00:00:34.440> side<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.950> front<00:00:35.430> side<00:00:35.640> one-eighty

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
board side and front side one-eighty

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.270 
board side and front side one-eighty
before<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.350> try<00:00:37.650> to<00:00:37.710> lift<00:00:37.920> side<00:00:38.160> you're

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
before you try to lift side you're

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.860 
before you try to lift side you're
probably<00:00:38.430> gonna<00:00:38.610> wanna<00:00:38.820> shut<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:39.180> or<00:00:39.570> sign<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
probably gonna wanna shut up or sign a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.170 
probably gonna wanna shut up or sign a
couple<00:00:40.260> times<00:00:40.440> first<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:41.190> feel<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.150> know

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
couple times first just feel you know

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.330 
couple times first just feel you know
which<00:00:42.960> wax<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> need<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> lean

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
which wax is on it you need to lean

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.549 
which wax is on it you need to lean
forward<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:44.879> lean<00:00:45.090> back<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.720> whatever<00:00:46.350> just

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
forward and lean back or whatever just

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.390 
forward and lean back or whatever just
get<00:00:46.800> comfortable

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
get comfortable

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.150 
get comfortable
so<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.850> approach<00:00:48.150> the<00:00:48.420> route<00:00:49.160> you're

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so you approach the route you're

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.880 
so you approach the route you're
probably<00:00:50.940> gonna<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.300> about<00:00:51.810> same<00:00:52.410> speed<00:00:52.770> as

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
probably gonna have about same speed as

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.319 
probably gonna have about same speed as
the<00:00:53.010> board<00:00:53.220> sign<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.610> maybe<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:54.030> faster

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the board sign or maybe a little faster

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.479 
the board sign or maybe a little faster
you're<00:00:55.110> gonna<00:00:55.200> have<00:00:55.380> your<00:00:55.530> front<00:00:55.800> foot<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
you're gonna have your front foot in the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.910 
you're gonna have your front foot in the
same<00:00:56.700> position<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.300> board<00:00:57.600> side<00:00:57.920> back

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
same position as the board side back

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.400 
same position as the board side back
foot<00:00:59.250> same<00:00:59.640> position<00:01:00.239> maybe<00:01:00.840> add<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> little

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
foot same position maybe add a little

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.410 
foot same position maybe add a little
bit<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.649> an<00:01:01.890> angle<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.460> you're<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.210> want

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
bit of an angle and you're going to want

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.420 
bit of an angle and you're going to want
to<00:01:03.480> pop<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.080> your<00:01:04.199> back<00:01:04.470> truck<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.100> little

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
to pop so your back truck a little

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.070 
to pop so your back truck a little
higher<00:01:05.700> than<00:01:05.910> a<00:01:05.940> board<00:01:06.180> says<00:01:06.390> your<00:01:06.600> back<00:01:06.810> truck

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
higher than a board says your back truck

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.469 
higher than a board says your back truck
gets<00:01:07.259> over<00:01:07.649> the<00:01:07.770> rail<00:01:07.950> trying<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> center

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
gets over the rail trying in the center

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.290 
gets over the rail trying in the center
you<00:01:10.110> know<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:10.830> pretty<00:01:11.250> much<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.759> like

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
you know and then pretty much it's like

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.490 
you know and then pretty much it's like
a<00:01:12.330> board<00:01:12.630> side<00:01:12.869> from<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:14.190> come<00:01:14.820> out<00:01:15.500> go

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
a board side from there just come out go

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.710 
a board side from there just come out go
for<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.800> best

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
for the best

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.080 
for the best
hopefully<00:01:18.720> roll<00:01:18.930> away<00:01:19.160> for<00:01:20.160> me<00:01:20.340> most<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
hopefully roll away for me most of the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.390 
hopefully roll away for me most of the
most<00:01:21.539> of<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.899> of<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.320> trick<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.770> pretty<00:01:23.159> much

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
most of it of the trick is pretty much

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
most of it of the trick is pretty much
all<00:01:23.760> commitment<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.900> want<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.260> know

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
all commitment is you want to you know

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.800 
all commitment is you want to you know
there's<00:01:26.100> no<00:01:26.310> second<00:01:26.909> guessing<00:01:27.030> yourself<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
there's no second guessing yourself you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
there's no second guessing yourself you
just<00:01:27.869> got<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> fully<00:01:28.409> go<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:29.790> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
just got to fully go for it so if you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.390 
just got to fully go for it so if you
come<00:01:30.690> up<00:01:30.840> short<00:01:31.100> half-assing<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.310> know

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
come up short half-assing it you know

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.840 
come up short half-assing it you know
you<00:01:32.580> could<00:01:32.729> come<00:01:32.909> down<00:01:33.710> this<00:01:34.710> cue<00:01:34.979> balls<00:01:35.189> go<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
you could come down this cue balls go to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.630 
you could come down this cue balls go to
sack<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:37.619> full<00:01:37.979> commit<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.430> have

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
sack so go full commit they have

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.240 
sack so go full commit they have
confidence<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.540> one<00:01:39.770> gotta<00:01:40.770> take<00:01:41.010> it<00:01:41.130> all

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
confidence on this one gotta take it all

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.420 
confidence on this one gotta take it all
the<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:41.510> one<00:01:42.510> thing<00:01:42.799> how<00:01:43.799> definitely<00:01:44.280> watch

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the way one thing how definitely watch

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.749 
the way one thing how definitely watch
out<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.850> too<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.360> leaning<00:01:46.080> forward<00:01:46.110> too<00:01:46.710> much

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
out for too is leaning forward too much

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.450 
out for too is leaning forward too much
having<00:01:47.759> way<00:01:47.970> too<00:01:48.000> much<00:01:48.570> forward<00:01:48.930> momentum

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
having way too much forward momentum

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.859 
having way too much forward momentum
because<00:01:50.460> sometimes<00:01:51.030> when<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.360> land<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
because sometimes when we land on the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.990 
because sometimes when we land on the
rail<00:01:52.080> you're<00:01:52.830> lean<00:01:53.009> waiting<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.850> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
rail you're lean waiting for it and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.510 
rail you're lean waiting for it and
you're<00:01:54.150> fully<00:01:54.509> committed<00:01:54.720> you're<00:01:55.680> flying<00:01:56.070> off

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
you're fully committed you're flying off

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.590 
you're fully committed you're flying off
the<00:01:56.580> rail<00:01:57.119> off<00:01:57.360> your<00:01:57.600> board

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.000 

all<00:02:04.600> right<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:04.930> yeah<00:02:05.140> that's<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.590> lipslide

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
all right so yeah that's the lipslide

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.940 
all right so yeah that's the lipslide
it's<00:02:06.250> one<00:02:06.670> of<00:02:06.730> my<00:02:06.820> favorite<00:02:07.150> tricks<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:08.740> fun

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
it's one of my favorite tricks it's fun
