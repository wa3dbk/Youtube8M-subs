00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.870
 are the zeros 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.510
 or keep 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.930
 what excuses are from losers to me I do not 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.930
 I was looking for 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.170
 you that the prison is too clear 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.010
 too clear the criminal I want through 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.230
 from too light to I read it as 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.500
 and not remove it operational examples the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.990
 habit to know this 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.750
 decisions 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.090
 They seemed like they could be for our 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:43.120
 favor has not favored us and this is 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:45.489
 wrong but mine also think that I 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.949
 they made it was valid Mr. Clos and 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.199
 the Galician gentleman lie 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.460
 and as he lies in recourse he can not finish 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.809
 the match with the same cards that 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.790
 one that only dedicates itself to being there and 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.500
 interrupt the game interrupt care 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.200
 it's not that we do not realize what 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.800
 what's going on 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.690
 but through too clear dale 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.430
 to chop him father who guardiola not 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.850
 I would have reacted like that but in a 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.040
 championship eliminator is different 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.200
 especially if the decision prevents the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.340
 boat gets with a 30 at 20 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.170
 match minutes 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.930
 that's why he insists you be in 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.880
 anti once and again 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.880
 and that's why he curses even in English 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.840
 and that's why when your delegate in your 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.790
 head convince him that the best is 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.590
 that he returns to his place is life who 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.030
 governs his actions and forces him to 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.940
 settle again with the room 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.650
 referee when the referee expels him 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.560
 he does not react he stays following the game 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.510
 with the lost look absent and in the end 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.820
 He leaves the bench as if he did not have 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.350
 self-will before the amazement of everything 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.350
 Camp Nou and its players 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.490
 and a point that I think is that 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.490
 they take the duels as personal 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.820
 normal and as the decision is already 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.440
 defined minimum premeditated 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.070
 but I am very proud you can not 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.070
 save 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.010
 two 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.810
 your kitchen 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.700
 but to elevate the very superb tenacity 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.470
 it can not 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.530
 and to order 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.540
 and answers badly right away to the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.540
 saint with sagasta and card and 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.740
 single 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.740
 the truth 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.560
 i 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.590
 italy gave us free rein to their 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.090
 joy in the water of the sprinklers 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.190
 of the visiting bench suffered the 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.780
 consequences too 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.910
 I have been told that it was for the 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.670
 Inter fans who wanted to jump 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.860
 to the field and that's not 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.350
 although the tifosi were above the 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.480
 everything in him 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.120
 or as last night explained laporta in the 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.949
 interview 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.610
 after a game a little water 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.610
 it never hurts 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.289
 guardiola was chatting with the room 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.480
 referee at that time the goal seemed 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.260
 catch him by surprise since he got 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.260
 I already had 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.949
 reaction at the first moment the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.139
 players were paralyzed all 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.690
 minus one knows suddenly appeared with 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.970
 his reasoning saying that not that goal 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.150
 it was legal and that's how he ran by the 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.919
 direct band to tell the assistant 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.680
 when he arrived he was already surrounded so 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.750
 he got in there as best he could and stayed by 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.569
 two while rosemary stops certified 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.940
 his decision while xavi went to 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.910
 the line guardiola he made then took 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.220
 another course went to where it was 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.080
 because I just needed one thing to see the 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.910
 repetition of the play on the monitor 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.760
 of the barça tv I hope it is 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.630
 it came with attention all your attention 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.820
 and smile 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.400
 while Xavi was doing his thing but the 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.080
 assistant managed to get away from that he believed and 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.750
 it was there when he was hooked guardiola 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.090
 I had just seen the network did not seem 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.130
 congratulate him 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.180
 A little bit still denied the decision with 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.090
 head 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.639
 go face standing to xavi furious the ipc 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.430
 insisted he has not been offside by 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.990
 this for this to selective xàbia that 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.870
 stop the delegate of barça carles 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.400
 naval because it was launched by him in what 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.199
 that remained of game they did not stop 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.630
 to challenge xàbia voices from the 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:58.720
 Guardiola bench in the body a 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.400
 body without rest and by the way the thing 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:06.449
 I was just going with the cut with the room 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.449
 referee there was so far 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:12.520
 twenty 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.520
