00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 her friends with you woody and in the street 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.899
 no longer June 23 but Batman 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.120
 eye on um I finished going through only 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.040
 yesterday and would like to share with you my 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.690
 I would like to think about this game 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.120
 start with the fact that I'm a fan of redistribution 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.820
 the series played all the previous parts and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.550
 even old games on consoles like sega 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.560
 black even read the original book 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.539
 when still bespectacled and bespectacled 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.699
 hairy hobbits never even heard 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.039
 although in real life the prospect of reading a book 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.439
 can in 3 class silly so kimi 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.450
 and galloping across the rooftops of the city Ivan shock 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.489
 every street tribe I am at first 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.430
 did not tell me my soul but does 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.100
 fuck plan so I started reading not quite 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.809
 not for nothing that this universe I sucked like hell 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.809
 no worse than hypno toad scultura to 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.370
 but let's get back to the game last 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.950
 The final part of the dilogy turned out to be 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.989
 for me very ambiguous even in different 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.050
 thieves gaming magazines have already appreciated the game 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.960
 on the power of fuck and go spend you 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.059
 handhelds for 1 jack and not black jack 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.140
 I personally had a very different 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.840
 opinion about the game and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.210
 1 and the main cant start the game on the PC 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.720
 such a launch is probably even the side 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.550
 the joker more than once turned over the grave 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.090
 lack of Russian localization heap 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.700
 bugs restrictions on 34 terrible brakes 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.190
 Lags all this we received as a gift with 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.530
 pre-order the game end up instead 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.420
 severely punish bad custom 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.130
 the enemies had to warm up a bunch 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.500
 Polish solutions to these jokes 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.960
 Well, okay, let alone the game is to 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.750
 joker dead on in town is brewing new 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.600
 zavarushka interosome in good batman 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.610
 introduced apple with on the very wings wings so 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.130
 like all the most formidable scumbags of the year on 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.759
 come together to send 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.829
 bc in the annals of history heading quietly and 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.930
 none other than a psychopath masochist crap 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.750
 already scarecrow quite a worthy replacement 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.939
 crazy bias big boss mind 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.520
 or poison the whole city with gas of fear and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.070
 to return in a year to the depths of despair 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.140
 so that any winged not hindered hired 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.880
 whole army of professional military with 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.239
 a bunch of just like drones and 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.619
 heads up those very drones so called 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.780
 arkhema knight 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.090
 in which Batman's old scores 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.980
 such a samovar now agro background he 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.470
 awesome cool as chuck norris 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.450
 Nothing more to say on all boevki 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.340
 standard there is a mode became with in which 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.100
 Ivan wide enemies in various ways 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.470
 access to get out of the roof pounce on 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.360
 In general, everything is the same way and there is a truck mode 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.060
 also not particularly different from previous ones 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.190
 parts just hard press the heat button 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.350
 mice sometimes block shocks and use 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.540
 special moves against special enemies in general 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.970
 boevka pleasant and relaxed and I personally 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.769
 I think that this game is suitable for her times 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.320
 you did the right thing dramatically 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.150
 nothing has changed here though dark souls and 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.079
 picking zadrot and of course with me not 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.060
 will agree 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.040
 eggs face things will start something there 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.170
 Prove about hardcore and games are not the same 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.319
 Yany fuck themselves these chop your haze 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.540
 According to how you do not have technician Vasya and for 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:05.060
 small hard key 12 right so about 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.739
 what i mean i'm there ah yes the memory is typical in 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.359
 the fight began with most of the time we 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.120
 will spend on using different 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.010
 devices from the arsenal under the suit and this 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.840
 part of the game is made fifti-fifti 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.609
 i.e. some devices example 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.430
 restoring chronology 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.109
 what happened event crap or scanner 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.150
 internal organs of the victim looks 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.310
 stylish and interesting really feel 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.439
 yourself cool kid detective but 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.829
 some stupid annoying for example 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:33.019
 password cracker just infuriates 10 times 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.650
 pick a password for the next door 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:39.230
 what am I like parrots though such doors 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.010
 not so much often occur 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.319
 so normal now about the plot here 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.810
 everything is bad in the belly of a sandworm and 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.269
 starry warrior no course plot there 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.760
 bats-like moments like dance bats with 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.400
 joker on the stuffed with explosives 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.109
 stage or double penetration 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.150
 Batman and Robin on base opponents with 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.069
 the subsequent spread of all those who are not 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.009
 obeyed in childhood semolina and became 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.419
 bully or same kawanishi scene with 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.419
 capturing harley quinn 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:26.480
 yes all this is awesome cool but overall it is 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.490
 just dudes judge yourself rush around 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.440
 the city is saved and friends and we plant 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.360
 villains behind bars the villains escapes and 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.340
 abducts these very friends we are again 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.320
 saving our friends and giving in the ass 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.270
 these villains but then other villains 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.990
 kidnap our other friends and us again 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.550
 I have to save them and I certainly 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.770
 I understand that Batman by profession 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.600
 a rescuer of good citizens and and 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.610
 part-time the black lord for 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.140
 all sorts of thugs nose to drive the whole plot and 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.600
 salvation of this or that person as 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.400
 at least stupid though sometimes it is necessary 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.590
 save something more protective 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.430
 like a city but that's another story 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.420
 waited for an epic and gorgeous story with 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.340
 sentimental moments in poor 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.310
 countries but no trace 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.170
 put on get dull 1 by lan game and 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.630
 a couple of cool scenes in the second 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.790
 half of the game I'm not talking about the condition 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.070
 about current side quests to 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.080
 open the truth well, no damn understandable 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.030
 last ending in the game article 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.860
 side quest and usually they all 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.930
 stack with chains of the same 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.030
 actions that we meet 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.070
 with the main asshole a feast of his problems 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.770
 take down the police station it looks like 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.080
 something like this two-faced gang robbing a bank 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.350
 without pathos to resolve the situation with 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.730
 It gives criminals the cops but then on 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.370
 coincidence is the same gang 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.710
 robs a bank of another place and ours 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.020
 the hero again has to cut through 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.690
 the city to stop another tutu 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.640
 gangsters after a series of same event 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.070
 appears and the courtyard itself which we 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.670
 We bring down and finally completing this 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.710
 fucking quest and so with all the tasks 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.570
 No, I'm not saying that all the tests 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.760
 absolutely identical every chain 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.400
 the quest happens on a new location and 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.470
 Differ in complexity from the previous but in 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.930
 general mechanic is the same everywhere you times 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.240
 this is done after which of the hole 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:15.410
 creeps out a big boss who can 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.660
 waste in the site by the way about the site now 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.230
 there you will be able to chat with all the cola 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.730
 managed 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.610
 catch per game and peculiar 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.830
 a collection of criminals batman we are not you 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.020
 stamps for wimps will be better to collect 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.300
 bandits in cats from the south stands 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.240
 tell about batmobile ride this 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.400
 sharpened real fun in cars of 2 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.650
 driving mode with the ability to drift 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.810
 ride upside down and boevki 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.510
 which we get is not what looks like 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.670
 spider with a machine gun type volcano g10 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.190
 millimeter cannon rockets from connor 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.290
 and a great bunch of coolness and buff with 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.000
 being a pacifist pc 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.310
 use real ammo only 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.530
 against drones and drones and all 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.870
 living thugs sharashit with a current shock 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.210
 The Batmobile part of the train looks very 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.490
 dynamic cool and stylish it's real 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.410
 so dudes as a whole guys that's all i'm 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.210
 like I can say something about the game 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.400
 I forgot and yes, and figs with him personally for me 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.310
 Batman series was important first 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.350
 plot and atmosphere and unfortunately for 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.660
 epic and stressful batman arkham 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.790
 city is still the best game for me 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.310
 series but i can't say that the game 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.590
 came out bad no just she came out as if 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.390
 it's better to go back as if half empty 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.700
 as if the Rocksteads are exhausted with batman 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.890
 as if they had new ideas and 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.750
 do not want to quickly finish with concrete 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.970
 but be that as it may, I don't care 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.220
 thank them for this trilogy and wish 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.200
