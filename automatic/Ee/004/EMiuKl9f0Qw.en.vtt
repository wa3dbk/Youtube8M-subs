00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.539
 photo 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.450
 let's say 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.380
 my name is albert camus 5 minutes of intoxication explaining the theory of 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.740
 relativity they kiss 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.089
 but he is good 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.689
 my assistance will accompany us in this life 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.740
 we have to hurry, however, for this and this year another twin swimming pool 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.740
 that the party for a cat some time ago 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.890
 I'm surprised he's so young even though we're twins 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.180
 as for the streaming on the moon expedition 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.090
 your heart 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.840
 when traveling at about the speed of light 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.210
 strange things happen 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.149
 otherwise we remain there 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.529
 we look at something that hurls straight ahead of us very quickly we can 

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:28.529
 observe 2 particular effects 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.799
 first of all we give you this shortened gesture 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.050
 as if you crush ass 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.370
 but the strangest thing is the hands of his watch 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.370
 they run more slowly than ours 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.920
 it is not an optical effect there are two things that really happen 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.670
 if, instead of standing still, we put ourselves on this object 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.170
 we will be crushed and our dear angel 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.980
 would go more slowly 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.000
 it will be happening to us 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.310
 even if we don't notice it 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.490
 every day we travel but nobody sees these two phenomena, that nobody 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.489
 reach constant high speed 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:24.579
 think that the fastest car at ferrari via adriano maximum ati 350 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.209
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.349
 while the highways one billion kilometers per hour 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.669
 follow me, I'll show you how it works 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:52.969
 is 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.679
 you saw it 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:57.549
 too fast 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.759
 I told you he was traveling very fast 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.409
 to show me what happened ok we are two special cameras that 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.579
 they resume the scene at the same speed as the road 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.109
 well 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.829
 hotmail.it courier forecast maori everything normal 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.299
 spartacus in the cheerful as always the hands of the blue clock turn me i 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.339
 fuck satellites the demon remember, however, for the ship I have to 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:35.599
 restart water service is always at the same speed if it takes a bend now 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.849
 an ebook the experiment no longer works well 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.459
 seen now 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.719
 it's all as I told you 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.649
 a flattened spaceship and bart 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:51.979
 that jumps happily as it always is crushed 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.579
 she died from the spaceship bru clock 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.579
 goes much slower than bio 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.879
 now it's clear why my brain is not younger than me 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:07.109
 but it's simple between 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.119
 called it sounds ring web almost at the speed of light 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.299
 and although many years have passed here on the spaceship, only a few have passed 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.319
 days 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:24.889
 this is why I have white hair, but he still gives me skateboarding 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:32.580
 I'm really glad I was able to explain these things in 5 minutes 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.900
 even because 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.900
 now I have an important appointment 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.529
 night but I have to run away 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:42.210
 to 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.100
 hello there 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:51.289
 ok
