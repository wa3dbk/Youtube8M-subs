00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.830 
video tutorial on one of the ways I
posted<00:00:06.629> last<00:00:06.810> week<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:08.630> twist<00:00:09.630> on<00:00:09.780> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.980 
posted last week and of a twist on a
halter<00:00:10.380> I'm<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> long<00:00:11.969> or<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.480> maxi<00:00:12.840> length

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
but I really think you can do this with

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.550 
but I really think you can do this with
any<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.910> them<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.150> show<00:00:15.420> how<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.870> make<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.320> long

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.270 
done one now I'm gonna do a second one
and<00:00:57.020> it<00:00:58.020> makes<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.410> more<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> square

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and it makes it more like a square

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.830 
and it makes it more like a square
neckline<00:00:59.820> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> halter<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> there<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> am

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
neckline of the halter so there I am

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.260 
neckline of the halter so there I am
three<00:01:04.559> knots<00:01:04.830> or<00:01:05.159> three<00:01:05.430> ties<00:01:05.670> around<00:01:06.030> and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
three knots or three ties around and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.120 
three knots or three ties around and
then<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.630> taking<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.049> two<00:01:07.260> straps<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
then I'm taking the two straps and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.880 
then I'm taking the two straps and
attaching<00:01:09.090> them<00:01:09.180> behind<00:01:09.420> my<00:01:09.630> neck<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:10.710> this

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
attaching them behind my neck like this

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280 
attaching them behind my neck like this
so<00:01:11.729> again<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.090> don't<00:01:12.360> need<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.780> lot<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so again you don't need a lot and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.109 
so again you don't need a lot and
sometimes<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:13.950> easier<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> tie

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
sometimes if it's easier for you to tie

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.570 
sometimes if it's easier for you to tie
it<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.509> front<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.170> your<00:01:16.409> neck<00:01:16.590> rather<00:01:17.250> than

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it in front of your neck rather than

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.039 
it in front of your neck rather than
tying<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.970> behind<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.540> what<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.780> need<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
tying it behind that's what you need to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
tying it behind that's what you need to
do<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.619> make<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> closure<00:01:20.340> right<00:01:21.270> like

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
do so we can make the closure right like

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.410 
do so we can make the closure right like
this<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.950> only<00:01:23.070> need<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.670> tiny<00:01:24.000> bit

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
this and you only need a really tiny bit

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.160 
this and you only need a really tiny bit
of<00:01:24.630> fabric<00:01:26.210> since<00:01:27.210> you're<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.630> gonna<00:01:27.810> see<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
of fabric since you're not gonna see it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
of fabric since you're not gonna see it
but<00:01:28.590> again<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.070> want<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> as<00:01:29.670> tightly

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
but again you want to do it as tightly

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.100 
but again you want to do it as tightly
as<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.159> see<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:32.790> I'm

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
as you can so as you can see here I'm

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.060 
as you can so as you can see here I'm
doing<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.290> SuperDuper<00:01:35.040> duper<00:01:35.159> tightly<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.950> as

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
doing it SuperDuper duper tightly so as

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.859 
doing it SuperDuper duper tightly so as
soon<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.549> feel<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.150> secure<00:01:39.600> enough

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
soon as you feel that it's secure enough

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.710 
soon as you feel that it's secure enough
and<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.140> even<00:01:40.530> test<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.180> by<00:01:42.180> pulling<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and you can even test it by pulling it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.940 
and you can even test it by pulling it
to<00:01:42.869> make<00:01:43.020> sure<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.290> not<00:01:43.409> gonna<00:01:43.560> separate

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
to make sure it's not gonna separate

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.789 
to make sure it's not gonna separate
then<00:01:44.250> bring<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.850> around<00:01:45.000> your<00:01:45.240> neck<00:01:45.799> now

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
then bring it up around your neck now

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.780 
then bring it up around your neck now
what<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> did<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.240> made<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.780> little<00:01:48.960> bit<00:01:49.200> I

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
what I did was I made it a little bit I

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.190 
what I did was I made it a little bit I
pulled<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.970> little<00:01:51.149> bit<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
pulled it a little bit here you have a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.280 
pulled it a little bit here you have a
little<00:01:52.439> bit<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.740> extra<00:01:53.159> fabric<00:01:53.990> that<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> can

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
little bit of extra fabric that you can

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.310 
little bit of extra fabric that you can
take<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:57.060> wrapped<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.750> through<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.290> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
take and I just wrapped it through so I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.469 
take and I just wrapped it through so I
took<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.710> piece<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.009> extra<00:01:59.430> fabric<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
took a piece of extra fabric and I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.280 
took a piece of extra fabric and I
wrapped<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.320> around<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:02.189> hide<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.990> elastic

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
wrapped it around to hide the elastic

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.889 
wrapped it around to hide the elastic
band<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.280> don't<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.630> really

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
band so you don't see it you can really

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.830 
band so you don't see it you can really
do<00:02:07.020> anything<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.560> want<00:02:07.770> with<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.629> like<00:02:09.629> that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
do anything you want with it like that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.640 
do anything you want with it like that
and<00:02:10.170> then<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.379> adjusted<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
and then I just adjusted it

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.399 
and then I just adjusted it
so<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.180> found<00:02:13.329> the<00:02:13.420> extra<00:02:13.750> bit<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.049> fabric

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
so so you found the extra bit of fabric

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.199 
so so you found the extra bit of fabric
here<00:02:14.439> and<00:02:15.450> then<00:02:16.450> pull<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.840> down<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:19.000> one

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
here and then pull it down this one

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.910 
here and then pull it down this one
doesn't<00:02:19.390> really<00:02:19.510> have<00:02:19.810> as<00:02:19.930> much<00:02:20.110> but<00:02:20.379> just

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
doesn't really have as much but just

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.520 
doesn't really have as much but just
find<00:02:21.099> a<00:02:21.189> little<00:02:21.310> extra<00:02:21.489> bit<00:02:22.170> pull<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.319> band

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.390 
find a little extra bit pull the band
away<00:02:23.799> and<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:25.180> just<00:02:25.450> loop<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.140> through<00:02:26.409> and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
away and then just loop it through and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.550 
away and then just loop it through and
then<00:02:27.459> it'll<00:02:27.670> hide<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:28.000> band<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:29.290> then<00:02:29.409> make

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
then it'll hide the band and then make

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.039 
then it'll hide the band and then make
any<00:02:29.709> adjustments<00:02:30.400> as<00:02:30.549> you<00:02:30.640> see<00:02:31.090> necessary<00:02:31.689> so
