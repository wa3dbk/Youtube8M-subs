so there's your proof you cannot deny
the<00:06:20.210> proof<00:06:20.569> is<00:06:20.780> there<00:06:21.159> see<00:06:22.159> minecraft<00:06:22.759> you

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
the proof is there see minecraft you

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.749 
the proof is there see minecraft you
play<00:06:23.840> Minecraft<00:06:24.439> you've<00:06:24.680> seen<00:06:24.919> it<00:06:25.099> you<00:06:25.610> know

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
what it's capable of this is formed and

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:35.920 
what it's capable of this is formed and
it<00:06:29.240> looks<00:06:29.569> better<00:06:29.900> in<00:06:30.289> the<00:06:31.189> creative<00:06:31.729> and<00:06:34.930> see

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
it looks better in the creative and see

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.779 
it looks better in the creative and see
that<00:06:36.349> looks<00:06:36.590> fantastic<00:06:36.800> it's<00:06:37.490> got<00:06:37.639> the
