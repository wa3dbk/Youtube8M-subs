annihilating a box I've got it open and
that's<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:55.800> feel<00:00:56.100> very<00:00:56.460> special<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.059> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
properly properly thick box immensely

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.850 
properly properly thick box immensely
thick<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.809> let's<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.989> look<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.710> got

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
thick but let's have a look and we got

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:16.120 
thick but let's have a look and we got
more<00:01:05.100> seals<00:01:05.510> we're<00:01:06.510> gonna<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.810> here<00:01:06.930> all<00:01:06.960> day

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.330 

comes<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.990> memory<00:01:18.990> fans<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:20.100> I'm<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.310> to

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
comes with memory fans so I'm going to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.510 
comes with memory fans so I'm going to
assume<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> double<00:01:22.170> bubble<00:01:22.520> it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
assume but this is double bubble it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.109 
assume but this is double bubble it
would<00:01:23.670> make<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> lot<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.119> sense<00:01:27.560> there<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.680> go

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
would make a lot of sense there we go

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
had to move the graphics card down

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.220 
had to move the graphics card down
because<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.379> that<00:02:56.950> was<00:02:57.099> actually<00:02:57.400> foul<00:02:57.609> in<00:02:57.849> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
because I that was actually foul in the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.470 
because I that was actually foul in the
top<00:02:59.230> PCI<00:02:59.590> Express<00:02:59.919> slot<00:03:00.250> on<00:03:00.639> this<00:03:01.030> fire<00:03:01.269> one

top PCI Express slot on this fire one
but<00:03:02.139> just<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.439> quick<00:03:02.590> demo<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.189> can<00:03:03.370> actually

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
but just a quick demo you can actually

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.490 
but just a quick demo you can actually
angle<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:06.099> fans<00:03:06.750> if<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:08.109> want<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.379> go<00:03:08.469> a

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
angle the fans if you want to go a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.429 
angle the fans if you want to go a

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
specific way it is a bit touch-and-go I

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.990 
specific way it is a bit touch-and-go I
would<00:03:11.709> advise<00:03:12.040> if<00:03:12.310> you're<00:03:12.459> going<00:03:12.609> to<00:03:12.730> do<00:03:12.849> this

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
I'd do it with the rig turned off and

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:21.569 
I'd do it with the rig turned off and
then<00:03:17.129> leave<00:03:18.129> it<00:03:18.159> to<00:03:18.370> how<00:03:18.669> you<00:03:18.699> set<00:03:19.239> them<00:03:20.579> we

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
then leave it to how you set them we
