so maybe they want me to play electronic

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.260 
so maybe they want me to play electronic
drums<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.130> also<00:01:35.310> play<00:01:35.759> program

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

electronic<00:01:36.780> drums<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.770> thought<00:01:37.950> okay<00:01:38.189> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
electronic drums so I thought okay that

electronic drums so I thought okay that
makes<00:01:38.610> sense<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:39.270> maybe<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:39.720> heard<00:01:39.930> my

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
makes sense think maybe they heard my

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.420 
makes sense think maybe they heard my
work<00:01:40.439> doing<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.280> they

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
work doing that and they

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.550 
work doing that and they
went<00:01:41.610> back<00:01:41.790> for<00:01:42.060> their<00:01:42.210> record<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:43.230> then<00:01:43.410> they

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
went back for their record but then they

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.930 
went back for their record but then they
were<00:01:43.650> like<00:01:43.800> no<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.790> play

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
thought that was so weird

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.650 
thought that was so weird
right<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> session<00:01:56.390> wasn't<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.479> typical

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
right so the session wasn't a typical

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.450 
right so the session wasn't a typical
recording<00:01:58.290> session<00:01:58.650> because<00:01:58.830> normally<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.340> an

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
