00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Talk to people, welcome to another one. 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.210
 video of today's barrel I'll show you 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.450
 you the differences between the older 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.860
 any two money then loose the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.860
 sticker that drives very crazy 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.660
 So people here we have the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.359
 ipad was one and is that ipad 02 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.460
 first is the touch aig that now 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.480
 is present on ipad 2 was not present 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.550
 on the ipad 1 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.079
 You can see here that the difference is 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.090
 very big is that now there is no more 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.739
 that home button with squares 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.829
 now it has made room for the reader 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.539
 digital the second the improvement is the screen 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.789
 now the screen has 40% - of reflection 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.070
 Can you see that the purple earth she is? 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.140
 purple because it's something that has less 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.870
 reflection of what it is until normal you 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.340
 Here you can see 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.789
 here is normal until you can see the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.770
 reflection a little and here does not stop the 2 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.199
 you see you also see the reflection 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.619
 well less well organized than the ipad 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:13.049
 was a third difference is the camera 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:20.909
 the camera now has 8 megapixels in 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:23.220
 compared to ipad 1 that had much better 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.439
 it's but it's still not as good as it is 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.759
 the iphone because tablets are not 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.070
 recommended to take the best 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.820
 Photos still do have some in favor of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.670
 laws 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.390
 now I will show here how the photo 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.130
 taken by the ipad was 11 and then with 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.549
 the ipad 2 ipad has 5 megapixels and the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.540
 ipad 2 has 8 megapixels is talking about 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.090
 design 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.250
 We have several differences you can 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.070
 see here the camera now the camera is 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.200
 very different from the ipad 1 camera 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.230
 you can see the camera now has not 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.630
 one more 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.240
 around it now practically 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.090
 flat like the iphone 5 s 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.570
 the microphones came out from above now 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.890
 microphones that were here they stayed 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.040
 camera side 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.740
 then this can even be improved not 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.960
 We know why but it could be that it improves. 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.420
 because if it was changed it was a new generation 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.270
 so there was a problem and also the lock 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.350
 of rotation voting lock that was here 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.830
 now it's the ipad ipad era it 's two 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.630
 ipad speakers was one he was 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.440
 several tiny little dots with two 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.420
 rows 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.660
 now is a row with several dots 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.550
 only bigger and thicker than 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.580
 it's the most talked about 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.870
 ipad 1 it has got 7 points 5 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.650
 mm 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.750
 the ipad is two have 6.1mm that's 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.430
 a very personal personal reference 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.550
