 four according to the group in which you are going 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.140

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.720
 paper 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.009
 according to me I agree in 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.940
 that has to be between the four 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.740

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.420
 of that the old one was a simple 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.630
 I had to behave well in the governorate 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.049
 if they did not take me out 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.049

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.569
 you are talking 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:41.109
 finally mexico should be me what I said 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.850
 several days that we touched on the subject of 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.950
 gerardo and you got scared 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.260
 I said it today also in the afternoon that 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.100
 we started to analyze this matter I think 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.340
 that the objective that corresponded to a 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.260
 as bold as the games 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.740
 london olympics when it was said that 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.170
 you had to be a medalist was 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:06.050
 gamble her to be a finalist mexico would have 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.920
 to put the best you have for this 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:13.120
 tournament and send a very clear message to 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.970
 world that you can make a glass of 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.800
 football brasil-2014 extraordinary I them 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.890
 I ask all of you who have so 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.170
 good memory in what place it was 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.910
 finally the selection of the USA in 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.990
 the last confederations cup the 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.700
 South Africa 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.700
 Secondly 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:40.180
 animation broke radios to usa 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.040
 then in terms of messi and to us no 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:49.000
 achieved because Mexico can not achieve it 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:52.900
 Of course I think the fear of recognizing 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.790
 that in your power point sheet or I do not know 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.590
 what program would have used that 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.449
 héctor gónzález iñárritu because for the 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.910
 objectives of the year we will already be seeing 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.830
 it is not manufactured with this we 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.410
 We have lived with this issue since 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.810
 dawned practically the day puts that 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.540
 is a mexico finalist of the cup 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.440
 confederations then it comes like that to 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.300
 nuance the matter and so not it not 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.889
 finalist to say being a semifinalist 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.630
 well I am them 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.450
 and the journalists who are aligned 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.090
 towards that eye towards that sea to fifa the 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.860
 final phase of the world cup we are 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.419
 how brave is journalist without 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.250
 names and surnames and embarking 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.940
 making me and approaching now I was 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.940
 Luis Titles 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:44.070
 you are saying it was in the 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.070
 meeting 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.510
 hamburger 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.400
 being serious in this topic 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.380
 and they see what it said 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.050
 chirinos we can not go on the 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.150
 finalists situation as I said 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.360
 router mediocrely as governor the 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.070
 heron in the olympic games ' past 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.050
 finalist is the one who arrives inside the 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.910
 first 20 are those are antics are 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.590
 stupidity is demagoguery that is to be 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.720
 well and try to defend your chamba as 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.120
 politician here are not politicians here are 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.400
 men with a lot of vision that today or in the 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.950
 national team from Hector el Chepo 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.070
 and all his technical staff then that 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.410
 it costs to put the reality that 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.140
 they think semifinalist nothing happens 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.600
 then leave nothing to the imagination of 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.190
 demons like us that if 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.000
 we are thinking about seeing things 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.020
 negative 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.419
 I see final 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.720
 and me the football to be finalist in arriving 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.460
 to the final 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.030
 is an example last year they said 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:56.490
 win medals 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:58.479
 warns 3 third parties 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.539
 does not say in the first place of the 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.539
 play off 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.900
 absolute lack of commitment without a 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.150
 Rafa pause because we visit is now 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.690
 we have to charge double then 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.690
 we have to have double sponsorships 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.690
 perfect
