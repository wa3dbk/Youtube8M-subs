00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
of it and that's pretty good-sized but

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.250 
of it and that's pretty good-sized but
it's<00:00:11.099> got<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> very<00:00:12.889> short<00:00:14.179> little<00:00:15.179> bit<00:00:15.480> more

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
it's got a very short little bit more

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.680 
it's got a very short little bit more
than<00:00:16.529> four<00:00:16.800> foot

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
than four foot

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.529 
than four foot
I'm<00:00:18.690> wall<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:19.770> end<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.850> can't<00:00:21.210> put<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
I'm wall on one end so you can't put a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.519 
I'm wall on one end so you can't put a
proper<00:00:23.570> bed<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.949> headboard<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.430> foot<00:00:27.529> on

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
proper bed with a headboard and foot on

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.580 
proper bed with a headboard and foot on
it<00:00:29.150> in<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.390> room<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.289> Linda's<00:00:32.930> idea<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.230> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
it in the room so Linda's idea is to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.310 
it in the room so Linda's idea is to
bump<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.250> out<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.910> she<00:00:36.120> says<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.809> take<00:00:37.050> this

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
bump it out as she says just take this

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.229 
bump it out as she says just take this
part<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.100> see<00:00:38.340> that's<00:00:38.550> at<00:00:38.730> an<00:00:38.850> angle

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
part that you see that's at an angle

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.670 
part that you see that's at an angle
that's<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.540> 45-degree<00:00:40.410> angle<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:42.780> bump<00:00:43.469> it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
that's a 45-degree angle and to bump it

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.279 
that's a 45-degree angle and to bump it
out<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.550> I'll<00:00:44.730> show<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.750> bump<00:00:46.020> outs

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
out and I'll show what the bump outs

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.439 
out and I'll show what the bump outs
come<00:00:46.760> when<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:48.480> built<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.230> house<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.800> put<00:00:50.449> seven

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
come when we built the house I put seven

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.680 
come when we built the house I put seven
foot<00:00:51.750> two<00:00:52.260> inch<00:00:52.800> ceiling<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:54.090> part<00:00:54.510> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
foot two inch ceiling in this part of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.310 
foot two inch ceiling in this part of
the<00:00:54.750> upstairs<00:00:55.320> by<00:00:55.910> making<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.000> shed<00:00:57.360> dormer<00:00:58.079> and

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
the upstairs by making a shed dormer and

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.509 
the upstairs by making a shed dormer and
it's<00:01:01.320> probably<00:01:02.309> about<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.699> 1<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.589> 3<00:01:04.589> or<00:01:04.619> 1<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.189> 4

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it's probably about a 1 in 3 or 1 in 4

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.660 
it's probably about a 1 in 3 or 1 in 4
pitch<00:01:06.150> as<00:01:06.570> opposed<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.439> 1212<00:01:08.100> pitch<00:01:08.430> that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
pitch as opposed to the 1212 pitch that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.840 
pitch as opposed to the 1212 pitch that
you<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.119> down<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.689> angle<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you see down this angle here that's the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.000 
you see down this angle here that's the
normal<00:01:12.270> roof<00:01:12.540> angle<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.200> that's<00:01:13.380> also<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
normal roof angle and that's also the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.350 
normal roof angle and that's also the
roof<00:01:14.280> angle<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.170> in<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.380> bedroom<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.360> our

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
roof angle in the in the bedroom so our

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.950 
roof angle in the in the bedroom so our
idea<00:01:18.570> would<00:01:19.259> be<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.439> take<00:01:19.920> make<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> shed-dormer

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
idea would be to take make a shed-dormer

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.980 
idea would be to take make a shed-dormer
like<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.549> for<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.610> rest<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> house<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
like this for the rest of the house and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.080 
like this for the rest of the house and
I'll<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.380> outside<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.490> show<00:01:26.700> what<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
I'll go outside now and show what that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.870 
I'll go outside now and show what that
will<00:01:27.420> look<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.290> outside<00:01:28.670> this<00:01:29.670> would

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
will look like on the outside this would

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.280 
will look like on the outside this would
give<00:01:30.090> us<00:01:30.119> plenty<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.659> room<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.380> bedroom

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
give us plenty of room in the bedroom

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.890 
give us plenty of room in the bedroom
this<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> way<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.979> shed-dormer<00:01:35.250> looks<00:01:36.119> on

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
this is the way the shed-dormer looks on

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.649 
this is the way the shed-dormer looks on

15 or 20 years of the gutters being full
all<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.930> time<00:02:19.170> because<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.830> never<00:02:20.040> got<00:02:20.280> up<00:02:20.520> and

all the time because I never got up and
cleaned<00:02:20.970> them<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.590> had<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.860> replace<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
cleaned them so I had to replace that

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.780 
cleaned them so I had to replace that
and<00:02:24.030> now<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.390> we've<00:02:24.510> got<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.019> done<00:02:25.790> it's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and now that we've got that done it's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.110 
and now that we've got that done it's
time<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.989> start<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:28.680> I'll<00:02:28.890> begin<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.760> show

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
time to to start so I'll begin to show

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.510 
time to to start so I'll begin to show
probably<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.230> inside<00:02:32.780> next

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
probably on the inside next

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.030 
probably on the inside next
well<00:02:36.060> there's<00:02:36.330> been<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.600> lot<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.870> work<00:02:37.170> done<00:02:37.500> and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
well there's been a lot of work done and
