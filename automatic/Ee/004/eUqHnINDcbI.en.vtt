00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
half a mile away and that's what we've

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.569 
half a mile away and that's what we've
done<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.930> let<00:00:55.620> me<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.860> kind<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.190> demonstrate

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
done so let me just kind of demonstrate

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.819 
done so let me just kind of demonstrate
this<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> original<00:00:57.620> fighting<00:00:58.620> cal

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
this this is the original fighting cal

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.109 
this this is the original fighting cal
calls<00:01:04.040> so<00:01:05.040> that's<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> pretty<00:01:05.729> good<00:01:05.850> sound

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
calls so that's got a pretty good sound

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.690 
calls so that's got a pretty good sound
but<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.500> west<00:01:07.710> blowing<00:01:08.159> off<00:01:08.280> he's<00:01:08.490> half

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
but it is the west blowing off he's half

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.450 
but it is the west blowing off he's half
a<00:01:08.729> mile<00:01:09.000> away<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.990> still<00:01:10.260> hard<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.250> your

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
a mile away it's still hard to get your

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.700 
a mile away it's still hard to get your
point<00:01:11.670> across<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> Lone<00:01:13.439> Ranger

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
point across so this is a Lone Ranger

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.760 
point across so this is a Lone Ranger
and<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:15.030> show<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.450> difference

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and to show you the difference

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.730 
and to show you the difference
the<00:01:17.250> long<00:01:17.460> Ranger<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> 3/4<00:01:18.750> inch<00:01:18.930> body<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the long Ranger is a 3/4 inch body and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
the long Ranger is a 3/4 inch body and
the<00:01:20.280> fighting<00:01:20.610> Cal<00:01:20.820> call<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.330> than<00:01:21.510> a<00:01:21.570> half

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the fighting Cal call is than a half

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
the fighting Cal call is than a half
inch<00:01:21.960> body<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.619> that's<00:01:22.770> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.310> give<00:01:23.430> you

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
inch body so that's going to give you

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.030 
inch body so that's going to give you
more<00:01:23.760> volume<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.420> more<00:01:24.990> pitch<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.590> let<00:01:25.950> me

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
more volume and more pitch so let me

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:37.100 
more volume and more pitch so let me
just<00:01:26.190> try<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.480 

so<00:01:38.110> if<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:38.320> got<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.590> windy<00:01:38.920> day<00:01:38.950> or<00:01:39.310> if<00:01:39.399> you've

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
so if you got a windy day or if you've

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.340 
so if you got a windy day or if you've
got<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.640> bowl<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:39.850> half<00:01:40.090> mile<00:01:40.360> away<00:01:40.509> there's<00:01:41.229> a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
got a bowl a half mile away there's a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.080 
got a bowl a half mile away there's a
good<00:01:41.470> chance<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:41.950> he'll<00:01:42.280> bugle<00:01:42.789> for<00:01:42.909> that

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
good chance that he'll bugle for that

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.209 
good chance that he'll bugle for that
work<00:01:43.630> perfect<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.679> I<00:01:44.740> didn't<00:01:45.009> really<00:01:45.189> think

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
work perfect and I didn't really think

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.100 
work perfect and I didn't really think
about<00:01:45.610> this<00:01:45.759> when<00:01:45.939> I<00:01:45.969> started<00:01:46.479> but<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:46.929> works

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
about this when I started but it works

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.929 
about this when I started but it works
even<00:01:47.380> greater<00:01:47.829> when<00:01:48.100> they're<00:01:48.220> up<00:01:48.340> close<00:01:48.640> it

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
even greater when they're up close it

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.880 
even greater when they're up close it
must<00:01:49.569> be<00:01:49.689> because<00:01:49.899> of<00:01:50.079> the<00:01:50.380> pitch<00:01:50.619> the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
must be because of the pitch the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.819 
must be because of the pitch the
intensity<00:01:51.520> they<00:01:51.729> call<00:01:51.970> when<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.780> get<00:01:52.929> a<00:01:52.990> al

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
intensity they call when you get a al

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.760 
intensity they call when you get a al
close<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.850> say<00:01:55.060> 100<00:01:55.360> yards<00:01:55.630> away<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:56.560> take

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
close to you say 100 yards away you take

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.950 
close to you say 100 yards away you take
out<00:01:56.920> long<00:01:57.189> ranges<00:01:57.670> are<00:01:57.880> playing<00:01:58.210> it<00:01:58.390> it's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
out long ranges are playing it it's

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.230 
out long ranges are playing it it's
almost<00:01:59.170> like<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.530> shark<00:02:00.100> feeding<00:02:00.610> frenzy<00:02:01.119> it's

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
almost like a shark feeding frenzy it's

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.929 
almost like a shark feeding frenzy it's
absolutely<00:02:01.840> great<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.860> we<00:02:03.310> took<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.549> another

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
absolutely great so we took it another

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.380 
absolutely great so we took it another
step<00:02:04.299> we<00:02:05.289> had<00:02:05.439> a<00:02:05.470> call<00:02:05.799> called<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.939> estrous

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
step we had a call called the estrous

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.900 
step we had a call called the estrous
fine<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:08.349> it<00:02:09.009> worked<00:02:09.220> good<00:02:09.429> but<00:02:09.640> we<00:02:09.729> had<00:02:09.880> a

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
fine and it worked good but we had a

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.240 
fine and it worked good but we had a
tapered<00:02:10.360> reed<00:02:10.569> in<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.840> which<00:02:11.019> kind<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.860> kept

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
tapered reed in it which kind of kept

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.100 
tapered reed in it which kind of kept
the<00:02:12.400> tone<00:02:12.640> down<00:02:12.670> we<00:02:13.180> couldn't<00:02:13.420> do<00:02:13.569> as<00:02:13.810> much

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
the tone down we couldn't do as much

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.990 
the tone down we couldn't do as much
with<00:02:14.319> it<00:02:14.470> as<00:02:14.590> we<00:02:14.709> wanted<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.459> embarked

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
with it as we wanted to so I embarked

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.180 
with it as we wanted to so I embarked
that<00:02:16.209> Reed<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:17.319> it<00:02:17.440> gives<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.769> this<00:02:17.920> sound<00:02:23.190> so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that Reed so it gives it this sound so

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.420 
that Reed so it gives it this sound so
you<00:02:24.310> take<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.819> step<00:02:25.060> further<00:02:26.069> this<00:02:27.069> is<00:02:27.130> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
you take it a step further this is the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.009 
you take it a step further this is the
same<00:02:27.640> one<00:02:27.880> without<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.420> barrel<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:28.959> is

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
same one without the barrel this is

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.080 
same one without the barrel this is
called<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.410> mini<00:02:29.590> bull<00:02:29.860> Gator<00:02:30.130> now<00:02:30.549> listen<00:02:30.970> to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
called the mini bull Gator now listen to

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.600 
called the mini bull Gator now listen to
the<00:02:31.209> tone

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:44.830 

or<00:02:37.610> even<00:02:37.940> some<00:02:38.150> self<00:02:38.480> exist<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:44.000> other<00:02:44.120> words<00:02:44.420> I

or even some self exist in other words I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.110 
or even some self exist in other words I
learned<00:02:45.560> long<00:02:45.800> time<00:02:46.070> ago<00:02:46.310> when<00:02:46.490> you<00:02:46.580> go<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.790> try

learned long time ago when you go to try

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.150 
learned long time ago when you go to try
to<00:02:47.150> call<00:02:47.420> Rolla<00:02:47.870> if<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.110> don't<00:02:48.350> take<00:02:48.560> one<00:02:48.860> call

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
to call Rolla if you don't take one call

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.190 
to call Rolla if you don't take one call
just<00:02:49.880> like<00:02:50.030> when<00:02:50.210> you<00:02:50.300> go<00:02:50.330> fishing<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:50.930> don't

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
just like when you go fishing you don't

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.650 
just like when you go fishing you don't
take<00:02:51.410> one<00:02:51.620> plug<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.880> got<00:02:53.000> enough<00:02:53.240> sounds

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
take one plug if you got enough sounds

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.270 
take one plug if you got enough sounds
there<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:53.990> hopefully<00:02:54.320> they'll<00:02:54.530> hit<00:02:54.800> on<00:02:54.950> one

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
there that hopefully they'll hit on one

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.160 
there that hopefully they'll hit on one
if<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:55.940> get<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.240> going<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.840> that's<00:02:56.990> what
