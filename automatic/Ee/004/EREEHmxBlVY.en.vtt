like<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:47.040> best

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
like that so to me this was the best

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.639 
like that so to me this was the best
however<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.360> also<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> most<00:01:49.020> expensive<00:01:49.140> I

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
however it's also the most expensive I

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.260 
however it's also the most expensive I
think<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> full<00:01:50.070> size<00:01:50.280> bottle<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.880> fifty

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
think a full size bottle is fifty

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.149 
think a full size bottle is fifty
dollars<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.170> were<00:01:52.259> two<00:01:52.470> cleansing<00:01:52.890> oils

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

drying<00:04:03.440> on<00:04:03.650> my<00:04:03.769> skin<00:04:04.540> not<00:04:05.540> as<00:04:05.720> bad<00:04:05.900> as<00:04:05.989> the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
drying on my skin not as bad as the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.960 
drying on my skin not as bad as the
bozhe<00:04:06.410> one<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:07.100> still<00:04:07.220> bad<00:04:07.489> enough<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:07.850> it

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
bozhe one but still bad enough that it

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.650 
bozhe one but still bad enough that it
left<00:04:08.150> like<00:04:08.420> white<00:04:09.430> flakes<00:04:10.430> on<00:04:10.730> my<00:04:10.970> chin<00:04:11.239> and<00:04:11.269> I

left like white flakes on my chin and I

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.720 
left like white flakes on my chin and I
just<00:04:11.900> couldn't<00:04:12.170> believe<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:12.590> this<00:04:13.370> will<00:04:13.610> be

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
just couldn't believe it so this will be

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.940 
just couldn't believe it so this will be
returned<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:14.510> also<00:04:14.660> made<00:04:15.260> my<00:04:15.440> eyes<00:04:15.620> it's

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
returned it also made my eyes it's

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.409 
returned it also made my eyes it's
probably<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.310> worst<00:04:16.489> offender<00:04:16.910> in<00:04:17.060> terms<00:04:17.269> of

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
probably the worst offender in terms of

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.020 
probably the worst offender in terms of
blurry<00:04:17.660> eyes<00:04:18.400> every<00:04:19.400> single<00:04:19.700> time<00:04:19.880> without

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
blurry eyes every single time without

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.469 
blurry eyes every single time without
fail<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:21.500> I<00:04:22.160> think<00:04:22.430> again<00:04:23.000> it's<00:04:23.330> one

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
fail and I think again it's one

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.940 
fail and I think again it's one
redeeming<00:04:23.720> quality<00:04:23.900> like<00:04:24.349> the<00:04:24.470> Boscia<00:04:24.680> is

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
redeeming quality like the Boscia is

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.330 
redeeming quality like the Boscia is
that<00:04:25.160> once<00:04:25.370> you<00:04:25.490> cleanse<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:25.880> off<00:04:26.000> your<00:04:26.150> face

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
that once you cleanse it off your face

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.710 
that once you cleanse it off your face
feels<00:04:26.610> clean<00:04:26.880> like<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.510> you<00:04:27.570> don't

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
feels clean like you and you don't

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.970 
feels clean like you and you don't
there's<00:04:27.990> no<00:04:28.080> residue<00:04:28.410> you<00:04:28.650> don't<00:04:28.800> need<00:04:28.889> to

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
there's no residue you don't need to

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.830 
there's no residue you don't need to
double<00:04:29.250> cleanse<00:04:29.490> but<00:04:30.120> this<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.419> pretty<00:04:30.600> harsh

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
double cleanse but this is pretty harsh

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
chin but it was not the worst offender

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.200 
chin but it was not the worst offender
in<00:04:46.530> terms<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.979> like<00:04:47.100> devotion<00:04:47.639> and<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:47.790> clinic

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
in terms of like devotion and the clinic

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.260 
in terms of like devotion and the clinic
being<00:04:48.570> worse<00:04:48.870> for<00:04:49.229> drying<00:04:49.470> out<00:04:49.680> my<00:04:49.800> skin<00:04:50.270> so

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
being worse for drying out my skin so

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.840 
being worse for drying out my skin so
maybe<00:04:51.600> in<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.900> summer<00:04:52.139> it<00:04:52.410> would<00:04:52.530> do<00:04:52.680> better<00:04:52.889> I

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
maybe in the summer it would do better I

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.030 
maybe in the summer it would do better I
also<00:04:54.240> did<00:04:54.510> not<00:04:54.540> experience<00:04:55.020> blurry<00:04:55.470> eyes<00:04:55.710> as

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
also did not experience blurry eyes as

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.310 
also did not experience blurry eyes as
much<00:04:56.190> as<00:04:56.340> I<00:04:56.430> did<00:04:56.610> with<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.240> bozo<00:04:58.050> or<00:04:58.199> the

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
much as I did with the bozo or the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.260 
much as I did with the bozo or the
Clinique<00:04:58.710> so<00:04:59.010> although<00:04:59.729> I<00:04:59.820> think<00:05:00.090> it's<00:05:00.210> a

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
Clinique so although I think it's a

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.680 
Clinique so although I think it's a
pretty<00:05:00.570> good<00:05:00.690> cleansing<00:05:01.410> oil<00:05:02.090> but<00:05:03.090> one<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.570> be

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
pretty good cleansing oil but one to be

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.560 
pretty good cleansing oil but one to be
aware<00:05:03.840> of<00:05:03.900> if<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.440> do<00:05:04.650> have<00:05:05.190> some<00:05:05.490> dryness<00:05:05.760> you

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
aware of if you do have some dryness you

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.600 
aware of if you do have some dryness you
know<00:05:06.690> this<00:05:06.900> may<00:05:07.110> further<00:05:08.010> dry<00:05:08.310> out<00:05:08.430> your<00:05:08.550> skin

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
know this may further dry out your skin

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.730 
know this may further dry out your skin
also<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.419> was<00:05:09.540> one<00:05:09.720> that<00:05:09.900> winced<00:05:10.229> away

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
also it was one that winced away

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.590 
also it was one that winced away
oh<00:05:10.770> this<00:05:11.220> was<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.520> one<00:05:11.729> that<00:05:11.910> instructed<00:05:12.330> you

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
oh this was the one that instructed you

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.540 
oh this was the one that instructed you
to<00:05:12.660> put<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.080> on<00:05:13.229> and<00:05:13.440> then<00:05:13.530> add<00:05:13.680> water<00:05:13.919> just

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
to put it on and then add water just

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.520 
to put it on and then add water just
like<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.820> nude<00:05:15.000> one<00:05:15.180> but<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:16.020> nude<00:05:16.200> one<00:05:16.320> did

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
like the nude one but the nude one did

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.050 
like the nude one but the nude one did
not<00:05:16.650> rinse<00:05:16.830> away<00:05:16.979> and<00:05:17.190> left<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.400> residue<00:05:17.550> this

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
not rinse away and left a residue this

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.060 
not rinse away and left a residue this
rinsed<00:05:18.419> away<00:05:18.510> clearly<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.229> it<00:05:19.320> left<00:05:19.919> your

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
rinsed away clearly and it left your

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.920 
rinsed away clearly and it left your
face<00:05:20.250> feeling<00:05:20.460> clean<00:05:20.789> and<00:05:20.820> like<00:05:21.510> you<00:05:21.630> didn't

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
face feeling clean and like you didn't

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.620 
face feeling clean and like you didn't
need<00:05:22.020> to<00:05:22.080> double<00:05:22.410> cleanse<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:23.039> I<00:05:23.850> think<00:05:24.510> this

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
need to double cleanse so I think this

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.090 
need to double cleanse so I think this
is<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.780> pretty<00:05:24.960> good<00:05:25.229> one<00:05:25.410> all<00:05:25.590> in<00:05:25.740> all<00:05:25.860> my

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
is a pretty good one all in all my

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.279 
is a pretty good one all in all my
absolute<00:05:26.850> favorite<00:05:27.150> one<00:05:27.240> is<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:27.510> D<00:05:27.810> or<00:05:27.960> this

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
absolute favorite one is the D or this

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.409 
absolute favorite one is the D or this
is<00:05:28.440> definitely<00:05:28.770> my<00:05:29.039> second<00:05:29.490> pick<00:05:29.669> the<00:05:30.240> other

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
is definitely my second pick the other

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.230 
is definitely my second pick the other
three<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:30.780> would<00:05:30.990> stay<00:05:31.320> away<00:05:31.530> from<00:05:31.910> but<00:05:32.910> I<00:05:32.940> guess

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
three I would stay away from but I guess

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.000 
three I would stay away from but I guess
I'm<00:05:33.570> at<00:05:33.750> your<00:05:33.840> own<00:05:33.960> risk<00:05:34.200> if<00:05:34.470> you<00:05:34.620> want<00:05:34.860> if

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
I'm at your own risk if you want if

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.170 
I'm at your own risk if you want if
you're<00:05:35.130> really<00:05:35.220> curious<00:05:35.490> about<00:05:35.789> them<00:05:36.000> maybe

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
you're really curious about them maybe

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.810 
you're really curious about them maybe
you<00:05:36.270> could<00:05:36.450> get<00:05:36.570> a<00:05:36.630> sample<00:05:37.169> from<00:05:37.200> Sephora<00:05:37.820> so

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
you could get a sample from Sephora so

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.900 
you could get a sample from Sephora so
that's<00:05:39.300> sort<00:05:39.450> of<00:05:39.570> my<00:05:39.919> venture<00:05:40.919> into<00:05:41.280> cleansing

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
that's sort of my venture into cleansing

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.080 
that's sort of my venture into cleansing
oils<00:05:42.240> and<00:05:42.450> it's<00:05:42.570> kind<00:05:42.900> of<00:05:43.020> I<00:05:43.440> would<00:05:43.979> say<00:05:44.370> not

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
oils and it's kind of I would say not

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.060 
oils and it's kind of I would say not
all<00:05:45.150> good<00:05:45.660> and<00:05:45.990> it<00:05:46.169> really<00:05:46.200> has<00:05:46.560> me<00:05:46.710> skeptical

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
all good and it really has me skeptical

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.980 
all good and it really has me skeptical
about<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.760> cleansing<00:05:48.150> oil<00:05:48.330> kind<00:05:48.990> of<00:05:49.050> movement
