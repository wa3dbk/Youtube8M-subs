00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
break the whole damn thing so let's

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.440 
break the whole damn thing so let's
start<00:00:07.830> small<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.309> you're<00:00:08.880> hacking<00:00:09.090> stores

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
start small and you're hacking stores

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.180 
start small and you're hacking stores
seems<00:00:09.719> trivial<00:00:09.990> but<00:00:10.469> it's<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.679> good<00:00:10.800> place<00:00:10.980> for

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
seems trivial but it's a good place for

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:25.370 
seems trivial but it's a good place for
us<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> be<00:00:11.429> all<00:00:11.969> right<00:00:12.030> get<00:00:12.450> moving<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:24.380> think

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
us to be all right get moving I think

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.870 
us to be all right get moving I think
you'd<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.560> best<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.859> start<00:00:26.070> at<00:00:26.220> plan<00:00:26.519> teasing

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
you'd be best to start at plan teasing

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.750 
you'd be best to start at plan teasing
go<00:00:27.570> big<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:27.900> go<00:00:27.960> home<00:00:28.140> am<00:00:28.529> i<00:00:28.680> right<00:00:28.890> okay<00:00:29.340> good

thing<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.620> think<00:04:14.920> it's<00:04:15.190> controlling<00:04:15.550> the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
thing I think it's controlling the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.970 
thing I think it's controlling the

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
security program here so so if you catch

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.530 
security program here so so if you catch
the<00:04:18.160> golden<00:04:18.430> orb<00:04:18.639> and<00:04:18.760> shut<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:18.970> down<00:04:19.209> then<00:04:19.450> the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
the golden orb and shut it down then the

the golden orb and shut it down then the
