00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
way but here is the head that that I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.130 
way but here is the head that that I
guess<00:01:14.619> one<00:01:14.890> on<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.159> air<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.750> there's<00:01:17.080> a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140

and actually coming out with another
battle<00:02:19.810> pack<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.350> in<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.650> or<00:02:21.220> weapons<00:02:21.700> back

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
battle pack and in that or weapons back

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.400 
battle pack and in that or weapons back
and<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.330> weapons<00:02:22.660> pack<00:02:22.870> Merman<00:02:23.350> is

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
and then that weapons pack Merman is

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.960 
and then that weapons pack Merman is
going<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.590> have<00:02:23.710> new<00:02:23.920> armor<00:02:24.310> which<00:02:24.550> is<00:02:24.580> gold

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
going to have new armor which is gold

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.040 
going to have new armor which is gold
and<00:02:25.210> guess<00:02:25.690> for<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.440> 2002<00:02:27.070> series

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
and guess for the 2002 series

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.940 
and guess for the 2002 series
gold<00:02:29.050> weapons<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.740> gold<00:02:31.560> armor<00:02:32.560> right<00:02:32.680> here

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
gold weapons in a gold armor right here

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.380 
gold weapons in a gold armor right here
so<00:02:33.130> it's<00:02:33.250> pretty<00:02:33.340> cool<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.790> sword<00:02:34.000> fits<00:02:34.240> in

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
so it's pretty cool so the sword fits in

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.770 
so it's pretty cool so the sword fits in
the<00:02:34.510> back<00:02:35.400> face<00:02:36.400> costume<00:02:36.880> doesn't<00:02:37.120> fit<00:02:37.660> in

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
the back face costume doesn't fit in

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.170 
the back face costume doesn't fit in
there<00:02:37.870> very<00:02:37.900> well<00:02:38.200> kind<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:38.890> falls<00:02:39.640> over<00:02:39.970> all

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
there very well kind of falls over all

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.580 
there very well kind of falls over all
over<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.480> place<00:02:40.690> but<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:40.960> sword<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.290> really

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
over the place but this sword is really

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.220 
over the place but this sword is really
cool<00:02:42.210> it's<00:02:43.210> like<00:02:43.330> looks<00:02:43.690> like<00:02:43.810> it's<00:02:43.990> made<00:02:44.170> of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
something from under the water I really

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.890 
something from under the water I really
like<00:02:47.800> how<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.160> themed<00:02:48.460> like<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.030> very<00:02:49.690> cool

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.570 
like how it's themed like that very cool
and<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:53.080> just<00:02:53.230> holds<00:02:54.070> in<00:02:54.280> his<00:02:54.340> hand

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
and that just holds in his hand

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.730 
and that just holds in his hand
perfectly<00:02:54.790> fine<00:02:55.240> you<00:02:56.100> can<00:02:57.100> battle<00:02:57.490> with<00:02:57.640> it

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
perfectly fine you can battle with it

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.160 
perfectly fine you can battle with it
very<00:02:59.740> cool<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.430> like<00:03:00.880> I<00:03:01.000> said<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.390> armor<00:03:01.990> can

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
very cool so like I said this armor can

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.520 
very cool so like I said this armor can
come<00:03:02.380> off<00:03:02.530> really<00:03:02.920> easily<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:05.170> did<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.380> good

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
come off really easily you did a good

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.590 
come off really easily you did a good
look<00:03:05.710> at<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.950> Homer<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.640> got<00:03:06.850> these<00:03:07.000> I'm

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
look at the Homer it's got these I'm

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.020 
look at the Homer it's got these I'm
guessing<00:03:08.020> this<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.260> some<00:03:08.440> sort<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.190> jewelry<00:03:09.940> or

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
guessing this is some sort of jewelry or

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.480 
guessing this is some sort of jewelry or
something<00:03:10.570> or<00:03:10.990> it's<00:03:11.620> just<00:03:11.800> you<00:03:12.040> know<00:03:12.070> part<00:03:12.430> of

something or it's just you know part of
the<00:03:12.550> armor<00:03:12.970> very<00:03:13.450> cool<00:03:13.780> this<00:03:13.930> armor<00:03:14.320> isn't

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350

degrees<00:03:48.880> swivel<00:03:49.450> at<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.810> top<00:03:50.050> of<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.260> arm<00:03:50.470> one

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
degrees swivel at the top of the arm one

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.010 
degrees swivel at the top of the arm one
point<00:03:51.760> at<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:51.970> elbow<00:03:52.270> these<00:03:52.570> figures<00:03:52.810> are

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
point at the elbow these figures are

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.680 
point at the elbow these figures are
really<00:03:53.320> big<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:53.950> it's<00:03:54.700> better<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.240> it's<00:03:55.510> just

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
really big so it's better that it's just

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.090 
really big so it's better that it's just
one<00:03:55.870> point<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.320> elbow<00:03:56.530> instead<00:03:56.830> of<00:03:56.920> two

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
one point the elbow instead of two

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.240 
one point the elbow instead of two
because<00:03:57.580> two<00:03:57.760> would<00:03:57.910> make<00:03:57.940> it<00:03:58.150> more<00:03:58.270> flimsy

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
because two would make it more flimsy

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.590 
because two would make it more flimsy
articulation<00:04:00.250> at<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.580> wrist<00:04:02.430> one<00:04:03.430> huge<00:04:03.880> chest

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
this little you shape that goes up it so

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
this little you shape that goes up it so
it<00:04:29.110> can<00:04:29.140> turn<00:04:29.770> 360<00:04:30.370> degree<00:04:30.760> up<00:04:30.880> there<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:32.070> one

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
it can turn 360 degree up there to one

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:40.810 
it can turn 360 degree up there to one
point<00:04:33.340> at<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.880> knee<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:37.140> can<00:04:38.140> turn<00:04:38.850> right

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
point at the knee and can turn right

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.360 
point at the knee and can turn right
above<00:04:41.630> his<00:04:41.780> little<00:04:42.050> ankle<00:04:42.440> cuff<00:04:42.980> type<00:04:43.220> of

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
above his little ankle cuff type of

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.580 
above his little ankle cuff type of
thing<00:04:43.550> so<00:04:44.270> I<00:04:44.300> can't<00:04:44.570> turn<00:04:44.780> through<00:04:44.960> series<00:04:45.560> and

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
thing so I can't turn through series and

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.560 
thing so I can't turn through series and
then<00:04:46.340> his<00:04:46.460> feet<00:04:46.700> go<00:04:46.880> forward<00:04:47.240> and<00:04:47.300> back<00:04:47.540> and

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
then his feet go forward and back and

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.560 
then his feet go forward and back and
have<00:04:48.290> a<00:04:48.320> tiny<00:04:48.740> pivot<00:04:49.280> on<00:04:49.520> them<00:04:49.760> so<00:04:50.450> that's

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
have a tiny pivot on them so that's

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.320
