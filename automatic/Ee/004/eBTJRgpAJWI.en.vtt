usually<00:01:20.090> when<00:01:20.270> a<00:01:20.300> DLC<00:01:20.960> comes<00:01:21.230> out<00:01:21.470> they<00:01:21.980> update

usually when a DLC comes out they update

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.180 
usually when a DLC comes out they update
like<00:01:22.880> three<00:01:23.600> or<00:01:23.720> four<00:01:23.750> days<00:01:24.230> before<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.890> game

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
like three or four days before the game

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.040 
like three or four days before the game
comes<00:01:25.550> out<00:01:25.760> because<00:01:26.420> they<00:01:26.600> got<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:26.750> patch

it you could play the shit you know

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.300 
it you could play the shit you know
because<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.350> shit's<00:01:33.590> already<00:01:33.830> on<00:01:34.070> the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
because the shit's already on the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.250 
because the shit's already on the
fucking<00:01:34.640> disk<00:01:35.030> you're<00:01:35.330> just<00:01:35.540> downloading<00:01:36.170> an

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260

fucking disk you're just downloading an
unlock<00:01:36.740> code<00:01:36.770> basically<00:01:37.660> but<00:01:38.660> they<00:01:39.320> they

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
unlock code basically but they they

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.680 
unlock code basically but they they
haven't<00:01:39.650> updated<00:01:39.980> it<00:01:40.460> since<00:01:40.610> January<00:01:41.270> 30th

haven't updated it since January 30th

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.240 
haven't updated it since January 30th
I'm<00:01:41.840> thinking<00:01:42.200> that's<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.680> reason<00:01:43.220> because

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
I'm thinking that's the reason because

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.050 
I'm thinking that's the reason because
that's<00:01:43.640> almost<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.180> month<00:01:44.420> they<00:01:44.720> don't<00:01:46.060> like

that's almost a month they don't like

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.910 
that's almost a month they don't like

especially with the PlayStation 3 they

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.590 
especially with the PlayStation 3 they
may<00:01:49.160> patch<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.730> like<00:01:49.910> two<00:01:50.090> or<00:01:50.240> three<00:01:50.270> days

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
may patch it like two or three days

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.290 
may patch it like two or three days
before<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:51.050> DLC<00:01:51.590> released<00:01:51.920> every<00:01:52.250> year<00:01:52.550> every
