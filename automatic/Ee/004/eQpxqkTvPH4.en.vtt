00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.470 

so<00:00:07.530> I'm<00:00:07.650> working<00:00:07.860> on<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.130> little<00:00:08.430> changeup<00:00:09.240> in

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
so I'm working on a little changeup in

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.860 
so I'm working on a little changeup in
my<00:00:09.750> wife's<00:00:10.080> PC

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
my wife's PC

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.780 
my wife's PC
I decided<00:00:11.230> to<00:00:11.440> pull<00:00:11.650> out<00:00:11.680> the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
I decided to pull out the

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.259 
I decided to pull out the
g1<00:00:13.480> sniper<00:00:13.900> and<00:00:14.290> go<00:00:14.440> with

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
g1 sniper and go with

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.529 
g1 sniper and go with
reasonable<00:00:15.920> board<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.609> I'm<00:00:17.699> just<00:00:17.880> using<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
reasonable board so I'm just using a

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.010 
reasonable board so I'm just using a
gigabyte<00:00:19.939> p67<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.180> I'm<00:00:21.300> actually<00:00:21.480> changing<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
gigabyte p67 a I'm actually changing the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.170 
gigabyte p67 a I'm actually changing the
CPU<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.529> well<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.740> had<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> 2500<00:00:23.759> K<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:23.970> there

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
CPU as well I had a 2500 K in there

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.909 
CPU as well I had a 2500 K in there
before<00:00:24.329> and<00:00:24.689> I'm<00:00:25.169> going<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.349> be<00:00:25.470> putting<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.860> a

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
before and I'm going to be putting in a

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.420 
before and I'm going to be putting in a
2600<00:00:26.789> K<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.750> an<00:00:27.989> ancient<00:00:28.259> sample<00:00:29.160> board

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
2600 K this is an ancient sample board

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.549 
2600 K this is an ancient sample board
so<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.880> actually<00:00:30.270> using<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.570> b2<00:00:31.020> chipset

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
so this is actually using the b2 chipset

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.560 
so this is actually using the b2 chipset
which<00:00:31.680> means<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.160> only<00:00:32.369> use<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.640> SATA<00:00:33.059> 3<00:00:33.329> 6

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
which means I can only use the SATA 3 6

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.229 
which means I can only use the SATA 3 6
gigabit<00:00:33.960> per<00:00:34.079> second<00:00:34.440> ports<00:00:34.710> without<00:00:35.280> without

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
gigabit per second ports without without

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.180 
gigabit per second ports without without
them<00:00:36.480> eventually<00:00:37.110> dying<00:00:37.379> but<00:00:37.739> that's<00:00:37.950> fine

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
them eventually dying but that's fine

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
them eventually dying but that's fine
because<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:38.520> only<00:00:38.670> using<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.120> single<00:00:39.420> SSD<00:00:39.870> for

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
because I'm only using a single SSD for

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.889 
because I'm only using a single SSD for
the<00:00:40.140> boot<00:00:40.320> drive<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.760> say<00:00:42.270> 2<00:00:42.329> optical

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the boot drive and then I say 2 optical

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.139 
the boot drive and then I say 2 optical
drive<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.980> machine<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
drive for this machine and I just the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.810 
drive for this machine and I just the
only<00:00:45.180> reason<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.719> I'm<00:00:46.129> bringing<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.430> is

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
only reason that I'm bringing this up is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.270 
only reason that I'm bringing this up is
because<00:00:48.380> actually<00:00:49.380> as<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.680> move<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.040> out<00:00:50.250> of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
because actually as we move this out of

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.780 
because actually as we move this out of
the<00:00:50.400> way<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.540> sit<00:00:54.620> over<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
the way it can sit over here with the

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.960 
the way it can sit over here with the
other<00:00:56.940> computers<00:00:57.630> that<00:00:57.660> are<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.230> shelf

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
other computers that are on this shelf

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.700 
other computers that are on this shelf
that's<00:00:59.970> why<00:01:00.059> motherboards<00:01:00.720> going<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.260> got

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
that's why motherboards going on got

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.889 
that's why motherboards going on got
another<00:01:01.860> one<00:01:02.070> sitting<00:01:02.250> over<00:01:02.520> there<00:01:02.690> anyway<00:01:03.690> I

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
another one sitting over there anyway I

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.340 
another one sitting over there anyway I
can<00:01:03.989> go<00:01:04.259> there<00:01:04.439> No<00:01:05.420> ok<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.960> reason<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
can go there No ok so the reason I

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.630 
can go there No ok so the reason I
brought<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> because<00:01:08.189> I'm<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.579> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
brought this up is because I'm going to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.249 
brought this up is because I'm going to
be<00:01:08.759> reconfiguring<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> airflow<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.140> this

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
be reconfiguring the airflow in this

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.980 
be reconfiguring the airflow in this
machine<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> little<00:01:10.890> bit<00:01:11.009> because<00:01:11.579> it's<00:01:12.270> been<00:01:12.719> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
machine a little bit because it's been a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.740 
machine a little bit because it's been a
little<00:01:13.950> bit<00:01:14.130> problematic<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.360> know<00:01:15.450> she's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
little bit problematic so you know she's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.480 
little bit problematic so you know she's
like<00:01:15.930> yeah<00:01:16.110> yeah<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> arc<00:01:16.950> MIDI<00:01:17.189> case

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
like yeah yeah I like the arc MIDI case

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.639 
like yeah yeah I like the arc MIDI case
it's<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:18.030> favorite<00:01:18.780> case<00:01:18.990> that's<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> want

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
it's my favorite case that's what I want

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.999 
it's my favorite case that's what I want
my<00:01:19.740> PC<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.249> but<00:01:20.759> she<00:01:20.909> doesn't<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.359> this<00:01:21.569> big

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
my PC in but she doesn't like this big

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.370 
my PC in but she doesn't like this big
dust<00:01:23.009> thing<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.819> here<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.719> there's<00:01:25.289> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
dust thing going on here so there's a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.749 
dust thing going on here so there's a
filter<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.039> front<00:01:26.069> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> case<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:26.729> you

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
filter on the front of the case but you

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.129 
filter on the front of the case but you
can<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.209> accumulates<00:01:27.689> quite<00:01:27.929> a<00:01:27.959> lot<00:01:28.109> of

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:28.139 
can see it accumulates quite a lot of

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:29.709 
can see it accumulates quite a lot of
dust

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
dust

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.629 
dust
not<00:01:30.719> very<00:01:30.929> attractive<00:01:31.350> also<00:01:32.069> I've<00:01:32.399> been

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:32.639 
not very attractive also I've been

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:34.580 
not very attractive also I've been
having<00:01:33.119> some<00:01:33.299> problems<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.749> overall<00:01:34.350> dust

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
having some problems with overall dust

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.190 
having some problems with overall dust
buildup<00:01:34.920> inside<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.850> case<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.329> well<00:01:36.749> and<00:01:37.049> what

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
buildup inside the case as well and what

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.899 
buildup inside the case as well and what
I<00:01:37.229> realized<00:01:37.649> since<00:01:37.920> due<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:38.549> negative

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I realized since due to the negative

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.539 
I realized since due to the negative
airflow<00:01:39.719> on<00:01:39.959> the<00:01:40.409> case<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.829> while<00:01:41.039> the<00:01:41.219> intakes

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
airflow on the case so while the intakes

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.089 
airflow on the case so while the intakes
are<00:01:41.759> filtered<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.529> keep<00:01:43.679> a<00:01:43.859> lot<00:01:44.039> of

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:44.099 
are filtered we so we can keep a lot of

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:45.980 
are filtered we so we can keep a lot of
the<00:01:44.249> dust<00:01:44.429> out<00:01:44.609> that<00:01:44.909> way<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.539> still<00:01:45.810> better

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the dust out that way it's still better

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.080 
the dust out that way it's still better
to<00:01:46.170> maintain<00:01:46.349> positive<00:01:47.249> air<00:01:47.520> pressure<00:01:47.549> inside

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
to maintain positive air pressure inside

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.580 
to maintain positive air pressure inside
the<00:01:48.420> case<00:01:48.599> so<00:01:48.749> what<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.139> to<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.319> doing

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the case so what I'm going to be doing

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.620 
the case so what I'm going to be doing
is<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.490> actually<00:01:50.609> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.999> take<00:01:51.179> this<00:01:51.359> fan

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
is I'm actually going to take this fan

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
intake fans in the front so that'll mean

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.029 
intake fans in the front so that'll mean
that<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.179> won't<00:02:03.389> have<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:04.469> ring<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.859> dust

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
that I won't have that that ring of dust

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.830 
that I won't have that that ring of dust
in<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> front<00:02:05.669> and<00:02:05.880> then<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.450> I'm<00:02:06.539> going<00:02:06.749> to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
in the front and then what I'm going to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.710 
in the front and then what I'm going to
do<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.319> I'm<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:08.099> turn<00:02:08.459> all<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.060> these<00:02:09.420> are

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
do is I'm going to turn all of these are

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.710 
do is I'm going to turn all of these are
round<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.500> I'm<00:02:11.489> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.819> use<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.360> ones<00:02:12.540> at

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
round and I'm going to use the ones at

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.890 
round and I'm going to use the ones at
the<00:02:12.810> top<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.560> back<00:02:13.860> as<00:02:14.360> intakes<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.750> what

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
the top and the back as intakes so what

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.890 
the top and the back as intakes so what
I'm<00:02:15.989> hoping<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:16.830> help<00:02:16.980> me<00:02:17.190> achieve<00:02:17.310> is

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
I'm hoping that will help me achieve is

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.740 
I'm hoping that will help me achieve is
to<00:02:18.900> have<00:02:20.090> overall<00:02:21.090> positive<00:02:21.360> air<00:02:21.720> pressure

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
to have overall positive air pressure

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.390 
to have overall positive air pressure
inside<00:02:22.110> which<00:02:22.410> means<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.800> dust<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.220> less

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
inside which means that dust is less

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.030 
inside which means that dust is less
likely<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.060> get<00:02:24.510> sucked<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.990> on<00:02:25.260> little<00:02:25.470> cracks

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
likely to get sucked in on little cracks

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.360 
likely to get sucked in on little cracks
in<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.790> case

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
in the case

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.430 
in the case
and<00:02:27.489> also<00:02:28.269> by<00:02:28.450> having<00:02:28.659> all<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:28.989> intakes

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
and also by having all the intakes

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.800 
and also by having all the intakes
higher<00:02:29.709> up<00:02:29.980> I'm<00:02:30.190> hoping<00:02:30.879> that<00:02:31.060> less<00:02:31.239> dust<00:02:31.540> will

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
higher up I'm hoping that less dust will

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.470 
higher up I'm hoping that less dust will
be<00:02:31.840> brought<00:02:32.799> in<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.280> general<00:02:33.790> because<00:02:34.209> it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
be brought in in general because it

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.030 
be brought in in general because it
won't<00:02:34.659> be<00:02:34.780> sitting<00:02:35.110> right<00:02:35.140> on<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.470> floor<00:02:35.769> so

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
won't be sitting right on the floor so

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.430 
won't be sitting right on the floor so
we'll<00:02:36.190> see<00:02:36.310> how<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.489> goes<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.140> purpose

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
we'll see how this goes so the purpose

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.830 
we'll see how this goes so the purpose
of<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:38.620> video<00:02:38.950> was<00:02:39.280> several<00:02:40.000> fold<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:40.569> number

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
of this video was several fold so number

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.960 
of this video was several fold so number
one<00:02:41.049> was<00:02:41.379> to<00:02:41.650> talk<00:02:41.799> about<00:02:42.069> positive<00:02:42.370> air

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
one was to talk about positive air

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.729 
one was to talk about positive air
pressure<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.420> little<00:02:43.569> bit<00:02:43.720> with<00:02:44.140> respect<00:02:44.560> to

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
pressure a little bit with respect to

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.740 
pressure a little bit with respect to
keeping<00:02:45.730> dust<00:02:45.879> out<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.120> your<00:02:46.209> case<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:46.690> you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
keeping dust out of your case so you

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.960 
keeping dust out of your case so you
want<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.019> use<00:02:47.140> filtered<00:02:47.560> intakes<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.310> then

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
want to use filtered intakes and then

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.210 
want to use filtered intakes and then
have<00:02:49.329> overall<00:02:50.019> positive<00:02:50.260> pressure<00:02:50.739> inside

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
have overall positive pressure inside

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.830 
have overall positive pressure inside
the<00:02:51.400> case<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:51.849> that<00:02:51.879> it<00:02:52.030> blows<00:02:52.329> up<00:02:52.510> little

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
the case so that it blows up little

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.250 
the case so that it blows up little
cracks

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
cracks

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.229 
cracks
number<00:02:54.099> two<00:02:54.250> was<00:02:54.430> because<00:02:54.670> several<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.150> you

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
number two was because several of you

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.350 
number two was because several of you
had<00:02:55.420> asked<00:02:55.780> about<00:02:55.900> my<00:02:56.440> my<00:02:57.430> wife's<00:02:57.730> machine<00:02:58.090> so

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
had asked about my my wife's machine so

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.670 
had asked about my my wife's machine so
I<00:02:58.390> figured<00:02:58.780> I'd<00:02:58.900> show<00:02:59.110> you<00:02:59.140> guys<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.650> finished

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
I figured I'd show you guys the finished

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.650 
I figured I'd show you guys the finished
build<00:03:00.190> know<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.519> it's<00:03:00.640> done<00:03:00.849> and<00:03:01.060> number

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
build know that it's done and number

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.210 
build know that it's done and number
three<00:03:01.870> was<00:03:02.079> if<00:03:02.230> since<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.500> was<00:03:02.620> taking<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.010> apart

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
three was if since I was taking it apart

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.830 
three was if since I was taking it apart
anyway<00:03:03.519> because<00:03:03.700> look<00:03:04.030> at<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.299> color<00:03:04.569> scheme

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
anyway because look at this color scheme

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.530 
anyway because look at this color scheme
I<00:03:05.019> mean<00:03:05.349> yeah<00:03:06.160> yeah<00:03:06.940> if<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.180> guys<00:03:07.329> are

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
I mean yeah yeah if you guys are

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.930 
I mean yeah yeah if you guys are
wondering<00:03:07.840> why<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.290> would<00:03:08.769> have<00:03:08.940> downgraded

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
wondering why I would have downgraded

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.640 
wondering why I would have downgraded
the<00:03:10.060> motherboard<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.720> reason<00:03:11.079> is<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.410> this

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
the motherboard the reason is that this

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.800 
the motherboard the reason is that this
just<00:03:11.950> doesn't<00:03:12.250> go<00:03:12.609> with<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.859> overall<00:03:15.569> look<00:03:16.569> of

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
just doesn't go with the overall look of

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.229 
just doesn't go with the overall look of
this<00:03:17.079> particular<00:03:17.560> case<00:03:17.769> hold<00:03:18.040> on<00:03:18.129> just<00:03:18.459> blow

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
this particular case hold on just blow

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.289 
this particular case hold on just blow
out<00:03:19.269> this<00:03:19.599> you<00:03:19.780> can<00:03:19.989> see<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.260> dust<00:03:20.440> ring<00:03:20.709> right

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
out this you can see the dust ring right

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.640 
out this you can see the dust ring right
not<00:03:22.299> really<00:03:22.420> no<00:03:22.780> okay<00:03:23.109> well<00:03:23.230> whatever<00:03:23.409> it's

not really no okay well whatever it's
there<00:03:23.829> I<00:03:25.920> wish<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:27.040> had<00:03:27.159> compressed<00:03:27.579> air<00:03:27.790> but<00:03:28.090> I

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
there I wish I had compressed air but I

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.309 
there I wish I had compressed air but I
don't<00:03:32.099> I'll<00:03:33.099> call<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.310> good<00:03:33.549> enough<00:03:33.730> okay

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
don't I'll call that good enough okay

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.720 
don't I'll call that good enough okay
throw<00:03:35.319> that<00:03:35.470> on<00:03:35.500> there<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:36.040> now<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:39.190> properly

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.740 
intakes and then this CPU cooler doesn't
need<00:04:21.760> any<00:04:21.940> kind<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.240> additional<00:04:22.449> cooling
