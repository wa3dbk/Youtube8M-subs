00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
bit of puffiness and in our practice

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.230 
bit of puffiness and in our practice
when<00:03:01.440> someone<00:03:01.890> has<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> very<00:03:02.400> slight<00:03:02.820> amount<00:03:03.150> of

puffiness we have we tend to avoid doing
a<00:03:08.040> surgery<00:03:08.790> as<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.300> first<00:03:09.630> procedure<00:03:10.320> and

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
a surgery as the first procedure and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.020 
a surgery as the first procedure and
give<00:03:11.700> them<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.030> option<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.870> see<00:03:13.770> if<00:03:14.040> they<00:03:14.700> like

give them the option to see if they like
a<00:03:15.360> temporizing<00:03:16.320> procedure<00:03:16.950> something<00:03:17.370> that

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
a temporizing procedure something that

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.630 
a temporizing procedure something that
helps<00:03:18.870> soften<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.740> appearance<00:03:19.830> of<00:03:20.400> that

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
helps soften the appearance of that

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.060 
helps soften the appearance of that
little<00:03:21.060> bit<00:03:21.210> of<00:03:21.270> puffiness<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.140> in<00:03:22.980> our

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
little bit of puffiness and in our

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.130 
little bit of puffiness and in our
practice<00:03:23.310> we'll<00:03:23.670> use<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.910> filler<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.690> that

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
practice we'll use a filler and that

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.610 
practice we'll use a filler and that
filler<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.950> placed<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.730> tear<00:03:27.180> trough<00:03:27.210> area

as well as the eyelid to cheek area it's

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.880 
as well as the eyelid to cheek area it's
done<00:03:32.160> very<00:03:32.480> conservatively<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.900> done<00:03:34.680> in<00:03:34.830> a

so that and the material that we

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.080 
so that and the material that we
typically<00:03:42.960> use<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.590> something<00:03:44.520> in<00:03:44.850> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
typically use is something in the

typically use is something in the
hyaluronic<00:03:45.570> acid<00:03:46.410> family<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:47.180> routinely

hyaluronic acid family and routinely

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.390 
hyaluronic acid family and routinely
we'll<00:03:48.420> use<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.660> filler<00:03:49.020> like<00:03:49.380> Restylane<00:03:50.420> so

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
we'll use a filler like Restylane so

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.890 
we'll use a filler like Restylane so
considering<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.550> filler<00:03:53.850> like<00:03:54.090> Restylane<00:03:54.600> to

considering a filler like Restylane to

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.770 
considering a filler like Restylane to
help<00:03:55.140> with<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.650> eyelid<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.370> cheek<00:03:56.400> area<00:03:57.240> to

help with the eyelid to cheek area to

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.350 
help with the eyelid to cheek area to
add<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.960> little<00:03:58.380> bit<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.590> volume<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.360> soften

the transition is one option the other
thing<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.210> we<00:04:03.510> do<00:04:03.720> for<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.140> lot<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.410> our

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
thing that we do for a lot of our

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.850 
thing that we do for a lot of our
patients<00:04:04.830> who<00:04:05.340> have<00:04:05.580> very<00:04:06.240> thin<00:04:06.660> skin<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:07.680> want

patients who have very thin skin we want
to<00:04:07.950> build<00:04:08.220> up<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.460> collagen<00:04:09.270> so<00:04:09.570> we'll<00:04:09.780> do

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
to build up that collagen so we'll do

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.590 
to build up that collagen so we'll do
something<00:04:10.230> called<00:04:10.709> or<00:04:11.550> use<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:11.880> Purdue

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
something called or use a Purdue

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
staff members in our practice have been

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.719 
staff members in our practice have been
availing<00:05:07.229> themselves<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.490> same

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
availing themselves to the same

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.930 
availing themselves to the same
injections<00:05:09.509> so<00:05:10.289> clearly<00:05:11.250> we've<00:05:11.490> been<00:05:11.669> getting

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
injections so clearly we've been getting

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.700 
injections so clearly we've been getting
a<00:05:12.000> lot<00:05:12.150> of<00:05:12.300> good<00:05:12.419> feedback<00:05:12.659> about<00:05:13.139> it<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.620> our

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
a lot of good feedback about it and our

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.200 
a lot of good feedback about it and our
staff<00:05:13.979> members<00:05:14.400> have<00:05:14.580> been<00:05:14.729> getting<00:05:15.120> the

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.460 
staff members have been getting the
injections<00:05:15.690> themselves

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
injections themselves

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.850 
injections themselves
so<00:05:17.190> I'd<00:05:17.909> say<00:05:18.150> conservative<00:05:18.900> options<00:05:19.470> first

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
so I'd say conservative options first

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.850 
so I'd say conservative options first
and<00:05:20.599> however<00:05:21.599> if<00:05:21.990> you<00:05:22.169> notice<00:05:22.470> that<00:05:22.740> the

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
and however if you notice that the

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.629 
and however if you notice that the
puffiness<00:05:23.250> under<00:05:23.460> your<00:05:23.639> eyes<00:05:23.729> is<00:05:24.229> more

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
puffiness under your eyes is more

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.059 
puffiness under your eyes is more
constant<00:05:26.639> and<00:05:27.000> very<00:05:27.419> prominent<00:05:28.229> then<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.889> may

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
constant and very prominent then you may

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.680 
constant and very prominent then you may
want<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.370> consider<00:05:29.789> a<00:05:29.909> surgical<00:05:30.539> procedure

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690
