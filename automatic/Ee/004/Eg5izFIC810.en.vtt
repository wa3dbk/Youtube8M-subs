00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.450
 how about friends we are going to make my potatoes 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.889
 I'm going to do what we do 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.349
 here in madrid in the classic ones that 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.540
 they put in our bars we chop the 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.960
 onion and then peel the 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:23.710
 potatoes that we are going to cut into pieces 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.930
 as you will see irregular 3 x 3 or 4 x 4 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.689
 centimeters you see to better collect the 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.730
 salsa then we will put 45 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.470
 minutes in boiling water not to cook 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.970
 the cee but so that they lose the starch 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.970
 and so that they soften a little 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.690
 well we have the potatoes that we are going to 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.820
 do now it 's very important to put them to 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.820
 that has nothing to drain water 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.430
 good now comes the important thing about this 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.770
 that will surprise you because people 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.829
 think that salsa brava goes with tomato 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.379
 and not necessarily here the madrid does not 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.739
 we do so look we put olive oil 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.269
 super extra virgin for sauce 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.130
 impressive onion which we have 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.380
 explained before you remember at the beginning 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.710
 come on we put it in oil that goes to 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.440
 medium fire and let's water it a little bit 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.320
 for three or four minutes we sautÃ© 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.119
 the onion that softens we put salt 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.120
 so that I was a little bit and talking 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.220
 it's even better to turn out your juice there 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.880
 what else are we going to put pepper look 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.380
 white also sweet paprika and as not 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.590
 spicy paprika that you are going to 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.770
 give here the spark 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.350
 perfect meal Let's start let's 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.600
 really make a plus or we're going 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.609
 to go putting our ingredients 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.500
 between white pepper 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.319
 then teaspoon of paprika 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.390
 sweet and a generous teaspoon of 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.420
 spicy paprika that said add paste 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.979
 the strength to all this and good here comes 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.829
 the flour that is going to thicken 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.600
 all this flour more fat a rush that 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.359
 is what I told you before we move 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.920
 well for it to dissolve and that the 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.880
 paprika to leave us do not miss us 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.940
 raw 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.940
 [Music] 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.920
 well now we added the broth 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.810
 chicken if instead of being broth 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.310
 been milk this would be a bechamel sauce 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.739
 Yes or no 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.420
 well these hikes are called blood and 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.610
 when we're going to give him a hug here with 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.319
 speed to avoid lumps the caldito 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.740
 It has to get very hot too 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.949
 that if we do not make the lumps 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.949
 [Music] 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.670
 and be careful even if the disasters are 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.319
 keep it on fire for eight minutes 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.140
 that the flour is cooked if we do not have 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.120
 fatal class good let's go through the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.180
 blender so that the pieces of 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.060
 onion and leave them in the mouth then 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.940
 we stumble, we give 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.220
 some small holes and we have the sauce 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.130
 brava this is the authentic one of madrid 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.560
 You see what body without tomato fijaros 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.880
 has been left to this sauce and what body 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.989
 is going to get to us when we 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.989
 let's take the appointment ration 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.040
 come on let's finish the potatoes the 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.800
 we had softened a little in water 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.300
 boiling but now let's fry and what 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.370
 let's do in two stages first 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.230
 we're going to put them on medium heat 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.330
 minutillos 4 or 5 for for 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.410
 soften inside to be done 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:28.780
 really there are we have them 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:30.700
 [Music] 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.560
 and when they are soft inside 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.180
 we're going to put a couple of minutes to 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.830
 high fire so that they last a little 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.240
 little in which the potato spoke has not 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.230
 why being golden has to be 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.120
 yellow and with some golden edges the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.069
 We take out on kitchen paper so that 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.760
 the excess oil goes away and we put a 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.220
 little salt 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.620
 well here we have them already a ration 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.720
 appointment as you see generous and we put the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.610
 sauce good to see how it goes sliding 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.739
 how that sauce falls that has to be covered 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.959
 that's why we give him in his good body this 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.370
 it's a delight to guess to see what I'm going to 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.480
 do now 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.480
 it's a machine 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.020
