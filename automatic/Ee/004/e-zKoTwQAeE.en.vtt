00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.240
 hello I'm at the water's edge at night 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.620
 not advance too much so I 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.960
 through this little video to your 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.270
 questions about the new hanger's 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.029
 those at solar so the new ones 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.110
 titanium in fact so here they are 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.110
 packaged in plastic tubes 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.810
 which has the advantage in fact not 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.179
 take up space in the bag and especially 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.610
 to have included origin what allow 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.300
 not broken the head the joints and 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.180
 especially the little ones who stack 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.440
 so here a little ergo allows you in 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.500
 clip 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.750
 very simply your rancor on your 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.280
 head 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.230
 first particularity here you have a 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.880
 hardware system that allows 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.560
 adjust the voltage so there I can not 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.280
 climb to the wall or but I really 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.990
 filtered flip flops or so if you're fishing in 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.440
 border or if one wanted detects with 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.710
 Accuracy and or to arise your sins 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.710
 foreign 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.340
 it's this system is wrong 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.100
 finally this position so he articulated 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.930
 a first time here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.360
 a second time here a third time 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.490
 here a foot binding you do a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.350
 fourth 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.899
 guardians martin ulation allows us 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.020
 to have a chorus totally spells 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:27.649
 not actually disassociate so also your 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.189
 clips and if you simulate touched word to 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:34.420
 say in the detection 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.420
 there is no better 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.480
 they are also sold with clips 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.110
 wire clips cannes 2 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.450
 different sizes actually fit or there 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.250
 you can you can fish his son 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.450
 relaxed to still have some 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.430
 voltage 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.909
 phil and to be extremely accurate life in 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.399
 made between the distance of your 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.390
 detector of your rigor and especially of 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.310
 the coil so 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.590
 if there is no better and there is also there 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.060
 is also sold with a system of 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.740
 clips that's a little bit different from 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.110
 those ci that really gets freaked 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.750
 wires to prevent bluing and for 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.850
 detect a 100% the head so here is in 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.210
 made 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.150
 for those who like hanger 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.240
 quite nice enough technical especially for 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.520
 have a conditioning one 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.900
 precision 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.460
 that's it here in there you can 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.310
 fish like me with great spotted peaks 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.739
 to calm him down 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.870
 there is no concern here is good well I 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.560
 do not know how to make us next video 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.560
