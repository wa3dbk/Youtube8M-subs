I had this creative idea to turn on the
side<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.699> I've<00:00:29.820> put

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
side and as you can see here I've put

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.870 
side and as you can see here I've put
all<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.240> my<00:00:30.420> text<00:00:31.140> books<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.679> binders<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.820> all

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that stuff on the top so it actually

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.080 
that stuff on the top so it actually
functions<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.489> two<00:00:35.640> different<00:00:35.820> ways<00:00:36.030> so

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
functions in two different ways so

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.000 
functions in two different ways so
that's<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.630> really<00:00:36.870> cool<00:00:37.079> little<00:00:37.260> thing<00:00:37.649> there
