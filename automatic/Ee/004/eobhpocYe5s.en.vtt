00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.829

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.699
 famous are they already competed again 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.160
 in 2003 they won an Oscar with 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.920
 trip from chihiro was the first was the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.449
 the only Japanese animation film that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.340
 won the Oscar 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.260
 and now they will be running 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.420
 only this is going to be the first time. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.689
 that the director will be present 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.659
 really on the way to receiving oscar 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:22.890
 if he wins in case it is not a 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:25.799
 simple as bad as that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.930
 is this movie that is contesting calls 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.590
 the tale of the princess with a needle 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.020
 it's based on a tale of fire a lot 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.530
 the oldest tale in fact of the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.950
 Japanese folklore that he is a is a tale 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.020
 of 1,600 more or less, and what counts 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.530
 story of a princess who is 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.170
 found in bamboo stems and she 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.079
 it was shining and so it was a face that 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.689
 A worker who was a cutter works 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.620
 bamboo he meets this princess and 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:02.100
 He catches her and takes care of her. 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:05.430
 Of course I 'm not a robot adam from the globe. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.369
 But then he takes them home they care. 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.590
 And then you need to watch 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.080
 understand the story right nÃ© 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.510
 but as it is a very old set 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.600
 then all animation was made based 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.760
 in ancient paintings of Japan even the 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.510
 classic paintings and such 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.200
 so all the animation she is she is seems 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.180
 that well painted yet so old me 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:37.200
 I thought it was very beautiful indeed 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:39.450
 the actor who does not understand art at all 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.110
 So, but they're going to be running. 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.470
 as best animation against how 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:52.260
 train your dragon 2 bi river six 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:54.720
 box brought and the sound of the deficit sorry 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.820
 Do not know the name here is an Irish movie. 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.980
 very cute Irish animation and 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:04.410
 Look, I'm twisting, I do not know. 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.350
 I think any of them who win 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.410
 going to stay will be very valid because I 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.320
 not watched Birro 6 yet but I think the 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.870
 very well made animation is just that they are 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.019
 different types of course or how much 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.660
 done is based on something other old 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.540
 fully modern understood I think 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.360
 It's very different but they are not all 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.209
 and today I think that everyone is 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.549
 valid so then know me can 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.920
 we win so it does not matter 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.470
 besides the other films also already 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.320
 have won awards this movie has already won 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.610
 other air prizes of better 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:48.600
 animation in others elsewhere in the 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.790
 united states, then and beyond 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.780
 plus the studio ghibli to a very studio 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.480
 he is already very famous and it is 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.209
 cool because they always did 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.800
 very beautiful very beautiful animations 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.650
 even just that the time they come 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.560
 won the Oscar in 2003 with 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.080
 trip takes the director did not take the 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.880
 oscar is because he said he did not 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.780
 wanted to enter a country that was 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.549
 attacking iraq on f 1 then that goes 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.690
 be the first time a director 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.920
 It's really going on at the ceremony. 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.800
 Oscar in 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.990
 but it is so for those who like 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.320
 follow these things so I found 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.380
 interesting news but that 's it 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.380
 same 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.690
 i
