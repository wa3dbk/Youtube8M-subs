00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
demonstrate it first we're going to

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.810 
demonstrate it first we're going to
pretty<00:00:35.410> much<00:00:35.560> play<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:35.980> same<00:00:36.190> kind<00:00:36.489> of<00:00:36.550> rhythm

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
pretty much play the same kind of rhythm

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.819 
pretty much play the same kind of rhythm
pattern<00:00:37.360> and<00:00:37.989> then<00:00:38.170> I'm<00:00:38.289> going<00:00:38.410> to<00:00:38.440> move<00:00:38.620> it<00:00:38.800> to

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
pattern and then I'm going to move it to

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.049 
pattern and then I'm going to move it to
something<00:00:39.100> that's<00:00:39.340> just<00:00:39.489> a<00:00:39.640> more<00:00:39.850> of<00:00:39.940> a

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
something that's just a more of a

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.790 
something that's just a more of a
secondary<00:00:40.780> guitar<00:00:41.199> part<00:00:41.440> where<00:00:41.559> I'm<00:00:41.649> just

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
secondary guitar part where I'm just

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.319 
secondary guitar part where I'm just
going<00:00:41.920> to<00:00:41.980> let<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.190> chords<00:00:42.550> ring<00:00:42.789> out<00:00:42.940> you<00:00:43.149> can

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
going to let the chords ring out you can

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.970 
going to let the chords ring out you can
kind<00:00:43.539> of<00:00:43.570> see<00:00:43.629> how<00:00:43.870> they<00:00:43.929> mesh<00:00:44.379> to<00:00:44.620> get<00:00:44.739> it<00:00:44.829> by

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
kind of see how they mesh to get it by

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.069 
kind of see how they mesh to get it by
most<00:00:45.250> one<00:00:46.090> really<00:00:46.420> important<00:00:46.809> thing<00:00:46.960> to

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
most one really important thing to

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.110 
most one really important thing to
mention<00:00:47.199> though<00:00:47.559> is<00:00:47.800> that<00:00:47.829> you<00:00:48.550> know<00:00:48.670> again

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
mention though is that you know again

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.220 
mention though is that you know again
you're<00:00:49.420> going<00:00:49.539> to<00:00:49.629> be<00:00:49.750> able<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:49.989> hear

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
you're going to be able to hear

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.160 
you're going to be able to hear
everything<00:00:50.769> that<00:00:51.070> each<00:00:51.309> of<00:00:51.550> us<00:00:51.670> does<00:00:52.170> just

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
everything that each of us does just

what you're going to hear on albums when

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.660 
what you're going to hear on albums when
guys<00:01:51.630> are<00:01:51.660> making<00:01:52.140> making<00:01:53.010> albums<00:01:53.460> and

guys are making making albums and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.310 
guys are making making albums and
they're<00:01:53.790> layering<00:01:54.030> guitar<00:01:54.630> parts<00:01:55.050> that's<00:01:55.230> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
they're layering guitar parts that's a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.660 
they're layering guitar parts that's a
whole<00:01:55.470> idea<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:55.830> layering<00:01:56.160> you're<00:01:56.550> not

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
whole idea of layering you're not

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.970 
whole idea of layering you're not
layering<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.300> same<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:01.110> same<00:02:01.140> chords<00:02:01.800> down

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
layering the same the same chords down

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.710 
layering the same the same chords down
here<00:02:02.280> over<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.790> over<00:02:02.910> where<00:02:03.450> you're<00:02:03.570> doing

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
here over and over where you're doing

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.570 
here over and over where you're doing
these<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:03.990> making<00:02:04.110> layers<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:05.220> chord

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
these are making layers of chord

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.719 
these are making layers of chord
inversions<00:02:05.730> and<00:02:06.450> when<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.870> invert<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.380> notes

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
inversions and when you invert the notes

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.030 
inversions and when you invert the notes
it<00:02:08.729> makes<00:02:08.940> for<00:02:09.119> nice<00:02:09.300> thick<00:02:09.780> wide<00:02:10.290> sound<00:02:10.800> and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
it makes for nice thick wide sound and

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.220 
it makes for nice thick wide sound and
that's<00:02:11.160> why<00:02:11.340> good<00:02:12.180> rock<00:02:12.390> albums<00:02:12.810> sound<00:02:13.050> nice

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that's why good rock albums sound nice

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.140 
that's why good rock albums sound nice
and<00:02:13.470> big<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:14.100> because<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.610> guitar<00:02:14.850> players

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150

bass players and counter flares all know

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.520 
bass players and counter flares all know
how<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.700> layer<00:02:17.970> their<00:02:18.510> tongue<00:02:18.780> layer<00:02:19.230> their

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
how to layer their tongue layer their

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
sound just to pick up on a word that

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.290 
sound just to pick up on a word that
Mitch's<00:02:22.200> use<00:02:22.380> their<00:02:22.620> inversions<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.850> what<00:02:24.150> we

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
Mitch's use their inversions so what we

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.940 
Mitch's use their inversions so what we
need<00:02:24.420> by<00:02:24.570> chord<00:02:24.960> inversions<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.800> is

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
need by chord inversions this is

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.230 
need by chord inversions this is
something<00:02:26.190> we'll<00:02:26.310> cover<00:02:26.460> more<00:02:26.610> detail<00:02:27.120> later

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
something we'll cover more detail later

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.960 
something we'll cover more detail later
but<00:02:27.660> simply<00:02:28.560> let's<00:02:29.340> assume<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.700> we're

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
but simply let's assume that we're

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.340 
but simply let's assume that we're
playing<00:02:30.090> an<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.330> minor<00:02:30.600> chord<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:31.170> has<00:02:31.320> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
playing an a minor chord it has the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.940 
playing an a minor chord it has the
notes<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:32.040> C<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.580> E<00:02:33.030> within<00:02:33.960> it<00:02:34.080> if<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:34.830> were

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
notes of a C and E within it if we were

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.260 
notes of a C and E within it if we were
to<00:02:35.040> start<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.940> see<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.110> when<00:02:37.320> c<00:02:37.620> e<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.270> that

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
to start that on see so when c e a that

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.580 
to start that on see so when c e a that
would<00:02:39.360> still<00:02:39.540> be<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.750> notes<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.110> an<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.290> minor

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
would still be the notes of an a minor

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.710 
would still be the notes of an a minor
but<00:02:41.460> it's<00:02:41.580> not<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:41.970> what<00:02:42.180> we<00:02:42.270> call<00:02:42.450> root

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
but it's not in what we call root

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.780 
but it's not in what we call root
position<00:02:42.960> today<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.830> lowest<00:02:44.130> note<00:02:44.310> so

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
position today is the lowest note so

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.449 
position today is the lowest note so
it's<00:02:44.820> now<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.450> first<00:02:45.870> inversion<00:02:46.290> will<00:02:47.160> explain

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
it's now a first inversion will explain

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.790 
it's now a first inversion will explain
this<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.790> more<00:02:47.820> detail<00:02:48.209> later<00:02:48.239> on<00:02:48.450> later<00:02:48.800> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
this in more detail later on later the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.680 
this in more detail later on later the
other<00:02:49.950> thing<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.280> also<00:02:50.580> gives<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.209> real

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
other thing it also gives you is a real

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.740 
other thing it also gives you is a real

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
good foot in the door for opening up

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.930 
good foot in the door for opening up
ideas<00:02:55.260> for<00:02:55.530> lead<00:02:55.709> lines<00:02:56.040> melody<00:02:56.520> line<00:02:56.700> that

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
ideas for lead lines melody line that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.760 
ideas for lead lines melody line that
sort<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.209> thing<00:02:57.300> because<00:02:57.959> all<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.110> these<00:02:58.350> cute

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
sort of thing because all of these cute

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.979 
sort of thing because all of these cute
little<00:02:58.860> chord<00:02:59.459> shapes<00:02:59.820> could<00:03:00.540> obviously<00:03:00.780> be

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
little chord shapes could obviously be

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.380 
little chord shapes could obviously be
broken<00:03:01.410> down<00:03:01.440> into<00:03:01.620> arpeggios<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.670> then<00:03:02.970> you

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
broken down into arpeggios and then you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.850 
broken down into arpeggios and then you
know<00:03:03.510> scalar<00:03:03.930> lines<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.410> will<00:03:04.500> obviously

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
know scalar lines that will obviously

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.820 
know scalar lines that will obviously
match<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.489> chord<00:03:05.670> progression<00:03:06.739> should<00:03:07.739> we

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
match the chord progression should we

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.260 
match the chord progression should we
demonstrate<00:03:08.370> something<00:03:08.610> like<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.150> want

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
demonstrate something like that you want

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.090 
demonstrate something like that you want
to<00:03:09.300> do<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.480> still<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.380> coop<00:03:10.560> I'll<00:03:10.770> do<00:03:11.070> the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
to do that still the coop I'll do the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.400 
to do that still the coop I'll do the
courts<00:03:11.400> again<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:12.510> start<00:03:12.720> off<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.140> then<00:03:13.230> had

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
courts again you start off and then had

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.180 
courts again you start off and then had
some<00:03:13.970> dudes<00:03:15.470> so<00:03:16.470> against<00:03:16.800> he's<00:03:16.950> going<00:03:17.130> to

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
some dudes so against he's going to

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.410 
some dudes so against he's going to
start<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.520> off<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:17.940> I'm<00:03:18.000> going<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.150> come<00:03:18.330> in

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
start it off and I'm going to come in

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:44.740 
start it off and I'm going to come in
the<00:03:18.540> next<00:03:18.660> go-around

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.869 

so<00:03:45.750> it's<00:03:45.870> just<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.110> very<00:03:46.349> simple<00:03:46.709> melody<00:03:47.370> what

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
so it's just a very simple melody what

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.670 
so it's just a very simple melody what
I'm<00:03:48.000> doing<00:03:48.300> is<00:03:48.390> I'm<00:03:48.510> kind<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.810> isolating<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.530> lot

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
I'm doing is I'm kind of isolating a lot

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.110 
I'm doing is I'm kind of isolating a lot
of<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:49.890> core<00:03:50.129> tones<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.640> there<00:03:50.790> I'm<00:03:50.940> going

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
of the core tones in there I'm going

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.020 
of the core tones in there I'm going
from<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:52.069> a-team<00:03:53.069> on<00:03:53.280> I'm<00:03:53.459> just<00:03:53.760> hitting<00:03:53.879> the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
from the a-team on I'm just hitting the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:02.059 
from the a-team on I'm just hitting the
roof<00:03:59.300> on<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.450> cheek<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:01.500> I'm<00:04:01.560> just<00:04:01.769> doing<00:04:02.010> a

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
roof on the cheek so I'm just doing a

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.789 
roof on the cheek so I'm just doing a
melody<00:04:02.610> that's<00:04:03.150> focusing<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.170> all<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.620> a

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
melody that's focusing and all that a

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.059 
melody that's focusing and all that a
the<00:04:05.549> sea<00:04:05.849> or<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.269> A<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.629> F<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.650> then<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.890> sea

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
the sea or the A to F and then the sea

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.180 
the sea or the A to F and then the sea
and<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.280> G<00:04:08.549> keeping<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.390> very<00:04:09.450> simple<00:04:10.190> what's

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
and the G keeping it very simple what's

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.080 
and the G keeping it very simple what's
commonly<00:04:11.489> referred<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.879> as<00:04:12.030> target<00:04:12.810> knows

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
commonly referred to as target knows

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.710 
commonly referred to as target knows
exactly<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.660> then<00:04:16.070> so<00:04:17.070> there's<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.340> little

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
exactly and then so there's a little

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.870 
exactly and then so there's a little
glimpse<00:04:18.720> on<00:04:18.959> how<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.229> play<00:04:19.470> that's<00:04:19.799> two<00:04:20.310> guitar
