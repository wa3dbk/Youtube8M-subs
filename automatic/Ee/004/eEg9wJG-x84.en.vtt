of<00:04:23.560> space<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:25.270> I<00:04:25.300> plan<00:04:25.780> on<00:04:26.310> making<00:04:27.310> that

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
of space so I plan on making that

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.730 
of space so I plan on making that
counter<00:04:28.000> space<00:04:28.240> on<00:04:28.449> this<00:04:28.570> side<00:04:28.630> double<00:04:29.500> as<00:04:29.680> a

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
counter space on this side double as a

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.779 
counter space on this side double as a
bed<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:31.810> I'll<00:04:32.020> have<00:04:32.199> the<00:04:32.470> some<00:04:33.310> phones<00:04:33.550> or

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
bed so I'll have the some phones or

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.040 
bed so I'll have the some phones or
something<00:04:34.090> some<00:04:34.330> foam<00:04:34.510> material<00:04:34.690> or

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
something some foam material or

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.510 
something some foam material or
something<00:04:35.349> that<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:35.710> know<00:04:35.830> somebody<00:04:36.250> can

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
something that you know somebody can

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.940 
something that you know somebody can
sleep<00:04:36.760> on<00:04:36.909> and<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:38.110> will<00:04:38.200> be<00:04:38.320> storage<00:04:38.680> space

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
sleep on and it will be storage space

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.120 
sleep on and it will be storage space
underneath<00:04:39.279> like<00:04:39.639> a<00:04:39.700> cabinets

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
underneath like a cabinets

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.480 
underneath like a cabinets
maybe<00:04:41.580> one<00:04:41.820> big<00:04:42.000> cabinet<00:04:42.330> door<00:04:42.540> here<00:04:43.490> with

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
maybe one big cabinet door here with

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.520 
maybe one big cabinet door here with
access<00:04:45.090> from<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:45.600> outside<00:04:45.630> from<00:04:46.380> these

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
access from the outside from these

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.470 
access from the outside from these
double<00:04:46.800> doors<00:04:46.950> underneath<00:04:47.880> so<00:04:48.150> be<00:04:48.300> all

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
double doors underneath so be all

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.820 
double doors underneath so be all
storage<00:04:48.810> space<00:04:49.020> underneath<00:04:49.230> that<00:04:49.440> cabinet

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
storage space underneath that cabinet

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.470 
storage space underneath that cabinet
and<00:04:50.040> of<00:04:50.670> course<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:50.970> know<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.180> camera<00:04:51.450> is

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
and of course you know the camera is

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.550 
and of course you know the camera is
going<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:51.690> run<00:04:51.810> across<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.200> top<00:04:52.350> on<00:04:52.530> both

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
going to run across the top on both

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.750 
going to run across the top on both
sides<00:04:52.950> now<00:04:53.930> as<00:04:54.930> far<00:04:55.200> as<00:04:55.260> this<00:04:55.440> ceiling<00:04:56.220> goes<00:04:56.400> as

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
sides now as far as this ceiling goes as

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.510 
sides now as far as this ceiling goes as
you<00:04:56.880> can<00:04:57.030> see<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.480> still<00:04:58.110> have<00:04:58.170> these<00:04:58.620> rails<00:04:59.310> in

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
you can see I still have these rails in

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.340 
you can see I still have these rails in
here<00:04:59.730> from<00:04:59.910> when<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.150> was<00:05:00.180> a<00:05:00.330> sense<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:01.020> struck

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
here from when it was a sense I struck

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.130 
here from when it was a sense I struck
those<00:05:01.950> are<00:05:02.100> coming<00:05:02.370> down<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.960> I'm<00:05:03.960> going<00:05:04.110> to

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
those are coming down and I'm going to

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.060 
those are coming down and I'm going to
put<00:05:04.320> a<00:05:04.350> false<00:05:05.330> drop<00:05:06.330> ceiling<00:05:06.900> on<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.680> inside

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
put a false drop ceiling on the inside

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.240 
put a false drop ceiling on the inside
here<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:10.100> problem<00:05:11.100> I'm<00:05:11.190> having<00:05:11.340> right<00:05:11.640> now<00:05:11.670> is

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
here and problem I'm having right now is

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.240 
here and problem I'm having right now is
how<00:05:14.250> loud<00:05:14.580> this<00:05:15.390> is<00:05:15.720> so<00:05:16.560> I'm<00:05:16.800> going<00:05:16.950> to<00:05:17.010> put

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
how loud this is so I'm going to put

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.310 
how loud this is so I'm going to put
some<00:05:17.460> insulation<00:05:18.150> in<00:05:18.480> between<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:19.140> rafters

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
some insulation in between the rafters

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.800 
some insulation in between the rafters
and<00:05:20.070> this<00:05:20.400> material<00:05:20.730> trying<00:05:21.300> to<00:05:21.360> quiet<00:05:21.570> down<00:05:21.750> a

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
and this material trying to quiet down a

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.980 
and this material trying to quiet down a
little<00:05:21.990> bit<00:05:22.170> and<00:05:23.300> eventually<00:05:24.300> I'm<00:05:24.750> going<00:05:24.900> to

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
little bit and eventually I'm going to

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.370 
little bit and eventually I'm going to
have<00:05:25.250> to<00:05:26.250> figure<00:05:26.400> out<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.640> way<00:05:26.880> to<00:05:27.110> get<00:05:28.110> some

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
have to figure out a way to get some

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.440 
have to figure out a way to get some
natural<00:05:28.830> ventilation<00:05:29.000> sunlight<00:05:30.000> in<00:05:30.150> here<00:05:30.300> so

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
natural ventilation sunlight in here so

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.850 
natural ventilation sunlight in here so
what<00:05:30.600> I<00:05:30.630> was<00:05:30.780> thinking

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
what I was thinking

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.240 
what I was thinking
was<00:05:32.400> putting<00:05:32.669> some<00:05:33.830> you<00:05:34.830> know<00:05:34.950> pressure

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
was putting some you know pressure

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.570 
was putting some you know pressure
treated<00:05:36.110> panels<00:05:37.110> up<00:05:37.260> there<00:05:37.650> um<00:05:40.490> bolts<00:05:41.490> them

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
treated panels up there um bolts them

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.659 
treated panels up there um bolts them
down<00:05:41.730> through<00:05:41.940> here<00:05:42.300> you<00:05:43.290> know<00:05:43.550> make<00:05:44.550> them

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
down through here you know make them

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.550 
down through here you know make them
waterproof<00:05:44.880> or<00:05:45.330> something<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.720> don't<00:05:45.780> know<00:05:45.990> you

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
waterproof or something I don't know you

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.930 
waterproof or something I don't know you
guys<00:05:46.710> can<00:05:46.919> give<00:05:47.040> you<00:05:47.100> some<00:05:47.250> ideas<00:05:47.640> on<00:05:47.790> what<00:05:47.880> I

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
guys can give you some ideas on what I

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.480 
guys can give you some ideas on what I
can<00:05:48.150> do<00:05:48.270> for<00:05:48.450> this<00:05:48.570> roof<00:05:49.140> but<00:05:49.470> that's<00:05:50.310> what<00:05:50.460> I

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
can do for this roof but that's what I

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.250 
can do for this roof but that's what I
was<00:05:50.640> thinking<00:05:50.880> of<00:05:50.940> a<00:05:51.030> temporary<00:05:51.360> thing<00:05:51.510> see

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
was thinking of a temporary thing see

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.900 
was thinking of a temporary thing see
how<00:05:52.290> that<00:05:52.560> works<00:05:52.770> out<00:05:52.950> so<00:05:53.400> that<00:05:53.490> I<00:05:53.520> can<00:05:53.669> put<00:05:53.820> an

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
how that works out so that I can put an

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:03.290 
how that works out so that I can put an
AC<00:05:54.090> unit<00:05:54.540> in<00:05:54.630> here<00:05:54.930> you<00:05:55.860> know<00:06:00.110> yeah<00:06:01.110> but<00:06:02.090> as<00:06:03.090> far

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
AC unit in here you know yeah but as far

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.120 
AC unit in here you know yeah but as far
as<00:06:03.330> insulation<00:06:03.720> goes<00:06:04.050> I'm<00:06:04.770> going<00:06:04.890> to<00:06:04.979> use<00:06:05.100> a

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
as insulation goes I'm going to use a

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.850 
as insulation goes I'm going to use a
styrofoam<00:06:06.080> insulation<00:06:07.080> with<00:06:07.410> the<00:06:07.470> reflective

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
styrofoam insulation with the reflective

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.960 
styrofoam insulation with the reflective
material<00:06:08.160> on<00:06:08.220> the<00:06:08.280> backside<00:06:08.700> I<00:06:08.820> don't

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
material on the backside I don't

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.920 
material on the backside I don't
remember<00:06:09.090> it's<00:06:09.330> called<00:06:09.510> but<00:06:09.630> it's<00:06:09.720> about<00:06:09.870> that

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
remember it's called but it's about that

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.530 
remember it's called but it's about that
thick<00:06:10.250> it's<00:06:11.250> going<00:06:11.460> to<00:06:11.520> go<00:06:11.610> here<00:06:11.640> before<00:06:12.300> I<00:06:12.330> put

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
thick it's going to go here before I put

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.100 
thick it's going to go here before I put
my<00:06:12.570> mine<00:06:12.990> or<00:06:13.680> walls<00:06:13.950> up<00:06:14.220> but<00:06:14.790> uh<00:06:15.050> other<00:06:16.050> than

my mine or walls up but uh other than

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.909 
my mine or walls up but uh other than
that<00:06:16.850> solar<00:06:17.850> power<00:06:18.120> is<00:06:18.419> the<00:06:18.450> plan<00:06:18.840> as<00:06:19.590> far<00:06:19.830> as

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
that solar power is the plan as far as

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:27.200 
that solar power is the plan as far as
my<00:06:20.070> electricity<00:06:20.729> goes<00:06:21.410> and<00:06:25.460> as<00:06:26.460> far<00:06:26.970> as<00:06:27.030> the

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
my electricity goes and as far as the

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:34.340 
my electricity goes and as far as the
exterior<00:06:29.270> I'm<00:06:30.270> planning<00:06:30.810> on<00:06:30.870> doing<00:06:32.630> a<00:06:33.630> vinyl
