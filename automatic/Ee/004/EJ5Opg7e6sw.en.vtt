00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.069
 and now a small manual by 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.550
 at the construction site 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:13.920
 daring 620 router it can be 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.690
 configured as a tablet from a computer with 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.690
 laptop when connected 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.660
 here connects the wire that you 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.220
 held provider connects here 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.939
 computer which has a wired connection 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.990
 has also can be customized via wai 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.360
 fay if you have a new router or you 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.850
 did a rear reset by pressing the reset button 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.660
 hold it for a few seconds you 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.660
 there will be an open wifi network and so 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.309
 to configure this router 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:53.570
 you need to connect the provider cable 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.570
 to him in the port which is written online 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.280
 a yellow light will appear 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:13.020
 Further we open the tablet settings we see 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.240
 connected network called 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.060
 d-link 620, this is how it will look 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:25.710
 not password protected since we reset 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:28.650
 the password will be empty connect go 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.729
 in any browser in the address bar 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.310
 we collect 192 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.310
 . 168. 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.040
 0.1 this ip address is written in 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.630
 the settings are registered behind the router on 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.550
 paper as well as the password 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.550
 administrator now we need it 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.530
 after we press enter we get to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:04.250
 router settings password standard 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.250
 admin is the same as login too admin 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:18.770
 and so we got into the settings of the router 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.840
 d-link 620 dir-300 looks exactly the same 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.209
 but there are different firmware they look 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.160
 a little bit different 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.990
 go to advanced settings this 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.750
 firmware one of the freshest for this 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:34.570
 router 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.570
 so we go online wan 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:44.930
 here we see there is already one network click 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:47.300

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.820

 the one who gave you the password 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.310
 the provider gave you a name 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.459

 do we handle a password 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.600
 after you clicked save 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.610
 the browser takes some time to think about 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.850
