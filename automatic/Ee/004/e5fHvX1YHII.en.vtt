00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
know they'll they'll do just fine

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.710 
know they'll they'll do just fine
straight<00:01:58.010> out<00:01:58.130> in<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.370> garden<00:01:58.550> if<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.450> want

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
straight out in the garden if you want

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.840 
straight out in the garden if you want
to<00:01:59.810> go<00:01:59.930> a<00:01:59.960> little<00:02:00.170> bit<00:02:00.350> further<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.580> can

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
to go a little bit further and you can

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.100 
to go a little bit further and you can
use<00:02:02.720> like<00:02:03.160> plastic<00:02:04.160> hoop<00:02:04.510> tunnels<00:02:05.510> to<00:02:05.870> cover

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
use like plastic hoop tunnels to cover

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.900 
use like plastic hoop tunnels to cover
things<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:06.890> are<00:02:06.980> more<00:02:07.100> tender<00:02:07.490> like<00:02:07.610> some<00:02:07.820> of

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
things that are more tender like some of

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.300 
things that are more tender like some of
the<00:02:08.000> lettuces<00:02:08.420> maybe<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.319> what<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.190> does

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
the lettuces maybe and it what it does

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.100 
the lettuces maybe and it what it does
is<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:10.459> really<00:02:10.700> just<00:02:10.849> keeps<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.330> greens<00:02:11.989> a

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
is it really just keeps the greens a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.530 
is it really just keeps the greens a
little<00:02:12.349> bit<00:02:12.440> more<00:02:12.700> tender<00:02:13.700> well<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.480> know

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
little bit more tender well you know

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.910 
little bit more tender well you know
it's<00:02:14.690> funny<00:02:14.810> because<00:02:15.050> when<00:02:15.170> we<00:02:15.500> were<00:02:15.590> talking

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
it's funny because when we were talking

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.580 
it's funny because when we were talking
earlier<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.970> we're<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:17.690> spoiled<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.170> America<00:02:18.560> I

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
earlier it we're so spoiled in America I

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.380 
earlier it we're so spoiled in America I
think<00:02:18.830> if<00:02:19.099> we<00:02:19.220> do<00:02:19.370> get<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.610> little<00:02:19.849> cross<00:02:20.180> on

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
think if we do get a little cross on

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.820 
think if we do get a little cross on
some<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.900> lettuce<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.260> said<00:02:21.440> sometimes

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
some of the lettuce you said sometimes

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.559 
some of the lettuce you said sometimes
there<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.370> little<00:02:22.490> damage<00:02:23.000> but<00:02:23.210> that's

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
there can be a little damage but that's

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.510 
there can be a little damage but that's
okay<00:02:23.870> right<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.920> if<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.130> didn't<00:02:25.370> want

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
okay right so and if you didn't want

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.040 
okay right so and if you didn't want
that<00:02:25.700> damn

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
that damn

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.510 
that damn
then<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.380> could<00:02:26.530> use<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.710> tunnel<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.430> were

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
then you could use a tunnel you were

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.610 
then you could use a tunnel you were
talking<00:02:27.820> about<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.120> was<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:29.200> giving<00:02:29.530> a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
talking about it was just giving a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.930 
talking about it was just giving a
little<00:02:29.650> bit<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.040> cover<00:02:30.340> if<00:02:30.460> you<00:02:30.550> got<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.910> know

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
little bit of cover if you got you know

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.940 
little bit of cover if you got you know
particularly<00:02:31.390> cold<00:02:31.630> nice<00:02:31.900> especially<00:02:32.620> if<00:02:32.860> it

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
particularly cold nice especially if it

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.860 
particularly cold nice especially if it
comes<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.340> quickly<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.330> we've<00:02:34.450> had<00:02:34.630> really

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
comes on quickly so we've had really

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.540 
comes on quickly so we've had really
good<00:02:35.080> weather<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.470> then<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:36.280> know<00:02:36.370> it's<00:02:36.490> like

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
there's a spun polyester product called

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.920 
there's a spun polyester product called
remade<00:02:42.670> mm-hmm<00:02:43.150> there's<00:02:43.480> actually<00:02:43.750> several

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
remade mm-hmm there's actually several

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.810 
remade mm-hmm there's actually several
varieties<00:02:44.140> out<00:02:44.560> there<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.430> can<00:02:45.550> put<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
varieties out there and you can put a

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.940 
varieties out there and you can put a
layer<00:02:46.060> or<00:02:46.240> two<00:02:46.270> over<00:02:46.570> it's<00:02:46.990> really<00:02:47.560> really

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
layer or two over it's really really

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.940 
layer or two over it's really really
light<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.450> basically<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.440> just<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.830> know

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
light and so basically you just you know

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.650 
light and so basically you just you know
lay<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.220> out<00:02:51.310> over<00:02:51.490> your<00:02:51.730> ear<00:02:52.000> salad<00:02:52.240> greens

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
lay it out over your ear salad greens

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.780 
lay it out over your ear salad greens
hold<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.740> down<00:02:53.860> with<00:02:54.100> some<00:02:54.130> stones<00:02:54.520> or

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
hold it down with some stones or

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.880 
hold it down with some stones or
something<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.470> don't<00:02:56.620> even<00:02:56.710> have

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
something and and you don't even have

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.670 
something and and you don't even have
you<00:02:57.040> don't<00:02:57.070> to<00:02:57.220> worry<00:02:57.400> about<00:02:57.490> removing<00:02:58.420> it

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
you don't to worry about removing it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.320 
you don't to worry about removing it
because<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.890> until<00:03:00.790> you're<00:03:00.880> ready<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.120> pick

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
because it until you're ready to pick

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.290 
because it until you're ready to pick
the<00:03:01.450> lettuce<00:03:01.750> right<00:03:02.430> both<00:03:03.430> air<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.670> water

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
the lettuce right both air and water

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.700 
the lettuce right both air and water
will<00:03:04.510> move<00:03:04.600> through<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:05.020> so<00:03:05.230> but<00:03:05.470> that'll

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
will move through it so but that'll

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.750 
will move through it so but that'll
that'll<00:03:05.830> keep<00:03:06.070> them<00:03:06.190> just<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.400> little<00:03:06.430> bit

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
that'll keep them just a little bit

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.340 
that'll keep them just a little bit
better<00:03:06.850> condition<00:03:07.390> for<00:03:07.540> beating<00:03:07.930> perfect

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
better condition for beating perfect
