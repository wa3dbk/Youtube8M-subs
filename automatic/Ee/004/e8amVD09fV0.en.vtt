00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.720 

so<00:00:09.500> one<00:00:10.500> thing<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:10.740> talked<00:00:11.070> about<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.309> lot<00:00:11.519> was

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
so one thing we talked about a lot was

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.240 
so one thing we talked about a lot was
how<00:00:11.910> there's<00:00:12.300> some<00:00:12.780> moves<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.559> are<00:00:13.590> probably

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
how there's some moves that are probably

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.980 
how there's some moves that are probably
more<00:00:14.490> likely<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.940> cause<00:00:15.059> injury<00:00:15.330> than<00:00:15.660> others

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
more likely to cause injury than others

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.490 
more likely to cause injury than others
but<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.369> still<00:00:17.609> practice<00:00:17.910> them<00:00:18.500> but

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
but you can still practice them but

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.050 
but you can still practice them but
there's<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:19.770> some<00:00:20.039> ways<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.490> can<00:00:20.640> try<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
there's just some ways we can try to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.880 
there's just some ways we can try to
make<00:00:21.180> them<00:00:21.359> safer<00:00:21.810> right<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.529> eyes<00:00:22.680> we

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
make them safer right in the eyes we

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.620 
make them safer right in the eyes we
practice<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.400> maybe<00:00:23.609> take<00:00:23.820> us<00:00:23.970> through<00:00:24.269> take

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
practice so maybe take us through take

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
practice so maybe take us through take
us<00:00:24.750> through<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:24.990> okay<00:00:25.619> great<00:00:25.890> so

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
us through that okay great so

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
us through that okay great so
essentially<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.420> video<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.109> about<00:00:28.320> giving

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
essentially this video is about giving

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.220 
essentially this video is about giving
you<00:00:28.859> some<00:00:29.099> strategies<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:30.090> how<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.599> practice

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you some strategies on how to practice

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.319 
you some strategies on how to practice
your<00:00:31.410> poi<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.460> way<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.790> will<00:00:32.969> minimize

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
your poi in a way that will minimize

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.330 
your poi in a way that will minimize
your<00:00:33.690> chance<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.079> injury<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.190> we

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
your chance of injury and so we

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.979 
your chance of injury and so we
mentioned<00:00:35.730> before<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.540> causes<00:00:36.719> of

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
mentioned before one of the causes of

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.260 
mentioned before one of the causes of
injuries<00:00:37.410> over<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.040> simply<00:00:38.550> doing<00:00:38.850> something

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
injuries over you simply doing something

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.510 
injuries over you simply doing something
for<00:00:39.420> too<00:00:39.600> long<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.649> order<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.920> combat<00:00:41.460> that

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
for too long so in order to combat that

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.479 
for too long so in order to combat that
risk<00:00:42.030> clearly<00:00:42.780> adding<00:00:43.350> more<00:00:43.590> variety<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> your

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
risk clearly adding more variety to your

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
risk clearly adding more variety to your
practice<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.750> say<00:00:46.020> you're<00:00:46.140> learning<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
practice so you say you're learning a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.139 
practice so you say you're learning a
new<00:00:46.530> trick<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> you're<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> you're

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
new trick and you're going and you're

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.209 
new trick and you're going and you're
going<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.750> try<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> change<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.100> up

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
going and going try to change it up

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
going and going try to change it up
frequently<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.480> lots<00:00:51.719> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
frequently so that you have lots of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.979 
frequently so that you have lots of
variety<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.980> give<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.370> body<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.699> break<00:00:53.989> so

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
variety to give your body a break so

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.049 
variety to give your body a break so
that's<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.440> strategy<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.370> another<00:00:56.730> strategy

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
that's one strategy and another strategy

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.959 
that's one strategy and another strategy
is<00:00:57.449> simply<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.050> find<00:00:58.289> ways<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:59.010> your<00:00:59.640> poi

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
is simply to find ways in your poi

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.720 
is simply to find ways in your poi
spinning<00:01:00.270> routine<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:01.170> practice<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.430> find

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
spinning routine or practice to find

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.570 
spinning routine or practice to find
rest<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.510> rest<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.409> mean<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.369> actually

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
rest and rest can mean that you actually

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.700 
rest and rest can mean that you actually
think<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.150> your<00:01:06.330> poi<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.900> those<00:01:07.110> moments<00:01:07.320> as

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
think of your poi in those moments as

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.310 
think of your poi in those moments as
props<00:01:08.490> they're<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.270> centerpiece<00:01:09.840> but

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
props they're not the centerpiece but

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350 
props they're not the centerpiece but
your<00:01:10.500> body<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> centerpiece<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.060> can

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
your body is the centerpiece so you can

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.789 
your body is the centerpiece so you can
find<00:01:12.600> beautiful<00:01:12.900> movements<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.710> you've

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
find beautiful movements and if you've

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.710 
find beautiful movements and if you've
seen<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.400> great<00:01:14.610> performers<00:01:15.150> their

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
seen really great performers their

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.510 
seen really great performers their
bodies<00:01:16.170> are<00:01:16.409> doing<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.799> lot<00:01:16.950> more<00:01:17.189> than<00:01:17.490> just

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
bodies are doing a lot more than just

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.450 
bodies are doing a lot more than just
being<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.299> prop<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> poi<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.040> point<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
being a prop for the poi the point is a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.499 
being a prop for the poi the point is a
prop<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.880> their<00:01:21.030> body<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:22.020> try<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.259> find<00:01:22.619> nice

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
prop for their body so try to find nice

Dancy type moves to try to to be to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.870 
Dancy type moves to try to to be to
beautify<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> aesthetic<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.369> also<00:01:29.549> give

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
beautify the aesthetic but also give

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.030 
beautify the aesthetic but also give
your<00:01:30.420> body<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.720> bit<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.110> rest<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.920> is

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
your body a bit of a rest and this is

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.069 
your body a bit of a rest and this is
often<00:01:32.220> why<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.549> emphasize<00:01:33.000> learning<00:01:33.869> through

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
often why I emphasize learning through

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.700 
often why I emphasize learning through
jiggy's<00:01:34.470> well<00:01:34.680> where<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.560> turning<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
jiggy's well where the turning of the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.289 
jiggy's well where the turning of the
poi<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.310> an<00:01:38.400> extension<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.970> how<00:01:39.090> you're

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
poi is just an extension of how you're

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.480 
poi is just an extension of how you're
moving<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:40.110> because<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:41.040> that's<00:01:41.250> going

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
moving right because what that's going

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580 
moving right because what that's going
to<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.119> your<00:01:42.299> arm<00:01:42.509> your<00:01:43.049> arms<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.560> be

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to do is that your arm your arms can be

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.310 
to do is that your arm your arms can be
in<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.829> very<00:01:44.009> restful<00:01:44.490> position<00:01:45.110> but<00:01:46.110> because

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
in a very restful position but because

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.539 
in a very restful position but because
of<00:01:46.380> how<00:01:46.530> you're<00:01:46.740> moving<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.070> body<00:01:47.250> you're

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
of how you're moving the body you're

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.190 
of how you're moving the body you're
still<00:01:47.759> doing<00:01:47.880> patterns<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.049> also

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
still doing patterns so we also

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.139 
still doing patterns so we also
discussed<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.860> our<00:01:49.979> videos<00:01:50.310> about<00:01:50.579> causes<00:01:51.030> of

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
discussed in our videos about causes of

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.210 
discussed in our videos about causes of
injury<00:01:51.270> about<00:01:51.630> how<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.079> poi<00:01:52.590> trying<00:01:53.130> to

this<00:02:00.390> problem<00:02:00.930> what<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.130> say

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
this problem what we can do is say

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.030 
this problem what we can do is say
practice<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.299> range<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.259> extreme<00:02:04.710> so

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
practice a range that is extreme so

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.969 
practice a range that is extreme so
behind<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> back<00:02:05.790> good<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:07.110> say<00:02:07.500> Nick<00:02:07.710> wants

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
behind the back good now say Nick wants

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.619 
behind the back good now say Nick wants
to<00:02:08.099> go<00:02:08.220> over<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> head<00:02:08.940> which<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.360> another

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
to go over the head which is another

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.630 
to go over the head which is another
extreme<00:02:10.080> range<00:02:10.319> he's<00:02:11.009> actually<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.550> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
extreme range he's actually going to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.830 
extreme range he's actually going to
take<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.970> into<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.239> neutral<00:02:12.810> position<00:02:12.959> first

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
take it into a neutral position first

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.070 
take it into a neutral position first
that's<00:02:14.800> not<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.310> extreme<00:02:15.879> and<00:02:16.150> then<00:02:16.750> once

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
that's not so extreme and then once

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.660 
that's not so extreme and then once
you've<00:02:17.379> been<00:02:17.650> there<00:02:17.860> for<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.129> little<00:02:18.250> bit<00:02:18.430> then

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
you've been there for a little bit then

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.820 
you've been there for a little bit then
go<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:19.180> your<00:02:19.269> next<00:02:19.629> extreme<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.620> you're<00:02:20.709> not

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
go to your next extreme so you're not

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.100 
go to your next extreme so you're not
taking<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.400> from<00:02:21.550> extreme<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.450> extreme<00:02:22.870> right

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
taking it from extreme to extreme right

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.410 
taking it from extreme to extreme right
away<00:02:23.349> especially<00:02:23.650> as<00:02:24.160> you're<00:02:24.340> just<00:02:25.150> getting

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
away especially as you're just getting

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.150 
away especially as you're just getting
into<00:02:25.660> your<00:02:25.750> practice<00:02:25.959> you're<00:02:26.769> going<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:26.980> take

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
into your practice you're going to take

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.759 
into your practice you're going to take
an<00:02:27.340> extreme<00:02:27.730> neutral<00:02:28.690> than<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.349> opposite

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
an extreme neutral than to it opposite

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.530 
an extreme neutral than to it opposite
extreme<00:02:30.160> really<00:02:30.819> as<00:02:30.940> you're<00:02:31.120> learning<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.510> new

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
trick finding a neutral launching

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.210 
trick finding a neutral launching
pattern<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.540> work<00:02:34.720> from<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:35.590> for<00:02:35.890> behind<00:02:36.160> the

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
pattern to work from so for behind the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.610 
pattern to work from so for behind the
back<00:02:36.400> we've<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:37.030> backwards<00:02:37.660> weave<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:38.049> front<00:02:38.379> is

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
back we've a backwards weave in front is

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.259 
back we've a backwards weave in front is
a<00:02:39.010> good<00:02:39.280> launching<00:02:39.549> pattern<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.120> very

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
a good launching pattern it's a very

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.940 
a good launching pattern it's a very
it's<00:02:40.450> fairly<00:02:40.690> neutral<00:02:40.930> arms<00:02:41.470> are<00:02:41.650> in<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.769> nice

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
it's fairly neutral arms are in a nice

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.830 
it's fairly neutral arms are in a nice
neutral<00:02:42.190> kind<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.120> what<00:02:43.299> i<00:02:43.330> call<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.540> Tai<00:02:43.810> Chi

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
neutral kind of what i call a Tai Chi

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.120 
neutral kind of what i call a Tai Chi
position<00:02:44.470> yes<00:02:44.799> from<00:02:45.670> here<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.420> go<00:02:47.410> into<00:02:47.769> the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
position yes from here I go into the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.770 
position yes from here I go into the
behind<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.489> back<00:02:48.670> wheel<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.299> come<00:02:52.540> I

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
behind the back wheel and then I come I

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.600 
behind the back wheel and then I come I
come<00:02:52.870> back<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.799> neutral<00:02:53.950> position<00:02:54.130> again

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
come back to the neutral position again

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.390 
come back to the neutral position again
exactly<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:56.019> those<00:02:56.200> two<00:02:56.410> ideas<00:02:56.739> work<00:02:57.190> together

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
exactly so those two ideas work together

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.520 
exactly so those two ideas work together
always<00:02:57.849> finding<00:02:58.299> something<00:02:58.360> neutral<00:02:59.079> to<00:02:59.319> work

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
always finding something neutral to work

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.229 
always finding something neutral to work
from<00:02:59.739> that<00:02:59.920> isn't<00:03:00.220> really<00:03:00.400> demanding<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.209> your

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
from that isn't really demanding on your

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.970 
from that isn't really demanding on your
body<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.870> then<00:03:02.110> trying<00:03:02.410> something<00:03:02.680> that's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
body and then trying something that's

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.949 
body and then trying something that's
more<00:03:03.160> demanding<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:03.790> your<00:03:03.819> body<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.420> then

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
more demanding on your body and then

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.610 
more demanding on your body and then
coming<00:03:05.319> back<00:03:05.349> to<00:03:05.680> neutral<00:03:05.950> good<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.959> we<00:03:08.470> also

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
coming back to neutral good so we also

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.339 
coming back to neutral good so we also
talked<00:03:08.980> about<00:03:09.129> how<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:10.209> jarring<00:03:10.629> stalled<00:03:10.930> in

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
talked about how the jarring stalled in

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.530 
talked about how the jarring stalled in
the<00:03:11.640> decelerating<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.819> movement<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.360> then

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
the decelerating a movement and then

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.030 
the decelerating a movement and then
accelerated<00:03:14.379> in<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.620> opposite<00:03:14.920> direction

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
accelerated in the opposite direction

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.930 
accelerated in the opposite direction
could<00:03:15.489> be<00:03:15.579> creating<00:03:15.970> injury<00:03:17.579> so<00:03:18.579> it<00:03:18.700> looks

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
could be creating injury so it looks

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.210 
could be creating injury so it looks
amazing<00:03:19.269> but<00:03:20.109> it<00:03:20.380> could<00:03:20.620> be<00:03:20.769> setting<00:03:21.010> you

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
amazing but it could be setting you

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.680 
amazing but it could be setting you
yourself<00:03:21.910> up<00:03:22.090> for<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.769> sore<00:03:24.250> shoulders<00:03:24.760> so

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
yourself up for so sore shoulders so

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.750 
yourself up for so sore shoulders so
Nick<00:03:25.900> why<00:03:26.079> don't<00:03:26.109> we<00:03:26.319> show<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.489> movement

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
Nick why don't we show that the movement

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.300 
Nick why don't we show that the movement
that<00:03:28.000> gave<00:03:28.600> your<00:03:28.780> shoulders<00:03:29.139> trouble<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:30.160> was

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
that gave your shoulders trouble it was

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.960 
that gave your shoulders trouble it was
this<00:03:30.670> kind<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.299> kind<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.720> stuff<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.290> the

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
this kind of that kind of stuff that the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.330 
this kind of that kind of stuff that the
reaching<00:03:33.970> way<00:03:34.120> over<00:03:34.450> way<00:03:34.660> over<00:03:34.889> so<00:03:35.889> one<00:03:36.130> way<00:03:36.280> to

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
reaching way over way over so one way to

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.120 
reaching way over way over so one way to
really<00:03:36.790> counteract<00:03:37.510> any<00:03:37.690> risk<00:03:38.049> here<00:03:38.380> is<00:03:38.560> to

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
really counteract any risk here is to

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.190 
really counteract any risk here is to
reduce<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.700> range<00:03:39.910> at<00:03:40.299> which<00:03:40.450> you're<00:03:40.690> working

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
reduce the range at which you're working

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.319 
reduce the range at which you're working
with<00:03:41.380> us<00:03:41.590> especially<00:03:41.950> in<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.400> beginning<00:03:42.519> so

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
with us especially in the beginning so

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.150 
with us especially in the beginning so
instead<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.690> reaching<00:03:43.810> all<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.500> way<00:03:44.739> over

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
instead of reaching all the way over

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.120 
instead of reaching all the way over
reach<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:46.269> half<00:03:46.690> way<00:03:46.900> over<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:47.739> can<00:03:47.919> you<00:03:47.950> show

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
reach a half way over so can you show

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.180 
reach a half way over so can you show
the<00:03:48.160> same<00:03:48.430> move<00:03:48.669> with<00:03:49.000> less<00:03:49.329> range<00:03:49.630> I<00:03:50.190> can

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
the same move with less range I can

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.210 
the same move with less range I can
still<00:03:51.340> practice<00:03:51.519> my<00:03:51.849> planes<00:03:53.069> exactly<00:03:54.069> not

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
still practice my planes exactly not

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.250 
still practice my planes exactly not
reach<00:03:54.489> you<00:03:54.519> so<00:03:54.880> far<00:03:55.180> anymore<00:03:55.450> or<00:03:55.780> maybe<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:56.169> just

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
reach you so far anymore or maybe I just

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.759 
reach you so far anymore or maybe I just
do<00:03:56.709> this<00:03:56.950> hat<00:03:57.220> this<00:03:57.519> much<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.440> could<00:03:59.590> try<00:03:59.709> to

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
do this hat this much and I could try to

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.460 
do this hat this much and I could try to
get<00:03:59.919> really<00:04:00.130> good<00:04:00.250> at<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:00.489> yes<00:04:01.169> super<00:04:02.169> so<00:04:02.380> you

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
get really good at this yes super so you

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.680 
get really good at this yes super so you
can<00:04:02.739> reduce<00:04:03.069> the<00:04:03.310> range<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:03.910> make<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.269> smaller

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
can reduce the range and make it smaller

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.770 
can reduce the range and make it smaller
just<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.139> practice<00:04:05.319> your<00:04:05.680> planes<00:04:06.010> and

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
just to practice your planes and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.479 
just to practice your planes and
eventually<00:04:07.780> make<00:04:07.989> it<00:04:08.169> bigger<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:08.500> bigger<00:04:08.829> so

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
eventually make it bigger and bigger so

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.370 
eventually make it bigger and bigger so
you<00:04:10.090> don't<00:04:10.269> need<00:04:10.359> to<00:04:10.540> practice<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.169> full

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
you don't need to practice the full

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.770 
you don't need to practice the full
range<00:04:11.620> for<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.549> whole<00:04:12.760> exercise<00:04:13.359> if<00:04:13.569> your

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
range for the whole exercise if your

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.000 
range for the whole exercise if your
whole<00:04:13.900> practice<00:04:14.109> in<00:04:14.440> order<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.739> experience

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
whole practice in order to experience

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.529 
whole practice in order to experience
benefit<00:04:15.519> because<00:04:15.609> your<00:04:15.790> body<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.090> going<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.419> be

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
benefit because your body is going to be

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.449 
benefit because your body is going to be
commanding<00:04:17.139> those<00:04:17.320> muscles<00:04:17.739> in<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.010> same<00:04:18.220> way

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
commanding those muscles in the same way

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.670 
commanding those muscles in the same way
every<00:04:18.910> time<00:04:18.940> just<00:04:19.780> sometimes<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:20.380> little<00:04:20.500> bit

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
every time just sometimes a little bit

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.529 
every time just sometimes a little bit
further<00:04:20.919> than<00:04:21.130> others<00:04:21.519> so<00:04:22.120> you<00:04:22.180> don't<00:04:22.330> need<00:04:22.419> to

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
further than others so you don't need to

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.450 
further than others so you don't need to
do<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.659> half<00:04:22.900> an<00:04:23.050> hour<00:04:23.169> full<00:04:23.590> range<00:04:23.830> you<00:04:24.070> can<00:04:24.099> do

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
do a half an hour full range you can do

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.820 
do a half an hour full range you can do
a<00:04:24.700> couple<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.419> times<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:25.960> then<00:04:26.110> some<00:04:26.469> shorter

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
versions of the same stall now remember

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.929 
versions of the same stall now remember
it's<00:04:30.699> not<00:04:30.969> just<00:04:31.509> about<00:04:31.659> the<00:04:31.960> poi<00:04:32.199> so<00:04:33.099> as<00:04:33.490> I've

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939 
it's not just about the poi so as I've

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.360 
it's not just about the poi so as I've
watched<00:04:34.240> poisoners<00:04:35.110> practice<00:04:35.919> and<00:04:36.159> dance

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
watched poisoners practice and dance

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.089 
watched poisoners practice and dance
I've<00:04:36.819> noticed<00:04:37.360> that<00:04:37.539> sometimes<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:38.620> focus<00:04:38.949> is

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
I've noticed that sometimes the focus is

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.159 
I've noticed that sometimes the focus is
all<00:04:39.219> on<00:04:39.249> the<00:04:39.430> poi<00:04:39.669> but<00:04:40.270> not<00:04:40.479> on<00:04:40.689> what<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.960> body

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
all on the poi but not on what the body

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.260 
all on the poi but not on what the body
is<00:04:41.259> doing<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:42.069> one<00:04:42.819> thing<00:04:42.849> that<00:04:43.240> really

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
is doing and one thing that really

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.409 
is doing and one thing that really
stands<00:04:43.870> out<00:04:44.050> our<00:04:44.349> back<00:04:44.650> bends<00:04:45.159> so<00:04:45.729> you're

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
stands out our back bends so you're

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.179 
stands out our back bends so you're
going<00:04:46.569> to<00:04:46.629> have<00:04:46.689> Nick<00:04:46.949> demonstrating<00:04:47.949> a

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:48.189 
going to have Nick demonstrating a

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:50.760 
going to have Nick demonstrating a
backbend<00:04:48.999> and<00:04:49.240> what<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:49.990> want<00:04:50.199> to<00:04:50.289> look<00:04:50.439> for

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
backbend and what you want to look for

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.950 
backbend and what you want to look for
is<00:04:51.159> a<00:04:51.719> nice<00:04:52.949> global<00:04:53.949> backbend<00:04:54.430> so<00:04:55.150> good<00:04:55.810> you

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
is a nice global backbend so good you

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.540 
is a nice global backbend so good you
want<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.199> see<00:04:56.349> coming<00:04:56.830> all<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.099> way<00:04:57.129> down<00:04:57.219> now

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
want to see coming all the way down now

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.570 
want to see coming all the way down now
Nick<00:04:57.969> hinges<00:04:58.509> only<00:04:58.930> from<00:04:59.139> the<00:04:59.169> low<00:04:59.439> back<00:04:59.680> that

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
Nick hinges only from the low back that

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.659 
Nick hinges only from the low back that
puts<00:05:00.789> a<00:05:00.879> lot<00:05:01.300> of<00:05:01.330> stress<00:05:01.900> on<00:05:02.169> his<00:05:02.830> low<00:05:03.009> back<00:05:03.219> so

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
puts a lot of stress on his low back so

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.240 
puts a lot of stress on his low back so
come<00:05:03.849> on<00:05:03.969> up<00:05:04.000> there<00:05:04.960> so<00:05:05.379> now<00:05:05.500> Nick<00:05:05.770> is<00:05:05.919> thinking

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
come on up there so now Nick is thinking

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.999 
come on up there so now Nick is thinking
about<00:05:06.370> lengthening<00:05:06.969> is<00:05:07.270> fine<00:05:07.599> and<00:05:07.990> then<00:05:08.800> come

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
about lengthening is fine and then come

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.050 
about lengthening is fine and then come
back<00:05:09.039> up<00:05:09.840> good<00:05:10.840> instead<00:05:11.830> of<00:05:11.860> hinging<00:05:12.370> so<00:05:12.909> you

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
back up good instead of hinging so you

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.730 
back up good instead of hinging so you
can<00:05:13.300> look<00:05:13.419> at<00:05:13.599> all<00:05:13.840> of<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.229> movement<00:05:14.620> that

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
can look at all of the movement that

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.929 
can look at all of the movement that
you're<00:05:14.889> doing<00:05:15.159> while<00:05:15.340> you're<00:05:15.490> spinning<00:05:15.729> your

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:15.939 
you're doing while you're spinning your

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.269 
you're doing while you're spinning your
poi<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.419> try<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:16.930> identify<00:05:17.199> areas<00:05:17.710> we<00:05:18.069> might

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:18.279 
poi and try to identify areas we might

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:20.909 
poi and try to identify areas we might
see<00:05:18.879> strain<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:19.599> where<00:05:20.139> you<00:05:20.289> see<00:05:20.469> strain<00:05:20.740> is

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
see strain and where you see strain is

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.529 
see strain and where you see strain is
usually<00:05:21.310> where<00:05:21.460> there's<00:05:21.699> a<00:05:21.759> hinge<00:05:22.060> and<00:05:22.419> it

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
usually where there's a hinge and it

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.959 
usually where there's a hinge and it
doesn't<00:05:22.839> look<00:05:22.870> like<00:05:22.990> a<00:05:23.110> big<00:05:23.409> global<00:05:23.949> curve<00:05:24.310> so

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
doesn't look like a big global curve so

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.480 
doesn't look like a big global curve so
again<00:05:25.240> for<00:05:25.270> a<00:05:25.539> backbend<00:05:26.080> if<00:05:26.469> you<00:05:27.009> have<00:05:27.129> a<00:05:27.159> nice

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
again for a backbend if you have a nice

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.390 
again for a backbend if you have a nice
arch<00:05:28.020> you're<00:05:29.020> doing<00:05:29.379> well<00:05:29.560> but<00:05:30.099> if<00:05:30.249> you're

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
arch you're doing well but if you're

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.760 
arch you're doing well but if you're
sitting<00:05:30.669> into<00:05:30.909> your<00:05:31.089> hips<00:05:31.300> and<00:05:31.689> your<00:05:32.289> you're

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
sitting into your hips and your you're

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.649 
sitting into your hips and your you're
going<00:05:33.009> from<00:05:33.189> here<00:05:33.370> my<00:05:33.580> back<00:05:33.789> isn't<00:05:34.000> arching<00:05:34.539> at

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
going from here my back isn't arching at

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.469 
going from here my back isn't arching at
all<00:05:34.810> but<00:05:35.319> if<00:05:35.409> I<00:05:35.529> lift<00:05:35.949> I<00:05:36.370> can<00:05:37.000> actually<00:05:37.360> get

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
all but if I lift I can actually get

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.300 
all but if I lift I can actually get
back<00:05:37.719> further<00:05:39.300> good<00:05:40.439> so<00:05:41.439> again<00:05:41.740> some<00:05:42.039> of<00:05:42.159> the

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
in order to promote rest so you don't

neutral restful patterns before you

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.050

explore<00:06:08.469> the<00:06:08.680> extreme<00:06:09.009> ranges<00:06:09.399> again<00:06:09.729> and

explore the extreme ranges again and

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.149 
explore the extreme ranges again and
three<00:06:10.750> really<00:06:11.199> having<00:06:11.500> a<00:06:11.589> look<00:06:11.800> at<00:06:11.949> the

balance of your program so are you

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.019 
balance of your program so are you
always<00:06:14.529> rotating<00:06:15.159> forwards<00:06:15.759> backwards

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:16.029

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:22.200 
outwards and equal proportions and then
for<00:06:21.129> have<00:06:21.370> a<00:06:21.399> look<00:06:21.610> at<00:06:21.729> your<00:06:21.849> stalling

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
for have a look at your stalling

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.019 
for have a look at your stalling
patterns<00:06:22.779> and<00:06:23.050> realizing<00:06:23.979> that<00:06:24.129> actually<00:06:24.939> you

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.029 
patterns and realizing that actually you

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:27.480 
patterns and realizing that actually you
can<00:06:25.180> practice<00:06:25.599> the<00:06:25.779> pattern<00:06:26.229> with<00:06:26.529> less<00:06:27.129> range

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
can practice the pattern with less range

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.329 
can practice the pattern with less range
to<00:06:28.300> try<00:06:28.479> to<00:06:28.539> get<00:06:28.750> your<00:06:28.870> planes<00:06:29.199> in<00:06:29.529> perfection

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:30.339 
to try to get your planes in perfection

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.339 
to try to get your planes in perfection
and<00:06:30.699> then<00:06:30.909> you<00:06:31.029> can<00:06:31.210> slowly<00:06:31.539> try<00:06:31.930> to<00:06:31.960> increase

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:32.349 
and then you can slowly try to increase

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:33.990 
and then you can slowly try to increase
the<00:06:32.889> range<00:06:33.069> at<00:06:33.339> what<00:06:33.460> you're<00:06:33.639> doing<00:06:33.669> your

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.040 
just tricks and salts which if you're

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.010 
just tricks and salts which if you're
always<00:06:56.340> moving<00:06:56.520> like<00:06:56.790> that<00:06:56.970> is<00:06:57.210> putting<00:06:57.840> a<00:06:57.900> lot

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
always moving like that is putting a lot

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.050 
always moving like that is putting a lot
of<00:06:58.050> strain<00:06:58.380> on<00:06:58.410> your<00:06:58.590> body<00:06:58.710> but<00:06:59.520> it<00:06:59.610> also<00:06:59.730> gets

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
of strain on your body but it also gets

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.970 
of strain on your body but it also gets
can<00:07:00.270> get<00:07:00.390> boring<00:07:00.630> to<00:07:00.870> watch<00:07:00.900> after<00:07:01.410> a<00:07:01.740> minute

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
can get boring to watch after a minute

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.250 
can get boring to watch after a minute
so<00:07:02.850> what<00:07:03.060> can<00:07:03.210> be<00:07:03.330> nice<00:07:03.540> is<00:07:03.810> you<00:07:03.840> know<00:07:04.080> if<00:07:04.170> you

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
so what can be nice is you know if you

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.610 
so what can be nice is you know if you
do<00:07:04.350> a<00:07:04.380> bunch<00:07:04.680> of<00:07:04.830> fast<00:07:05.700> stuff<00:07:06.030> and<00:07:06.350> then<00:07:07.350> if<00:07:07.560> you

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
do a bunch of fast stuff and then if you

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.140 
do a bunch of fast stuff and then if you
just<00:07:07.800> came<00:07:08.040> into<00:07:08.750> doing<00:07:10.430> not<00:07:11.430> something<00:07:11.790> like

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
just came into doing not something like

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:18.980 
just came into doing not something like
this<00:07:12.560> hey<00:07:15.620> that<00:07:16.620> can<00:07:17.600> that<00:07:18.600> gives<00:07:18.810> your

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990 
this hey that can that gives your

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.810 
this hey that can that gives your
shoulders<00:07:19.380> time<00:07:19.620> to<00:07:19.800> relax<00:07:20.040> and<00:07:20.310> rest<00:07:20.550> but

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:20.820 
shoulders time to relax and rest but

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.730 
shoulders time to relax and rest but
also<00:07:21.000> it<00:07:21.330> looks<00:07:21.480> nice<00:07:21.720> so<00:07:21.750> it<00:07:22.200> changes<00:07:22.620> the

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
also it looks nice so it changes the

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.680 
also it looks nice so it changes the
speed<00:07:22.980> of<00:07:23.160> the<00:07:23.220> performance<00:07:23.700> so<00:07:24.390> having<00:07:24.660> that

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:24.690 
speed of the performance so having that

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.810 
speed of the performance so having that
habit<00:07:25.140> of<00:07:25.200> going<00:07:25.380> from<00:07:25.680> fast<00:07:26.040> stuff<00:07:26.370> to<00:07:26.610> slow

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:26.820 
habit of going from fast stuff to slow

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.270
