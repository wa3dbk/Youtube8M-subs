we need to maintain our filters well
firstly<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.790> makes<00:00:33.059> sure<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.420> machine<00:00:33.510> is

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
firstly it makes sure your machine is

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.110 
firstly it makes sure your machine is
performing<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.469> its<00:00:34.530> best<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.190> secondly<00:00:36.030> it

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
performing at its best and secondly it

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.590 
performing at its best and secondly it
helps<00:00:36.210> prolong<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.780> life<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.170> your<00:00:37.230> machine

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
helps prolong the life of your machine

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.560

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
empty your dirty dust container like so

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.290 
empty your dirty dust container like so
that<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.210> check<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.020> shroud<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.980> unit<00:00:50.399> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
