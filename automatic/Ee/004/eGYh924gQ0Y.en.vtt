 Pauli vor one spoke again and again in spring 2000 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.130
 to make this anniversary special in any way 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.730
 it should not come to that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.860
 the traffic jam on the thirtieth of August 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.860
 but we have turned his idea on 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.490
 Joining the formula was among the witnesses when it happened 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.470
 the miracle of Warsaw 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.990
 a report on this 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.260

 is considered to be the easiest to win in recent history 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.290
 the first time in many many years will not be a three year old 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.060
 Derby winner will be at the start 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.260
 24 Pair and generally it is assumed that the last year winners 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.600
 Allee France, now five years old, is again the famous one 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.380
 Race this catfish will win 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.910
 it goes beyond the classic distance of 2400 meters 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.470
 and the overall price of the race for the winner and for the three placed 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.270
 is 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.490
 2 million 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.409
 two and a quarter million women 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.370
 That's a million mark 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.970
 Guest of honor here at the presidential palace the French president decides 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.540

 Also called only mares 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.429
 that is strange 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.559
 that the fear is given so little chance 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.670
 for Germany is interesting that with steel Moritz Berg's five-year-old 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.790
 Stallions for her, even as a three-year-old, have been rapidly failing in the Prix de

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.729
 Million field is represented 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.430
 his chances on paper do not look better than those of an outsider 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:19.009
 but from that he was finally before his victories in the Grand Prix me di 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.680
 Milano

 including two European group 1 races 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.130
 and become a group of two 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.049
 everyone will stalk in between city

 next to sc-tor year 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.040
 Roll NATO and c2 one of the doctors then in the head 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.290
 for Zetor year before and Metro then you can see percent Marburg way pulls there 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.769
 you also see Dalia then a place in the rehab on the outside 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:19.869
 Percent is the field tight on the metals woman from about the eighth to ninth 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:20.410
 location 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.540
 and steel Moritz Berg sda from her is about from Alban 5 to 6 last place 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:27.760
 Adjustment from the front 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.919
 on the left you see it goes with the white ground Blender is it last year 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.519

 he is number 19 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.339
 Carolus who comes from England 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.579
 that explains now behind the grove 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.569
 come forth 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.959

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.359
 the other performer spaces gate in fourth place Carolus 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.180
 and I have to see what was going on Biker has something to do before work and 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.709
 weighs about 12th place 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.970
 while all France are still in midfield 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.590
 nothing to be seen yet 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.939
 unchanged sec last year at the top 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:24.240

 and all France still in midfield 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.479
 faire now offer just around the corner 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.219
 Ceto year at the inner edge is unchanged 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.990
 Kordts front but now already happened 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.879
 only through the vines 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.879
 and the horses now in the advised 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.339
 in the middle, as before Rooney brings the English are older winners 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:54.529
 the Schemmel is also suddenly Starkiller second line 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.300
 but have changed my fight to explain 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.180
 and then comes the Octapharma world this year too 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.529
 the car driver which side of the place was as expected 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:11.249
 Although the Germany eighth wondering upright is a sensation 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:15.729
 Black and yellow likeness defender Andy Roddick of clarifying all this can not 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.319
 his bath Bramstedt 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.479
 certainly not, "says Schaaf 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.110
 a German tick as an explanation 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.440
 sda from marriage 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.800
 he thinks GTA 3 euros ever built in third place it was like last year 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.270
 Second place went to Iran 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.309
 13 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:36.719
 that's a sensation 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.439
 that's such a sensation 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:43.009
 sda from he applies it for steel construction Erzberg 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.909
 the Prix de l'arc de Triomphe 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.029
 the first horse ever clarified this long long story 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:50.509
 Millions of races 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:56.580
 that makes German rides win a victory and who wins with 3 4 lengths 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.460
 Goal conceded he was gone 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.480
 in third place today 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.810
 then Professor a who was already second in the previous year 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:09.220
 a sensation the owner is with his wife and coach Theo Weber 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.270
 at the driving time lay with Mrs. Waltraud and energy Georg Leber are her property 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.760
 i dont know what they are going to do right now they will be laughing they will 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.680
 Crying they will fall around their necks 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.749
 There was no such thing at all 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:23.250
 Dr against 1 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.279
 clear outsider 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.629
 at the start 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.789
 and also the President of the French Union seems something 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.999
 to be embarrassed that there has now been a French victory on 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:33.629
 every case 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:36.389
 looked like he was on the wrong horse 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.689
 was that really did not expect anyone in Germany 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.099
 he hopes that he will run well 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:47.819
 And then there's the order he has consistently adhered to 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:52.629
 Aiming from the field on which first kilometer has hidden in the back 

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.389
 then slowly made up ground then dove in the second row in the 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.770
 Distance on Known a slip had to go after race and crashed 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.580
 then suddenly with an unlikely start 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.939
 from the field the way 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:08.539
 if you consider the stud Röttgen this drives 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:15.780
 from two years 1973 sold for 60 000 marks that the stallion in this 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.159
 Year alone this year has won half a million and now the 

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:23.660
 Prix ​​de l'arc de Triomphe meet the third group 1 he still gets 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:27.729
 once a million 468 calls with breaks 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:30.469
 then you can only 

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:32.669
 that is that Europe is driving 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:34.129
 he drives 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:38.520
 Joke in Europe number one, there is none at all 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.949
 Doubts more after only 40 points in the scoring 

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:43.809
 Kettler 

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:48.089
 English and Irish derby winner Grandi stood and now by this victory 

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:51.339
 course has done well 

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.059
 with this result 

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:55.229
 Let's say goodbye 

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:59.559
 Goodbye ladies and gentlemen in Germany with this sensation
