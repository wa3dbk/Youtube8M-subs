00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.910
 hello hello welcome one more time today 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.220
 I want to share with you a press 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.540
 from the side of three ends stay to see 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.910
 this video let's start with this braid what 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.240
 What we are going to do is take 3 segments almost 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.640
 we're going to make a crossing of 3 of 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.980
 this way once we have already 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.289
 crossed our hair for the first 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.200
 What we are going to do is take 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.760
 pressure in the middle and we will go sending 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:35.960
 the hair of the left hand in the middle and 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:39.290
 let's make pressure and cross the hair 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.290
 of the right hand but without taking anything 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.809
 of extra hair we're just going to go 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.809
 doing these crosses in this way 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.960
 this technique super easy to do and nothing 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.720
 laborious is braids is very nice 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.440
 in the end we are simply going to cross 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.140
 the segment of the right hand and in the hand 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.080
 so let's go feed 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.030
 go taking thin sections not very thick 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.780
 and we are going to unravel with our 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.780
 fingers 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.160
 as you can see here we are already giving you 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.760
 shape to our braid we carry almost to 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.760
 half 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.850
 if you notice that one of the hair is 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.950
 have left or are left in such a state of trouble 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.620
 worry at the end as we have 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.110
 finished let's simply with the 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.200
 comb to comb the slightly 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.200
 over 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.979
 to 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.940
 but 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.200
 As you can see we are almost finished 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.319
 our braids and that's how we are 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.319
 staying 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.629
 and finally I have finished the press and the 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.980
 I'm going to tie with this little league and 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:31.940
 decoration I'm going to put a bow 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.360
 I'm also going to loosen the braid a bit 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.890
 and comb those little hairs that have 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.890
 been somewhat raptured 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.540
 these are the results of the braid 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.000
 I hope you liked it you can not 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.170
