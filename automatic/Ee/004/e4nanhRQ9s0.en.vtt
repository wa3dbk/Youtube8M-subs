it<00:03:57.439> away<00:03:58.359> this<00:03:59.359> is<00:03:59.419> just<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.930> wheel<00:04:00.109> from<00:04:00.379> my<00:04:00.620> old

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
it away this is just a wheel from my old

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.939 
it away this is just a wheel from my old
go-kart<00:04:02.030> I<00:04:02.299> thought<00:04:03.139> it<00:04:03.259> looked<00:04:03.349> better<00:04:03.650> than

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
go-kart I thought it looked better than

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.569 
go-kart I thought it looked better than
these<00:04:04.099> ones<00:04:04.900> we<00:04:05.900> have<00:04:06.109> a<00:04:06.439> brand<00:04:07.099> new<00:04:07.280> set<00:04:07.549> of

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.899 
these ones we have a brand new set of
these<00:04:08.290> but<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.620> figured<00:04:10.159> out<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:10.430> these<00:04:10.639> ones

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
these but I figured out that these ones

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.099 
these but I figured out that these ones
would<00:04:11.060> work<00:04:11.269> -<00:04:11.509> saw<00:04:11.810> like<00:04:12.019> these<00:04:12.199> ones<00:04:12.409> better

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
would work - saw like these ones better

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.439 
would work - saw like these ones better

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
now you're gonna want to do the same

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.700 
now you're gonna want to do the same
thing<00:07:16.009> for<00:07:16.220> both<00:07:16.430> sides<00:07:16.780> but<00:07:17.780> this<00:07:17.960> one<00:07:18.169> still

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 
thing for both sides but this one still

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.040 
thing for both sides but this one still
has<00:07:18.860> the<00:07:19.190> cap<00:07:19.430> on<00:07:19.699> it<00:07:19.729> so<00:07:20.509> I'm<00:07:20.599> going<00:07:20.810> to<00:07:20.840> see<00:07:20.960> if

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
has the cap on it so I'm going to see if

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:33.999 
has the cap on it so I'm going to see if
I<00:07:21.169> can<00:07:21.289> get<00:07:21.409> this<00:07:21.590> off<00:07:21.830> I<00:07:28.930> should<00:07:29.930> probably<00:07:33.009> put

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:34.009 
I can get this off I should probably put

00:07:34.009 --> 00:08:05.480 
I can get this off I should probably put
something<00:07:34.250> still<00:07:39.490> I'm<00:07:40.490> gonna<00:07:40.669> get<00:07:40.819> my<00:07:40.940> hand

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:05.490 

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:16.999 

okay<00:08:06.490> I<00:08:06.520> thought<00:08:06.879> this<00:08:07.120> should<00:08:07.300> pop<00:08:07.599> right<00:08:07.870> off

00:08:16.999 --> 00:08:17.009 

00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:20.430
