sheets of paper at a time and study the
progress<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.540> characters<00:02:16.960> motion

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.690 

the<00:02:24.180> next<00:02:24.450> step<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.590> scan<00:02:26.010> each<00:02:26.310> drawing

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
the next step is to scan each drawing

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.890 
the next step is to scan each drawing
into<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.270> computer
