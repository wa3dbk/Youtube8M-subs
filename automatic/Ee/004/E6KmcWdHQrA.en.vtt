00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:10.110
 good afternoon I want to tell you today 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:13.219
 gate table for router 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.610
 will do raised 60 by 60 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:21.350
 so here is chosen a little and a half 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:25.200
 plywood there centimeter 11 millimeters 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.960
 selected here and here is the recess frezer 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.950
 that after you left did not go right but 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.310
 Two such ones are inserted here 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.579
 called tubules for 8 not slippers 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.900
 harder and bolted so 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.020
 here here we put shaybochki 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.600
 wooden 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.880
 such as these screws are used too 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.190
 Here from furniture Windows 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:58.410
 powder is also used from now on here 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:01.590
 corner base such round thick 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.460
 leg of cardboard tubes will be safer and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.899
 more convenient 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.689
 Well, this option allows 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:13.460
 develop the system that is, we see 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.639
 that she could be like this 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.939
 decompose 

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:20.039
 since I did take 70 kilograms 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.990
 the same type is slightly more powerful they are better 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.479
 they are here and Shelley did not come here 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.020
 I had to put shaybots here 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.999
 well frezer I have makalister 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.329
 what else should I do next 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:35.940
 didn't lift here firstly like you 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.970
 make a box think 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:44.160
 here's how to do it take off separately 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:49.410
 further what else but here is the necessary collar 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:52.530
 to pick up account include take for 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.500
 bill sticking baking they're not like this 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.680
 make a rosette here let's say well or 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.960
 right here screw the corners to the rosettes in 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.880
 the socket will be here this wire and here 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.480
 and made the wire switches already go 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.179
 tusk due to this here so here it is 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.920
 looks below now let's click 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.990
 pause 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.330
 This is how the working position looks 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.010
 done here 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.890
 moving too on such here 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.470
 shaybochki enclosed to she 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.030
 Shaybochki cut these we such as they 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.750
 crowned riots here done here it is 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.550
 drives fixed without problems on the right 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.400
 distance here is cut a lot 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.820
 pretty big prizes we are here for now 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.830
 a small opening opportunity i do 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.520
 More and here the liner will do a few 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.530
 different occasion different spasm further what 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.310
 still rose here planned to highlight 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.010
 the choices are the same as here goes here 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.980
 there will be two screwed closing here 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.450
 this is the plate hole 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.700
 why do you need it when I will be here 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.540
 cutter suppose here it is necessary to push through 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.930
 so it's almost 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.940
 it will be good here but it can be here 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.890
 These plates make replaceable ready 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.530
 come here knowing this 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:17.070
 fortresses or even without him 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.690
 such a table turned out let's 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.739
 let's see how we are in the word 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.739
 kind of be 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:32.280
 in general, it was difficult to keep everything 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:36.280
 without slime now let's take a minute 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.440
 here it is folded as he is like this 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.690
 see takes up very little space 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.330
 especially since this part can be removed 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:50.530
 but the cutter understand the service is killed if 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:52.840
 need for mass around I don't know how many not 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.970
 weighed well, since four and a half 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.120
 about a kilogram but I took it there 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.870
 here these here understand more I am not 5 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:07.080
 kilogram 5 and a half 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:11.050
 here is the cost of plywood us so 435 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.620
 nougat nuts noggin here for 6 everything is done 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.850
 basically 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.380
 that's what else you can plan here 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.769
 still do add two more corners 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.220
 over here and make hood options 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.110
 all up to cling 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.360
 vacuum cleaner but I do not know maybe we will not be 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.970
 what is here bottom clings here 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.090
 here its pretty good here 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.590
 draw well that's shorter you have to do 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.270
 lug around here and already possible in principle 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.040
 By the way here's legs a little bit I do not 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.110
 like it now here here itself saw 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.630
 who is she twisting her legs a little 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:56.890
 will remake well though it is quite 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:59.700
 working version so thanks for 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.700
 attention to all the best
