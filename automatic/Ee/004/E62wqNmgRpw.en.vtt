 xbox 360 just a year ago and in a 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.649
 very short term of time and that is why 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.670
 end microsoft has confirmed that you will not see 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.829
 a new xbox in in 2012 an executive of 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.050
 Microsoft seemed to have confirmed that 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.350
 the firm will not launch a new console 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.840

 microsoft marketing in france has 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.219
 answered the recent rumors that 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.289
 they suggested that the redmond campaign 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.079
 would soon reveal its hardware soon 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.870
 of your next generation of the most 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.770
 confirmed that this year there will be nothing 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.729
 there will not be a new console because it says and 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.890
 feels that the xbox 360 has not yet 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.990
 completed its cycle and it is true 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.940
 many comments we have talked 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.500
 when to arrive in 2013 to reach the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.690
 2012 many people say but if the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.360
 xbox still have not given your t and it's 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.240
 true and has also cited as 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.479
 check to this that the xbox 360 does not 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.340
 has suffered offers us a massive discount 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.950
 with that is a very big indication that 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.469
 will not come a new console 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.649
 this with textual words is after 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.509
 of this that if I walked in the e3 it is still 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.360
 premature what is certain is that no 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.579
 there will be new in 2012 also the most 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.799
 talked about the position of microsoft 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.960
 in relation to nintendo because it will reveal 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.909
 of his new wii u in e3 this year and 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.979
 will put it on sale next month of 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.659
 December of this year and what has 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.670
 answered he is that we are not here 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.259
 to deal with nintendo and they do not 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.869
 they are there to fight against others 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.420
 nintendo manufacturers has been located by 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.179
 your account in a different cycle progress 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.150
 at your own pace successfully the successful 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.400
 sorry as we have seen with wii and now 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.380
 It is your turn to present your innovation 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.870
 a word good words very 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.000
 correct by this director of 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.950
 microsoft from in france 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.080
 even though he has said more than said 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.210
 that the next microsoft console does not 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.340
 will be on the street this year has not 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.800
 denied the belief that the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.040
 hardware will make an appearance at the e3 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.920
 this year, so even if it does not go to 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.490
 leaving this year is possible is possible or 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.250
 Perhaps it means that the console itself 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.990
 that is in e3 at least as 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.260
 presentation method as they did the 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.510
 last year on the web 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.610
 so what do you guys say ? 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.800
 You think that what you think this is a 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.380
 joy method a symptom of joy 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.970
 and happiness has not cost me 300 euros 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.650
 others I feel are just a console in 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.420
 in vain to comment tell me if 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.450
 he really is still much you 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.670
 you to the xbox 360 and give me examples of 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.520
 games with a very good graphic quality 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.810
 and that can be overcome even more so 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.819
 will be guys a little kiss to all 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.819
 and see you in the next news
