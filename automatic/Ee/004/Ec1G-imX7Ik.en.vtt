00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
and I put a it was like I cut myself a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:27.790 
and I put a it was like I cut myself a
swarm

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.140 

that<00:00:28.800> Scouts<00:00:29.190> in<00:00:29.460> my<00:00:29.610> my<00:00:30.180> beehive<00:00:31.190> and<00:00:32.190> then

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
that Scouts in my my beehive and then

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.940 
that Scouts in my my beehive and then
they<00:00:33.630> kind<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.900> went<00:00:34.020> away<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.530> then<00:00:34.650> I<00:00:34.740> saw

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
they kind of went away and then I saw

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
they kind of went away and then I saw
him<00:00:35.100> come<00:00:35.340> over<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.060> be<00:00:36.800> my<00:00:38.660> swarm

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
him come over here to my be my swarm

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.370 
him come over here to my be my swarm
trap<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.880> think<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.630> was<00:00:42.900> the<00:00:42.930> trick

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
trap and I think this was the trick

00:00:43.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
trap and I think this was the trick
right<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:49.910> they're<00:00:50.910> busy

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
