hey this is Nate storey with bright
Agrotech<00:00:04.899> and<00:00:05.319> today<00:00:05.560> I'm<00:00:06.100> going<00:00:06.279> to<00:00:06.430> talk

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:06.609 
Agrotech and today I'm going to talk

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.000 
Agrotech and today I'm going to talk
about<00:00:06.910> water<00:00:07.270> use<00:00:07.629> efficiency<00:00:07.810> in<00:00:08.379> hydroponic

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010 
about water use efficiency in hydroponic

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.129 
about water use efficiency in hydroponic
and<00:00:09.100> aquaponic<00:00:09.610> systems<00:00:09.940> versus<00:00:10.629> traditional

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 
and aquaponic systems versus traditional

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:24.280 
and aquaponic systems versus traditional
agriculture

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.330 

so<00:00:25.290> there's<00:00:25.470> been<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.620> lot<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.830> questions

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
so there's been a lot of questions

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.550 
so there's been a lot of questions
lately<00:00:26.670> both<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.270> media<00:00:27.450> and<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.410> our

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
lately both in the media and on our

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.470 
lately both in the media and on our
website<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.310> through<00:00:29.490> YouTube<00:00:29.910> kind<00:00:30.360> of

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
website and through YouTube kind of

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.620 
website and through YouTube kind of
asking<00:00:30.960> us<00:00:31.170> about<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.369> efficiency<00:00:33.150> of<00:00:33.420> these

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
asking us about the efficiency of these

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.630 
asking us about the efficiency of these
systems<00:00:34.170> versus<00:00:35.010> kind<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.460> other

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
systems versus kind of other

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.090 
systems versus kind of other
agricultural<00:00:36.270> systems<00:00:36.630> out<00:00:36.840> there<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
agricultural systems out there so the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.710 
agricultural systems out there so the
thing<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.309> understand<00:00:38.910> about<00:00:39.000> aquaponic

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
thing to understand about aquaponic

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.330 
thing to understand about aquaponic
systems<00:00:40.080> and<00:00:40.260> hydroponic<00:00:40.739> systems<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.220> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
systems and hydroponic systems is that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.430 
systems and hydroponic systems is that
most<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.760> them<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:41.970> recirculating<00:00:42.900> that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
most of them are recirculating that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.410 
most of them are recirculating that
means<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.220> water<00:00:44.400> that<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.330> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
means all of the water that is going to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.650 
means all of the water that is going to
the<00:00:45.540> plants<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> excess<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.770> captured<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
the plants the excess is captured and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.910 
the plants the excess is captured and
recirculated<00:00:48.660> we're<00:00:49.050> constantly<00:00:49.410> adding

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
recirculated we're constantly adding

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.280 
recirculated we're constantly adding
nutrition<00:00:50.400> to<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> nutrients<00:00:51.270> through<00:00:52.110> either

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
nutrition to it nutrients through either

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.050 
nutrition to it nutrients through either
fish<00:00:52.530> waste<00:00:52.800> or<00:00:53.129> through<00:00:53.250> fertilizer<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
fish waste or through fertilizer and

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.110 
fish waste or through fertilizer and
that<00:00:54.570> allows<00:00:54.810> us<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.050> constantly<00:00:55.860> just

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
that allows us to constantly just

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.640 
that allows us to constantly just
recycle<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.300> water<00:00:57.540> and<00:00:57.870> use<00:00:58.290> it<00:00:58.470> for<00:00:58.590> our

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
recycle that water and use it for our

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.139 
recycle that water and use it for our
plant<00:00:58.920> production<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> lot<00:00:59.970> of<00:01:00.000> these

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
plant production so a lot of these

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.090 
plant production so a lot of these
systems<00:01:00.360> can<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:01.170> efficient<00:01:01.620> which

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
systems can be really efficient which

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.219 
systems can be really efficient which
means<00:01:02.130> that<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.700> reuse<00:01:03.180> water<00:01:03.480> over<00:01:04.020> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
means that we can reuse water over and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.710 
means that we can reuse water over and
over<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.860> over<00:01:05.130> again<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.149> water<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.570> this

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
over and over again so the water in this

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.740 
over and over again so the water in this
system<00:01:06.990> has<00:01:07.380> actually<00:01:07.800> been<00:01:08.750> recirculating

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
system has actually been recirculating

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.139 
system has actually been recirculating
now<00:01:09.899> for<00:01:10.229> years<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.680> end<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:11.130> don't<00:01:11.880> get<00:01:12.000> me

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
now for years on end now don't get me

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.609 
now for years on end now don't get me
wrong<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.540> water<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.050> started<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.470> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
wrong the water that we started with is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.469 
wrong the water that we started with is
all<00:01:13.770> been<00:01:13.920> consumed<00:01:14.340> by<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.759> course<00:01:14.940> but

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
all been consumed by now of course but

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.810 
all been consumed by now of course but
we<00:01:15.600> never<00:01:15.810> discharge<00:01:16.410> any<00:01:16.649> water<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.399> of<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
we never discharge any water all of the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.999 
we never discharge any water all of the
water<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.149> leaves<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.690> system<00:01:19.110> basically

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
water that leaves this system basically

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.060 
water that leaves this system basically
leaves<00:01:20.310> through<00:01:20.810> evapotranspiration

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
leaves through evapotranspiration

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.440 
leaves through evapotranspiration
basically<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.190> where<00:01:23.399> plants<00:01:23.790> are<00:01:24.030> losing

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
basically are where plants are losing

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.260 
basically are where plants are losing
water<00:01:24.630> or<00:01:25.039> occasionally<00:01:26.039> through<00:01:26.280> leaks<00:01:26.459> so

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
water or occasionally through leaks so

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.639 
water or occasionally through leaks so
what<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.569> means<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.959> that<00:01:27.990> these<00:01:28.200> systems

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
what that means is that these systems

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.949 
what that means is that these systems
are<00:01:28.830> really<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.759> efficient<00:01:30.270> compared<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
are really really efficient compared to

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.080 
are really really efficient compared to
traditional<00:01:31.200> systems<00:01:31.740> even<00:01:32.700> compared<00:01:33.030> to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
traditional systems even compared to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.430 
traditional systems even compared to
traditional<00:01:33.270> gardening<00:01:33.959> so<00:01:34.110> if<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.289> have<00:01:34.410> a

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
traditional gardening so if you have a

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.749 
traditional gardening so if you have a
garden<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:35.069> backyard

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
garden in your backyard

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.120 
garden in your backyard
expect<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.360> use<00:01:36.479> at<00:01:36.690> least<00:01:36.720> 20<00:01:37.500> times<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:38.100> much

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
expect to use at least 20 times as much

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.620 
expect to use at least 20 times as much
water<00:01:38.580> as<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.030> would<00:01:39.149> use<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.539> a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
water as you would use in a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.480 
water as you would use in a
recirculating<00:01:40.170> system<00:01:40.590> why<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.310> this

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
recirculating system why is this

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.940 
recirculating system why is this
important<00:01:41.970> well<00:01:42.539> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.410> lot<00:01:43.709> of<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
important well kind of with a lot of the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.559 
important well kind of with a lot of the
things<00:01:44.160> going<00:01:44.459> on<00:01:44.550> right<00:01:44.610> now<00:01:44.789> especially<00:01:45.270> in

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
things going on right now especially in

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.749 
things going on right now especially in
the<00:01:45.690> West<00:01:45.899> there's<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.709> lot<00:01:47.039> of<00:01:47.250> questions

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the West there's a lot of questions

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.430 
the West there's a lot of questions
about<00:01:47.910> the<00:01:48.179> sustainability<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.050> our<00:01:49.200> water

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
about the sustainability of our water

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.830 
about the sustainability of our water
use<00:01:49.679> and<00:01:49.910> specifically<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.300> sustainability

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
use and specifically the sustainability

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.600 
use and specifically the sustainability
of<00:01:52.110> our<00:01:52.380> water<00:01:52.590> use<00:01:52.830> in<00:01:53.069> relation<00:01:53.580> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
of our water use in relation to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.029 
of our water use in relation to
agriculture<00:01:54.479> gardening<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.590> kind<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:55.890> these

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
agriculture gardening and kind of these

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.249 
agriculture gardening and kind of these
traditional<00:01:56.729> practices<00:01:57.330> of<00:01:57.569> producing

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
traditional practices of producing

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.830 
traditional practices of producing
vegetables<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.099> producing<00:01:59.610> food<00:01:59.819> this<00:02:00.660> is<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
vegetables and producing food this is a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.749 
vegetables and producing food this is a
big<00:02:01.170> question<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.429> it's<00:02:02.550> getting

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
big question right now and it's getting

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.550 
big question right now and it's getting
a<00:02:02.849> lot<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.240> media<00:02:03.539> attention<00:02:03.599> and<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.410> got<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
a lot of media attention and it's got a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.050 
a lot of media attention and it's got a
lot<00:02:04.800> of<00:02:04.830> people<00:02:05.190> thinking<00:02:05.520> about<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:05.849> they

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
lot of people thinking about how they

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.870 
lot of people thinking about how they
can<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.450> more<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.289> conserve<00:02:07.649> water<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.640> if

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
can do more to conserve water so if

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.100 
can do more to conserve water so if
these<00:02:09.030> are<00:02:09.209> kind<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.420> questions<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.990> you're

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
these are kind of questions that you're

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.690 
these are kind of questions that you're
pondering<00:02:10.380> then<00:02:10.649> I'd<00:02:10.770> really<00:02:11.220> encourage<00:02:11.340> you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
pondering then I'd really encourage you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.020 
pondering then I'd really encourage you
to<00:02:11.730> check<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.420> try<00:02:13.080> either<00:02:14.030> aquaponics

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
to check out and try either aquaponics

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.059 
to check out and try either aquaponics
or<00:02:15.180> hydroponics<00:02:15.500> you're<00:02:16.500> gonna<00:02:16.620> find<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:16.950> it

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
or hydroponics you're gonna find that it

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.750 
or hydroponics you're gonna find that it
saves<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.520> lot<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.849> water<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.950> oftentimes<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
saves a lot of water and oftentimes that

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.250 
saves a lot of water and oftentimes that
means<00:02:20.940> lower<00:02:21.180> water<00:02:21.540> bills<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.140> also

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
means lower water bills but it also

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.040 
means lower water bills but it also
means<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:23.040> water<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:24.450> your<00:02:24.690> area<00:02:24.989> is

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
means that the water in your area is

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.470 
means that the water in your area is
being<00:02:25.260> used<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.530> lot<00:02:25.739> more<00:02:25.980> sustainably<00:02:26.520> so

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
being used a lot more sustainably so

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.760 
being used a lot more sustainably so
these<00:02:27.599> are<00:02:27.780> these<00:02:27.959> are<00:02:28.110> kind<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.410> important

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
these are these are kind of important

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.930 
these are these are kind of important
things<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.040> be<00:02:29.130> thinking<00:02:29.400> about<00:02:29.489> when<00:02:29.819> you're

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
things to be thinking about when you're

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.580 
things to be thinking about when you're
thinking<00:02:30.180> about<00:02:30.480> starting<00:02:30.870> your<00:02:31.020> own<00:02:31.050> system

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
thinking about starting your own system

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.590 
thinking about starting your own system
remember<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.370> usually<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.790> factor<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.270> 20

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
remember it's usually a factor of 20

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.720 
remember it's usually a factor of 20
times<00:02:34.020> sometimes<00:02:34.410> much<00:02:34.920> more

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
times sometimes much more

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.510 
times sometimes much more
traditional<00:02:36.209> field<00:02:36.480> AG<00:02:37.099> uses<00:02:38.099> techniques

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
traditional field AG uses techniques

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.059 
traditional field AG uses techniques
like<00:02:38.959> flood<00:02:39.959> irrigation<00:02:40.590> where<00:02:40.980> they

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
like flood irrigation where they

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.940 
like flood irrigation where they
basically<00:02:41.370> flood<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.849> field<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:43.680> losses

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
basically flood the field and the losses

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.670 
basically flood the field and the losses
to<00:02:44.280> evaporation<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.060> losses<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:46.440> runoff

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
to evaporation the losses just to runoff

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.309 
to evaporation the losses just to runoff
are<00:02:47.129> absolutely<00:02:47.879> astounding<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
are absolutely astounding and the

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.650 
are absolutely astounding and the
industry<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:49.830> changing<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:50.370> practices<00:02:51.030> but<00:02:51.269> by

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
industry is changing as practices but by

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.229 
industry is changing as practices but by
and<00:02:51.870> large<00:02:51.959> water<00:02:52.860> use<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.370> still<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.849> big

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
and large water use is still a big

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.360 
and large water use is still a big

with aquaponic and hydroponic production
water<00:03:13.739> use<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> really<00:03:14.670> big<00:03:14.849> issue<00:03:15.030> but

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
water use is a really big issue but

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.930 
water use is a really big issue but
recirculating<00:03:16.680> hydroponics<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.519> aquaponics

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
recirculating hydroponics and aquaponics

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.509 
recirculating hydroponics and aquaponics
can<00:03:18.450> be<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.599> great<00:03:19.019> solution<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:20.340> looming

together<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.959> little<00:03:31.140> bit<00:03:31.319> of<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.470> series<00:03:31.799> for

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
together a little bit of a series for

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.729 
together a little bit of a series for
you<00:03:32.069> guys<00:03:32.250> just<00:03:32.280> talking<00:03:32.970> about<00:03:33.060> hydro<00:03:33.739> so

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
you guys just talking about hydro so

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.530 
you guys just talking about hydro so
right<00:03:34.950> off<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.160> bat<00:03:35.360> hydroponic<00:03:36.360> production

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
right off the bat hydroponic production

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.420 
right off the bat hydroponic production
is<00:03:37.049> soilless<00:03:37.590> plant<00:03:37.890> production

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
is soilless plant production

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.080 
is soilless plant production
okay<00:03:38.849> so<00:03:38.989> aquaponics<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.139> a<00:03:40.200> form<00:03:40.709> of

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
okay so aquaponics is a form of

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.300 
okay so aquaponics is a form of
hydroponics<00:03:42.380> all<00:03:43.380> aquaponics<00:03:44.190> is

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
hydroponics all aquaponics is

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.229 
hydroponics all aquaponics is
hydroponics<00:03:44.910> but<00:03:45.690> not<00:03:46.230> all<00:03:46.410> hydroponics<00:03:47.069> is

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
hydroponics but not all hydroponics is

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.699 
hydroponics but not all hydroponics is
aquaponics<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.600> makes<00:03:48.810> sense<00:03:49.079> because

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
aquaponics that makes sense because

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.190 
aquaponics that makes sense because
hydroponics<00:03:50.519> is<00:03:50.670> using<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.239> formulated

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
hydroponics is using a formulated

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.930 
hydroponics is using a formulated
nutrient<00:03:52.650> solution<00:03:53.069> so<00:03:53.370> instead<00:03:53.639> of<00:03:53.700> using

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
nutrient solution so instead of using

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.410 
nutrient solution so instead of using
fish<00:03:54.329> waste<00:03:54.569> we're<00:03:55.260> actually<00:03:55.410> using

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
fish waste we're actually using

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.559 
fish waste we're actually using
fertilizer

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
fertilizer

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.449 
fertilizer
okay<00:03:58.079> so<00:03:58.139> we're<00:03:58.319> mixing<00:03:58.470> fertilizer<00:03:59.040> into<00:03:59.310> our

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
okay so we're mixing fertilizer into our

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.300 
okay so we're mixing fertilizer into our
water<00:03:59.750> at<00:04:00.750> certain<00:04:01.350> levels<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:02.010> keep<00:04:02.160> our

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
water at certain levels to keep our

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.109 
water at certain levels to keep our
plant<00:04:02.549> growth<00:04:02.819> really<00:04:03.209> cranking<00:04:03.840> along
