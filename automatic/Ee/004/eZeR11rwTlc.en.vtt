 listen from is from the people that you have to blame Latino Latinos the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.930
 changes in the community and that at this moment I check at this moment there is no 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.130
 nothing that the Hispanic community can offer at that time because those are 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.100
