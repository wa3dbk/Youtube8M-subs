00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
anyway I want to see how long this is

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.290 
anyway I want to see how long this is
gonna<00:00:47.550> take<00:00:48.829> which<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:50.250> boiling<00:00:50.730> water<00:00:50.940> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
gonna take which it's boiling water so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.319 
gonna take which it's boiling water so
if<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.050> boiling<00:00:52.469> water<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.860> means

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
if it's boiling water that means

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.950 
if it's boiling water that means
shouldn't<00:00:54.329> take<00:00:54.480> long<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> let<00:00:57.539> me<00:00:57.629> move<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
shouldn't take long so let me move the
