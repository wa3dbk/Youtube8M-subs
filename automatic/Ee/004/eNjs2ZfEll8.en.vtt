information review and that is I had a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.810 
information review and that is I had a
question<00:00:10.230> down<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.040> comments<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:11.610> my

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
question down in the comments on my

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.220 
question down in the comments on my
windows<00:00:12.210> 8<00:00:12.420> gaming<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.440> steam<00:00:13.769> video<00:00:14.420> and<00:00:15.420> I

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
windows 8 gaming and steam video and I

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.540 
windows 8 gaming and steam video and I
just<00:00:16.410> kind<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.650> wanted<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.980> touch<00:00:17.070> base<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.400> it

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
just kind of wanted to touch base on it

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.650 
just kind of wanted to touch base on it
I<00:00:17.609> thought<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.850> was<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> good<00:00:18.060> question<00:00:18.480> and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
I thought it was a good question and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.210 
I thought it was a good question and
thought<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.320> lot<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.650> people<00:00:19.740> might<00:00:19.980> want<00:00:20.160> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
thought a lot of people might want to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.560 
thought a lot of people might want to
know<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> difference<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.119> question<00:00:21.449> was

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
know the difference so the question was

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.179 
know the difference so the question was
basically<00:00:22.430> is<00:00:23.810> does<00:00:24.810> windows<00:00:25.140> are<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.439> e<00:00:25.800> mun

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
basically is does windows are just e mun

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.670 
basically is does windows are just e mun
better<00:00:27.060> from<00:00:27.480> metro<00:00:28.019> than<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.410> does<00:00:28.529> from

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
better from metro than it does from

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.279 
better from metro than it does from
desktop<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:30.330> answer<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.630> question<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
desktop and to answer that question I

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.920 
desktop and to answer that question I
can't<00:00:31.740> really<00:00:31.920> because<00:00:32.160> steam<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.390> not<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> part

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
can't really because steam is not a part

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.080 
can't really because steam is not a part
of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.140> metro<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.460> mean<00:00:35.640> by<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.910> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
of the metro and what I mean by that is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.540 
of the metro and what I mean by that is
the<00:00:36.510> Metro<00:00:36.870> apps<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> desktop<00:00:38.100> apps<00:00:38.309> are

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the Metro apps and the desktop apps are

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.030 
the Metro apps and the desktop apps are
two<00:00:38.820> completely<00:00:39.180> totally<00:00:39.600> different<00:00:39.840> things

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
two completely totally different things

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.850 
two completely totally different things
your<00:00:41.040> desktop<00:00:41.850> apps<00:00:42.120> run<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.540> run<00:00:42.989> off<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.350> like

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
your desktop apps run on run off of like

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.990 
your desktop apps run on run off of like
win32<00:00:44.510> whereas<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:46.010> Metro<00:00:47.010> apps<00:00:47.219> run<00:00:47.640> from

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
win32 whereas your Metro apps run from

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.529 
win32 whereas your Metro apps run from
the<00:00:48.390> win<00:00:48.840> RT<00:00:49.559> platform<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.360> difference

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the win RT platform now the difference

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.910 
the win RT platform now the difference
is<00:00:51.840> i'm<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.289> go<00:00:52.350> into<00:00:52.469> technical

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
is i'm not going to go into technical

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.110 
is i'm not going to go into technical
differences<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.489> i'm<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.879> show

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
differences but i'm just going to show

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.720 
differences but i'm just going to show
you<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.360> difference<00:00:54.829> because<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.219> lot<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you the difference because it's a lot of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.709 
you the difference because it's a lot of
people<00:00:56.910> don't<00:00:57.059> want<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> know<00:00:57.360> all<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
people don't want to know all the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.290 
people don't want to know all the

technical mumbo jumbo basically the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.200 
technical mumbo jumbo basically the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.050 
first what it did is it took me to this
this<00:01:51.810> app<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.189> exactly<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.939> is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
this app and that is exactly what it is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.910 
this app and that is exactly what it is
it's<00:01:54.240> an<00:01:54.329> app<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.439> had<00:01:55.619> your

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's an app just like as if you had your

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.980 
it's an app just like as if you had your
your<00:01:56.430> windows<00:01:56.759> phone<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.390> an<00:01:57.509> android<00:01:57.960> phone

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
your windows phone or an android phone

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.310 
your windows phone or an android phone
or<00:01:58.320> even<00:01:59.130> an<00:01:59.579> iphone<00:02:00.119> they<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.750> apps<00:02:00.960> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
or even an iphone they have apps and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.410 
or even an iphone they have apps and
they<00:02:01.409> run<00:02:01.619> specific<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.430> those<00:02:02.610> platforms<00:02:02.909> and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
they run specific on those platforms and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.240 
they run specific on those platforms and
so<00:02:04.079> that's<00:02:04.259> what<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.619> when<00:02:04.950> i<00:02:04.979> right

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
so that's what this is when i right

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.600 
so that's what this is when i right
click<00:02:05.280> i<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:06.540> different<00:02:07.399> options<00:02:08.399> than<00:02:08.580> I

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
click i get different options than I

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.700 
click i get different options than I
would<00:02:08.849> if<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.090> was<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.569> say<00:02:10.520> desktop<00:02:11.520> app<00:02:11.760> so
