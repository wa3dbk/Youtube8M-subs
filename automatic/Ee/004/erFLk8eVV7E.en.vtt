00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:02.602 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I think when we were
putting together the writers

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:05.605 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
it was just the funniest
people we could find.

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:06.773
- Everybody was my first choice.

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.441 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're the funniest
people I know,

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:11.044 align:start size:81% position:19%
and also the worst
people I know.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.646
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:15.915 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- From the very beginning,
it was like Jessi.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.051
- I first met Jessi
just through stand-up

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.753 align:start size:84% position:16%
and she had this
amazing joke I loved

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.621
about how Cosmo writes articles

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:23.890
like "How to Give a Blow
Job while You're Crying".

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.893 
- 2000 men are suing Cosmo
magazine for emotional damages.

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.161
- I bet you guys didn't know

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.163
you could fit a Hanukkah
candle in your pee hole.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.065
Well guess what Cosmo?

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:36.236
You can't and now I have
to pee in a series of bags.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.873
- [Amy] Gabe Liedman,
I know from stand-up.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:43.576 align:start size:97% position:3%
I would do some shows
together at like aidsy places.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.078
- You look ferocious, Amy.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.981 align:start size:97% position:3%
- The gayest, bestest friend
a girl could ever have.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.783
I think he would be
totally fine with me

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:50.950
describing him that way.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.219
- I'm like a real man, Ame.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:55.288
- [Amy] Damn.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.990 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I fucked you
right in your pussy.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.025 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Tig, I was like,
please write for my show.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:00:59.859
- Tada.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.995
- Dry wit.

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:03.596 line:0%
- Tig makes me laugh
because she's got,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.231 align:start size:97% position:3%
I don't know, you just
interviewed her now, right?

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.667
Did she do that cold
dead lesbian stand to

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.169
the camera she does?

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.471 align:start size:97% position:3%
My God, she made me stare
into her eyes the other day.

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.006 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Will you stare at
me for a little while?

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.642 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
I just sometimes stare
at him when we're

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:16.743
in the writers' room.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.746
He's just like this huge man.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.514
- He definitely knows
how to push buttons

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.383 align:start size:94% position:6%
and for that he gets fired
several times a week.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.418
- Oh my God, Kurt I totally
forgot to tell you this.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.252
- What?

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.487
- You're fired.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:31.224
- Amy runs the show much
like a Jim Jones style

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:34.727 align:start size:88% position:13%
Guyanese cult and that's
one of the many games

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.162
to break you down.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.465
- I started stand-up with him.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.600 align:start size:97% position:3%
He decided that he had
like this huge crush on me.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.535
- We actually went
on like two dates.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.037 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And then one night
I realized like,

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.872
why I wasn't interested.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.740 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Kurt] I look
exactly like her dad.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.410
(dramatic music)

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.978
- She's gross for even having

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:54.414
gone on those two dates with
me as far as I'm concerned.

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:57.750
- I think Kurt is hilarious
and just a total degenerate.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.319
- The man's orgasm
is loud and awful.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.386
- Whoa! Whoa!

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.357
- Kurt, don't go subtle.

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:07.794
- Kyle is very like sweet
and lovely and then ...

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.862
- Nuts! Nuts!

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.197 line:0%
- [Kurt] My favorite
sketch is Nutters.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.932 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
- It's something I
thought of a while ago.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.734
It's like Hooters,
but it's for women.

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:17.170
- [Kurt] So they showcase
their nuts, their like,

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.037
nut cleavage.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:19.139
- It's Nutters.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.007
I mean it's a simple premise.

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.509 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I think it should
be two sacks.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.543
- [Jessi] Two sacks!

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:24.777
Give me two sacks.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:25.712
- Come on give me
a couple sacks.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.580
- Come on Jim, touch 'em.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.383 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'm excited it's
gonna come to fruition.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:32.152
- Ouch! Easy Jim.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.487
- I live with Kyle and Tig.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.122
They have bunk beds.

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.057
I'm sure they told you
that they have bunk beds.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.292
- There they are.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.394
I probably should have
cleaned it up first.

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:42.862
- It's pretty ...

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:43.830
- [Kyle] What?

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.864
(screams happily)

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.166
- Wait a minute.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.000
Wait a minute, Amy.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.334
- We do a lot of bits.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:52.005
- [Kyle] ♪ Here a lay,
by myself, in my poop.

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:54.707
- Some of the things
that have happened

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.743 align:start size:94% position:6%
at the apartment have
popped up in the sketches.

00:02:56.743 --> 00:03:00.547
- "♪ And livin' like a swamp"

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:04.284 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- "♪ There's a
possum in your heart"

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.518 line:0%
- [Kyle] Where did we go?

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.352 line:0%
- Possum in your heart.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:10.490
- "♪ Possum, possum"

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.428 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "♪ Possum's bleeding
on your torso"

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:18.998
- "♪ Livin' in your heart"

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:22.402
- [Amy] Working with them and
then also living with them

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.470
has been so fun.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.408
I'm just weirdly living
with these two people

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.843 align:start size:84% position:16%
in their forties,
that have bunk beds.

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:33.880
(upbeat rock music)

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.281
- Vegas.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:38.518
(upbeat rock music)

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:39.719 align:start size:81% position:19%
I've just been
going on the road,

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.720
getting ready for the stand-up

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.155
that's gonna be on the show.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.190 align:start size:97% position:3%
Nothing makes you as strong
as going on the road.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.858 align:start size:84% position:16%
My sister has never
been to Vegas.

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:48.528
I feel like she's gonna love it.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:51.731
Two of you, two of us.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.166
I'll do the math.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:55.702
Oh shit!

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:57.270
Vegas!

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.440
Vegas knows how to
fuck you in the ass.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.241
What?

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:05.845
(upbeat rock music)

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.585
(squeak)
