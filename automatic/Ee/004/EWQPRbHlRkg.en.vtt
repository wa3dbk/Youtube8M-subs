hey guys how we doing I want to show you
something<00:00:03.240> what<00:00:03.570> I<00:00:03.600> found<00:00:03.810> out<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.350> actually

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
something what I found out I actually

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.860 
something what I found out I actually
noticed<00:00:05.130> it<00:00:05.520> on<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:06.000> my<00:00:06.120> visionary<00:00:06.540> one

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
noticed it on the on my visionary one

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.610 
noticed it on the on my visionary one
the<00:00:07.830> next<00:00:07.980> day<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.250> got<00:00:08.340> it<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:10.019> didn't<00:00:10.380> think

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
the next day I got it and I didn't think

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.100 
the next day I got it and I didn't think
much<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:11.070> then<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.639> got<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.300> one<00:00:12.360> yesterday

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
much of it then I got this one yesterday

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.799 
much of it then I got this one yesterday
and<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:14.099> saw<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.460> they<00:00:14.849> actually<00:00:14.940> change<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.719> I

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
and I saw that they actually change it I

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.960 
and I saw that they actually change it I
don't<00:00:15.960> know<00:00:15.990> which<00:00:16.170> one<00:00:16.350> was<00:00:16.500> first<00:00:16.830> but<00:00:17.699> i<00:00:17.730> can

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
don't know which one was first but i can

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.580 
don't know which one was first but i can
see<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.210> actually<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.930> one<00:00:19.170> has<00:00:19.350> much

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
see that actually this one has much

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.109 
see that actually this one has much
better<00:00:19.800> design<00:00:20.220> than<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.789> there's

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
better design than this one and there's

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.269 
better design than this one and there's
one<00:00:21.420> kind<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.810> big<00:00:21.960> flow<00:00:22.289> design<00:00:22.560> flow<00:00:22.949> i<00:00:23.010> would

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
one kind of big flow design flow i would

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.279 
one kind of big flow design flow i would
call<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:24.390> know<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.630> our<00:00:24.779> clock<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
call it you know the our clock is the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.560 
call it you know the our clock is the
same<00:00:25.710> same<00:00:26.250> kind<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.550> deal<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> like

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
same same kind of deal like a like

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.419 
same same kind of deal like a like
access<00:00:27.960> log<00:00:28.140> except<00:00:28.500> axis<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.279> that

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
access log except axis like it that

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.250 
access log except axis like it that
period<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.970> thing<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.570> stops<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.170> know

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
period that thing that stops you know

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.440 
period that thing that stops you know
the<00:00:31.410> lock<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.430> free<00:00:32.730> free<00:00:33.149> floating

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the lock is just free free floating

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.959 
the lock is just free free floating
there<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.110> held<00:00:34.440> by<00:00:34.710> those<00:00:35.309> grooves<00:00:35.670> there

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
there it's held by those grooves there

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.450 
there it's held by those grooves there
in<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.300> place<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.649> spring-loaded<00:00:37.980> from

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
in a place and it's spring-loaded from

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
in a place and it's spring-loaded from
the<00:00:38.579> side<00:00:38.870> this<00:00:39.870> work<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.260> same<00:00:40.500> principle

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the side this work the same principle

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.150 
the side this work the same principle
but<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.120> not<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.420> free<00:00:42.960> low<00:00:43.140> free<00:00:43.710> floating

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
but it's not just free low free floating

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.639 
but it's not just free low free floating
there<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:45.180> actually<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:46.320> know<00:00:46.440> like

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
there it's actually you know like

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.250 
there it's actually you know like
suspended<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.910> arm<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.989> swings

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
suspended on one little arm that swings

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.990 
suspended on one little arm that swings
on<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.860> period<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.820> this

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
on this period you know you see this

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.660 
on this period you know you see this
dispute<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.320> swings<00:00:52.920> back<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.460> forth

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
dispute here it swings back and forth

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.569 
dispute here it swings back and forth
and<00:00:54.530> but<00:00:55.530> other<00:00:55.680> than<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> same

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and but other than that it's the same

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.860 
and but other than that it's the same
you<00:00:56.670> know<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:57.030> Springs<00:00:57.390> from<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> side

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you know you have Springs from the side

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.189 
you know you have Springs from the side
that<00:00:58.140> pulls<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.010> forward<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.570> when<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.899> when

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
that pulls it forward so when you when

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.380 
that pulls it forward so when you when
you<00:01:01.230> open<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.859> engages<00:01:02.399> into<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> cutout

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
you open it it engages into the cutout

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.289 
you open it it engages into the cutout
in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> blade<00:01:03.870> now<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.949> has<00:01:05.189> right<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:06.030> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
in the blade now it has right here you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.109 
in the blade now it has right here you
can<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.780> two<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.770> these<00:01:07.920> periods<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:09.000> is

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
can see two of these periods here one is

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.060 
can see two of these periods here one is
the<00:01:09.240> pivot<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.570> swings<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.409> Clark<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the pivot that swings are Clark and the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
the pivot that swings are Clark and the
front<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.659> blade<00:01:13.110> step<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.710> no

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
front one is the blade step in no

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.670 
front one is the blade step in no
stopping<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.689> what<00:01:15.900> I've<00:01:16.020> noticed<00:01:16.200> when<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
stopping now what I've noticed when I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.320 
stopping now what I've noticed when I
was<00:01:16.860> taking<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.310> knife<00:01:17.460> apart<00:01:17.790> looking<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
was taking the knife apart looking if I

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.420 
was taking the knife apart looking if I
could<00:01:18.479> customize<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.320> such<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.310> is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
could customize it and such I know it is

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.340 
could customize it and such I know it is
that<00:01:20.610> even<00:01:20.790> from<00:01:21.090> beginning<00:01:21.540> from<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.170> came

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that even from beginning from as it came

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.039 
that even from beginning from as it came
to<00:01:22.560> me<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.220> screw<00:01:23.610> was<00:01:23.820> very<00:01:24.180> very<00:01:24.420> loose<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to me this screw was very very loose I

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590 
to me this screw was very very loose I
could<00:01:25.560> clearly<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.340> know<00:01:26.460> spin<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.939> both

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
could clearly you know spin it both

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.719 
could clearly you know spin it both
direction<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.829> doesn't<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.310> know<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.579> has

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
direction and it doesn't you know it has

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.569 
direction and it doesn't you know it has
that<00:01:29.939> little<00:01:30.119> thing<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:31.400> it's<00:01:32.400> not

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
that little thing here that it's not

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.359 
that little thing here that it's not
just<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.060> turns<00:01:33.329> around<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.979> was<00:01:35.220> just

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
just that it turns around it was just

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.319 
just that it turns around it was just
ruse<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.420> i<00:01:36.509> titled<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.079> down<00:01:37.350> right<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.180> you

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
ruse so i titled it down right so you

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.999 
ruse so i titled it down right so you
want<00:01:39.509> your<00:01:39.659> screws<00:01:40.079> tightened<00:01:40.530> down<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
want your screws tightened down on the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.170 
want your screws tightened down on the
life<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> don't<00:01:41.400> want<00:01:41.640> them<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.909> fall<00:01:42.119> out

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
life you don't want them to fall out

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.719 
life you don't want them to fall out
right<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.930> tighten<00:01:43.380> them<00:01:43.560> down<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.220> check

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
right so I tighten them down and check

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.429 
right so I tighten them down and check
what<00:01:44.880> happens<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.390> tighten<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.810> down<00:01:45.840> now

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
what happens if you tighten it down now

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.380 
what happens if you tighten it down now
first<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.979> see<00:01:47.220> how<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.180> goes

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
first of you see how you know it goes

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.230 
first of you see how you know it goes
hard<00:01:48.689> right<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.350> then<00:01:50.130> look<00:01:50.670> at<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> second

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
hard right and then look at the second

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.770 
hard right and then look at the second
thing<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.450> notice<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:56.570> if<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
thing you notice you see that if you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.289 
thing you notice you see that if you
tighten<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.409> down<00:01:58.579> because<00:01:59.579> it<00:02:00.000> doesn't

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
tighten this down because it doesn't

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.179 
tighten this down because it doesn't
have<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> standard<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:02.040> actually

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
have a standard in there that actually

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.260 
have a standard in there that actually
holds<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.090> liners<00:02:03.600> exact<00:02:04.500> dimensions<00:02:05.270> far

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
holds the liners exact dimensions far

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.169 
holds the liners exact dimensions far
apart<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.960> know<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.710> actually<00:02:08.369> squeeze<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
apart you know it actually squeeze and

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.880 
apart you know it actually squeeze and
compresses<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.140> little<00:02:10.470> are

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
compresses that little are

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.340 
compresses that little are
the<00:02:11.100> that<00:02:11.460> suspends<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.210> hour<00:02:12.420> clock<00:02:12.720> it

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
the that suspends the hour clock it

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.010 
the that suspends the hour clock it
squeeze<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.370> tight<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.540> springs

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
squeeze it so tight that the springs

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.940 
squeeze it so tight that the springs
won't<00:02:16.500> push<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:17.330> into<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.860> locked<00:02:19.860> position

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
won't push it into the locked position

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.240 
won't push it into the locked position
you<00:02:20.640> see<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.410> stays<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:22.800> in

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
you see it it just stays like this in

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.510 
you see it it just stays like this in
open<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.530> kind<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.890> like<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.190> know<00:02:26.220> mess

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
open so you kind of like you know mess

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.449 
open so you kind of like you know mess
up<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.850> whole<00:02:27.630> lot<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.110> I'll<00:02:28.830> show<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.100> here

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
up the whole lot and I'll show you here

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.760 
up the whole lot and I'll show you here
when<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.880> loosen<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.360> up<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.780> will<00:02:30.810> see<00:02:31.020> once<00:02:31.620> it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
when I loosen it up you will see once it

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.800 
when I loosen it up you will see once it
gets<00:02:31.980> loose<00:02:32.190> enough<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:33.060> will<00:02:33.270> see<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.600> lock

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
gets loose enough you will see the lock

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.479 
gets loose enough you will see the lock
just<00:02:34.290> pop<00:02:34.530> into<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.950> right<00:02:35.280> position<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:38.310> see

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
just pop into the right position you see

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.310 
just pop into the right position you see
that<00:02:39.170> can<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.950> would<00:02:41.250> say<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.930> design<00:02:42.930> flaw

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
that can I would say it's a design flaw

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.729 
that can I would say it's a design flaw
because<00:02:43.910> this<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.380> stopping<00:02:46.380> should<00:02:46.650> have

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
because this this stopping should have

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.310 
because this this stopping should have
been<00:02:46.980> should<00:02:47.820> have<00:02:47.970> been<00:02:48.270> kind<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.290> a

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
been should have been kind of like a

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.110 
been should have been kind of like a
bushing<00:02:49.739> or<00:02:49.890> something<00:02:50.340> or<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.700> know<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.000> had

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
bushing or something or you know it had

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.290 
bushing or something or you know it had
supposed<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.750> be<00:02:51.870> wider<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.580> middle<00:02:53.880> to

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
supposed to be wider in the middle to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.229 
supposed to be wider in the middle to
keep<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:54.950> exact<00:02:55.950> dimension<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.730> need<00:02:56.940> there

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
keep that exact dimension you need there

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.449 
keep that exact dimension you need there
so<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:58.260> tighten<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.830> screws<00:02:59.160> because

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
so you can tighten the screws because

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.460 
so you can tighten the screws because
you<00:02:59.550> want<00:02:59.730> your<00:02:59.790> all<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.390> screws<00:03:00.690> styled<00:03:01.380> as

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
you want your all the screws styled as

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.140 
you want your all the screws styled as
possible<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.280> know<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.550> don't<00:03:02.730> want<00:03:02.850> them

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
possible and I know you don't want them

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.360 
possible and I know you don't want them
to<00:03:03.330> shake<00:03:03.570> out<00:03:03.810> unscrew<00:03:04.500> whatever<00:03:04.830> something

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
to shake out unscrew whatever something

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.780 
to shake out unscrew whatever something
comes<00:03:05.580> loose<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:07.100> stuff<00:03:08.100> like<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.700> just

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
comes loose and stuff like that and just

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.290 
comes loose and stuff like that and just
because<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.080> nature<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.769> it's<00:03:11.430> kind<00:03:12.209> of

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
because of the nature of it it's kind of

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.140 
because of the nature of it it's kind of
silly<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.900> have<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.260> have<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.890> know

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
silly that you have to have it you know

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.060 
silly that you have to have it you know
just<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.329> right<00:03:15.450> amount<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.410> threats<00:03:16.799> you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
just the right amount of threats you

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.140 
just the right amount of threats you
know<00:03:17.190> for<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.420> work<00:03:18.570> same<00:03:19.380> goes<00:03:19.620> for<00:03:19.920> this

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
know for it to work same goes for this

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.229 
know for it to work same goes for this
you<00:03:21.150> can<00:03:21.299> actually<00:03:21.450> tighten<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.489> screw<00:03:23.489> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
you can actually tighten the screw the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.930 
you can actually tighten the screw the
pivot<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.780> holds<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.350> our<00:03:25.470> clock<00:03:25.769> too<00:03:26.670> tight

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
pivot that holds the our clock too tight

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.360 
pivot that holds the our clock too tight
for<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.420> spin<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.989> should<00:03:28.410> have<00:03:28.500> been<00:03:28.709> on<00:03:28.860> on

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
for it to spin it should have been on on

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.150 
for it to spin it should have been on on
a<00:03:29.549> bushing<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:31.760> prevent<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.910> from<00:03:33.030> happening<00:03:33.120> I

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
a bushing to prevent it from happening I

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.470 
a bushing to prevent it from happening I
mean<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.310> notice<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.820> right<00:03:35.850> away<00:03:36.030> if<00:03:36.360> you

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
mean you notice it right away if you

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.060 
mean you notice it right away if you
ever<00:03:36.600> do<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:36.959> if<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.350> tighten<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.860> see

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
ever do that if you tighten it you see

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.259 
ever do that if you tighten it you see
that<00:03:38.250> something's<00:03:38.610> wrong<00:03:38.790> with<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.000> knife

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
that something's wrong with the knife

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.420 
that something's wrong with the knife
but<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:40.079> know<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.739> very<00:03:40.980> simple

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
but you know there is that very simple

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.520 
but you know there is that very simple
solutions<00:03:41.970> if<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.720> design<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.049> knife<00:03:43.290> like

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
solutions if you design a knife like

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.020 
solutions if you design a knife like
that<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:44.670> prevent<00:03:44.940> such<00:03:45.329> a<00:03:45.360> things<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:46.709> know

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
that to prevent such a things you know

a<00:06:17.310> problem<00:06:17.520> with<00:06:17.790> the<00:06:17.850> pocket<00:06:18.180> clip<00:06:18.360> very

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
a problem with the pocket clip very

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.020 
a problem with the pocket clip very
uncomfortable<00:06:19.920> for<00:06:20.070> some<00:06:20.280> reason<00:06:20.730> the<00:06:20.910> way

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
uncomfortable for some reason the way

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.630 
uncomfortable for some reason the way
you<00:06:21.090> hold<00:06:21.390> the<00:06:21.570> knife<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:22.050> way<00:06:22.200> it's<00:06:22.320> made

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
you hold the knife the way it's made

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.460 
you hold the knife the way it's made
it's<00:06:23.640> very<00:06:24.000> uncomfortable<00:06:24.750> here<00:06:25.230> and

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
it's very uncomfortable here and

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.160 
it's very uncomfortable here and
meanwhile<00:06:26.340> it's<00:06:26.790> not<00:06:27.060> much<00:06:27.660> different<00:06:27.690> than

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
meanwhile it's not much different than

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.710 
meanwhile it's not much different than
anything<00:06:28.560> else<00:06:28.950> it's<00:06:29.130> longer<00:06:29.550> oh<00:06:29.760> that's

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
anything else it's longer oh that's

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.050 
anything else it's longer oh that's
probably<00:06:30.900> why<00:06:31.260> it<00:06:31.890> comes<00:06:32.220> out<00:06:32.400> two<00:06:32.580> completely

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
probably why it comes out two completely

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.159 
probably why it comes out two completely
different<00:06:33.570> portion<00:06:34.290> of<00:06:34.380> your<00:06:34.500> hand

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
different portion of your hand

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.019 
different portion of your hand
that's<00:06:36.009> probably<00:06:36.279> why<00:06:36.460> it<00:06:36.639> is<00:06:36.849> so

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:37.029 
that's probably why it is so

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.519 
that's probably why it is so
uncomfortable<00:06:37.389> I'm<00:06:37.900> gonna<00:06:38.199> have<00:06:38.319> to<00:06:38.409> do

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:38.529 
uncomfortable I'm gonna have to do

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:40.080 
uncomfortable I'm gonna have to do
