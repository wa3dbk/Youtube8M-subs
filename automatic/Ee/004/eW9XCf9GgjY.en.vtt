00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.410

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.540
 Well, honestly there is no other result 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:56.220
 I waited and most likely this is due to the fact that I 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:03:00.630
 chose the walking character seems to me 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:05.400
 because of this but let's say the same 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:13.430

 the damage here is the invoker and all because 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.150
 the fact that I wanted to fly my 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.840
 the character in general is so funny 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.280
