hi<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.860> Alex<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.520> here's<00:00:02.790> another<00:00:02.850> video

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hi this is Alex and here's another video

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.160 
hi this is Alex and here's another video
in<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.870> water<00:00:04.080> cooling<00:00:04.740> video<00:00:05.670> series<00:00:06.170> in

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
in the water cooling video series in

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.960 
in the water cooling video series in
this<00:00:07.379> video<00:00:07.649> we're<00:00:07.799> going<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.950> be<00:00:08.130> unboxing

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
this video we're going to be unboxing

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.680 
this video we're going to be unboxing
the<00:00:09.030> coolants<00:00:09.630> cpu<00:00:10.260> 370<00:00:11.130> CPU<00:00:11.820> water<00:00:12.090> block<00:00:12.300> and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the coolants cpu 370 CPU water block and

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.200 
the coolants cpu 370 CPU water block and
this<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> actual<00:00:13.590> unit<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:15.000> would

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
this is the actual unit that you would

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.590 
this is the actual unit that you would
put<00:00:15.480> right<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.410> your<00:00:16.440> CPU<00:00:17.060> instead<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.300> one

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
put right on to your CPU instead of one

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.620 
put right on to your CPU instead of one
of<00:00:18.690> those<00:00:18.840> gigantic<00:00:19.410> heat<00:00:20.340> sinks<00:00:20.789> with<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> big

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
of those gigantic heat sinks with a big

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.960 
of those gigantic heat sinks with a big
fan<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.080> whatnot<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.650> let's<00:00:23.460> open<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.760> up<00:00:23.880> and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
fan and whatnot so let's open it up and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.700 
fan and whatnot so let's open it up and
see<00:00:24.060> what's<00:00:24.330> inside

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.850 

okay<00:00:33.309> so<00:00:34.180> it<00:00:34.390> looks<00:00:34.540> like<00:00:34.629> we<00:00:34.899> have<00:00:34.930> an

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
okay so it looks like we have an

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.200 
okay so it looks like we have an
instruction<00:00:36.219> guide<00:00:36.610> on<00:00:36.940> how<00:00:37.809> to<00:00:37.840> install<00:00:38.199> it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
instruction guide on how to install it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.490 
instruction guide on how to install it
looks<00:00:40.210> fairly<00:00:40.540> simple<00:00:41.410> it's<00:00:42.100> boom<00:00:42.370> about<00:00:42.610> it

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
looks fairly simple it's boom about it

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.729 
looks fairly simple it's boom about it
and<00:00:44.500> have<00:00:45.219> some<00:00:46.680> selenium<00:00:47.680> parts<00:00:48.070> some<00:00:49.030> screws

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and have some selenium parts some screws

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.219 
and have some selenium parts some screws
bolts<00:00:51.570> couple<00:00:52.570> of<00:00:52.659> springs<00:00:53.019> and<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:55.510> thermal

bolts couple of springs and a thermal

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.689 
bolts couple of springs and a thermal
compound<00:00:56.440> which<00:00:57.430> is<00:00:57.579> very<00:00:57.820> handy<00:00:59.579> see<00:01:00.579> what

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
compound which is very handy see what

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.799 
compound which is very handy see what
else<00:01:00.850> is<00:01:01.059> in<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.449> box<00:01:01.860> here's<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.040> actual

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
else is in the box here's the actual

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.840 
else is in the box here's the actual
water<00:01:04.809> block<00:01:05.170> itself<00:01:05.649> so<00:01:06.490> this<00:01:06.640> particular

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
water block itself so this particular

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.870 
water block itself so this particular
unit<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:08.649> one<00:01:08.800> that<00:01:08.950> you<00:01:09.130> would<00:01:09.369> put<00:01:09.640> right

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
unit is the one that you would put right

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.919 
unit is the one that you would put right
on<00:01:09.910> to<00:01:10.270> your<00:01:10.300> CPU<00:01:10.990> let's<00:01:11.950> open<00:01:12.429> it<00:01:12.520> up<00:01:12.670> here

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
on to your CPU let's open it up here

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.480 
on to your CPU let's open it up here
this<00:01:13.929> is<00:01:14.080> actually<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.410> fairly<00:01:14.649> heavy<00:01:15.039> unit<00:01:15.250> I'd

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
this is actually a fairly heavy unit I'd

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:25.020 
this is actually a fairly heavy unit I'd
say<00:01:15.700> it's<00:01:15.850> about<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.450> pound<00:01:16.690> oh<00:01:23.850> yeah<00:01:24.850> it's

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
say it's about a pound oh yeah it's

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.460 
say it's about a pound oh yeah it's
pretty<00:01:25.179> heavy<00:01:25.420> it's<00:01:26.409> very<00:01:26.619> very<00:01:26.860> shiny<00:01:27.130> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
pretty heavy it's very very shiny and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.580 
pretty heavy it's very very shiny and
let's<00:01:29.470> take<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.800> look<00:01:30.039> here<00:01:30.070> has<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:31.590> coolants

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
let's take a look here has the coolants

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.380 
let's take a look here has the coolants
logo<00:01:32.950> right<00:01:33.190> here<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:35.649> has<00:01:35.890> an<00:01:36.490> inn<00:01:36.970> in<00:01:37.240> and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
logo right here and it has an inn in and

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.230 
logo right here and it has an inn in and
out<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:38.020> this<00:01:38.950> is<00:01:39.009> actually<00:01:39.280> made<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.119> this

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
out and this is actually made and this

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.940 
out and this is actually made and this
is<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.479> cpu<00:01:41.110> 370<00:01:41.770> model<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:44.409> made<00:01:44.590> for

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
is the cpu 370 model and it's made for

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.179 
is the cpu 370 model and it's made for
various<00:01:45.700> types<00:01:45.970> of<00:01:46.210> processors<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.979> course

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
various types of processors of course

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.560 
various types of processors of course
I'm<00:01:48.310> going<00:01:48.430> to<00:01:48.490> be<00:01:48.610> using<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:49.030> on<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.450> machine

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
I'm going to be using it on the machine

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.200 
I'm going to be using it on the machine
that<00:01:50.560> this<00:01:50.740> was<00:01:50.920> purchased<00:01:51.280> for<00:01:51.490> which<00:01:51.820> is<00:01:52.030> the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
that this was purchased for which is the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.370 
that this was purchased for which is the
Intel<00:01:52.890> 5690<00:01:54.600> CPU<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.430> as<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.420> can<00:01:58.630> see<00:01:58.869> here

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
Intel 5690 CPU so as you can see here

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.730 
Intel 5690 CPU so as you can see here
with<00:01:59.680> this<00:01:59.860> particular<00:02:00.040> unit<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:01.090> input<00:02:01.810> for

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
with this particular unit the input for

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.670 
with this particular unit the input for
the<00:02:03.340> nozzles<00:02:03.820> is<00:02:04.030> very<00:02:04.750> close<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.320> middle

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
the nozzles is very close to the middle

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.389 
the nozzles is very close to the middle
of<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:07.090> water<00:02:07.869> block<00:02:08.140> which<00:02:09.100> is<00:02:09.220> very

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
of the water block which is very

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.280 
of the water block which is very
important<00:02:09.880> for<00:02:10.209> war<00:02:10.420> blocks<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:10.959> reason

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
important for war blocks and the reason

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.550 
important for war blocks and the reason
is<00:02:11.440> is<00:02:11.680> because<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:12.430> CPUs<00:02:13.239> get<00:02:13.480> hot<00:02:13.720> right<00:02:14.410> in

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
is is because the CPUs get hot right in

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.460 
is is because the CPUs get hot right in
the<00:02:14.650> middle<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.190> core<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.140> basically<00:02:17.140> if

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
the middle of the core and basically if

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.710 
the middle of the core and basically if
you<00:02:18.220> have<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.579> water<00:02:18.820> going<00:02:19.030> right<00:02:19.359> into<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
you have the water going right into the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.060 
you have the water going right into the
middle<00:02:19.840> or<00:02:20.170> as<00:02:20.290> close<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.680> Middle's<00:02:20.920> and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
middle or as close to the Middle's and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.370 
middle or as close to the Middle's and
as<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.480> more<00:02:22.660> efficient<00:02:23.200> in

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
as you can it is more efficient in

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.680 
as you can it is more efficient in
cooling<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.160> processor<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.390> that's<00:02:25.510> one<00:02:25.660> of

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
cooling the processor so that's one of

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.180 
cooling the processor so that's one of
the<00:02:25.840> reasons<00:02:26.380> why<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.560> chose<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.859> particular

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
the reasons why I chose this particular

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.009 
the reasons why I chose this particular
model<00:02:27.760> versus<00:02:28.570> some<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> other

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
model versus some of the other

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.710 
model versus some of the other
manufacturers<00:02:29.859> where<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.880> input<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.630> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
manufacturers where the input and the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.160 
manufacturers where the input and the
output<00:02:31.750> are<00:02:32.170> kind<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.650> off<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.010> center<00:02:34.170> so

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
output are kind of off the center so

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.400 
output are kind of off the center so
let's<00:02:35.440> see<00:02:35.560> what<00:02:35.590> else<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:37.269> in<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.720> box

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
let's see what else is in the in the box

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.330 
let's see what else is in the in the box
here

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.490 

okay<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.400> here's<00:02:45.060> another<00:02:45.330> component<00:02:46.200> and

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
okay so here's another component and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.710 
okay so here's another component and
this<00:02:47.370> one<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.629> case<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.349> have<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.860> different

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
this one is in case you have a different

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.839 
this one is in case you have a different
processor<00:02:51.720> like<00:02:51.959> an<00:02:52.110> AMD<00:02:52.410> or<00:02:52.860> something<00:02:54.379> and

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
processor like an AMD or something and

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.550 
processor like an AMD or something and
there's<00:02:56.849> a<00:02:56.910> little<00:02:57.000> rubber<00:02:57.390> gasket<00:02:57.930> for<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
there's a little rubber gasket for the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.430 
there's a little rubber gasket for the
backplates<00:02:59.040> these<00:02:59.730> black<00:02:59.970> back<00:03:00.569> plates<00:03:00.840> are

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
backplates these black back plates are

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.059 
backplates these black back plates are
the<00:03:01.590> ones<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.220> connect<00:03:02.670> at<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.920> on<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
the ones that you connect at the on the

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.960 
the ones that you connect at the on the
bottom<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.700> motherboard<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:07.170> secure<00:03:07.980> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
bottom of the motherboard to secure the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.770 
bottom of the motherboard to secure the
particular<00:03:10.250> water<00:03:11.250> block<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.879> the<00:03:12.090> CPU<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:12.660> it

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
particular water block to the CPU so it

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.539 
particular water block to the CPU so it
doesn't<00:03:13.049> go<00:03:13.110> away<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.349> basically<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.370> put

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
doesn't go away so basically you put

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.610 
doesn't go away so basically you put
these<00:03:14.730> two<00:03:14.940> like<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.049> motherboard<00:03:16.500> is

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
these two like so and the motherboard is

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.530 
these two like so and the motherboard is
right<00:03:16.799> in<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.950> middle<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.120> have<00:03:18.329> these

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
right in the middle and you have these

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.520 
right in the middle and you have these
long<00:03:19.140> screws<00:03:19.910> right<00:03:20.910> here<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:22.200> will<00:03:22.380> go

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
long screws right here that will go

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.910 
long screws right here that will go
through<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:23.810> corner<00:03:24.810> or<00:03:25.019> all<00:03:25.500> these<00:03:25.680> four

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
through this corner or all these four

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.729 
through this corner or all these four
corners<00:03:26.370> into<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:27.060> four<00:03:27.269> corners<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
corners into the four corners of the

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.530 
corners into the four corners of the
bracket<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.019> that's<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.769> for<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:33.299> water

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
bracket and so that's it for the water

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.630 
bracket and so that's it for the water
block<00:03:33.920> for<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.010> CPU<00:03:37.160> thanks<00:03:38.160> for<00:03:38.310> watching

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640
