00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
so the light is directed where we want

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.759 
so the light is directed where we want
it<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.780> be<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.209> simple<00:02:33.659> with<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.260> LED

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769
