00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello to all so today we're going 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.910
 do the recipe of the couple who is a 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.550
 dessert or a malagasy snack based 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.790
 of corn flour bananas and 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.279
 optionally peanuts 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.720
 so to do this you will need to 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.609
 bananas of peanut corn flour 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.220
 so I have not I have not managed to 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.980
 find peanuts 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.670
 nature so I took peanuts that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:41.329
 I hulled and I already have a little 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.329
 crushed and so here are more results 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:50.309
 then you will also need to 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.450
 sugar a little sugar if not for for 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.580
 the packaging so 2 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:03.100
 2 of the dessert you will need film 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:05.440
 plastic or plastic film or 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.680
 aluminum must know that in the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.100
 traditional preparation is used 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.680
 rather banana leaves but for 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:22.180
 me like I do not have eh ben 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:25.900
 we will simply use either the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.820
 truck be the plastic film 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.470
 here 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.470
 so we will start 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:51.180
 so here I am going to flatten the bananas so 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.250
 I have finished crushing but three 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:15.150
 bananas so I'm going to decant 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:15.630
 all in my bowl I will take my 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.220
 car 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.980
 bailly 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:28.050
 this one I held them from 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.690
 madagascar but we could find 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.870
 everywhere in the Chinese even a point of 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:41.070
 surface so for the quantity does it 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.070
 is to put in every month 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:22.110
 the time I'm going to add more 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:28.230
 on fire so that gives a texture 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:31.140
 like this I'm going to add a little bit of 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.599
 sugar is the same 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.010
 really at your convenience 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:41.060
 nothing there that put me much 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.060
 other lights me I'm master monnier 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:58.540
 after me I think it's better 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:04:00.790
 we all know sweet so 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.629
 here is the preparation is ready 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.970
 we will now move to the second 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:14.270
 step which is of m 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.620
 so that this dough on a support so 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.140
 nothing more simple you take a 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:25.440
 tablespoon of dough 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:28.230
 then you take the bread peanuts 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.560
 break you've been just a tiny 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.880
 shortly thereafter you will answer all with 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:48.810
 a second and then yesterday at 6 o'clock 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:55.700
 and here is to close the roof as if I 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.700
 was making a papillote to close 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.810
 and that's so I'm going to do I'm going 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.690
 continue for the rest of the dough 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.010
 then I'll cook them to the 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.010
 steam for about twenty minutes 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:17.030
 and have I will come back to you he believes 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.030
 that all this would be ready for anything
