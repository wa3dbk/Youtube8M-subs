the<00:01:25.869> length<00:01:26.109> of<00:01:26.259> this<00:01:26.409> dress<00:01:26.709> because<00:01:27.009> often

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
the length of this dress because often

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.249 
the length of this dress because often
times<00:01:27.549> that<00:01:27.909> music<00:01:28.179> festivals<00:01:28.600> you're<00:01:29.109> in<00:01:29.200> a

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
times that music festivals you're in a

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.599 
times that music festivals you're in a
lot<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.439> weird<00:01:29.709> positions<00:01:30.189> and<00:01:30.429> you're
