00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the the track event that we have almost

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.530 
the the track event that we have almost
all<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.290> Italian<00:00:34.800> skaters<00:00:35.190> using<00:00:35.760> MPC<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
all the Italian skaters using MPC and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.100 
all the Italian skaters using MPC and
this<00:00:37.080> makes<00:00:37.380> us<00:00:37.760> very<00:00:38.760> proud<00:00:38.880> and<00:00:39.330> in<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
this makes us very proud and in the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.729 
this makes us very proud and in the
meanwhile<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.920> convinced<00:00:41.400> also<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.420> other

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
meanwhile we convinced also the other

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.440 
meanwhile we convinced also the other
countries<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.480> NBC<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.620> better<00:00:47.090> track<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
countries that NBC is a better track and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.320 
countries that NBC is a better track and
that's<00:00:49.200> why<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.710> had<00:00:51.890> people<00:00:52.890> skating<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.850> NBC

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
that's why we had people skating on NBC

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.800 
that's why we had people skating on NBC
during<00:00:54.990> the<00:00:55.350> track<00:00:55.770> event<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.600> we<00:00:57.600> won't

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
during the track event and we won't

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.340 
during the track event and we won't
maybe<00:00:58.410> 90%<00:00:58.860> of<00:00:59.310> the<00:00:59.430> titles<00:00:59.850> that's<00:01:00.780> that's

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
maybe 90% of the titles that's that's

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.740 
maybe 90% of the titles that's that's
very<00:01:01.470> good<00:01:01.860> people<00:01:02.250> told<00:01:02.579> me<00:01:02.700> that<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.540> wheels

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
very good people told me that the wheels

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.499 
very good people told me that the wheels
are<00:01:03.960> really<00:01:04.259> faster<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.009> this<00:01:05.940> kind<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.330> track

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
are really faster on this kind of track

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.410 
are really faster on this kind of track
and<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.920> general<00:01:08.340> point<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.729> view<00:01:08.910> in<00:01:09.060> Italy

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and the general point of view in Italy

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.030 
and the general point of view in Italy
is<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:10.280> on<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> track<00:01:12.649> which<00:01:13.649> are<00:01:13.830> coated

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
is that on the track which are coated

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.120 
is that on the track which are coated
with<00:01:14.280> West<00:01:15.060> Marco<00:01:16.640> Marco<00:01:17.640> Venetian<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.130> NPC

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
with West Marco Marco Venetian is a NPC

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.520 
with West Marco Marco Venetian is a NPC
will<00:01:20.430> start<00:01:20.729> faster<00:01:21.149> because<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.200> way<00:01:22.350> how

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
will start faster because of the way how

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.779 
will start faster because of the way how
they<00:01:22.770> are<00:01:22.950> produced

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
they are produced

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.930 
they are produced
yeah<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.539> construction<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.789> totally<00:01:26.789> is

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
yeah the construction is totally is

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.270 
yeah the construction is totally is
completely<00:01:27.390> different<00:01:27.509> from<00:01:27.830> from<00:01:28.830> any<00:01:29.100> other

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
completely different from from any other

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.199 
completely different from from any other
wheels<00:01:29.550> we<00:01:30.300> have<00:01:30.649> a<00:01:31.729> flexible<00:01:32.729> hub<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:34.200> helps

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
wheels we have a flexible hub that helps

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.449 
wheels we have a flexible hub that helps
skaters<00:01:36.209> during<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.869> turn<00:01:37.590> when<00:01:38.130> when<00:01:38.340> you

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459 
skaters during the turn when when you

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:41.300 
skaters during the turn when when you
skate<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:39.030> twists<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.410> ring<00:01:40.800> that<00:01:41.039> you<00:01:41.130> have

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
skate it twists this ring that you have

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.980 
skate it twists this ring that you have
inside<00:01:41.700> twister<00:01:42.630> has<00:01:43.039> to<00:01:44.039> follow<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.190 

the<00:01:48.990> corners<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> then<00:01:50.249> outside<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the corners and then outside we have a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.880 
the corners and then outside we have a
uracil<00:01:52.740> which<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.399> harder<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.649> a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
uracil which is harder so you have a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.160 
uracil which is harder so you have a
very<00:01:56.429> good<00:01:57.179> role<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.640> since<00:01:59.659> the<00:02:00.659> shape<00:02:00.959> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
very good role and since the shape of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.559 
very good role and since the shape of
the<00:02:01.439> wheels<00:02:01.679> change<00:02:02.520> while<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.329> skating

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
the wheels change while you're skating

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.749 
the wheels change while you're skating
you<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.409> better<00:02:04.679> grip<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.219> during<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
you have a better grip and during the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.410 
you have a better grip and during the
corner<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.709> you<00:02:07.709> never<00:02:07.920> hand<00:02:08.160> skating<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.330> you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
corner you you never hand skating so you

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.250 
corner you you never hand skating so you
can<00:02:09.629> push<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.379> skate<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.569> why<00:02:12.780> you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
can push and skate so this is why you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.600 
can push and skate so this is why you
are<00:02:13.410> absolutely<00:02:14.220> faster<00:02:14.819> on<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.959> track<00:02:16.200> so

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
are absolutely faster on the track so

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.890 
are absolutely faster on the track so
thanks<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.640> MPC<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:20.030> create<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.450> kind<00:02:21.720> of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
thanks to MPC to create this kind of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.160 
thanks to MPC to create this kind of
wheels<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.319> really<00:02:23.099> a<00:02:23.280> new<00:02:23.849> goal<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.239> road<00:02:24.930> war

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
wheels is really a new goal and road war

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.890 
wheels is really a new goal and road war
in<00:02:25.410> this<00:02:25.829> moment<00:02:26.129> is<00:02:26.599> a<00:02:27.650> new<00:02:28.650> step
