Hello! Surely you also happens to you or you have happened that you have made potatoes and have become soft and discolored

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.720
Well, here we are going to make some crispy golden chips

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.240
We started peeling the potato

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.960
Then cut it into a stick

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.100
The first secret is that they are not very thick. About 1 centimeter thick

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Then thoroughly wash the potatoes to remove excess starch

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.540
Now, let's cook the potato. And we are going to do it in two phases

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.920
In the first, we put it on medium fire in abundant olive oil. It should not take color

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.620
After about 10 minutes, when the potato is soft we remove it and let it cool

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.760
This done, and now we do, put the oil to maximum power and brown the potatoes in it for one, or two minutes

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.403
We remove and we put salt

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.480
Try this technique, and you will see the result. A greeting!
