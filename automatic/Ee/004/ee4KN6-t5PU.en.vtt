00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.200 
be able to handle the cold I don't know
about<00:02:00.499> salary<00:02:01.039> plants<00:02:01.399> what<00:02:01.549> can<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:01.819> tell<00:02:01.999> me

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
about salary plants what can you tell me

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.880 
about salary plants what can you tell me
about<00:02:02.329> them<00:02:02.689> I<00:02:02.840> thought<00:02:03.289> these<00:02:03.469> would<00:02:03.649> produce

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
about them I thought these would produce

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.140 
about them I thought these would produce
big<00:02:04.340> stalks<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.770> don't<00:02:09.250> see<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:11.030> know

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
big stalks I don't see that you know

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.850 
big stalks I don't see that you know
they're<00:02:11.480> producing<00:02:11.870> some<00:02:12.170> maybe<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.830> just

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
they're producing some maybe it just

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.740 
they're producing some maybe it just
takes<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.370> little<00:02:13.490> bit<00:02:13.700> longer<00:02:13.970> but<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.690> think

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
takes a little bit longer but I think

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.180 
takes a little bit longer but I think
what<00:02:15.170> I'll<00:02:15.260> do<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.470> cut<00:02:15.860> though

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
what I'll do is cut though

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.910 
what I'll do is cut though
anyway<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.240> just<00:02:17.450> freeze<00:02:17.750> them<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.230> put<00:02:18.830> them

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
anyway and just freeze them and put them

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.250 
anyway and just freeze them and put them
in<00:02:19.100> soups<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.730> stuff<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.360> think<00:02:20.930> that'll<00:02:21.230> work

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
in soups and stuff I think that'll work

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.630 
in soups and stuff I think that'll work
great<00:02:21.620> my<00:02:22.310> green<00:02:22.580> beans<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:24.280> need<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.370> get<00:02:25.460> out

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
bring bugs in with and I'll probably be

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.900 
bring bugs in with and I'll probably be
doing<00:04:09.320> some<00:04:09.470> spraying<00:04:10.010> on<00:04:10.220> them<00:04:10.370> just<00:04:10.489> to<00:04:10.700> kind

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
doing some spraying on them just to kind

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.180 
doing some spraying on them just to kind
of<00:04:10.970> keep<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.239> bugs<00:04:11.480> get<00:04:12.110> them<00:04:12.260> under<00:04:12.500> control

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
of keep the bugs get them under control
