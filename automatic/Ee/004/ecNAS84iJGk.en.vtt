00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.249
 probably percent 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:14.609
 if we look at n 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.849
 but today 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.980
 in the London Tavria 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.820
 exactly there 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.060
 Cops potential there I have Nevsky 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.590
 winner in general those who will be there 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.789
 fight 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.789
 for the victory and remember that there is still anand 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.259
 then long overstepped 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.650
 forty years 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.650
 touran say what to situations 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.899
 even m more than 1 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.710
 only a fraction of 63 year olds 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.720
 all the same meaning that the tournament was 32 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.690
 of the year 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.030
 world champion botvinnik 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.640
 Botvinnik weather 42 years 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.440
 here is redkin from st at that moment was 37 years old 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.430
 percentage seven years 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.410
 in but let's see 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.530
 on the dam kramnik agent fund 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.889
 and ananda 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:05.990
 but it is clear that there is certainly one thing 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.840
 of them I like him nothing 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.350
 Petya sweater that is generally if you look 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.700
 to the tournament with the exception of angus 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.250
 Here's how about what else in the summer apart 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.860
 from this 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.970
 radio tv and another generation covered 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.800
 another world because principle we won't 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.180
 forget what's in london 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.190
 the masters of the rubble sat down 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.290
 what are the nightmarish career mushrooms 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.970
 nightmare phisher seven soviet 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.270
 Yes, and with a Westerner, that is, here 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.780
 another thing is that there may 3 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.550
 will it be different flags 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.480
 all the Soviet masts of the country 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.670
 less nonetheless so 7 7 players according to 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.160
 no commercial tournament gave birth 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.630
 Soviet Union then world champion us 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.719
 suggest how would there 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.869
 this is also not soviet 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:51.700
 chess player 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.100
 oao MMK 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.210
 and that is probably there is such a rule 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.320
 what do u generally 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.090
 no rules are written but simply many 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.690
 which he 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.080
 regularity so all the same as in 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.820
 nor accelerated rhythm time 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.989
 Tabakova listen remains there 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.219
 it is clear that he 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:11.439
 and then we 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.019
 mid in them they are common food presenting 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:14.899
 valor 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.999
 divisions are a serious factor with which all 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.949
 need to be considered someone Babylonian tournament 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.279
 to be the favorite of the match on the side 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.509
 because already 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.689
 Herzen established the article miraculously resisted 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.759
 entered into the principle despite the fact that the executive committee 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:30.849
 case of potential chess players 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.989
 whom he generally won the best years 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.230
 they are well not that they were in one water in one 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.680
 wicket but still pretty 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.139
 confidently won in all this 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.249
 it was still not a temple 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.189
 but then of course something else is the system itself 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.599
 she she is quite conservative 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.409
 it is known that 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.249
 today all the same if carried on 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:49.729
 tournament of this and 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.289
 tukai bathroom pocket play 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:52.899
 prime karyakin unconditionally 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.109
 completely that he was younger if the system 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.699
 was not so conservatism not 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:57.769
 so there 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.709
 and it is cumbersome to understand that all systems 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.980
 world cup tatyana she is clearly 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.379
 already behind the times on the one hand 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.579
 preserved as if the classic form with 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.359
 the other side is full of contempt because 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.779
 the world is changing and generally month and today about and 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.719
 more dynamic selection as if fun 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.219
 attention to the rating and in general as it was 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:19.959
 you are so much a system that would still 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.010
 would allow such a tournament upm 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:25.619
 psm atr be carried on a horse of course reflect 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:28.069
 Tulu composition today all the same corner with us 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.819
 more cultured of course there would of course be 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.589
 answered that the penalty system should be 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.009
 objective yana due 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.489
 I can even aim at finding the strongest 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.819
 chess player must still be 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.559
 mobilized for this 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:41.959
 whole 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.569
 god to avoid these situations here 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:45.439
 now 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.339
 all the same sooner or later I hope 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:48.759
 chess must 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:50.509
 still acquire corporate 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.089
 sponsors category could there apt 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:55.279
 stop dependence of these temporary 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.769
 sponsors hairy with very specific 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:58.599
 interests
