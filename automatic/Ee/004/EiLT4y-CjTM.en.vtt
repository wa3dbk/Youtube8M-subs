the<00:00:22.320> last<00:00:22.619> frontier<00:00:23.279> was<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.670> corn<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.470> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the last frontier was the corn and and

but<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.189> did<00:00:29.550> some<00:00:29.760> research<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.359> corn<00:00:30.630> looked

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
but I did some research and corn looked

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.260 
but I did some research and corn looked
into<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> history<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.769> corn<00:00:32.070> found<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:32.940> how

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
into the history of corn found out how

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.330 
into the history of corn found out how
we<00:00:33.329> developed<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> when<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.440> developed<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
we developed it when we developed it the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.010 
we developed it when we developed it the
fact<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.149> won't<00:00:36.420> grow<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.930> don't

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
fact that it won't grow if you don't

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.319 
fact that it won't grow if you don't
plant<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.190> unnatural<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> can't<00:00:39.180> even

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
plant it so unnatural you can't even

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.000 
plant it so unnatural you can't even
grow<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.690> its<00:00:39.899> own<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.739> google

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
grow on its own and that if you google

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.610 
grow on its own and that if you google
corn<00:00:41.670> gluten<00:00:41.910> meal<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.930> find<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
corn gluten meal you find that it's a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.779 
corn gluten meal you find that it's a
natural<00:00:43.860> herbicide<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.820> kills<00:00:45.180> other<00:00:45.600> plants

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
natural herbicide it kills other plants

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.490 
natural herbicide it kills other plants
okay<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.570> don't<00:00:48.629> know<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:48.989> anything<00:00:49.379> that

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
okay and I don't know if anything that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.990 
okay and I don't know if anything that
we<00:00:49.649> eat<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.980> healthy<00:00:50.370> for<00:00:50.550> us<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
we eat this healthy for us that if you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.490 
we eat this healthy for us that if you
ground<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> put<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> plants<00:00:52.410> it

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
ground it up and put it on the plants it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.720 
ground it up and put it on the plants it
would<00:00:52.620> kill<00:00:52.770> them<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
would kill them I think it's just the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.850 
would kill them I think it's just the
opposite<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.300> would<00:00:54.449> call<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.750> fertilizer<00:00:55.230> so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
opposite we would call it fertilizer so

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.610 
opposite we would call it fertilizer so
corn<00:00:56.219> has<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> long<00:00:56.969> history<00:00:57.620> including

know the thing that ties them together

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.800 
know the thing that ties them together
or<00:01:34.500> literally<00:01:35.040> binds<00:01:35.340> them<00:01:35.729> together<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.360> that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
or literally binds them together is that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.630 
or literally binds them together is that
those<00:01:37.049> are<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.259> only<00:01:37.439> four<00:01:37.619> foods<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.460> we

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
what we see as far as the tolerance

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.629 
what we see as far as the tolerance
level<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.379> personally<00:03:25.949> think<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.280> soy<00:03:26.579> is

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
level and I personally think that soy is

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.789 
level and I personally think that soy is
is<00:03:27.150> worse<00:03:27.629> than<00:03:27.870> gluten<00:03:28.260> in<00:03:28.349> many<00:03:28.590> many

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
is worse than gluten in many many

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.009 
is worse than gluten in many many

the that's the nature of glycoproteins

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.960 
the that's the nature of glycoproteins
you<00:05:07.920> know<00:05:08.040> which<00:05:08.190> gluten<00:05:08.610> and<00:05:08.670> all<00:05:08.820> these

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
you know which gluten and all these

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.790 
you know which gluten and all these
lectins<00:05:09.420> are<00:05:09.630> they're<00:05:09.930> kind<00:05:10.230> of<00:05:10.320> a<00:05:10.410> protein

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
lectins are they're kind of a protein

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
sugar attached to them I described them

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.660 
sugar attached to them I described them
to<00:05:16.200> my<00:05:16.320> people<00:05:16.650> my<00:05:16.770> clients<00:05:16.830> in<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.400> exam<00:05:17.640> room

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
to my people my clients in the exam room

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.520 
to my people my clients in the exam room
or<00:05:18.060> most<00:05:18.330> of<00:05:18.480> them<00:05:18.660> are<00:05:18.780> certainly<00:05:19.200> less<00:05:19.380> than

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
or most of them are certainly less than

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.380 
or most of them are certainly less than
medically<00:05:19.950> inclined<00:05:20.370> they<00:05:20.880> just<00:05:21.060> think<00:05:21.210> of<00:05:21.300> it

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
medically inclined they just think of it

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.820 
medically inclined they just think of it
being<00:05:21.630> like<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.840> Tootsie<00:05:22.200> Pop<00:05:22.230> you<00:05:22.560> know<00:05:22.680> in<00:05:22.740> the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
being like a Tootsie Pop you know in the

being like a Tootsie Pop you know in the

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
the you know and the glycoproteins on

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.310 
the you know and the glycoproteins on

the outside and the carbohydrates on the
outside<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:28.830> when<00:05:28.950> it<00:05:29.100> sticks<00:05:29.370> to<00:05:29.550> things

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
outside and when it sticks to things

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.070 
outside and when it sticks to things
that<00:05:29.910> you<00:05:30.150> know<00:05:30.240> that's<00:05:30.480> what<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:30.750> does<00:05:30.870> it

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
that you know that's what it does it

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.140 
that you know that's what it does it
sticks<00:05:31.290> to<00:05:31.410> things<00:05:31.560> even<00:05:32.160> bacteria<00:05:32.640> produce

sticks to things even bacteria produce

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.850 
sticks to things even bacteria produce
lectins<00:05:33.690> that<00:05:33.930> cause<00:05:34.110> them<00:05:34.320> to<00:05:34.440> stick<00:05:34.680> to

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
lectins that cause them to stick to

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.440 
lectins that cause them to stick to
tissue<00:05:35.130> and<00:05:35.430> that's<00:05:35.550> why<00:05:35.700> they<00:05:35.880> infect<00:05:36.240> them

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
tissue and that's why they infect them

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.720 
tissue and that's why they infect them
and<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:37.200> interesting<00:05:37.710> thing<00:05:37.890> about<00:05:37.920> them<00:05:38.460> of

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
and the interesting thing about them of

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.700 
and the interesting thing about them of
course<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.390> people<00:05:39.480> want<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.050> know<00:05:40.110> they<00:05:40.500> say

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
course and people want to know they say

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.380 
course and people want to know they say
well<00:05:40.890> it<00:05:41.100> doesn't<00:05:41.340> our<00:05:41.520> stomach<00:05:41.880> take<00:05:42.060> care<00:05:42.270> of

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
well it doesn't our stomach take care of

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.140 
well it doesn't our stomach take care of
that<00:05:42.540> and<00:05:42.930> you<00:05:43.050> go<00:05:43.200> it<00:05:43.380> tries<00:05:43.680> it<00:05:44.460> tries<00:05:44.820> by

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
that and you go it tries it tries by

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.300 
that and you go it tries it tries by
dumping<00:05:45.570> out<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.720> lot<00:05:45.990> of<00:05:46.020> acid<00:05:46.560> but<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.100> sad

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
dumping out a lot of acid but the sad

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.940 
dumping out a lot of acid but the sad
thing<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.640> these<00:05:48.540> glues<00:05:48.930> are<00:05:49.140> not<00:05:49.320> acid

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
thing is these glues are not acid

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.830 
thing is these glues are not acid
soluble<00:05:50.370> in<00:05:50.700> fact<00:05:51.120> they're<00:05:51.300> just<00:05:51.630> the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
soluble in fact they're just the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.160 
soluble in fact they're just the
opposite<00:05:52.470> right<00:05:53.030> alcohol<00:05:54.030> soluble<00:05:54.390> if

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
opposite right alcohol soluble if

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.930 
opposite right alcohol soluble if
they're<00:05:55.320> alcohol<00:05:55.800> soluble<00:05:56.220> and<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.730> other

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
they're alcohol soluble and the other

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.330 
they're alcohol soluble and the other
thing<00:05:57.360> that<00:05:57.750> gets<00:05:58.410> them<00:05:58.590> off<00:05:58.740> of<00:05:58.920> your<00:05:59.040> villi

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
thing that gets them off of your villi

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.810 
thing that gets them off of your villi
is<00:05:59.790> vinegar<00:06:00.180> you<00:06:00.600> know<00:06:01.410> and<00:06:01.650> they<00:06:02.190> say<00:06:02.370> vinegar

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
is vinegar you know and they say vinegar

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.950 
is vinegar you know and they say vinegar
really<00:06:03.030> I<00:06:03.150> said<00:06:03.360> well<00:06:03.480> yeah<00:06:03.600> have<00:06:03.810> you<00:06:03.900> ever

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
really I said well yeah have you ever

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.720 
really I said well yeah have you ever
done<00:06:04.230> wallpapering<00:06:04.920> well<00:06:05.280> I<00:06:05.310> know<00:06:05.430> somebody

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
done wallpapering well I know somebody

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.580 
done wallpapering well I know somebody
you<00:06:06.000> did<00:06:06.210> well<00:06:06.660> what<00:06:06.810> did<00:06:06.900> they<00:06:07.020> use<00:06:07.230> to<00:06:07.470> get

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
you did well what did they use to get

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.380 
you did well what did they use to get
the<00:06:07.740> wallpaper<00:06:08.220> glue<00:06:08.550> off<00:06:08.730> of<00:06:08.940> the<00:06:09.030> residue

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
the wallpaper glue off of the residue

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.630 
the wallpaper glue off of the residue
off<00:06:09.540> of<00:06:09.570> the<00:06:09.780> wall<00:06:09.960> use<00:06:10.890> vinegar<00:06:11.130> on<00:06:11.370> water

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
off of the wall use vinegar on water

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.710 
off of the wall use vinegar on water
yeah<00:06:12.120> isn't<00:06:12.480> that<00:06:12.510> cool

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
yeah isn't that cool

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.410 
yeah isn't that cool
and<00:06:15.720> so<00:06:16.200> you<00:06:16.560> go<00:06:16.950> you<00:06:17.250> go<00:06:17.640> yeah<00:06:17.910> that<00:06:18.210> there's

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
and so you go you go yeah that there's

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.970 
and so you go you go yeah that there's
the<00:06:18.540> practical<00:06:18.960> application<00:06:19.590> for<00:06:19.620> it<00:06:19.890> and

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
the practical application for it and

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.290 
the practical application for it and
this<00:06:20.040> is<00:06:20.100> one<00:06:20.340> of<00:06:20.370> the<00:06:20.490> reasons<00:06:20.820> why<00:06:20.940> it's<00:06:21.120> been

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
this is one of the reasons why it's been

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.940 
this is one of the reasons why it's been
tradition<00:06:21.750> in<00:06:21.870> some<00:06:21.900> families<00:06:22.620> and<00:06:22.770> some

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
tradition in some families and some

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.740 
tradition in some families and some
cultures<00:06:23.190> to<00:06:23.580> actually<00:06:24.030> either<00:06:24.210> drink<00:06:24.630> a

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
cultures to actually either drink a
