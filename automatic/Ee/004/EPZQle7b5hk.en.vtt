00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello, my name is Maxim 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.510
 and now I will talk about what 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.179
 do if a laptop or computer 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.360
 Normally does not turn off I recommend you 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.550
 three options first create a shortcut 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.180
 which will shut down the computer or 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.779
 a laptop 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.390
 let's say by force what is needed for this 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:29.099
 we right-click on the desktop 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.279
 click the create shortcut button and here 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.450
 here where you need to specify the location 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:39.140
 I object to you have I seem to still label 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.660
 I'll give you in the description of this video 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.090
 specifically such a team that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.379
 will perform 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.840
 turning off the computer that is you just 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.039
 here paste and here it is all that I tell you 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 I will give a reference such text click 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.399
 dale 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.350
 call this label something like 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.719
 shutdown laptop disconnecting 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.480
 computer or there shutdown click 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.720
 the button is ready and now when you 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.970
 run this one shortcut here 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.939
 double-clicking on it you have 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.280
 automatically after a few seconds 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.009
 will turn off the computer or laptop this 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.790
 the easiest move the easiest solution 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.340
 and for windows 8 for those who came across 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.100
 for example, with him, this one is a label 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.259
 it will be very good to help out because in 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.930
 they do not have a standard start off 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.549
 computer is no such thing windows 8 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.250
 for example , the computer is already shutting down 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.430
 a little different means that we do 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.619
 Further look happens such that 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.110
 laptop computer does not shut down due to 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.140
 the fact that some yasbi are in conflict 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.420
 devices for example webcam mouse there 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.990
 microphone and beat so you don't go there 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.240
 connected and in order for this problem 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.360
 decide 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.790
 we do the following push start right 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.700
 click on computer properties 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:08.539
 Now we go into the device manager and 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.019
 we find controllers yusb 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.230
 here they are with me and we find 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.349
 root usb hub 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.290
 click on it with the right mouse button 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.879
 power management properties 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.890
 and here we tick off 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.709
 shutting down this device to save 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.500
 energy on each doing the same 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:34.519
 right-click control properties 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.040
 allow and all so until the end after 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.349
 how do you solve all these things 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.659
 do you even have any 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.400
 stranger device hanging around laptop 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:47.829
 or is the computer still computer 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.439
 shutdown through start completion 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:53.269
 the third option which I recommend to you 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.909
 which is really very very 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.540
 works well and helps to turn off 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.970
 computer under any conditions this 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.459
 a program called switch off 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.859
 a candle in this program which 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.549
 principle performs the shutdown function 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:13.729
 computer for a given time or through 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.099
 certain times but I do it too, as well 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:18.620
 I recommend using people for example with 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.169
 windows 8 or joy in the year in which 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.569
 laptop does not turn off normally or 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:27.139
 computer what we do and just 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.229
 Install this program now I 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.030
 I'll show it to me already installed 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:38.720
 a reference to her I am under this video you 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:41.079
 I will also give the program files here it is switch 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.340
 off 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.099
 you can make her always 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.310
 launched about here it appears in the tray 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.919
 right mouse button 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.489
 go to the properties is very important 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.609
 fad 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:59.090
 another it is here forced to close 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:02.389
 application put a tick press ok and 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.959
 now right click off 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.639
 Now press the button now and your 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.549
 the computer will automatically 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.799
 shut down no matter stick out 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.409
 Any yusbi device what 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.769
 applications you are running and because 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.840
 For example, skype or microsoft office is not 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.810
 gives the computer a normal shutdown and 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.830
 you will need 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:29.100
 manually at times disable these here 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.090
 programs if you turn off com 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.250
 through veces all this is not needed here 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.580
 that is, here are three steps that 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.490
 solve the problem with the fact that it does not turn off 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.410
 laptop or computer thanks a lot for 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.510
