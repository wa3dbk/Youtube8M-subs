00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.570
 julia that we walk again young 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.570
 I 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.540
 I have this part of the cover with body 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.090
 fender 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.340
 but I have used all the tricks 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.340
 that they use here to look good 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.550
 here the base 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:32.120
 and then we cut the hoop by the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:37.309
 half and remove the base for the angle 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.309
 moment has to be removed really 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.730
 and the ready to 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.730
 make a hole has this part 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.490
 to pull the cable on this side 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.770
 good good 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.370
 it would be almost finished and ready to 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.840
 the palmar and this I have a prick 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.370
 chaos 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:07.430
 waiting for him to stay a little 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.970
 I could start sanding it since 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.010
 previously the body filler in this case 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.659
 I am using this brand that you will find 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.420
 in Europe 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.840
 other parts of here 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.070
 Really 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.810
 something cheap 15 dollars something 5 but 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.509
 I really liked it 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.729
 it really works to do what 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.240
 has to do the other the fund does not 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.960
 really liked nothing 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.340
 a little thick and this is easier to 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.810
 handle really needs a little 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.970
 layers only 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.790
 and you do not have to leave that much and it's more 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.900
 easy to sand too and then when 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.460
 dry young as rock 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.210
 Well, as I say 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.460
 I am fatal and Carlos and we are going to give him the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.000
 1st 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.000
 village 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.679
 or 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.730
 today I'm going to 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:19.180
 in oroso before you 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.930
 for the troops as it was not checked 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.790
 Really 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.610
 it was not very good for us to say 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.830
 It looks good but 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.920
 in 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.980
 small details are reached to see a 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.280
 little streaks of meditate estelle back to 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.530
 sand a lot and I prefer to use in 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.350
 spray to see how it is this time 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.340
 you 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.420
 well we probably raided in 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.120
 these days you read with another video to see 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.690
 this result of prime art 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.880
 and the painting that 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.030
 I do not have it defined I want to put the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.590
 same color beige or coffee color 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.430
 but it did not convince me much that we say 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.430
 probably 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.630
 add the color of 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.019
 the trail blazers 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.360
 the color that has outside we will see 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.730
 How is it and so let's see if I can 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.640
 get 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.940
 this 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.750
 but same color 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.840
 Well this is all for now, more 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.680
 forward will have the other video 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.680
 as we walk
