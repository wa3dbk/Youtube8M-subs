Reuben foster cuz he's another

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.410 
Reuben foster cuz he's another
linebacker<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.950> maybe<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:19.910> competing<00:02:20.299> with

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420

him<00:02:20.540> at<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.780> position<00:02:20.930> would<00:02:21.350> be<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.470> great
