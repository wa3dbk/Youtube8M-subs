 now 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.560
 wood trash bins 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.550
 I feel like a child in the most amazing playground 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.880
 handcuffed Norwegian the participants of the root country are waiting for the 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.049
 most powerful golf of all time of the forest remembered 170 horses 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.189
 an incredible experience event where it was only the 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.879
 inexperience teaches all the participants special techniques of 

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:32.940
 I understand driving 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.620
 night to choose or learn to drive fast in extreme situations 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.960
 the convoy approaches the snow-covered platform in the north of oslo 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.480
 students can become familiar with the real cost 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.220
 before a first contact with the ice the theory of dynamics of 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.880
 driving and racing techniques the expectation increasing 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.020
 He said that we are so much I have always wondered how I could 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.890
 apply this in practice are 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.890
 since the central building 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.960
 driving and fear what should be practiced now expert supervision 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.650
 de rouen -city of the professional race driver simply only 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.650
 absolute what do you tell me about the position of the seat 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.190
 do not signal that it is important 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.980
 we have not just reached an agreement we must have a distance from the steering wheel 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.480
 When I put my hands in the position of 9 and 13 hours we put inter 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.980
 sign the seat 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.970
 next to him palm hands in parallel at nine and three hours invest thumbs 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.930
 and shoulders at the same level just need to raise the headrest and now what 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.680
 what we have to do is accelerate 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.790
 said and done martínez addition to June during Saturday damiá abella here 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.300
 We do several things based on many years of experiences with cars of 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.980
 careers 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.590
 efe in the end you realize that you can not enter the curves too much 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.590
 I'll quickly take action while we accelerate 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:12.759
 In most cases we have studied our knowledge and tricks to 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:17.059
 to accelerate the learning of the participants so they reach the point that 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:21.609
 it cost us six years threats fruit and in 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.579
 one hours under construction the cg year the first slalom change exercises 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.579
 of charge and we believe with the snsp bird disconnected 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.699
 I feel too close to the wheel but it's great to see how the car 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.119
 reaction to 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.119
 the rule 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.189
 to failure when normalized so that everyone gets an idea of ​​the 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.299
 distances and how are the obstacles 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.829
 the maneuvers of changes of direction and the braking in the ice 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.209
 they are more and more controlled 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.019
 with the loose hour or the case of tandil 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.459
 it's important not to accelerate all the time and let go quickly accelerated by the next 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.039
 pilot 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:06.389
 the next challenge is waiting
