and movies like this and the Sun will

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.350 
and movies like this and the Sun will
reflect<00:00:46.230> back<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.100> now<00:00:47.460> now<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.969> Sun's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
reflect back like this now now the Sun's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.200 
reflect back like this now now the Sun's
up<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.710> move<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.219> usually

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
up here you want to move it I usually

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.029 
up here you want to move it I usually
wait<00:00:51.539> till<00:00:51.570> about<00:00:51.899> five<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.530> six<00:00:52.739> sometimes

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
wait till about five or six sometimes

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.670 
wait till about five or six sometimes
this<00:00:53.910> time<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.270> year<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.750> little<00:00:55.590> bit

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
this time of year to a little bit

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
this time of year to a little bit
towards<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> west<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.820> only<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.120> move

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
towards the west so I only have to move

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
towards the west so I only have to move
with<00:00:57.449> twice<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> day<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
with twice a day but if you have a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.439 
with twice a day but if you have a
cloudy<00:00:59.309> there<00:00:59.579> something<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.059> might<00:01:00.180> want<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
cloudy there something you might want to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.299 
cloudy there something you might want to
move<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.719> more<00:01:00.899> often<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:04.129> you<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
move it more often so that you know you

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.840 
move it more often so that you know you
get<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.700> hotter<00:01:06.060> temperature<00:01:07.520> let's<00:01:08.520> say<00:01:08.670> we

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
get it hotter temperature let's say we

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.679 
get it hotter temperature let's say we
moving<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.600> over<00:01:09.689> here<00:01:09.990> too<00:01:10.170> soon

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
moving it over here too soon

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.539 
moving it over here too soon
there's<00:01:12.689> people<00:01:12.869> online<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:14.070> good

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
there's people online and have good

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.030 
there's people online and have good
videos<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.240> how<00:01:15.390> they<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:16.350> reflectors<00:01:16.979> for

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
videos as how they have reflectors for

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.999 
videos as how they have reflectors for
these<00:01:17.460> tubes<00:01:18.259> usually<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> smaller<00:01:19.680> tubes

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
these tubes usually the smaller tubes

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.149 
these tubes usually the smaller tubes
but<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.299> these<00:01:21.509> two<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.710> might<00:01:22.950> put

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
but you have these two then I might put

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
but you have these two then I might put
this<00:01:23.310> up<00:01:25.909> maybe<00:01:26.909> they'll<00:01:27.180> shoot<00:01:27.450> us<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
this up maybe they'll shoot us on a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.770 
this up maybe they'll shoot us on a
video<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.700> tell<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.210> your<00:01:30.329> hand<00:01:30.570> if

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
video you can tell with your hand if

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.640 
video you can tell with your hand if
it's<00:01:30.930> hitting<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> tube<00:01:32.310> well<00:01:32.579> here<00:01:33.650> tell

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
it's hitting the tube well here tell

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.350 
it's hitting the tube well here tell
them<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> other<00:01:34.920> side<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.240> up

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
them the other side right here it's up

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.640 
them the other side right here it's up
there<00:01:36.570> we're<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> move<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:37.409> there

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
there we're going to move it up there

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.240 
there we're going to move it up there
and<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:40.790> put<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.329> top

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
and it's like that so I put this on top

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.999 
and it's like that so I put this on top
now<00:01:44.250> there's<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:44.970> thing<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.210> need<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:46.009> about

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
now there's one thing I need to do about

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.359 
now there's one thing I need to do about
this<00:01:47.189> time<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.460> day<00:01:47.960> is<00:01:48.960> move<00:01:49.259> some<00:01:49.590> hot<00:01:50.189> water

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
this time of day is move some hot water

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.920 
this time of day is move some hot water
that<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.700> got<00:01:50.880> from<00:01:51.030> these<00:01:51.240> other<00:01:51.360> tubes<00:01:51.659> over

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that I got from these other tubes over

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.130 
that I got from these other tubes over
here<00:01:52.250> into<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.549> I'll<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.450> full

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
here into here so I'll have a full

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.620 
here into here so I'll have a full
chamber<00:01:55.470> at<00:01:55.740> night<00:01:56.329> probably<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.450> so

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
chamber at night probably not so

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.969 
chamber at night probably not so
critical<00:01:57.810> if<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:58.590> sunny<00:01:58.740> day

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
critical if you have a really sunny day

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.060 
critical if you have a really sunny day
but<00:01:59.040> especially<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.409> cloudy<00:02:01.409> or<00:02:01.619> days<00:02:01.799> you

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
but especially on cloudy or days you

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.920 
but especially on cloudy or days you
need<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.549> make<00:02:03.090> sure<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.420> chamber<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.840> full

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
need to make sure this chamber is full

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.179 
need to make sure this chamber is full
of<00:02:04.049> water<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.649> maintain<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
of water so you can maintain the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.210 
of water so you can maintain the
temperature

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
temperature

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.359 
temperature
higher<00:02:07.220> I'm<00:02:08.060> going<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.270> put<00:02:08.360> couple<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:08.929> there

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369
