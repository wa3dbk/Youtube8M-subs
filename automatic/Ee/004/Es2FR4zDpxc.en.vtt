the lsat especially holding down in
certain<00:03:04.130> areas<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.610> give<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.850> a<00:03:04.880> lot<00:03:05.330> of

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
certain areas that give you a lot of

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.090 
certain areas that give you a lot of
ammo<00:03:05.780> you're<00:03:06.170> shooting<00:03:06.319> down<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> lot<00:03:06.860> of<00:03:06.980> guys

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
ammo you're shooting down a lot of guys

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.240 
ammo you're shooting down a lot of guys
protecting<00:03:07.670> Flags<00:03:07.970> just<00:03:08.330> like<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:08.630> one<00:03:08.840> and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
protecting Flags just like this one and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.740 
protecting Flags just like this one and
doing<00:03:10.250> stuff<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.550> that<00:03:10.580> nature<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:11.239> found<00:03:11.510> that

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
doing stuff of that nature I found that

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.300 
doing stuff of that nature I found that
especially<00:03:12.530> in<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:12.739> game<00:03:12.920> when<00:03:13.069> you<00:03:13.160> play

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
especially in this game when you play

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.650 
especially in this game when you play
the<00:03:13.430> objective<00:03:13.819> really<00:03:14.030> hard<00:03:14.269> which<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.540> what

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
the objective really hard which is what

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.080 
the objective really hard which is what
I'll<00:03:14.750> talk<00:03:14.930> about<00:03:14.959> in<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.530> next<00:03:15.560> episode<00:03:16.430> I

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
I'll talk about in the next episode I

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.330 
I'll talk about in the next episode I
have<00:03:17.540> this<00:03:17.660> absolutely<00:03:18.230> insane<00:03:18.709> game<00:03:18.980> where<00:03:19.310> I

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
have this absolutely insane game where I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.190 
have this absolutely insane game where I
get<00:03:19.549> over<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.910> hundred<00:03:20.239> kills<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.810> died<00:03:20.870> less

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
get over a hundred kills and I died less

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.690 
get over a hundred kills and I died less
than<00:03:21.230> ten<00:03:21.590> times<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.130> all<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.280> would<00:03:22.459> literally

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
than ten times and all I would literally

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.090 
than ten times and all I would literally
was<00:03:23.030> doing<00:03:23.360> was<00:03:23.959> running<00:03:24.320> straight<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.890> be

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
was doing was running straight to be

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.120 
was doing was running straight to be
unlike<00:03:25.610> hijacked<00:03:26.180> in<00:03:26.780> every<00:03:27.590> single<00:03:27.799> time<00:03:28.100> I

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
unlike hijacked in every single time I

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.410 
unlike hijacked in every single time I
kill<00:03:28.489> a<00:03:28.519> couple<00:03:28.700> of<00:03:28.940> guys<00:03:29.030> will<00:03:29.239> come<00:03:29.329> on

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
kill a couple of guys will come on

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.699 
kill a couple of guys will come on
trying<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.690> cap<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.989> flag<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.470> would<00:03:30.590> give

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
trying to cap the flag and it would give

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.440 
trying to cap the flag and it would give
me<00:03:30.769> literally<00:03:31.250> enough<00:03:31.760> points<00:03:32.000> for<00:03:32.120> like<00:03:32.329> an

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
me literally enough points for like an

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.750 
me literally enough points for like an
orbital<00:03:32.720> vsat<00:03:32.870> kill<00:03:33.709> three<00:03:34.100> people<00:03:34.130> and

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
orbital vsat kill three people and

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.039 
orbital vsat kill three people and
you're<00:03:34.880> practically<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.570> an<00:03:35.660> orbital<00:03:35.930> vsat

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
you're practically to an orbital vsat

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.250 
you're practically to an orbital vsat
plus<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.530> cab<00:03:36.799> it's<00:03:37.040> crazy<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:38.420> can't<00:03:38.930> really<00:03:39.110> do

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
plus a cab it's crazy I can't really do

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.860 
plus a cab it's crazy I can't really do
that<00:03:39.290> in<00:03:39.620> this<00:03:40.100> game<00:03:40.489> but<00:03:41.239> what<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.660> need<00:03:41.690> to

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
that in this game but what you need to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.210 
that in this game but what you need to
do<00:03:42.110> is<00:03:42.260> need<00:03:42.410> to<00:03:42.530> understand<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.070> power

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
do is need to understand the power

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.890 
do is need to understand the power
positions<00:03:43.790> like<00:03:43.940> this<00:03:44.120> position<00:03:44.390> right<00:03:44.840> here

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
positions like this position right here

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.830 
positions like this position right here
shares<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.070> power<00:03:46.220> position<00:03:46.430> parallel<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.750> it

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
shares the power position parallel to it

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.940 
shares the power position parallel to it
like<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.109> guys<00:03:48.230> at<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.440> other<00:03:48.560> end<00:03:48.799> would

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
like the guys at the other end would

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.250 
like the guys at the other end would
share<00:03:49.190> something<00:03:49.519> very<00:03:49.549> similar<00:03:50.079> you<00:03:51.079> can

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
share something very similar you can

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.840 
share something very similar you can
shoot<00:03:51.440> down<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.739> hallway<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.220> take<00:03:52.670> out<00:03:52.820> a

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
shoot down the hallway and take out a

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.000 
shoot down the hallway and take out a
lot<00:03:53.060> of<00:03:53.150> guys<00:03:53.329> that<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.079> just<00:03:54.350> lightning<00:03:54.739> struck

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
lot of guys that I just lightning struck

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.430 
lot of guys that I just lightning struck
actually<00:03:55.609> this<00:03:56.299> this<00:03:56.810> in<00:03:57.079> certain<00:03:57.410> other

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
actually this this in certain other

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.349 
actually this this in certain other
areas<00:03:57.859> of<00:03:57.890> this<00:03:58.100> map<00:03:58.280> really<00:03:58.579> really<00:03:59.000> benefit

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
areas of this map really really benefit

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:00.849 
areas of this map really really benefit
LMGs<00:03:59.780> and<00:03:59.959> I<00:03:59.989> think<00:04:00.170> this<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.380> actually<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.739> very

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
LMGs and I think this is actually a very

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.890 
LMGs and I think this is actually a very
good<00:04:00.980> lmg<00:04:01.519> map<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:02.299> just<00:04:02.450> can't<00:04:02.630> go<00:04:02.840> to

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
good lmg map you just can't go to

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.110 
good lmg map you just can't go to
certain<00:04:03.170> areas<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:03.709> expect<00:04:04.070> to<00:04:04.130> win<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.760> lot<00:04:05.000> of

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
certain areas and expect to win a lot of

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.240 
certain areas and expect to win a lot of
firefights<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:06.500> will<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:06.920> will<00:04:07.040> lose

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
firefights you will you will lose

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.860 
firefights you will you will lose
firefights<00:04:07.820> in<00:04:07.970> places<00:04:08.359> that<00:04:08.390> have<00:04:08.600> a<00:04:08.630> lot<00:04:08.840> of

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
firefights in places that have a lot of

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.080 
firefights in places that have a lot of
corners<00:04:09.230> but<00:04:09.410> these<00:04:09.590> these<00:04:10.160> long<00:04:10.519> hallways

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
corners but these these long hallways

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.819 
corners but these these long hallways
and<00:04:11.299> stuff<00:04:11.480> like<00:04:11.660> this<00:04:11.720> oh<00:04:12.049> my<00:04:12.290> god<00:04:12.500> dude<00:04:12.680> your

it's really good especially if you're
running<00:04:19.489> some

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.680 
they're not the most amazing games like
maybe<00:04:50.349> like<00:04:50.560> a<00:04:50.800> 3-2<00:04:51.759> a<00:04:51.789> 5<00:04:52.120> kill<00:04:52.449> death<00:04:52.630> ratio

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690
