 the opening thinks it's a great medium 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.570
 the because it's just we have seed theater it's just 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.429
 a costume 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.510
 and singing and acting 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.510
 and that just makes it become a whole complex whole 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.090
 the concern is a shared responsibility at bnn

 that one or more things on stage can act 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.070
 we stand 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.000
 but you are 3 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.829
 the whole 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.180
 experience other than a healer 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.140
 states 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.140

 when the moment suprÃ¨me is there 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.210
 then you go 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.540
 create new and then it will come out pretty much the same as that 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.540
 you have studied it but there is a spark of life in it 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.550
 the me 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.310
 so 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.740
 so 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.190
 so see

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.459
 another example means that from the text 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.319
 all parties are sung at the same time and that is actually true 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.799
 some characteristic of it 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.799

 everything I have chosen for one 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.839
 the open day is most of them doing 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.509
 so we do not go back in time 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:58.679
 and a lot clearer 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:59.749
