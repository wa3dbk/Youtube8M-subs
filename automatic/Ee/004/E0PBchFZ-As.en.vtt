do<00:01:53.450> is<00:01:53.600> make<00:01:53.780> sure<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.920> sensitivity<00:01:55.640> is

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
do is make sure that the sensitivity is

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.230 
do is make sure that the sensitivity is
set<00:01:56.150> so<00:01:56.480> where<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.870> picks<00:01:57.170> up<00:01:57.380> notes<00:01:58.280> like<00:01:58.790> this

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
set so where it picks up notes like this

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.330 
set so where it picks up notes like this
one<00:01:59.420> C<00:01:59.630> with<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:00.470> set<00:02:00.680> like<00:02:00.710> that<00:02:01.010> it's<00:02:01.190> not

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
one C with it set like that it's not

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.670 
one C with it set like that it's not
picking<00:02:02.150> up<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:02.450> little<00:02:03.050> note<00:02:03.290> there<00:02:03.560> so

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
picking up that little note there so

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.440 
picking up that little note there so
what<00:02:03.800> I<00:02:03.860> want<00:02:04.010> to<00:02:04.070> do<00:02:04.190> is<00:02:04.310> keep<00:02:04.940> backing<00:02:05.210> it

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
what I want to do is keep backing it

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.810 
what I want to do is keep backing it
down<00:02:05.600> until<00:02:05.900> it<00:02:06.050> triggers<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.650> note<00:02:06.860> now

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
down until it triggers the note now

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.969 
down until it triggers the note now
everything<00:02:08.450> well<00:02:08.599> there's<00:02:09.019> two<00:02:09.259> more<00:02:09.410> good

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
everything well there's two more good

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.890 
everything well there's two more good
example<00:02:10.459> here<00:02:10.640> okay<00:02:11.300> I'm<00:02:11.420> going<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.629> pull<00:02:11.810> this

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
example here okay I'm going to pull this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.340 
example here okay I'm going to pull this
back<00:02:11.959> even<00:02:12.470> more<00:02:12.849> and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
back even more and

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.310 
back even more and
now<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.500> should<00:02:14.950> have<00:02:15.130> everything<00:02:15.460> that<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.820> need

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
now I should have everything that I need

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.500 
now I should have everything that I need
the<00:02:17.320> step<00:02:17.770> two<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.310> want<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.940> look<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.390> little

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
the step two I want to look a little

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.660 
the step two I want to look a little
closer<00:02:19.810> at<00:02:20.020> one<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.200> these<00:02:20.320> waves<00:02:20.620> here<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.190> I

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
closer at one of these waves here and I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.690 
closer at one of these waves here and I
went<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.630> start<00:02:22.990> pad<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.500> be<00:02:23.710> as<00:02:23.950> low

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
went to the start pad to be as low

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.460 
went to the start pad to be as low
almost<00:02:25.330> as<00:02:25.660> low<00:02:25.810> as<00:02:25.930> it'll<00:02:26.110> go

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
almost as low as it'll go

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.300 
almost as low as it'll go
it<00:02:26.800> goes<00:02:26.980> from<00:02:27.190> 0<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.640> 19<00:02:28.240> seconds<00:02:28.750> here<00:02:29.050> or<00:02:29.650> 19

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
it goes from 0 to 19 seconds here or 19

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.850 
it goes from 0 to 19 seconds here or 19
milliseconds<00:02:31.000> that's<00:02:31.480> plenty<00:02:31.990> because<00:02:32.050> we're

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
milliseconds that's plenty because we're

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.290 
milliseconds that's plenty because we're
going<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.070> cut<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:33.460> one<00:02:33.520> in<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.850> same<00:02:34.030> place

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
going to cut this one in the same place

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.220 
going to cut this one in the same place
now<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.050> region<00:02:35.470> end<00:02:35.770> pad<00:02:36.010> I'm<00:02:36.400> going<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.230> zoom

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
now the region end pad I'm going to zoom

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.440 
now the region end pad I'm going to zoom
in<00:02:38.380> on<00:02:38.560> this<00:02:38.740> waveform<00:02:39.120> probably<00:02:40.120> not<00:02:40.300> the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
in on this waveform probably not the

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.940 
in on this waveform probably not the
best<00:02:40.480> example<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:41.170> look<00:02:41.290> at<00:02:41.470> let's<00:02:41.680> look<00:02:41.740> at

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
best example to look at let's look at

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.440 
best example to look at let's look at
this<00:02:42.130> this<00:02:42.430> one<00:02:42.640> right<00:02:42.730> here<00:02:42.940> we<00:02:43.090> want<00:02:43.270> it<00:02:43.300> to

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
this this one right here we want it to

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.720 
this this one right here we want it to
cut<00:02:43.600> off<00:02:43.720> before<00:02:44.560> this<00:02:44.770> high<00:02:44.950> hat<00:02:45.190> hits<00:02:45.430> here

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
cut off before this high hat hits here

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.560 
cut off before this high hat hits here
okay<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.810> now<00:02:47.320> let's<00:02:47.890> go<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.850> take<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.150> look<00:02:49.360> at

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
okay so now let's go and take a look at

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.890 
okay so now let's go and take a look at
it<00:02:49.720> okay<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.730> we<00:02:51.970> got<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.210> selected<00:02:52.360> there's

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
it okay so we got it selected there's

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.260 
it okay so we got it selected there's
the<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.770> region<00:02:54.310> start<00:02:54.580> pad<00:02:54.760> now<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.030> want<00:02:55.210> to

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
the the region start pad now I want to

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.010 
the the region start pad now I want to
set<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.570> end<00:02:55.720> pad<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.110> end<00:02:56.290> right<00:02:56.530> there<00:02:57.870> or<00:02:58.870> as

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
set the end pad to end right there or as

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.520 
set the end pad to end right there or as
close<00:02:59.140> as<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.500> can<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:01.000> looks<00:03:01.150> good<00:03:01.450> there<00:03:01.530> now

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
close as I can that looks good there now

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.940 
close as I can that looks good there now
what<00:03:02.740> I<00:03:02.770> want<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.160> do<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.610> extract<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.950> okay

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
what I want to do is extract it okay

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.550 
what I want to do is extract it okay
notice<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.550> snare<00:03:07.020> disappeared<00:03:08.080> okay

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
notice that the snare disappeared okay

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.010 
notice that the snare disappeared okay
now<00:03:08.800> leave<00:03:09.700> these<00:03:09.970> settings<00:03:10.210> in<00:03:10.600> and<00:03:10.810> select

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
now leave these settings in and select

now leave these settings in and select
the<00:03:11.260> bottom<00:03:11.440> track<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.040> now<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.220> want<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.610> strip

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
the bottom track and now I want to strip

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.970 
the bottom track and now I want to strip
it<00:03:13.090> now<00:03:13.810> what<00:03:13.990> we've<00:03:14.170> effectively<00:03:14.590> done<00:03:14.950> is

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
it now what we've effectively done is

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.640 
it now what we've effectively done is
separated<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.060> noise<00:03:16.330> from<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:17.350> snare

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
separated this noise from the snare

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.320 
separated this noise from the snare
track<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.100> want<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.490> to<00:03:18.580> hear<00:03:18.730> just<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.120> snare

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
track I want you to hear just the snare

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.620 
track I want you to hear just the snare

okay<00:03:25.630> I<00:03:25.870> know<00:03:26.170> there's<00:03:26.440> hi-hat<00:03:26.860> in<00:03:27.040> there<00:03:27.220> but

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
okay I know there's hi-hat in there but

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.770 
okay I know there's hi-hat in there but
this<00:03:27.550> will<00:03:27.700> give<00:03:27.850> you<00:03:27.970> options<00:03:28.420> this<00:03:28.540> gives

this will give you options this gives
you<00:03:28.870> options<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.320> trigger<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.250> little<00:03:30.370> bit<00:03:30.580> more

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
you options to trigger a little bit more

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.540 
you options to trigger a little bit more
accurately<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.800> when<00:03:32.800> you<00:03:32.890> add<00:03:33.070> it<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.280> this

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
accurately and when you add it to this

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.940 
accurately and when you add it to this
track<00:03:33.820> what<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.150> can<00:03:34.300> do<00:03:34.450> is<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:34.750> can<00:03:34.950> process

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
track what you can do is you can process

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.830 
track what you can do is you can process
these<00:03:36.160> differently<00:03:36.640> now<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:37.480> can<00:03:37.630> process

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
these differently now you can process

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.630 
these differently now you can process
this<00:03:38.230> maybe<00:03:38.530> with<00:03:38.710> just<00:03:38.740> a<00:03:39.040> little<00:03:39.280> less<00:03:39.400> highs

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
this maybe with just a little less highs

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.730 
this maybe with just a little less highs
on<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.570> can<00:03:40.690> process<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.290> with<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.560> little

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
on it you can process this with a little

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.290 
on it you can process this with a little
bit<00:03:41.830> more<00:03:41.980> highs<00:03:42.190> on<00:03:42.460> it<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:42.970> when<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.150> add

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
bit more highs on it and when you add

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.550 
bit more highs on it and when you add
them<00:03:43.450> together<00:03:43.570> it<00:03:43.930> should<00:03:44.110> sound<00:03:44.290> almost

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
them together it should sound almost

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.620 
them together it should sound almost
exactly<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.430> way<00:03:45.550> it<00:03:45.670> did<00:03:45.700> before<00:03:46.390> you

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
exactly the way it did before you

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.970 
exactly the way it did before you
stripped<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.050> out<00:03:47.140> except<00:03:47.500> you'll<00:03:47.590> have<00:03:47.770> more

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
stripped it out except you'll have more

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.870 
stripped it out except you'll have more
control<00:03:48.220> over<00:03:48.340> it

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
control over it

00:03:48.880 --> 00:04:04.160 
control over it
I'll<00:03:49.480> show<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.720> what<00:03:49.840> I'm<00:03:49.930> talking<00:03:49.990> about

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.750 

so<00:04:05.170> what<00:04:05.320> we've<00:04:05.470> done<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:05.920> taking<00:04:06.460> out<00:04:06.580> the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
so what we've done is taking out the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.940 
so what we've done is taking out the
noise<00:04:07.420> from<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:07.990> between<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.410> snares<00:04:08.680> if

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
noise from in between the snares if

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.100 
noise from in between the snares if
you'd<00:04:09.340> like<00:04:09.490> dozens<00:04:09.940> more<00:04:10.090> mixing<00:04:10.450> resources
