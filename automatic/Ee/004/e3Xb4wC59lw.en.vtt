00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Well, all friends, how are you? 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.230
 welcome to a new video tutorial and 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.510
 this time I wanted to show you how 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.940
 optimize and clean our computer 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.940
 with the program 'tilt 4 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.109
 [Music] 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.660
 It should be noted that this video is 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.240
 divided in two in the first let's 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.369
 see how to download the program how 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.800
 clean our computer and in the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.140
 second how to optimize our pc 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.000
 using his English to download it is 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.520
 simple we go to someone who is in 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.680
 the description of this video that is this 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.680
 link we choose our browser 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.870
 we open it 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.670
 [Music] 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.329
 as long as we're going to have to 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.350
 wait the 5 seconds are in the 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:01:00.760
 upper right sector 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.940
 we should skip advertising 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.220
 [Music] 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.510
 is going to take us to mega and from mega what 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.510
 we will be able to download 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.460
 but now it weighs more than 45 or megas and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.119
 we give in download and we will wait for 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.119
 that is downloaded 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.250
 [Music] 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.579
 as you can see I have an internet connection 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.330
 pretty fast so he downloaded 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.070
 very fast 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.350
 well once we download the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.060
 program is going to leave us a file 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.910
 winrar with which we will extract the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.610
 installer of the same good program 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.770
 once you are already downloading the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.110
 program that this installer gives us 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.340
 where do we do it downloaded button 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.750
 right to extract here 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.000
 is going to extract these two files 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.080
 [Music] 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.060
 we give the setup double click install it 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.780
 it's very simple we choose our language 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.070
 in this case next Spanish this what 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.070
 let's destine all 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.920
 we give you to install 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.620
 let's close the green version note 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.500
 and we're going to run the cycler 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.870
 version 4.3 the last one that came out at 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.760
 market then installed once the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.160
 program we are going to find with this 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.350
 interface is above me version 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.800
 program and the data of our 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.800
 computer 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.709
 and basically the interface is this 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.870
 what we are going to do now is going to 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.459
 be a quick clean for it 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.459
 We need to have our 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.510
 closed either football be chrome be 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.019
 internet explorer we have to close 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.160
 everything once we close all we 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:07.580
 let's go here in this bar as we see 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.680
 it's not going to figure everything out - 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.840
 saved passwords I recommend them 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.320
 leave only temporary files 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.110
 of internet that is editorial cookies url 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.670
 all these are those of xavi litemos in 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.740
 actually do not bother in our 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.890
 computer and do not let it weigh too 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.550
 It will be a few megabytes and the cookies 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.470
 the history are usually very necessary 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.450
 default saved passwords seems 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.040
 distilled but if they had it labeled 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.170
 as in going to a mistake, the only thing that 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.830
 we do is allocate it then take out 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.290
 programs 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.090
 and we also leave only the cache 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.879
 from Internet 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.590
 the rest we leave everything as it is and we 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.590
 let's run clean 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.230
 gives us this message that says this 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.710
 process will erase all files 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.170
 systems and we are sure we are going to 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.430
 say that yes erase is going to clean 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.379
 our computer 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.510
 let's speed up the video a little bit 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.510
 so that it is not so long 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.739
 very well 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.070
 already finished the program will have seen 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.540
 that the touch some excited they jumped to 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.990
 out on now because the chrome was 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.170
 open 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.560
 [Music] 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.380
 and as we see we just cleanup us 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.830
 just deleted 2000 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.770
 11 mb or 2 gigs of information we 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.620
 just erase and if we see the trash 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.050
 recycle that I barely had 4 megabytes 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.830
 temporary internet files 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:51.690
 arrives and a half and the internet cache 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:54.240
 chrome 3 369 megabytes or we're going to do 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.430
 a pretty deep cleaning to our 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.430
 We will clean it again 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.110
 and you would be clean for the next 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.810
 part of the video that is going to be how 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.160
 optimize our pc with this program 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:13.770
 I recommend every click on it 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.230
 little button that appears here go to 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.300
 see what it says go the next video we 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.330
 go to the next video and they will 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.220
 will be able to know how to optimize 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.260
 our computer with this program 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.690
 that we are going to leave a lot more 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.440
 fast used in such a basic program 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.600
 how many people will be created because they will not 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.250
 everything exists together and we are taught this 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.670
 now I explain it at the end of 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.440
 video many people already know how to use the 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.600
 cleaner of that clean energy knows how 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.180
 download it and install it but do not know 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.400
 how to optimize these people is guess 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.140
 has automatically gone to the video how 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.630
 optimize our computer with cic lean 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.640
 because they probably did not know 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.520
 but there are many people who do not know how 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.410
 download it and how to use the cleaner 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.260
 well in this case I already showed you how 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.860
 well see you in the next video that 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.239
 I leave you after this one 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.239
 [Music] 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.810
 once 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.180
 but no 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.259
 good 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.259
 [Music] 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.760
 no no 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.429
 [Music] 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.429
 [Applause]
