lap I think quite a few TC if I might
add<00:03:07.579> we<00:03:08.579> still<00:03:08.909> can't<00:03:09.150> make<00:03:09.329> up<00:03:09.510> our<00:03:09.629> mind

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
add we still can't make up our mind

about whether this display really comes
in<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.329> reflective<00:03:12.870> category<00:03:13.349> or<00:03:13.829> not

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
in the reflective category or not

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.379 
in the reflective category or not
because<00:03:15.829> white<00:03:16.829> probably<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.819> a<00:03:17.849> major

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
because white probably is a major

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.330 
because white probably is a major
display<00:03:19.049> which<00:03:19.379> was<00:03:19.560> not<00:03:19.709> reflective<00:03:20.220> and

display which was not reflective and

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.920 
display which was not reflective and
then<00:03:20.459> decided<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:20.970> just<00:03:21.239> have<00:03:21.389> a<00:03:21.419> little<00:03:21.599> fun

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
then decided to just have a little fun

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.680 
then decided to just have a little fun
and<00:03:22.260> confuse<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.889> reviewers<00:03:23.280> possibly<00:03:24.239> you

and confuse the reviewers possibly you

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.930 
and confuse the reviewers possibly you
never<00:03:24.900> know<00:03:25.079> because<00:03:25.769> this<00:03:26.129> one<00:03:26.400> looks<00:03:26.849> the

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.449 
this is an excellent display in our test
this<00:03:57.419> laptop<00:03:57.720> gave<00:03:58.470> us<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.739> battery<00:03:59.069> life<00:03:59.250> of

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
this laptop gave us a battery life of

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.890 
this laptop gave us a battery life of
two<00:03:59.669> are<00:03:59.849> some<00:04:00.120> full<00:04:00.329> charge<00:04:00.599> to<00:04:00.720> full

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
two are some full charge to full

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.289 
two are some full charge to full
discharge<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.739> was<00:04:02.010> would<00:04:02.310> display<00:04:02.790> on<00:04:03.030> all

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
discharge that was would display on all

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.470 
discharge that was would display on all
the<00:04:03.599> time<00:04:03.780> at<00:04:04.230> full<00:04:04.590> brightness<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.480> Wi-Fi

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
the time at full brightness and Wi-Fi

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.879 
the time at full brightness and Wi-Fi
connected<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.079> background<00:04:07.500> we<00:04:07.620> had<00:04:07.859> a

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
connected in the background we had a

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.379 
connected in the background we had a
benchmark<00:04:08.430> test<00:04:08.609> running<00:04:08.819> in<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.180> scenario

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
benchmark test running in that scenario

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.509 
benchmark test running in that scenario
with<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.079> hype<00:04:10.229> high<00:04:10.500> performance<00:04:11.040> mode<00:04:11.250> set

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
with the hype high performance mode set

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.550 
with the hype high performance mode set
for<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.879> path<00:04:12.870> settings<00:04:14.209> however<00:04:15.209> if<00:04:16.049> you

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
for the path settings however if you

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.920 
for the path settings however if you
translate<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:17.039> into<00:04:17.459> real-life<00:04:17.880> usage<00:04:18.120> that

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
translate that into real-life usage that

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.110 
translate that into real-life usage that
could<00:04:19.139> easily<00:04:19.380> double<00:04:19.739> because<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.579> will

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
could easily double because you will

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.820 
could easily double because you will
probably<00:04:21.359> not<00:04:21.750> be<00:04:21.810> using<00:04:22.229> this<00:04:22.380> display<00:04:22.770> at

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
probably not be using this display at

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.459 
probably not be using this display at
full<00:04:23.070> brightness<00:04:23.159> all<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.760> time<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:25.289> you

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
full brightness all the time and you

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:26.780 
full brightness all the time and you
will<00:04:25.560> probably<00:04:25.710> not<00:04:26.010> have<00:04:26.190> Wi-Fi

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
will probably not have Wi-Fi

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.580 
will probably not have Wi-Fi
all<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.570> time<00:04:27.750> which<00:04:27.930> are<00:04:28.080> on<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.410> move

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
all the time which are on the move

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.620 
all the time which are on the move
typing<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.160> document<00:04:29.190> or<00:04:29.640> something<00:04:30.000> you

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
typing a document or something you

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.990 
typing a document or something you
probably<00:04:30.960> won't<00:04:31.170> be<00:04:31.320> using<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:32.010> four

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
probably won't be using that so four

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.690 
probably won't be using that so four
hours<00:04:33.240> from<00:04:34.170> this<00:04:34.410> one<00:04:34.680> good<00:04:35.550> enough

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
hours from this one good enough

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.400 
hours from this one good enough
considering<00:04:36.420> the<00:04:36.540> power<00:04:36.690> package<00:04:37.080> on<00:04:37.230> this

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
considering the power package on this

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.290 
considering the power package on this
this<00:04:37.680> is<00:04:37.860> not<00:04:38.010> an<00:04:38.130> ultrabook<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:38.970> then<00:04:39.180> again

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
this is not an ultrabook but then again

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.450 
this is not an ultrabook but then again
this<00:04:39.660> machine<00:04:39.990> never<00:04:40.260> really<00:04:40.650> had<00:04:40.830> ambitions

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
this machine never really had ambitions

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.110 
this machine never really had ambitions
of<00:04:41.580> doing<00:04:41.790> that<00:04:42.830> for<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.890> price<00:04:44.100> of<00:04:44.160> under<00:04:44.520> 40k

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
of doing that for a price of under 40k

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.390 
of doing that for a price of under 40k
we<00:04:45.840> personally<00:04:46.350> believe<00:04:46.650> this<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.040> machine

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
we personally believe this is a machine

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.370 
we personally believe this is a machine
which<00:04:47.670> is<00:04:47.820> very<00:04:48.180> very<00:04:48.420> powerful<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:49.170> you

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
which is very very powerful and you

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.290 
which is very very powerful and you
should<00:04:49.590> definitely<00:04:50.220> check<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:50.580> out<00:04:50.760> you

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
should definitely check this out you

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.060 
should definitely check this out you
probably<00:04:51.660> will<00:04:52.110> get<00:04:52.290> more<00:04:52.470> power<00:04:52.740> than<00:04:52.950> what

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
probably will get more power than what

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.100 
probably will get more power than what
you<00:04:53.220> bargained<00:04:53.250> for<00:04:53.670> but<00:04:54.540> then<00:04:54.690> again<00:04:54.810> that's

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
you bargained for but then again that's

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.470 
you bargained for but then again that's
just<00:04:55.710> being<00:04:55.890> future-ready<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:56.970> bit<00:04:57.180> future

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
just being future-ready and a bit future

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.900 
just being future-ready and a bit future
proof

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.179
