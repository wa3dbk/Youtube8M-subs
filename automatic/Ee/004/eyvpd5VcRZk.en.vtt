 Hi, I'm Camilla and I'll show you a creative way to use paper lanterns and confetti 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.200
 to reveal the sex of the baby during your baby shower 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.500
 You will need: 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.360
 To decorate the lanterns, cut 4 to 6 strips of crepe paper 4 centimeters wide 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.380
 Cut the fringes on one side of the paper, every half a centimeter 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.480
 But cut only the ends, otherwise the cop will break 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.670
 Take the paper lantern and place the wire inside to form 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.120
 Glue together long pieces of double-sided tape from top to bottom of the flashlight 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.360
 Make sure they are securely fastened. Wrap the crepe strips, already cut with 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.180
 fringes, in the spiral lantern, from bottom to top 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.140
 After pasting the paper, use one more tape just to make sure it will not fall out. 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 For a combined diaper cake, click the tutorial link at the end of the video 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.469
 Release fringes of crepe paper to look really cute and fun 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.630
 Now it's time to make a special flashlight to reveal the baby's sex 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.549
 Cut a circle of buttered paper about 10 centimeters 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.509
 The circle should be slightly larger than the flashlight hole 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.939
 Glue a piece of string on the matte side of the foil 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.249
 Cut two slits on opposite sides of the paper circle so that it can fit into the frame 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:30.469
 of lantern wire Fit the circle with the side of the string 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:36.490
 on the underside of the flashlight. Snap the corners together with a spoon to 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.579
 Make sure the confetti will not escape Buy confetti in the colors you have chosen 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.849
 for your party You're going to need a couple of handfuls of 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.369
 Confetti to fill the lantern Hang the lantern on top for the 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.749
 Dad and Mom can be well underneath it. At the end of the party, the guests gather 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:59.639
 around the lantern, while future parents pull the tape attached to the underside 

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:03.099
 of the lantern, thus announcing the sex of the baby with the confetti 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:08.099
 This is a super fun way to make the big ad 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.150
