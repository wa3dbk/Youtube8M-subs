00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.540
 Hello everyone guys, but that's a pity. what 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.650
 we recently did who have not seen see 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.930
 here here 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.599
 but today I want to test it on 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.990
 maximum star speed principle 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:20.380
 here the front is worth 14k rear 37 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.390
 if you set the principle of 15 16 then 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.980
 one could achieve a little bit more 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.589
 speeds but we will test today 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.989
 and this is how we all have something 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:31.089
 On this reeds these little ride like 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.760
 what engine would be normal bodrenky 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.530
 I like the rear suspension broken already 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.449
 flou can see that the mats but the back already 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.820
 almost curved front suspension 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.660
 seems to be more or less normal but all 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.850
 well let's say so little gets from my 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.429
 grandfather because the owner rides him 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.250
 fields everyone there where necessary and not necessary 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:54.390
 Generally the load on the suspension here I 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 so understood serious 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.780
 What is your self are our indicators 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.000
 as you can see the speedometer can be a little bit 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.560
 Maximal speed seems to be his 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.480
 seventy six kilometers per hour but i 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.250
 so plainly on gps looked on because 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.550
 I need to look at the track as you can see 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.580
 we have a little bit but still landfill 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.680
 76 for stop 10 vat moped this 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.380
 let's say a little bit so if 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.380
 install as i said earlier 15 16 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.390
 a star can be achieved a little 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.610
 More speed, but in principle, if 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.020
 he has a grandfather and he does not need it 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.730
 and maximum speed is his main 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.760
 so that something can be back there 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.800
 trailer or put it we I 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.420
 of course or bring something home in general 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.120
 something shorter how grandpa didn't tell him 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.950
 the main thing here so here well well guys 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.790

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.100
