as either cheese horribly or play
incredibly<00:00:03.270> well<00:00:03.419> because<00:00:03.720> they<00:00:03.870> know<00:00:04.020> the

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
incredibly well because they know the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:15.860 
incredibly well because they know the
game<00:00:04.290> inside<00:00:04.620> out<00:00:13.820> TBT<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.000> hard<00:00:15.330> because<00:00:15.630> it

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
game inside out TBT is hard because it

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.580 
game inside out TBT is hard because it
generally<00:00:16.199> comes<00:00:16.410> down<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.710> tanks<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:18.590> when

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
generally comes down to tanks and when

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.109 
generally comes down to tanks and when
there<00:00:19.770> are<00:00:19.890> tanks<00:00:20.189> there<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> possibility

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
there are tanks there is the possibility

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.599 
there are tanks there is the possibility
for<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.289> dive<00:00:22.529> horribly<00:00:23.010> by<00:00:23.250> wandering

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
for you to dive horribly by wandering

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.279 
for you to dive horribly by wandering
into<00:00:23.880> them<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.300> then<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.810> immediately

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
into them and then get immediately

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.290 
into them and then get immediately
killed<00:00:25.650> also<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> tendency<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.029> allow

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
killed also I have a tendency to allow

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.790 
killed also I have a tendency to allow
myself<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.689> get<00:00:27.779> contained<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:28.619> really

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
myself to get contained and I'm really

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.200 
myself to get contained and I'm really
about<00:00:29.010> breaking<00:00:29.400> out<00:00:29.519> contained<00:00:29.880> sort<00:00:30.119> of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
about breaking out contained sort of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.350 
about breaking out contained sort of
lose<00:00:30.449> right<00:00:30.779> then<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.140> there<00:00:32.180> that's<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
lose right then and there that's the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.660 
lose right then and there that's the
main<00:00:33.570> problem<00:00:33.719> tvt<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> while<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.460> wasn't

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
main problem tvt for a while it wasn't

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.250

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
I've learned to like tanks more now that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.109 
I've learned to like tanks more now that
I<00:01:13.710> learned<00:01:13.979> about<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.310> queueing<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.729> commands

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
I learned about the queueing of commands

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
I learned about the queueing of commands
that<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:16.020> something<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.439> didn't<00:01:16.710> know<00:01:16.770> how<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that was something I didn't know how to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.170 
that was something I didn't know how to
do<00:01:17.159> once<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.520> learned<00:01:17.700> how<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.030> that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
do once I learned how to do that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.450 
do once I learned how to do that
suddenly<00:01:18.600> tanks<00:01:19.560> were<00:01:19.740> easier<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.310> control

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
suddenly tanks were easier to control

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.140 
suddenly tanks were easier to control
and<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.909> built<00:01:21.150> more<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.420> them<00:01:21.600> but

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
and I built more of them but

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.219 
and I built more of them but
unfortunately<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> tendency<00:01:25.080> of

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
unfortunately I have a tendency of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.970 
unfortunately I have a tendency of
walking<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.650> tank<00:01:25.890> shells<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.640> doesn't
