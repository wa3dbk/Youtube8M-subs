 hello hello teddy bear friends 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.610

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:37.100
 good day here we are on the map says 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.070

 in short his debt and in germany and we 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.780
 are in high art 39 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.530
 so I'm not alone you have 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.829
 the badge of honor 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.989
 especially me to be accompanied by our 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.059
 youtuber my favorite drug 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.629
 we're both in has raised 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.719
 39 because my voice there we know we got 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:04.280
 Trapped by sirens from a subscriber 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:06.860
 as well as currently at egg 155 which 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.679
 do not stop raving about this tank so 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.950
 we went to pick him up and my 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:17.390
 faith is long it's long and it's not 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.580
 that's it and it's not easy on your rlb 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.259
 tron must tell you that it's not my 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.360
 char prefer not to say right now 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.790
 like that it's done and we 'll talk about it 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.439
 more so why this part then 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.670
 that I do not like it dearly because 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.790
 it'll allow me maybe to me 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.790
 get rid of 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.880
 on the one hand because I'm not very 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:42.979
 far from moving on to the next who from tatane 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.830
 x 46 and that low as I am a little 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.690
 beast I challenge myself so I 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.259
 long rounds that I have no right 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.320
 a jean bart so let's go back to this sacred 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.680
 richard eyre high 39 1 french and 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.270
 thanks to its magnificent locarn 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.100
 it's not a cannon it's a sting 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.580
 finally it's very weird this thing 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.840
 good brief cart 6 so he has when 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.420
 even several cannons there is a cannon 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.190
 which goes from 3 to 8 hours the imagined between 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.280
 the little gun 3 that was firing was 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.860
 almost 17 short 17 minute hits and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.230
 the last who draws that if 67 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.310
 you have margin so the last 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.700
 190 mm the cdcr 45 and it is this one that 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.430
 you must have the canary chinaud 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.590
 Renault renault twingo but renault and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.810
 caterpillars down the caterpillars that 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.450
 serve to overcome a short cat a thing 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:42.230
 that you put below the map 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:45.260
 pass and motorcycles 42 km like this one has 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.910
 had done well enough for him so at this 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.760
 that announced the cannons at a 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.820
 dispersion of 0.36 the proof that's 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.980
 second when you are that penetration 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.680
 and the damage abbas has done harm 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.890
 212 240 when you are in standard 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.350
 otherwise the penetration and 259 for 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.840
 o'shea damage of 140 so it's up to you to 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.760
 to choose 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.370
 So here we go on this map 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.620
 rather to the left and td so we 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.709
 is hiding and then we try to see what 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.760
 is happening here for now they 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:23.390
 are far enough away and we leave it to 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.090
 bones and averages on their job me 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.829
 I'm waiting because I do not know how 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.130
 they play and try to charge 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.959
 in assault it works thought exploded because 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.030
 that in fact it moves pretty bad even 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.519
 if he has a great gun but what is 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.750
 very very cool tone with what announced 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.890
 in fact 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.130
 ben are in foreign currency and 2009 has 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.840
 almost no three seconds between 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.520
 two shots what are you sending a who 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.900
 you arrive on it you find the living room 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.530
 dining room as ben the footix 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.560
 finally these prices cook anyway so 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.310
 we monitor 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.170
 usually we have time to see them 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.640
 come on the left and for that we 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.640
 walked along the railway 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.310
 we are not very very many a 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:19.430
 to have 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:25.370
 we'll see what's going on this attack 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.810
 on the side of the carousel manage and especially he 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.020
 there is the only second coffee to you from the 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.930
 find because the game was 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:38.150
 do not want the central Athens cafe 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.760
 love it so that's the job of t &amp; d ben 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.669
 you spend a lot of time 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.960
 Ben here are carpets in Taipei Acropolis 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.650
 movement there the ps had it 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.300
 I will try to see what we can 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.180
 to do on this tackle kbs 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.770
 it's still strong these animals there 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:59.900
 very good very good tanks what had 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:05.300
 to those who own it do not 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:08.020
 will not deny we obviously have that 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.020
 come home anyway huh 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.320
 where it does not fit is sometimes we miss 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.360
 but he did not miss the other so 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.090
 we are less numerous 20 to the rest of the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.690
 arts small ball kbs but that is not very 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.000
 in shape 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.850
 but we make it so that it is 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.730
 let alone his hair there he is more 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.650
 in shape so it's healthy their electo and 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.860
 keep arty so usually the 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:38.650
 artists often on seven cases it's either 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:42.100
 nothing in itself if it is 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.110
 completely up the hill in kaka 0 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.820
 me it's often the positioning of 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.240
 articles when I have a part on this 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.770
 map 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:56.530
 it can not be where I put myself the position 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:59.350
 median cassis and blackcurrant and the most 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.230
 safe you have time to see coming 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.630
 finally provided you also have a hymn 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:08.140
 arty who goes fast so a French you 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.520
 in English finally an English out 5 6 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.060
 1 because it's now it's not 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.820
 very good here we are with whom and bah 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.940
 yeah with the league that down there the 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:23.890
 many bones he will turn it accurate 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:27.790
 try to finish the front and then that's it 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:31.720
 there I begin to be here or there I am 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:34.690
 hot then at the same time I'm happy 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.270
 because I had 4 we could all 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.400
 both and at the same time a bit feverish 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:45.100
 because I say to myself I have maybe 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:48.460
 the opportunity maybe to make a 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.720
 master of rank 1 or better and that it 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.400
 might allow me to move on to 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.700
 something else so here I am less at 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.760
 comfortable well I still balrog it's 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.830
 still more reassuring is that this 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.220
 so are two items so it's a 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:05.080
 little better so I tell myself 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.700
 prudence caution and that's where we 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.700
 starts to play badly that's classic 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.840
 we are coming forward ah ah 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.520
 he spotted via spots and our article 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.710
 who actually up there 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.480
 the 41 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:25.000
 and he has well descended the respect that 3 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:28.750
 and I finished it so we can say that 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.810
 this artist was rather for him and 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:35.440
 I will try to grab the other one 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:39.090
 where there has been so blackcurrant or Ogien of 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:42.670
 hanau she is there me all that for me 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.690
 wrong at this time it's me because 

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.700
 that he will have time to shoot me 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:49.150
 or month he had time to shoot me 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.130
 above a direct shot but sure and I have it 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.870
 had 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.690
 here we go, we've survived all 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.070
 two guys and rigaud is happy 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:00.670
 I had six of warrior anchovies and 

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:03.040
 then in fact I will be able to have my 

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.080
 a sign of mastery 1 and there I am 

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.240
 very happy 

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.930
 so that's the end for real concrete 9 

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:13.800
 and next time to our cat 

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.800
 Gentlemen, I salute you very well
