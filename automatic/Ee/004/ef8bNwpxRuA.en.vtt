really hard to hit though obviously

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.740 
really hard to hit though obviously
because<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.790> can't<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.119> further<00:01:12.360> going

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
because you can't see further going

because you can't see further going
there<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.869> if<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:15.960> whip<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.320> our

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
there we go so if we whip out our

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.399 
there we go so if we whip out our
shotgun<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> one-shot<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:18.409> most

shotgun here this is a one-shot on most

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.880 
shotgun here this is a one-shot on most
at<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:20.070> most<00:01:20.369> things<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.450> mobs<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.650> it

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
at on most things on mobs it's not it

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.190 
at on most things on mobs it's not it
doesn't<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.250> 10<00:01:23.430> hearts<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.049> can

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
doesn't do 10 hearts and then if we can

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.539

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
wear a silver ifonly start right click

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.569 
wear a silver ifonly start right click
or<00:01:26.970> am<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:28.110> right<00:01:28.229> clicking<00:01:28.500> yeah<00:01:29.369> it'll

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
or am I think right clicking yeah it'll

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.280 
or am I think right clicking yeah it'll
start<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.119> start<00:01:30.390> using<00:01:30.509> our<00:01:30.659> ammo<00:01:30.960> i<00:01:30.990> think

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
start and start using our ammo i think

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
start and start using our ammo i think
so<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.670> into<00:01:32.820> game<00:01:33.119> mode<00:01:36.740> s-see<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.970> see

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
so if we go into game mode s-see you see

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
so if we go into game mode s-see you see
it<00:01:39.240> start<00:01:39.450> using<00:01:39.600> our<00:01:39.720> ammo<00:01:41.479> just<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.630> shot<00:01:43.820> so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
it start using our ammo just one shot so

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.800 
it start using our ammo just one shot so
you<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.240> keep<00:01:45.390> holding<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.720> and

you just have to keep holding it and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.510 
you just have to keep holding it and
then<00:01:45.930> you'll<00:01:46.049> hit<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.259> eventually<00:01:46.520> chance

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
then you'll hit it eventually chance
