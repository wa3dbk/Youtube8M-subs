00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
this film is the fact that it's not as

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
was gonna become which I'm and I'm very

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.170

happy<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.580> didn't<00:01:23.790> happen<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
happy that that didn't happen and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.289 
happy that that didn't happen and
granted<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.439> did<00:01:25.710> adapt<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> heavily<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
granted they did adapt it heavily and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
granted they did adapt it heavily and
especially<00:01:27.780> with<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.770> lore<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
especially with all the lore and the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.190 
especially with all the lore and the
supernatural<00:01:29.880> elements<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.750> think<00:01:30.990> that's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
supernatural elements but I think that's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.719 
supernatural elements but I think that's
for<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> audience<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.130> they<00:01:32.400> wanted<00:01:32.640> to

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
for the audience I think they wanted to

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
for the audience I think they wanted to
bring<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.119> transformers<00:01:33.810> audience<00:01:34.170> that

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
bring in the transformers audience that

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.800 
bring in the transformers audience that
kids<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.860> mean<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.340> pg-13<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:36.299> there's<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
kids I mean it is pg-13 they there's a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.120 
kids I mean it is pg-13 they there's a
good<00:01:37.020> could've<00:01:37.229> been<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.350> bloody<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.040> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
good could've been very bloody and it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
good could've been very bloody and it
definitely<00:01:38.280> wasn't<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:39.360> they<00:01:39.509> cut<00:01:39.659> away

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
definitely wasn't right they cut away

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.819 
definitely wasn't right they cut away
from<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.079> cut<00:01:40.200> away<00:01:40.290> there's<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> lot<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
from they cut away there's not a lot of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.109 
from they cut away there's not a lot of
that<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.400> was<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.850> bring<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
that I think that was just to bring in a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.580 
that I think that was just to bring in a
bigger<00:01:42.299> audience<00:01:42.450> hindered<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.320> don't

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
bigger audience hindered it I don't

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.200 
bigger audience hindered it I don't
agree<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.159> think<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:44.850> you're<00:01:44.939> gonna<00:01:45.030> have

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:51.080 

I'm<00:02:42.660> looking<00:02:43.050> for<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> half-breed

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:59.410 

good<00:02:51.630> luck<00:02:51.900> Samurai

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.260 

what<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:00.290> did<00:03:00.590> like<00:03:00.800> is<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.490> Japanese<00:03:01.880> actors

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
what I did like is the Japanese actors

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.790 
what I did like is the Japanese actors
here<00:03:02.510> they're<00:03:02.840> speaking<00:03:03.080> in<00:03:03.290> English<00:03:03.620> and

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
here they're speaking in English and

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.440 
here they're speaking in English and
sometimes<00:03:04.010> with<00:03:04.489> Japanese<00:03:04.849> actors<00:03:05.209> the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
sometimes with Japanese actors the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.000 
sometimes with Japanese actors the
accents<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.959> little<00:03:06.140> bit<00:03:06.230> thick<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.680> little<00:03:06.920> bit

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
accents a little bit thick a little bit

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.080 
accents a little bit thick a little bit
hard<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.220> understand<00:03:07.610> but<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.819> thought<00:03:08.000> they

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
hard to understand but I thought they

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.030 
hard to understand but I thought they
did<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.270> really<00:03:08.330> good<00:03:08.480> job<00:03:08.599> and<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.530> reason<00:03:09.830> is

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
did a really good job and the reason is

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.320 
did a really good job and the reason is
because<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.430> director<00:03:10.790> had<00:03:10.970> all<00:03:11.209> the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
because the director had all the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.000 
because the director had all the
Japanese<00:03:11.720> actors<00:03:12.080> do<00:03:12.470> their<00:03:12.620> takes<00:03:12.860> and

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
Japanese actors do their takes and

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.559 
Japanese actors do their takes and
Japanese<00:03:13.370> first<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.120> they<00:03:14.239> could<00:03:14.390> get<00:03:14.480> the

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
Japanese first so they could get the

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.510 
Japanese first so they could get the
inflection<00:03:15.080> in<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.260> nuance<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.860> then<00:03:16.280> have

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
inflection in the nuance and then have

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.770 
inflection in the nuance and then have
them<00:03:16.640> do<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:16.850> in<00:03:16.940> English<00:03:17.239> which<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.540> thought<00:03:17.690> it

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
them do it in English which I thought it

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.400 
them do it in English which I thought it
worked<00:03:17.930> really<00:03:18.050> well

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
worked really well

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.160 
worked really well

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
many do they have to add because he has

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.949 
many do they have to add because he has
such<00:03:36.920> an<00:03:37.010> appreciation<00:03:37.250> for<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.910> culture<00:03:38.360> he

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
such an appreciation for the culture he

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:39.699 
such an appreciation for the culture he
read<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.260> script

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
read the script

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:40.720 
read the script
he<00:03:39.890> knew<00:03:40.010> who's<00:03:40.130> gonna<00:03:40.280> be<00:03:40.340> brought<00:03:40.519> on

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
he knew who's gonna be brought on

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.220 
he knew who's gonna be brought on
because<00:03:40.910> he's<00:03:41.209> Keanu<00:03:41.450> Reeves<00:03:41.690> but<00:03:41.900> he's<00:03:42.080> like

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
because he's Keanu Reeves but he's like

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.259 
because he's Keanu Reeves but he's like
no<00:03:42.440> this<00:03:42.739> is<00:03:43.069> this<00:03:43.549> is<00:03:43.670> about<00:03:43.819> Japanese

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
no this is this is about Japanese

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.970 
no this is this is about Japanese
characters<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.930> shouldn't<00:03:45.200> be<00:03:45.290> my<00:03:45.470> movie<00:03:45.769> so<00:03:45.950> I

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
characters it shouldn't be my movie so I

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.770 
characters it shouldn't be my movie so I
think<00:03:46.160> he<00:03:46.400> probably<00:03:46.489> toned<00:03:46.850> his<00:03:46.970> role<00:03:47.540> down<00:03:47.750> a

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
think he probably toned his role down a

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.570 
think he probably toned his role down a
little<00:03:48.049> bit<00:03:48.230> in<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.709> studio<00:03:49.069> maybe<00:03:49.370> was

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
little bit in the studio maybe was

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.550 
little bit in the studio maybe was
saying<00:03:50.090> no<00:03:50.299> you<00:03:50.600> need<00:03:50.720> to<00:03:50.750> do<00:03:51.260> might<00:03:51.470> have

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
saying no you need to do might have

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.650 
saying no you need to do might have
toned<00:03:51.799> it<00:03:51.920> down<00:03:51.950> for<00:03:52.370> him<00:03:52.519> my<00:03:53.180> problem<00:03:53.540> with

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
toned it down for him my problem with

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.120 
toned it down for him my problem with
the<00:03:53.750> directing<00:03:54.170> but<00:03:54.380> which<00:03:54.560> is<00:03:54.709> by<00:03:54.830> Carl

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
the directing but which is by Carl

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.699 
the directing but which is by Carl
Rinsch<00:03:55.340> is<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.900> seems<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.290> be<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.500> lot<00:03:57.680> of

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
Rinsch is that it seems to be a lot of

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.199 
Rinsch is that it seems to be a lot of
posing<00:03:58.190> there's<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.430> lot<00:03:58.549> of<00:03:58.670> just<00:03:58.819> stoic

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
posing there's a lot of just stoic

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.210 
posing there's a lot of just stoic
posing<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:00.860> know<00:04:00.950> there's<00:04:01.160> a

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
posing so that you know there's a

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.340 
posing so that you know there's a
tableau<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:01.880> looks<00:04:02.060> pretty<00:04:02.360> but<00:04:02.810> nothing

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
tableau and it looks pretty but nothing

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.150 
tableau and it looks pretty but nothing
seemed<00:04:03.620> natural

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
seemed natural

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.610 
seemed natural
it<00:04:04.400> just<00:04:04.640> seems<00:04:04.820> all<00:04:05.030> unnatural<00:04:05.620> particularly

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
it just seems all unnatural particularly

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.349 
it just seems all unnatural particularly
since<00:04:06.859> the<00:04:07.040> script<00:04:07.370> has<00:04:07.670> very<00:04:07.910> realistic

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
since the script has very realistic

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:09.759 
since the script has very realistic
dialogue<00:04:08.720> we<00:04:08.900> we<00:04:09.109> don't<00:04:09.260> we're<00:04:09.410> not<00:04:09.440> weighed

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
dialogue we we don't we're not weighed

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.830 
dialogue we we don't we're not weighed
down<00:04:09.799> in<00:04:10.250> proverbs<00:04:10.760> right<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.480> we<00:04:11.570> have<00:04:11.720> this

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
down in proverbs right so we have this

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.509 
down in proverbs right so we have this
realistic<00:04:12.380> story<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.950> then<00:04:13.100> but<00:04:13.280> we<00:04:13.370> still

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
realistic story and then but we still

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
here because I thought there are some

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
some great dialogue at times but then

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.930 
some great dialogue at times but then
there<00:04:43.160> are<00:04:43.190> other<00:04:43.340> things<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.610> were<00:04:43.760> quite

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
there are other things that were quite

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
obvious were these two made I did

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.900 
obvious were these two made I did
however<00:04:48.289> think<00:04:48.680> that<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:49.100> was<00:04:49.220> beautiful<00:04:49.760> as

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
however think that it was beautiful as

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.450 
however think that it was beautiful as
effervescent<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:50.870> very<00:04:51.410> lush<00:04:51.680> unfortunately
