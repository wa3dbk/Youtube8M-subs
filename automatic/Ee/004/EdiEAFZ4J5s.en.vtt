that we could take our grandchildren

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.910 
that we could take our grandchildren
away<00:00:13.379> with<00:00:13.619> us<00:00:13.770> I<00:00:14.779> hope<00:00:15.779> that<00:00:16.170> you're<00:00:16.710> going<00:00:16.890> to

away with us I hope that you're going to
enjoy<00:00:17.310> using<00:00:18.180> yours<00:00:18.740> before<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:20.100> use<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.369> for

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
enjoy using yours before you use it for

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.999 
enjoy using yours before you use it for
the<00:00:20.759> first<00:00:20.970> time<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.259> to<00:00:22.439> fit<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.800> into

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
the first time we have to fit it into

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.060 
the first time we have to fit it into
your<00:00:23.310> vehicle<00:00:23.990> it's<00:00:24.990> very<00:00:25.199> simple<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.949> only

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
your vehicle it's very simple it only

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.759 
your vehicle it's very simple it only
takes<00:00:26.429> two<00:00:26.730> tools<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.419> is<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:28.259> level<00:00:28.499> your

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
takes two tools one is to level your

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.710 
takes two tools one is to level your
vehicle<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.339> to<00:00:29.820> check<00:00:30.089> that<00:00:30.269> you've<00:00:30.449> leveled

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
vehicle and to check that you've leveled

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.520 
vehicle and to check that you've leveled
the<00:00:31.140> Caban<00:00:31.560> pole<00:00:31.890> afterwards<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.470> a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the Caban pole afterwards and one is a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.250 
the Caban pole afterwards and one is a
crosshead<00:00:35.070> screwdriver<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.930> couldn't<00:00:37.200> be

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
crosshead screwdriver so it couldn't be

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.580 
crosshead screwdriver so it couldn't be
simpler<00:00:37.650> and<00:00:38.370> those<00:00:38.720> parts<00:00:39.720> to<00:00:39.990> install<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
simpler and those parts to install it

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.220 
simpler and those parts to install it
for<00:00:40.740> the<00:00:40.800> first<00:00:41.040> time<00:00:41.340> will<00:00:41.640> take<00:00:42.230> 15-20

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
for the first time will take 15-20

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.910 
for the first time will take 15-20
minutes<00:00:43.560> and<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:44.400> you<00:00:44.550> set<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.920> holidays

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
minutes and then you set up for holidays

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.590 
minutes and then you set up for holidays
for<00:00:47.340> years<00:00:47.580> to<00:00:47.790> come<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.470> then<00:00:50.100> in

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
for years to come and you can then in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
for years to come and you can then in
fit<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.810> car<00:00:51.990> bunk<00:00:52.200> each<00:00:52.410> evening<00:00:52.740> and<00:00:53.550> it'll

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
fit the car bunk each evening and it'll

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.680 
fit the car bunk each evening and it'll
take<00:00:54.000> 25<00:00:54.570> seconds<00:00:55.200> maximum

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.770 

now<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> first<00:01:01.800> thing<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.520> being<00:01:03.180> motorhome

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
now the first thing and being motorhome

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.299 
now the first thing and being motorhome
as<00:01:03.960> yourselves<00:01:04.379> you'll<00:01:04.680> understand<00:01:05.190> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
as yourselves you'll understand the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
as yourselves you'll understand the
importance<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.960> start

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
importance of this you have to start

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.680 
importance of this you have to start
with<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> level<00:01:07.890> vehicle<00:01:08.450> because<00:01:09.450> otherwise

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
with a level vehicle because otherwise

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.740 
with a level vehicle because otherwise
if<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.260> fit<00:01:10.440> it<00:01:10.620> with<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.580> non<00:01:12.120> level<00:01:12.479> vehicle

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
if you fit it with a non level vehicle

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.710 
if you fit it with a non level vehicle
your<00:01:13.200> bunk<00:01:13.440> is<00:01:13.650> forever<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.520> late<00:01:14.850> at

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
your bunk is forever going to be late at

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.280 
your bunk is forever going to be late at
a<00:01:15.900> crazy<00:01:16.140> angle<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.460> use<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> surface<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.020> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
a crazy angle so use a surface that you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.070 
a crazy angle so use a surface that you
trust<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> spirit<00:01:20.280> level<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.080> check

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
trust on a spirit level and check

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.320 
trust on a spirit level and check
especially<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> across<00:01:24.210> band<00:01:25.070> levelness

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
especially for the across band levelness

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.350 
especially for the across band levelness
you<00:01:27.330> may<00:01:27.479> wish<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.780> check<00:01:28.580> for<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.700> forward<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you may wish to check for the forward to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.999 
you may wish to check for the forward to
backward<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.110> not<00:01:31.320> critical<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.860> this

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
backward but that's not critical in this

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.940 
backward but that's not critical in this
case<00:01:32.330> so<00:01:33.330> check<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.990> you've<00:01:34.350> got<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.710> level

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
case so check that you've got a level

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
case so check that you've got a level
vehicle<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.670> put<00:01:35.910> it<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.180> nice<00:01:36.420> piece<00:01:36.690> of

vehicle so put it on a nice piece of

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.660 
vehicle so put it on a nice piece of
concrete<00:01:37.050> somewhere<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.369> then<00:01:40.520> check<00:01:41.520> for

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
concrete somewhere and then check for

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.890 
concrete somewhere and then check for
them

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.310 

first<00:01:47.590> thing<00:01:47.830> you<00:01:47.950> need<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.370> establish<00:01:49.320> after

first thing you need to establish after
you've<00:01:50.470> leveled<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.920> van<00:01:51.100> is<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.960> cab<00:01:53.200> UNK

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
you've leveled the van is the cab UNK

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.940 
you've leveled the van is the cab UNK
hangs<00:01:54.010> over<00:01:54.520> here<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.810> bunk<00:01:56.050> starts<00:01:56.620> here

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
hangs over here and the bunk starts here

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.670 
hangs over here and the bunk starts here
which<00:01:57.640> is<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.450> each<00:01:58.720> model<00:01:59.230> on<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.970> see<00:02:01.270> of

which is in each model on the see of

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.250 
which is in each model on the see of
your<00:02:02.680> headrest<00:02:03.190> it's<00:02:04.150> been<00:02:04.390> designed<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.990> go

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
your headrest it's been designed to go

your headrest it's been designed to go
to<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.740> seam<00:02:05.980> of<00:02:06.190> your<00:02:06.310> headrest<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:07.000> what

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
to the seam of your headrest so what

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.169 
to the seam of your headrest so what
you'll<00:02:07.900> notice<00:02:08.170> here<00:02:08.679> is<00:02:08.890> if<00:02:09.460> we<00:02:09.670> follow<00:02:09.880> that

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
you'll notice here is if we follow that

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.030 
you'll notice here is if we follow that
line<00:02:10.479> round<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.350> doesn't<00:02:11.650> have<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:11.830> be

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
line round and it doesn't have to be

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.120 
line round and it doesn't have to be
exact<00:02:12.430> because<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.910> hammock<00:02:13.330> forms<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.560> finds

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
exact because a hammock forms it finds

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.950 
exact because a hammock forms it finds
its<00:02:15.250> own<00:02:15.430> level<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:15.970> don't<00:02:16.180> worry<00:02:16.360> about<00:02:16.510> that

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
its own level so don't worry about that

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.030 
its own level so don't worry about that
it<00:02:17.500> has<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.920> be<00:02:18.040> roughly<00:02:18.550> on<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.900> level<00:02:20.170> that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
it has to be roughly on that level that

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.880 
it has to be roughly on that level that
you<00:02:21.190> put<00:02:21.400> your<00:02:23.400> hammock<00:02:24.400> pole<00:02:24.730> brackets<00:02:25.890> I've

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
you put your hammock pole brackets I've

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.490 
you put your hammock pole brackets I've
got<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.430> one<00:02:27.459> already<00:02:27.990> installed<00:02:28.990> for<00:02:29.320> you

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
got that one already installed for you

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.470 
got that one already installed for you
I'm<00:02:29.920> about<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.490> show<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.730> how<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.000> fix<00:02:31.330> that

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
I'm about to show you how to fix that

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.480 
I'm about to show you how to fix that
but<00:02:32.200> that's<00:02:32.380> where<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.740> need<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:33.070> take<00:02:33.280> your

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
but that's where you need to take your

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.760 
but that's where you need to take your
leveled<00:02:33.850> so<00:02:34.720> what<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.020> do<00:02:35.170> when<00:02:35.380> you've<00:02:35.590> got

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
leveled so what you do when you've got

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.060 
leveled so what you do when you've got
your<00:02:35.950> level<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.840> where<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.020> want<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.770> first

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
your level of where you want the first

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.300 
your level of where you want the first
bracket<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.700> go<00:02:39.750> which<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.930> as<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.650> said<00:02:41.890> at<00:02:42.100> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
bracket to go which is as I said at the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.970 
bracket to go which is as I said at the
same<00:02:42.520> height<00:02:42.850> as<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.120> seam<00:02:43.600> on<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.170> seat<00:02:44.440> of

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
same height as the seam on the seat of

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.490 
same height as the seam on the seat of
the<00:02:45.160> headrest<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.630> then<00:02:46.860> will<00:02:49.170> place<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
the headrest you then will place the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.910 
the headrest you then will place the
bracket<00:02:50.770> on<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.280> wall<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:52.709> behind<00:02:53.709> the

established<00:04:37.070> that<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.670> pole<00:04:37.910> is<00:04:37.940> level<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:39.170> on

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
established that the pole is level so on

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.180 
established that the pole is level so on
this<00:04:39.620> other<00:04:39.830> side
